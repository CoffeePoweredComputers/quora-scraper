            "answer_text": "Yes and Bangladesh is far more developed than West Bengal. First of all, Bangladesh (BD) is a sovereign country and the West Bengal (WB) is just a state of sovereign India. Recently, Bangladesh has become a Developing Country [1][2][3][4]like India leaving the Least Development Countries (LDC) category. Bangladesh\u2019s economy is the second largest[5][6] in the Subcontinent after India\u2019s economy with an export over $41 Billion every year.[7] The financial sector is the second largest in the sub-continent after India and classified as the Next Eleven Asian Economy.[8] \u201cBangladesh is undergoing a transformation from a low-income to a middle-income economy. The South Asian country continues to generate strong growth\u2014projected at around 7 % for 2018\u2014driven by consumer spending and investment\u201d - The IMF [9] \"But Bangladesh has come from behind like a meteor, it seems. What's significant is that Bangladesh now exports more ready-made garments than India and Pakistan combined.\" - Times of India[10] Surprisingly, Bangladesh's foreign reserve is 4 times larger, export is 2 times larger, GDP per capita is higher and GDP Nominal is $41 billion more than Pakistan.[11][12] [13]  Dhaka, Bangladesh. (Photo Credit: Lumenite's portfolio [14]) (1) Now, if you compare Bangladesh\u2019s economy with West Bengal\u2019s economy, then you will be surprised how far Bangladesh is ahead. Bangladesh to become the 3rd fastest growing economy in the world in 2019. [15][16][17][18] Bangladesh\u2019s GDP (Nominal) in 2019: $314.656 billion[19]Pakistan\u2019s GDP in 2019: $273 billion (lower than Bangladesh [20])1 Bangladeshi Taka = 1.77 Pakistani RupeeWest Bengal\u2019s GDP (Nominal) in 2019: $190 billion [21](2) Now, if we compare the PPP between the two regions, then you will be surprised. Bangladesh\u2019s Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): $831.75 billion[22] (Almost double of the WB)West Bengal\u2019s Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): $478.16 billion(3) Comparing the GDP per capita between the two regions reflects the economic development took place in these two regions. Bangladesh\u2019s GDP Per Capita in 2019: $1,888 (INR 132,710)[23] (BD has 170 million people)Pakistan\u2019s GDP Per Capita in 2019: $1,641 (lower than Bangladesh)West Bengal\u2019s GDP Per Capita in 2019: $1600 (INR 104751)[24] (WB has 90 million people)(4) If we compare the foreign exports between these two regions, then you will be surprised how much importance Bangladesh gets from other countries. Bangladesh\u2019s Foreign Export in 2018: $41 billion [25]Foreign Export Partners:European Union: 58.2%United States: 16.3%Japan: 3.1%Canada: 3.0%India: 2.4%Australia: 1.9%China: 1.9%Southeast Asia: 1.6%Others: 11.6%Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Export in 2018: $ 24.8 billion (almost half of Bangladesh\u2019s foreign export)West Bengal\u2019s Foreign Export in 2019: Not known data.India\u2019s foreign export was $303.5 billion [26] in 2018 and it has 29 states that equates $10.49 billion per state. It is difficult to conclude how much West Bengal contributes to India\u2019s foreign export, but a report from Exim Bank India stated it was around $9 billion, which meets the threshold of $10.49 billion per state export profusely. The Pharmaceutical and Ship Building sectors are the rising industrial sectors behind Garment sector in Bangladesh. Shipbuilding yards in Bangladesh are now exporting small and medium-sized ships for the highly competitive European market\" - The BBC[27] The Shipbuilding Industry is the next Garment Industry like industrial sector of Bangladesh delivering comparable products to the European countries,.[28] (5) Let\u2019s look at the unemployment rate between the two regions. Bangladesh\u2019s Unemployment Rate: 4.2% [29]West Bengal\u2019s Unemployment rate: 10.9% [30][31]There are more than 4,500 garment factories across Bangladesh and a typical Garment Worker in Bangladesh gets 8,000 Taka (INR 6,700) per month.[32] A Government Fourth Class (deemed as the lowest class such as Cleaner, Peon, Messenger, etc) employee gets a basic 8,250 Taka (INR 6900) per month.[33] In addition, government employees get a housing allowance, medical allowance, religious festivals bonuses, etc.  Garment Workers in a Factory, Bangladesh. (Photo Credit: RMG[34] ) \u201cBangladesh\u2019s large and vibrant middle-class with a yearly household income from $4,000 to over $12,000 is making all differences to its economic growth\u201d [35] The people of WB assume BD people have immigrated to WB for jobs but its the other way round where 500,000 Indians are working in Bangladesh\u2019s industries. [36]But there are BD people who lived in the border area moved to WB, but the number is far fetched than the actual number. In 2012, Bangladesh was the fifth among the nations sending the highest remittances to India. The Indian workers sent $3.7 billion to India from Bangladesh.[37] \u201cBased on the international poverty line of $1.90 per person per day, Bangladesh reduced poverty from 44.2 % in 1991 to 14.8% in 2016/17\u201d - The World Bank [38] The poverty has come down to 7.4% in 2019. [39] If you visit the USA (185,622 Bangladeshi people [40]), AUSTRALIA (53,000 Bangladeshi people [41]), Canada (100,000 Bangladeshi people[42]), UK (more than 500,000 Bangladeshi people [43]) and Middle Eastern countries (2.82 million Bangladeshi People), you will find way more Bangladeshi students (self-funded) studying in the developed countries than WB students where Bangladeshis students are paying an average of $15,000 per year for tuition fees. It is a trend among middle-class and upper-middle-class Bangladeshi families to send their children abroad to get a higher education, and believed to be a social status case. \u201cBangladesh is the second biggest contributor of military and police to the UN peacekeeping mission.\u201d - The United Nations [44] (6) Let\u2019s break down the economic sectors between the two regions. Bangladesh\u2019s Economic Sectors: Agriculture (14.23%) Industry (33.66%) Services (52.11%).Bangladesh reduced the dependency on Agriculture and increased the dependency on Industrial sector.West Bengal\u2019s Economic Sectors: Agriculture( 24%) Industry (22%) Services (54%)WB\u2019s industrial sector (22%) is 2/3rd of Bangladesh\u2019s industrial sector (33.66%). Also, the 1/4th of the economy relies on Agricultural sector (24%).WB\u2019s Service sector is slightly bigger than Bangladesh\u2019s service sector. But Bangladesh will surpass in 3\u20135 years considering the growth rate.(7) Let\u2019s have a look at the Foreign Reserve of the two regions. Bangladesh\u2019s Foreign Reserve: $33 Billion (2019)West Bengal\u2019s Foreign Reserve: $0.00 Billion (a State of India)India\u2019s foreign reserve is $420 Billion,[45] that is 12 times larger than Bangladesh\u2019s foreign reserve. But India has 29 states that equate $14.5 billion per state. Assuming if West Bengal was allowed to reserve, then it would have reserved \u00a314.5 Billion (less than half of Bangladesh\u2019s foreign reserve). (8) Now, let's compare the transport networks between the two regions. Bangladesh\u2019s Total Road Length: 3,74,118.739 Km[46]National Highway = 3,790.861 kmRegional Highway = 4,206.121 kmDistrict Road = 13,121.757 kmRural Road: 3,53,000[47] KmWest Bengal's Total Road Length: 92,223 Km[48]National Highway:\t2,578 kmState Highway:\t2,393 kmExpressway: 121 kmDistrict and Rural road: 87,052 kmIt is noticeable the WB\u2019s road length is nearly one-fourth of Bangladesh\u2019s road length and this is where Bangladesh has upper-hand when it comes to moving goods from one end to another end of the country. Apparently, You can reach the capital city Dhaka from any district of Bangladesh within 6\u20138 hours by road driving 400 km \u2013 600 km. All the Sub-districts are well connected to their respective Districts by road and all the villages are more or less connected to their respective Sub-districts.[49][50] Also, there are only 5\u20136 small ferries operating in whole Bangladesh and the rest of the ferries were abolished because Bangladesh built long Bridges [51][52]over medium to large rivers such Bangabandhu Bridge (5 Km long, Cost: $1 billion in 1998)[53], Padma Bridge (7 Km long, Cost: $3.8 billion in 2019)[54], etc .  Bangabandhu (Yamuna) Bridge, 5 km long, Bangladesh (Photo Credit: Lamia Zaman[55] ) (9) Let\u2019s have a look at the electricity coverage between the two regions. Bangladesh: 95% Coverage (as of 2018)West Bengal: Not Known DataBangladesh has installed capacity of 1.625 gigawatts (GW) and the total installed capacity is 2.0 GW (combining solar power). The energy sector of Bangladesh is booming and recently, Bangladesh started the construction of the 2.4 GW Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant spending $12.65 billion, which is expected to go into operation in 2023.[56] Bangladesh will require an estimated 3.4 GW of power by 2030 to sustain its current economic growth of over 7%.[57] Assuming the Nuclear Power Plant starts producing electricity by 2023, then Bangladesh will have 4.2 gigawatts along with current installed capacity that is more than its requirement to sustain the current economic growth of 7%. Bangladesh has the world's most successful project to use solar power to provide electricity in rural areas initiated with the help of the World Bank. [58] (10) Let\u2019s compare the Telecommunication sector between the two regions. Bangladesh\u2019s Mobile Network Coverage: 99% Covered156.5 million subscribers as of 2019West Bengal's Mobile Network Coverage: Not Kown Data.(11) Comparison of Broadcasting Media between two regions. Bangladesh TV Channels: 43 ChannelsBangladeshi TV Channels in the UK: 3Bangladeshi TV Channels in Canada: 1BBC Bangla: Focuses heavily on Bangladesh.Bangladeshi Radio Stations: 46 and 5 OnlineWest Bengal TV Channels: 26 ChannelsBengali TV Channels in the UK: 0Bengali Tv Channels in Canada: 0(12) In terms of the health sector, Bangladesh is ahead of India as a country.[59] Bangladesh\u2019s Health Sector: 16,329 (2015)ICDDR, B: Global Research HQ for Cholera and Diarrhoea Diseases.Sub-district (Sub-divisional) Hospital: 413Secondary & Tertiary Hospital: 117Infectious Disease Control Centres: 5District Hospital: 64 (deemed as General Hospital)Govt. Medical College Hospital: 36 [60]Military Funded Medical College Hospital: 6Private Medical College Hospital: 61Chest Hospital: 12Community Clinics: 10,723Other Hospitals (NGO/Private/Funded): 5,316Number of Nurses: 13,483Number of Physicians: 11,300Medical Technologists: 4,658Medical Assistants: 3,694To create a better health system and jobs, Bangladesh created more districts than West Bengal resulting in 64 General Hospitals and 64 District HQs.  Newborn baby, (Photo Credit: Asian Development Bank [61][62]) West Bengal Health Sector: 13,925Medical College Hospital: 13District Hospital: 15Sub-Divisional Hospital: 45State General Hospital: 33Other Hospital: 33Rural Hospital: 269Block Primary Health Centre: 79Primary Health Centre: 909Sub-centre: 10,356Others: 2,170Now, there is an illusion among West Bengal people that the health sector is inferior to India, hence they travel to WB. But that is just 2%\u20133% wealthy middle-class people who travel to India for treatment and they feel they went to a foreign country to get the treatment similar to a subset of the population who travel to Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong for treatments. So, the health sector is far more developed than one assumes and definitely better than WB as well as India. Bangladesh produces 97% of its pharmaceutical needs resulting in only 3% import from foreign countries. The Indian State of West Bengal relies on the Central Government for its funding [63]but Bangladesh does not rely on any funding body or does not require approvals. Whenever a comparison takes place in Bangladesh either in Government or in the Media, then it is always with India and Pakistan, especially with Pakistan considering the bitter history it had with Pakistan. The West Bengal people should visit Bangladesh and they will definitely enjoy their stay in Bangladesh. Hope that helps.

            "answer_text": "No Bangladesh is not more developed than West Bengal. West Bengal is doing far better than Bangladesh. Its more developed than BD. If you want anecdotal evidence see from where people are migrating. There is huge migration from BD to WB . People migrate from poor region to rich not the other way. Huge number of Bangladeshi patients flock to Kolkata for medical treatment and even for simple testings which shows Medical sector is more developed in WB than in BD.(Medical tourism, a swelling business for hospitals ) There is good number of BD students in WB universities specially in Calcutta, Jadavpur , Visva bharati etc but opposite flow of student in not there. There are three university in West Bengal in Times world ranking IIT-KGP, CU, JU against one of Bangladesh (Dhaka univeristy) World University Rankings If you want statistics Per capita income of BD is $ 3190 ppp against $5515 of West Bengal. The gap would be only increasing in future as BD growth rate is approx 6% but WB growth rate is in double digit. (List of Indian states and union territories by GDP per capita - Wikipedia) Report for Selected Countries and Subjects If you check HDI India 2014 is 0.609 and Bangladesh is 0.57. West Bengal HDI was 0.604 which is higher than 0.57 of Bangladesh (Why Kerala is like Maldives and Uttar Pradesh, Pakistan) Yes there are areas where Bangladesh is doing better than West Bengal specially in Social indices like Child and mother mortality rates etc but overall West Bengal is more developed than Bangladesh.
