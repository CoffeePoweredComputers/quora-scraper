            "answer_text": "I find that metaphors can be helpful, for both writer and reader. If you just write a sex scene, it can be incredibly dull, even tedious, for the reader. Some writers (even best selling novelists) make the mistake of writing it like a medical textbook description of sex, and that\u2019s not doing anyone any good. Readers don\u2019t need you to give a play-by-play of the whole thing. In the case of sex scenes, less is actually more. At the other end of the spectrum are the super wild and crazy antics in bed between otherwise normal people (especially when it\u2019s their first time as a couple), and the result makes it seem like they were possessed by aliens who were taking those human meat bags for a joyride, then leaving once the act was done. Sexual tension is far more interesting and compelling than actual sex scenes. In many cases, the presence of a sex scene isn\u2019t even necessary. It\u2019s perfectly fine to just write the lead up to the big game, and then leave the rest to the reader\u2019s imagination. Because it\u2019s probable that what the reader is imagining that\u2019s going on is a lot better than what the writer could have written. I would encourage you to read some romance novels. You will find mostly awful sex scenes, and those are the ones you will learn the most from. Because learning what not to do is far more helpful in this area of writing than any other. And that makes the case for why you should consider not writing a sex scene at all. If it\u2019s highly important to the story, you should still question whether or not you need to put it in there. If you aren\u2019t sure, give it a shot and move on. Then when the novel is done, you can revisit the scene, and whether or not it\u2019s necessary, or if you can cut some of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Get inside the head and under the skin of one of the characters in the scene. You are trying to load up on the emotional and sensory elements, not on the choreography. You are not a camcorder, telling the reader what character A did to character B, and in what order. You ARE character A or character B, and you let the reader experience the sex as you do. It\u2019s not about the size of the bits, or where they go, it\u2019s about how it all feels, smells, sounds, and what it means to the character. A sex scene is where the characters are naked, in all senses. They take their social mask off with their clothes, and you get to see them as they really are. Use that to develop their character and advance the plot. And I\u2019ve personally found that it\u2019s a good idea to tell yourself that you are never going to show this scene to anyone, you are writing it for yourself, so you can be as honest as necessary.
