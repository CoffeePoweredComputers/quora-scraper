            "answer_text": "The first few books re-explain the basics of the world in the early chapters, but by the end of the series, Harry Potter was such a phenomenon that Rowling was able to assume that everyone remembered who Voldemort was and what \"Muggle\" meant, so she stopped doing that. However, you won't appreciate the books nearly as much without having read the previous ones. Potter books get a lot of payoff from things set up in previous books; for instance, a surprising character death in one of the later books gains much of its power from that character's emotional meaning several books before. (I'm being vague here to try to avoid spoiling.) And on a smaller scale, there are subtle connections between the books that you'll miss, like an object mentioned in a throwaway joke in book 2 becoming a major plot point in book 6. Book 7 in particular is like this\u2014about 75% of it is payoff for things set up in the previous books. If you don't want to commit to reading the whole series, though, you can stop at any time. Each book does have a distinctive ending, although they start getting less \"happily ever after\" from book 3 onward. Book 1 in particular is clearly written to be a standalone story, because Rowling didn't know if it would be popular enough to justify a sequel. So I would suggest you start at the beginning and read until you don't want to anymore. (Keep in mind, though, that the early books are more simplistic and child-oriented; the deeper and more interesting themes don't really start to appear until book 3.) You can stop before the end if you want to, but chances are you won't. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly. That is, if you can resist the temptation of reading the others once you've read one. Of course, I would highly recommend that you start with book 1. It's true that you could read each book without having read all the previous books, but... no, not really. You'd miss too many crucial references to past events. The story is quite carefully built, from one year on to the next. If you only read one Harry Potter book, it should definitely be book 1. The story matures with the characters. As the characters grow up, the story becomes more and more serious, dramatic, and even macabre. But I'm confident that if you should happen to hate book 1, you wouldn't like the others any better. ",
