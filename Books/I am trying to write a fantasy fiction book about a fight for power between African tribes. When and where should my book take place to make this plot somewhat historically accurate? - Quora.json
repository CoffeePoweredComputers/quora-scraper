            "answer_text": " Here is a map of pre-colonial Africa States. Most of them were founded by charismatic heroes whose lives and deeds have shaped the history of their states. African tribes emerged on the one hand from the migration and expansion of these populations (tribes are often named according to their places of settlement) and on the other hand from the natural fragmentation or subdivision of the family tree of their founding hero. African societies are mostly family based and people therefore belong to the same tribe or clan because they share a common ancestor who often happened to be related to or a descendant of the founding hero. African tribal struggles are thus large scale familial disputes fuelled by past and sometimes long forgotten matters of honor, jaleousy, misunderstandings or simply plain disagreements. A deeper understanding of the origins of these struggles/disputes and their relevance from a socio-cultural perspective would greatly help you better shape more authentic and captivating stories. Here are a few notable examples of African states: Northern Africa: a) Carthaginian Empire with its hero Hannibal and his military campaigns against the Roman Empire b) The Egyptian Kingdoms and their cultural wealth spanning thousands of years and countless dynastical generations Western Africa: c) The Mali (Mandinka) Empire and his founder, military strategist and warrior prince, Sundiata Keita Eastern Africa: d) The Kingdom of Aksum (Ethiopia), the only Africa state to have never been colonized by western powers and which has consistently been ruled up until recent times by an single unbroken dynasty. Central Africa: e) The Luba Empire, the largest and most organized pre-colonial state of central Africa that gave birth to the other 2 major states of the region which are: f) The Kongo Kingdom, one of the rare matriarcal african societies ruled by Luba princesses imposed upon defeated local chiefs by conquering luba princes g)The Lunda Empire, founded by the same founding hero of the Luba Empire during a period of exil. Southern Africa: h) The Empire of Great Zimbabwe i) The Zulu Kingdom forged by the fearless Shaka Zulu who forcibly united all local tribes into a fully fledge militarized state that was only defeated by the superior technology of the colonial powers present at the time. There is much to choose from and I would advise you to start your stor(ies) with the genesis of the African states and then develop with tales outlining the reasons and circumstances of their generational conflicts so that the current generations of Africans may learn from them and not repeat the mistakes of the past as they strive toward shaping a stronger panafrican unity! I hope this helps. Best of luck and God bless you! Keita ",

            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t already know a lot of African history, why are you using Africa as your setting? If it\u2019s fantasy, you have the option of inventing your own society and history, instead of making a mess of it (or spending years doing research so as not to make a mess of it). I would strongly recommend not trying to use a historical setting you aren\u2019t already familiar with. ",
