            "answer_text": "Only thing constant is death and taxes!  One of my friend\u2019s mom is a trainer for the trainers at H&R Block. She encouraged us girls to go through the tax program. I could not see myself sitting in a tax class, especially when the weather is awesome. We choose dance. As you can see, the decision couldn\u2019t have been any easier for us! The program is both training for yourself and also an opportunity do be recruit from the class for reasons employment. H & R block is a pretty reliable source and should be on one of your top few resources if you choose to.Higher them all is Uncle Sam, the IRS site itself. Start reading on the site and navigate one topic at a time.Take classes with the Demi God at a University or even at a community college.You have to teach yourself other reliable sources besides the IRS on google who can break things down for you.One of the four parts that the Certified Public Accountant \u201cto be\u201d has to pass is tax and is called \u201cRegulation (Reg)\u201d. You can just buy the home course, especially now that there are no sit in training classes and get to it in the order of material listed. There are businesses that offer prep classes. Since you are not sitting for the exam, any and all of them should serve your needs. (If you Google \u201ctop\u201d or best CPA exam prep courses\u201d, you should get a decent list.And when you learn a little and also want to build a little confidence, consider \u201cVITA\u201d to help people prepare easy 1040s. Volunteer, especially on campus. It is hard to screw it up. Your work is double checked, anyways. Believe it or not, some people still prefer long hand. It might just be worth to have that experience too. Don\u2019t forget to download the calculator app ;)When someone says with a happy smiley face that they have a big refund coming. I cringe. I hope you will too.All in all, always know that the IRS codes and interpretation are constantly evolving. Thus makes all materials as interpretation potentially dated. Only thing constant is death and taxes. But you knew that, eh. Hope it helps. Stay safe. N happy 4th. Photo Credit; Google (no specific author was published.) ",

            "answer_text": "I do not have a finance and commerce background. All the things I have learnt about income tax, finance or personal investment is through searching on Google. The moment you get a question in your mind search it.Do not delay or postpone it.Check atleast 3 sites for the answer. Eventually, you'll learn which sites or blog posts are trustworthy.If you are talking especially about income tax then start filing your income tax. Search the queries as you come across. Then file ITR for others. Similarly, Search the queries as you come across. Also, in case you have a friend who is a CA then you can cross check the information. I file my own ITR since I started earning. So that's been like three years. Also, this year I have filed ITR for 6 more ppl. And I have learnt great deal of things when I was filing for others. Also, I and 2 of them have also got their Refund processed. This definitely encourages and it feels very good ! Good luck ! ",
