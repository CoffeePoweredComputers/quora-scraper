            "answer_text": "No. At least, not yet. Pujols\u2019 first eight years are very comparable to Mike Trout\u2019s. Trout has been better than Mookie. Mookie isn\u2019t far behind, but I think he is behind. He may well are better than Pujols and have an argument at some point of having a better career than Pujols, but that\u2019s far from a sure thing. ",
