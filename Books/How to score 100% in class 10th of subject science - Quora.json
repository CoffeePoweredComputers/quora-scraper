            "answer_text": "First of all, scoring 100/100 in any subject is not a cake walk. So, you have to work very hard for that. Here are some tips from my side. There are 3 main things you have to keep in mind. A) Making the right study plan. Start by making a right schedule for study. Take a look at the entire syllabus. Divide it into small portions into subtopics for each day. Suppose you have 60 days and you have 15 chapters to cover; make a plan such that you cover every chapter within 3 days. Here you can cover the syllabus in 45 days. The rest of days must be used for revision.Set your daily targets. Make a time table in such a way. Otherwise you can mark the topics on a calender and study accordingly. Make sure to study that day till you complete the target topics.Do not procrastinate.B) How to study? First, start by reading the NCERT Textbook thoroughly. Read everything written in the textbook.Make proper notes. Note down all important laws, formulas and explanations. Refer the notes of your teacher as well.Clear all your doubts on time without any hesitation. I recommend you to make a separate notebook for doubts. Write the question and answer of your doubts in that book so that when you get the same doubt, you can refer it.Practice every question from NCERT exercises. Don\u2019t forget to practice from sample question papers and past year papers.You can also refer from books like S. Chand physics, S. Chand chemistry and S. Chand biology. Everything is clearly explained in that.Bonus tip: Always remember that when you are studying, sit on a chair and study. Don\u2019t lie down on a bed while studying.Don\u2019t take frequent and long breaks in between. Take at most 3 breaks with max. 15 mins.Don\u2019t get addicted to electronic gadgets or social media. Take care of your health.C) Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s in examinations. No matter how hard you study. You have to give examinations properly for good result. Do not get panic before or during the examinations. Panic can ruin your paper.Take proper care of your health in exam season.Reach examination hall on time. Keep yourself away from any malpractices. Abide by the examination guidelines always. Do not make any silly mistakes while filling in your details.Write exam in a neat legible handwriting. Even if your answer is right, bad handwriting makes difficult to score better. Write everything in a presentable manner.Try to avoid last minute hurry-burry studies. You will get confused.Always answer to the point. Don\u2019t beat around the bush. Write important points first. If the question is for more marks you can include other points. Maintain proper word limit.Always draw diagrams and do labelling with pencil.Do not make calculation mistakes.Improve your writing speed so that you can have extra time.In numericals, state the formulas, given data with proper steps.Pray and go for exams so that everything goes well.You better know the other things as this is not your first time of giving exams. If you have got the patience and concentration to read the entire answer (it\u2019s very lengthy); and you are also ready to follow it, I believe you can crack your exams with flying colours with hardwork. 100/100 is not always a reality so be prepared for everything. Do your best, God will do the rest. PS: I did not score 100/100 in my class 10 science. I scored 97/100 ( As per the information given by my school) ",

            "answer_text": "1.(COMPLETE NCERT+LAST YEARS SAMPLE) 2. Regular notes and Continuos WRITING practise. In my 10th boards,i scored 95/100 in sci. (5 marks lost in 1 question(carrying 5mark),in physics ) just due to nervousness while solving.AND I USED NO REFERENCE BOOK even after having them with me.I got no time to touch even as i was so busy with ncerts concepts throught the year. So,i was not on quora from where i could take someones\u2019s guidance.And even there was no one from whom i could get such answers.So i worked hard with whatever i knew although little.And thanks to god that i believed in the books made for us by cbse (NCERT\u2019s). So, scoring 100/100 depends on how you have utilised your NCERT book.Throughout the year, i read ncerts\u2026multiple times every chapter,every line.I read only ncerts, made notes, continuous writing practice. I know that ncerts doesn\u2019t have to the point answers,questions. And that\u2019s why you have to read it so carefully.You must practise all the concepts of ncert,all the questions of ncert.Read a line and then collect so many relatable points on it.Write,highlight your book. Make flow charts. And byheart complete ncert before 1\u20132 months of exams and then go for last 10\u201315 years sample papers,latest sample by cbse in those last months.Practise it by having set a goal in how much time you\u2019re going to complete it.And preserve last 1 month for again ncert revision,notes of your own(short notes,formula list, Flow charts). In biology i scored full.For this i practised full ncert until i byhearted even the diagrams and page numbers. And the most helpful thing was- My teacher. He is an amazing ,highly experienced teacher. I took running notes regularly in the class.Then at home i would read the particular topic from book. And made a proper understanding of every little thing. In physics, i did complete ncert. I don\u2019t know the reason why i never understood a single thing taught by my teacher.So i did it all by my own. In chemistry, we got a new teacher whose even language was undefined to me.So,i did all by won with my ncerts. ",
