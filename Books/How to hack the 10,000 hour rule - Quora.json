            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by \u201chack\u201d. Since the 10,000 hour rule is all about becoming the expert in a certain field, there are a few ways: Find a field without many experts in it the first place. Take the example of Sharon Terry, for example. Her children were diagnosed with a rare genetic disease which reduces the elasticity in tissues. Unfortunately, since the disease did not affect many people, not much research was available. So, after studying the disease for about a year, she became \u201cthe leading expert\u201d on the disease, at least according to her.[1] Of course, the major drawback is that smaller fields tend to be very specialized, niche fields, and so you won\u2019t get household recognition with this tactic.Start early. This means start in a field when it is just emerging, and start early in life. Starting early in a field means that, when other people start to jump on to the bandwagon, you already have a couple years of a head start on them, meaning that others will look to you for guidance. Starting early in life allows you to focus only on the field, without worrying about family, children, income, the future, &c. It also means that you have a longer time to perfect your craft. Again, the main problem with this is that emerging fields often crash, and many of us are not young.Grind. According to Gladwell, the best-known proponent of this rule, this is the only surefire way to become an \u201cexpert\u201d, or at least become extremely proficient. The drawback of this method is keeping up the 10,000 hours, i.e. discipline and endurance. Some ways to do so are to find a field that keeps you engaged and feels fun, like Bill Gates and programming; or to force yourself to innovate and be creative, like the Beatles\u2019 Hamburg performances.Footnotes[1] Sharon Terry: When Siblings Get A Rare Diagnosis, Can Their Parents Find the Cure?",

            "answer_text": "Actually, Gladwell's findings that 10000 hours is what it takes to master a skill has been debunked. There's nothing particularly special about this number, from what I've read it was chosen more symbolically to represent 'a really long time.' Also, it sounded catchy. What's far more important than focusing on the number of hours, is focusing on how those hours are spent. This is a concept called deliberate practice. It revolves around: Constantly pushing yourself outside your comfort areaFollowing professionally designed training strategiesUsing feedback to identify weaknesses and work on themDon't spend half your time surfing Quora (I added this one)Personally, I think it's also important to note that you don't acquire a skill once you've completed the necessary hours of practice. You acquire it gradually over this time. For instance, if you are learning a language, you can use it before you totally master it. Celebrating benchmarks between novice and expert (such as learning to order coffee; in the case of a language) will help to keep you focused and motivated! ",
