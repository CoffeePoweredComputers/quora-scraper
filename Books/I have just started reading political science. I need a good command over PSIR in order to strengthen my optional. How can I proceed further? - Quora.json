            "answer_text": "I really feel that there\u2019s so much to read in political science, you cant handle it without a coaching unless you\u2019ve done your graduation in it. But I warn you, this answer might be a little biased since I\u2019m a pol sci graduate myself. So I joined Shubhra Ranjan Ma\u2019am\u2019s coaching classes at Vajiram. I really dont know if it\u2019s worth the 44k (read it\u2019s not). They say she\u2019s the only one who can teach it right. But her notes were very useful when I gave my JNU entrance. I know a couple friends who recorded all the lectures. I\u2019d recommend read the basic books- Bipan Chandra, Guha etc and religiously read the newspaper. You\u2019ll soon notice you\u2019ll start connecting theories and actual things that happen in real life. Now keep in mind- the syllabus is vast. You HAVE to make a plan and stick to it. It would be pretty tough to make your own notes-how much time do you have? Since it\u2019s so vast- you have to just fall in love with the subject and be loyal to it. You have to be interested. When reading the philosopher my trick is to be the philosopher and think like him in his times. Justify everything the philosopher says to yourself as absurd as it may seem then (like Plato\u2019s communism of wives.). Dont question him till you\u2019re done understanding the entire idea or concept you\u2019ve picked up- the philosopher is god for that time being. Then once you\u2019re done- then the criticisms are pretty obvious. Everyone loves IR. It\u2019s the most popular one. But remember you have to relate the theories with the real life happenings to understand the dynamics of the theory. Plus it helps you with your pres too as far as I think (could be wrong). Polity for pre, laxmikant is best. But Ma\u2019am said that it gets the spirit of the constitution wrong (like calling the Governor agent of the PM/President sometimes). So I\u2019d be careful about that. Btw, why worried about optional abhi. What\u2019s up with your Pre prepz? ",
