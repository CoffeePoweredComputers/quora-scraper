            "answer_text": "I don't think so and I don\u2019t personally know anyone who is fond of her or supports her role. You can watch videos for yourself of her shoving people out of the way, smacking the hands of those who try to help her, refusing gifts during official visits, smacking Harry's hand to remind him to hold her hand, scratching her crotch in public, etc. The woman didn't have a single friend to help her with her wedding dress (or even at her wedding??) and had to have the designer help her. She blacklisted her own father who raised her when her flighty mother took off. She uses people and discards them when it's over. She has been caught in about a million lies. She blatantly disrespects the Queen's wishes for propriety of the family's dress code and general behavior. (S)he has a wide smile but it's pretty clear she's not what a human being would call \u201cnice.\u201d Edit: So many hurt butts in this comment section. I don't mind if the trolls reveal themselves. Have a lovely day, everyone! :) Edit #2: For those asking for links and videos, you can find them the same way I did, via YouTube. Type in \u201cMeghan Markle ______\u201d and for the blank, pick any derogatory adjective you desire. If I wanted my favorite videos to be reported and deleted, I'd give direct links. Peace. Edit #3 I get upvotes on this answer daily. I assume the downvotes keep the numbers close to the same. I do not block and report comments, however shitty they may be, because I find comment policing both immature and stifling of free speech. If someone wants to call me crazy, go right ahead. I'm not concerned with your opinion. If you have an opinion, write an answer to the question and move on. Free speech, in the US, gives us the right to voice our distaste of any political figure without fear of being executed or imprisoned. I will continue to exercise this right, and maintain my opinion. I can say what I wish to say, and if you don't like it, that's perfectly fine with me. I'm not here to powder your behind. Those who disagree with my opinion, I certainly don't seek out your answers and argue with you about why your opinion is \u201cincorrect.\u201d What is this, Facebook? Do we all understand what an opinion is? Subjective vs objective? The real question here is why some of you are so heavily invested in defending her. That is WEIRD. What is your motivation? Mine is to uphold freedom of speech. Like one brilliant commenter noted, we are able to act as our own attorney. I've done this. I'll continue to. Much like a tabloid, I cannot be sued if what I say is the truth. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Learn the law, folks, or your rights will be taken from you. MEGHAN'S NOT NICE BY ANY STRETCH OF THE DEFINITION. THAT IS MY OPINION. DEAL WITH IT. Again, PEACE. Peace even if I don't like Meghan and you do. Peace even if some of you wish to argue about why my opinion hurts your butt (Or wherever the internet's words hurt you). Peace even if you have some sort of freakish attachment to this stranger, peace even if you are blinded, peace if I'm somehow \u201cwrong\u201d and you're somehow \u201cright.\u201d Peace if there are D-listers you don't care for. Peace if you weren't around for the Fergie fiasco, for Andrew being outed as a pedophile on the Johnny Carson show in the 70\u2019s, if you don't understand protocol as it has stood for centuries, or the way the RF operates. Peace if you haven't deleted your Facebook account yet. But most importantly, I wish you PEACE for having a problem with an internet stranger's opinion. Welcome to the internet! My opinion and my answer stay, and as long as Quora doesn't have a problem with it, you should grow up and get over it too. PEEEAAAACE. ",
