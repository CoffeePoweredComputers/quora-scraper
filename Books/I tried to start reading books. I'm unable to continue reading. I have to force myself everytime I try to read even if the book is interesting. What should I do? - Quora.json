            "answer_text": "I would suggest that the book is not really interesting to you, despite what you say. If it were, I would think the desire to see where the story goes would overcome whatever discomfort you have with reading. My wife reads very rarely. I would not consider her a reader. It\u2019s just not her thing. However, there have a been a few books where she literally could not put it down. Again, reading is *really* not her thing. My point? She was interested enough in the story to push through her dislike of reading. This happens few and far in between with her, but it does happen. Perhaps as it might be with you. Are you sure you are really interested in what you reading? I suggest you give this some serious introspection. If it still isn\u2019t working for you, then put the book down and pick up another one. At some point, you will stumble across a story you literally will not be able to put down. I suspect it just won\u2019t happen very often for you, like my wife. And, at the end of the day, not everyone has to be a reader. It\u2019s possible reading just isn\u2019t your thing and that\u2019s okay. If you are determined to make it your thing (I personally find it very satisfying) you just might have to work at it some. ",

            "answer_text": "Do not try to read too much at once. Start small and read a couple of pages at a time every day. Make it a routine you must do. If you keep reading it and it is interesting then it is worth it. Over time it will be easier to read. When you have finished it, you will feel pride in doing so. I know I do. Then you will have information that only people who have read the book have. No one can take that away from you. Then use that information. Give it a book review on goodreads or some other website. Use all your willpower and do not give up. If reading is not you thing and you accepted that, try audiobooks. Good luck and maybe one day I will find your reccomendation of a book and then want to read it like you! For me I started with comics and graphic novels. Then I had to read novels and non-fiction. Hope this helped! ",
