            "answer_text": "I know this is an old question. I saw it on my feed, and after reading all of the answers given, I felt I had something to add. First, and foremost, it depends on what you define as \u201cdata science.\u201d There are places I doubt R will ever lose ground, and that is with those who do \u201cdata science\u201d from a strictly statistical analysis point of view - which, while not considered mainstream as the definition, is at least a huge part of what we call data science today. In all three of my degrees (BSc, MMath, and PhD in statistics) R has been the tool of choice by professors and students. That includes the students who went on to be professors. Like begets like and all of that. As a matter of fact, R was my personal favourite for a while, and I had a much larger programming background as well as relevant CS courses than most of my peers. Compared to my peers specifically in the PhD program while I was there - more than all, by a large margin. There are, of course, some problems with R that Python mostly skirts or doesn\u2019t have even remotely. First, R is not, technically, a programming language: it is an environment equipped with a programming language. To be fair, it was designed to be that way, because it was designed and written by statisticians for statisticians well before the term data science was ever used. I\u2019m not saying that these were statisticians who were poor programmers, but they were statisticians first. I have known a couple of members of the R Core Development team (Duncan Murdoch and I had the occasional chat while I was at Western, and although I never had him teach me a class or TAed for him, I followed his work), and while I have a great deal of respect for all of them, again, statistician first, programmer second. If it weren\u2019t for RStudio and Hadley Wickham, \u201cregular\u201d R wouldn\u2019t be where it is now. And if it weren\u2019t for Revolution Analytics (now Microsoft R), you would still be forced to deal with R as a memory hog. The thing is, this isn\u2019t really anyone\u2019s fault: when R was developed, there were no real data sets considered even close to the size we have now. I doubt anyone conceived such a situation was possible. And memory management is really, really, hard to change on a system like R without breaking a lot of things, which is why Revolution (and now presumably Microsoft) could charge a mint for its product. Python, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t originally meant for data science. It is very good at certain specific things. It\u2019s the ultimate glue language, and its idioms are enough like R\u2019s that I felt comfortable switching. Adding easier C integration than R has and Cython (and eventually Numba\u2026 oh my) make it blazing fast for custom algorithms. And, lest we forget, Numpy, Scipy and scikit-learn for everything non-custom (although you can do a lot of custom data science algorithms by tweaking and/or extending things.) I don\u2019t really know the history of Python nearly as well as the history of R, so I don\u2019t know what decisions made all of the (mostly written in C) code that made all of this data science magic happen. It was there when I started with Python, and again, the similarities to R made me comfortable switching. (Note that I had been programming in various other languages for a long time previous.) But the similarity made sense in terms of analyses. R has a huge number of packages. More than I hope Python will ever have, because there\u2019s repetition, poor quality, and wildly different syntax in a lot of them. If it weren\u2019t for Hadley, RStudio, and lots of years of using R, I wouldn\u2019t be using R at all these days. As it is, I use it for custom things I need to bang out if I know there\u2019s something R has a package I trust for. There\u2019s really no need to choose one over the other if you can use both. Especially as you can call R from Python (but heck, you can call practically any other language from Python). If I were just starting out now, and I had to choose one\u2026 it would still be tough. Especially since I have such a long history with R already. But I probably would choose Python\u2026 eventually. But why make a choice if you don\u2019t have to? ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it all depends on the switching cost, and this is probably not just limited to R and/or Python: 1. Are there sufficient use cases where you will be more efficient or productive when switching to a new tool? If the use cases that you have encountered are mostly taken care by your existing tool, then the cost of learning a new language, syntax, and its philosophy might not be worth it. However, if there are compelling use cases that are not available or it's hard to do efficiently using your existing tool, you might be in business. Additionally, you want to make sure that the new tool has wider coverage -- in the sense that it not only covers the new use cases, but also your existing use cases very well. 2. How much of your current work is dependent on your current tool (say R)? If your works involve mostly building prototypes that do not interact with other system, and is not part of a pipeline, then the cost of switching will be lower. On the other hand, if your pipeline/system heavily depends on the platform you are using, the code that you need to re-write is not necessarily just the job itself, but also other things that streamline everything together. 3. Is the programming paradigm for the new tool different enough that you will have a new understanding of how data analysis can be structured? To give a more concrete example -- R is essentially a functional programming language, and many of its data processing workflow follow this paradigm. It also have an object oriented spin to it, but I usually find it much harder to grasp compare than how Python approach it.  There will be times where a particular paradigm is more suitable for the analysis you are trying to do, and choosing the right tool is important.  If the new tool follows mostly the same paradigm as your existing tool, you are likely to learn it pretty quickly, but it wouldn't stretch your mind as much and give you new perspectives. ",

            "answer_text": "R vs Python is one of the most common but important question asked by lots of data science students. Today I am going to tell of the major difference between R and Python. We know that R and Python both are open source programming languages. Both of these languages are having a large community. Both of these languages are having continuous development. That\u2019s is the reason these languages add new libraries and tools in their catalog. The major purpose of using R is for statistical analysis, on the other hand Python provide the more general approach to data science. Both of the languages are state of the art programming language for data science. Python is one of the simplest programming languages in terms of its syntax. That\u2019s why any beginner in a programming language can learn R without putting extra efforts. On the other hand, R is built by statisticians that are a little bit hard to learn. There are some reasons that will help us to find out why we should not use both R and Python. R R is one of the oldest programming language developed by academics and statisticians. R comes into existence in the year 1995. Now R is providing the richest ecosystem for data analysis. The R programming language is full of libraries. There are a couple of repositories also available with R. In fact, CRAN is having around 12000 packages. The rich variety of library makes it the first choice for statistical analysis and analytical work. Key features of R Consists of packages for almost any statistical application one can think of. CRAN currently hosts more than 10k packages.Comes equipped with excellent visualization libraries like ggplot2.Capable of standalone analysesPython On the other hand Python can do the same tasks as R programming language does. The major features of python are data wrangling, engineering, web scraping and so on. Python is also having the tools that help in implementing the machine learning at large scale. Python is one of the simplest languages to maintain and it is more robust than R. Now a day Python is having the cutting edge API. This API is quite helpful in machine learning and AI. Most of the data scientist uses only five Python libraries i.e Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn and Seaborn. It is quite handy to use Python over R. Key features of Python programming language:- Object-oriented languageGeneral PurposeHas a lot of extensions and incredible community supportSimple and easy to understand and learnpackages like pandas, numpy and scikit-learn, make Python an excellent choice for machine learning activities.R or Python Usage Python has developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python is the most popular programming language in the world. It has most powerful libraries for math, statistic, artificial intelligence and machine learning. But still python is not useful for econometrics and communication, and also for business analytics. On the other hand, R is developed by academics and scientist. It is specially designed for machine learning and data science. R is having the most powerful communication libraries that are quite helpful in data science. In addition, R is equipped with many packages that are used to perform the data mining and time series analysis. Why not use Both? Lots of people think that they can use both the programming languages at the same time. But we should prevent to use them at the same time. Majority of people are using only one of these programming languages. But they always want to have access to the capability of the language adversary. For example, if you use both the language at the same time that may face some of the problems. If you use R and you want to perform some object-oriented function than you can\u2019t use it on R. On the other hand, Python is not suitable for statistical distributions. So that they should not use both the language at the same time, because there is a mismatch of their functions. But there are some ways that will help you to use both of these languages with one another. We will talk about them in our next blog. Let\u2019s have a look at the comparison between R vs Python. R is more functional, Python is more object-oriented. R is more functional, it provides a variety of functions to the data scientist i.e Im, predict and so on. Most of the work done by functions in R. On the other hand Python use classes to perform any task within the python. R has more data analysis built-in, Python relies on packages. R provides the build-in data analysis for summary statistics, it is supported by summary built-in functions in R. But on the other hand, we have to import the statsmodel packages in Python to use this function. In addition, there is also a built-in constructor in R i.e is dataframe. On the other hand, we have to import it in Python. Read more ",

Python makes data tools more available to everyone, but it just might not be optimal way to solve a problem.  Most people don't need optimal solutions, so yeah, Python will go mainstream for data analysis. Different programming languages are good at different things and that is a positive thing. Mainstream users aren't interested building an analysis system that is the most robust, fastest and most powerful.  They just want an answer to their question.  Python is a great, accessible/easy, and generally fast enough way to get that. Anyone who really needs speed for something big and ugly is always going to go to R.  Just like if I need to data mine strings I would probably go with PERL instead of Python. R will never be displaced by Python. A better question might be if Python will displace SAS or SPSS ",

            "answer_text": "What many do not realize is that many subject-oriented analysts have and probably will always have trouble with doing data analysis using a fairly low-level language like python. Python will surely eat R\u2019s lunch in data sciences. But R will eat stata\u2019s, SPSS, Excel and graphpad\u2019s lunch (and more people do data analysis with these tools than with python). Also there are huge application areas (like bioinformatics) that are heavily reliant on R packages (like Bioconductor, which has over 1000 specialized packages and a common data model). So I think they will coexist. But be used by somewhat different people depending on discipline. RStudio has played a huge part in making R more accessible to new people and facilitating reproducible data analysis through the use of R scripting and to some extent programming. A lot of \u201cData Science\u201d, understood broadly, does not require a more powerful language than R. And R is improving all the time. ",

Many of us use Python over R already.  (I barely even know R.)   If the question is \"will data scientists all stop using R in favor of Python?\" then I would say no. There are a lot of people who prefer to use R, and a number of specialized R packages that have no easy Python equivalent. If the question is \"will data scientists use the best tool for the job?\" then I hope the answer is yes.  :) ",

            "answer_text": "No, not likely. Python was not originally designed for statistical computing and data mining. It was designed for programmers to write programs to build websites, softwares etc. Later, because of its ease of use, Python expanded into the big data field (both Hadoop and Spark now support Python). R is a different story. It was invented for statisticians. It has many many open source data mining / statistical packages. R programmers have developed a tradition to open-source their work and contribute to the community. Lately, Microsoft developed a multi-threading version of R using MLK called Microsoft R Open. Spark community also embraced R with SparkR. As R is becoming more and more popular, I think one day it might kick out Python from the big data community if it solves its own problems such as data processing. ",

Both tools have the same memory-in-RAM limits, both are single core by default and both of those issues are solved the same way on either platform (add more RAM, HDF5, RDBMS). Additionally, to get great performance from either language, people write code in C/C++/Fortran or try to work with JIT compilers (Numba, PyPy, compiler in R). So what are we arguing about, syntax preferences? That's hardly \"eating ones  lunch\" IMO. ",
