It still is one of the finest Bengali novels I have read to date. The concept was beautiful, the story was well written. I read this when I was very young, and the political thrills really attracted me a lot. I don\u2019t remember much, but I would definitely read it again His best one is probably Shaatkahon #1. This is a story about a woman Dipaboli and her struggle against all the odds of the society. The character was amazingly crafted. I haven\u2019t loved any female character from Bengali literature this much ever before. She should be the role-model of the Bengali teens. Every bengali lady should read this book at least once. However, I didn\u2019t like the sequel. It looked like he wrote that one just for the sake of another book. He has tried rather too hard to make Dipaboli fall in love and show that this doesn\u2019t work. Yeah yeah, I get it, love is not all romance and pet names. But this is not that bad either. Also I didn\u2019t like how the males were portrayed in this one. Then I must mention the story of three generations - Kalpurush, Kaalbela and Uttoradhikar, each one beautiful in it\u2019s own way. Gorvodharini, another amazing novel, portrays the rebellious nature of Bengali teens beautifully. However I didn\u2019t like the ending much. Well, the feeling is kinda mixed. Bengali literature passed the golden age during it\u2019s renaissance. Rabindra, Sharat, Sunil, Sattyajit, Shankar, Bivuti, Bankim - phew\u2026 Truth be told, we haven\u2019t seen someone of that calibre for quite a long time. ",
