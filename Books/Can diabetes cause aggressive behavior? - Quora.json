Insulin-dependent diabetics are often mistaken for drunks (often with catastrophic results for the diabetic) because as they\u2019re blood sugar goes low, they lose emotional control and often behave aggressively. Insulin-dependent diabetics on low-carb diets do not not have this problem since ketones pinch-hit for the missing glucose and diabetics behave rationally at far lower blood glucose levels - blame the American Diabetes Association for fighting the locarb diet for decades - as advocates for doing what works for diabetics, they have been useless sacks of shit for decades, only acknowledging this year - 2019!! - that low carb works for glycemic control American Diabetes Association endorses low-carb diet as option \u2014 Diet Doctor when Dr Frederick Allen was advocating the low carb diet in 1922 ",

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cCan diabetes cause aggressive behaviour?\u201d Yes - indirectly. It\u2019s actually hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar, or low Blood Glucose) that causes aggressive behaviour. Hypoglycaemia is common in those using insulin - AND insulin secretagogues (medications that stimulate increased insulin production by the pancraetic endocrine beta cells). When BG (Blood Glucose) gets low, emotional restraints are lost - and we can lash out at anyone in our way without regard to consequences. I once decked a cop that was actually trying to help me; fortunately, he knew my circumstances and let me get put on an ambulance and taken to hospital, with no legal repercussions. Low BG only occurs in diabetics using insulin or an insulin secretagogue; those include the sulfonlureas (like glyburide, glipizide and glimepride) and the glinides (like repaglinide and nateglinide).

            "answer_text": "Study 2 found an indirect relationship between diabetes (a disorder marked by low glucose levels and poor glucose metabolism) and aggressiveness through low self-control. Study 3 found that states with high diabetes rates also had high violent crime rates. Anger initiates the stress response within the body causing blood sugar levels to rise, heart rate and blood pressure to increase. It is normal for people with diabetes to experience anger, often questioning why it is them with diabetes whilst other people are healthy.

            "answer_text": "Yes it can when blood sugar gets low it can cause irritability. However, I tend to believe that if a diabetic gets violent it is because they have an aggressive streak in them. My ex husband was diabetic and he could get nasty even punchy when low. Truth is he had a nasty streak even when not hypoglycemic. He used \u2018low blood sugar\u2019 as an blanket excuse for aggressive behavior. ",
