            "answer_text": "It is easy to score 90+ marks in class 12th there are only few rules which need to be followed RELIGIOUSLY. The rules are simple but tough to follow bcoz we are not in habit of accepting things as they are we have the habit of overthinking and doing the things in a manner in which we try to mould the basic rules in order to make them effective in our own manner without realizing the importance of some basic principles such as regularity, diligence and self regulation\u2026.. Some basic rules to be followed are mentioned below and remember the adage \u2018IT IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE\u2019 Remember the famous saying that \u2018TALK DOES NOT COOK RICE\u2019 so stop planning and start implementing.It is never to late to start the right thing in the right manner here i would like to insist on the right manner which means start with small targets but with perfection , never try to overburden youself with huge targets which are tough to be achieved bcoz it may lead to procastination which will ultimately lead to losing your motivation for your goal.Make a habit of doing at least 5 questions in your major subject (5*3=15 questions) on daily basis in a different notebook and stay focussed.These 15 questions should become part of your routine and there should not be a single day on which you should skip doing these questions and try to do atleast these 15 questions with whole hearted effort never ever skip them and take them for granted and plan to do them on the next day, it can lead you in a disastrous state of procastination and planning. Stay focussed.Once you have overcome your above state and have started doing the work in the best possible form then your SELF MOTIVATION is going to inctease and you will start enjoying your work.Your confidence level is going to get a boost bcoz of your regularity and perfection in your work as a result your performance is going to increase which will lead to an increase in your SELF ESTEEM.Once you are tuned into the process of regularity than your desire for doing more is going to increase and your quest for doing more is going to increase and it would be a process of self induction.After following the process for 3 (safer side)months your grades are surely going to surely shoot up. As psychology reveals that if we do a task for 8 weeks it becomes part of habit.This is how we can train our brains into the process of self regulation but remember one thing before believing in a principle we need to have complete faith in the principle.This is how we can bring out the best in ourself and achieve 90+ marks in our board exams.The only one precaution which needs to be taken care off is you need to believe in yourself and follow the above principle RELIGIOUSLY.Thank you for reading and you will be more thankful to yourselves if you apply it bcoz always remember \u2018IT IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE\u2019Regards, Career mate keep learning Once",

            "answer_text": "Yes u can do !!!! It won't be very tough. U just need to increase the hours u study, boost your confidence and believe in yourself that u can . U may follow these small advices :- As u didn't study well in 11 , then to get the habit of studying for long hours would be difficult initially . So take short breaks in between but don't do anything distractive in the break this will make it difficult for u return back to study .Also try to increase the study hours gradually .Try to concentrate may be by listening to calm music or by meditation \u2026Check your progress through any kind of class test etc that happens in school or tuition . Give those test honestly and prepare for it dilligently . Even if u have improved a little from class XI it should be a huge positive point for u . After giving two or three such test , if u find yourself improving then , be confident that u are on the right track . Thus continue walking on that path with all your energy and enthusiasm . Be regular with your studies . Be regular to school and coaching . Don't take unnecessary leave . Don't spend a day or two by studying nothing. Atleast study for an hour or two . First clear your concepts property and then solve the type of questions that come in boards . Ask doubts 'n' no of times to your teachers or friends . Don't be ashamed to do so even if u are scholded or told stupid etc .Don't think that your questions is silly and ppl will laugh at u . Be thorough with the last 10\u201315 yrs question paper . Give some them as full test seriously keeping in mind time management . And then self evaluate yourself . Don't stress yourself if u are getting bad marks initially . Practice makes a man perfect . If marks haven't improved then practice more and more and at the end all the efforts will definitely will be fruitful and u will pass with flying colours . Relax and try to be tension free before exam ( ik it's difficult ) . Try to reach way before time in exam centre and eat and sleep properly before the exams . These things actually matter a lot. Lastly boards exams are easy and there are countless students who come up with 90+ marks so u can also achieve it. ",

            "answer_text": "You can surely score more than 90 percent in 12 class boards even if you are not able to make it in 11 class. But it could be possible only if you was quite good in studies till your matric. If you were, then the reason for your poor performance in 11 could only be the abrupt rise in syllabus or more freedom from parents in 11 class or you might have\u2019nt paid attention as 11 class scores are not of much importance. I got 95% in my 12 class CBSE board exams in non-med. Stream, but in 11 i just passed on the verge. The reasons for my poor performance were many. 1.i got much freedom from my parents after shifting in higher secondaries.2.Lack of proper guidance that what to do after +2. and the main reason 3. I got 10 CGPA in 10th and i thought that if i had done this,then i can do any thing,quitea carelessness. But then i got quite serious for studies after 11 results. So i think you can make a comeback in board results if you do regular studies and from depth of your heart, which is quite important. Also 3\u20134 hours of self study is quite important for making it to more than 90%. ",

It is definitely possible to score well in class 12 because as everybody says that nothing is impossible but if this is true then you won\u2019t have been asking this question now if it was really true. everything is possible but only in it\u2019s own time so if that voice really comes out of your head and heart that yes i have to study for my own sake and not anybody else then none of these answers would matter to you and you\u2019d shut your phone off and start studying. So,think that whatever you are doing,is it really something your own self wants from yourself or you are doing it just for the sake of doing it. take care dude. ",

Options such as live chat with audio and video makes the interfacing very smooth and seamless. i could ask help from them at the last minutes and they cleared my doubts efficiently. To choose a tutor suiting my needs was my call to make and i did it after a FREE demo first trial which made my judgement very easy. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes off-course you can. Although its true that class 11 sets a base for class 12th but you still can score your desired marks provided you are ready to work hard. Start early so that you have sufficient time for revision before exams. Concentrate in your classes because getting the basics right is very important to score good marks. First study from your textbooks thoroughly, make your own notes. But for clarity of concepts take help from reference books. I would recommend you to study from Oswaal Question Bank. This book is updated and include more than sufficient questions to be exam-ready. Some of the benefits of studying from this book are: Features like Chapter wise and Topic-wise presentation strengthen knowledge and attitude related to the subject. .2. Quick Review in the beginning of each chapter is an added advantage of using this book. 3. Questions incorporated in this book encompass all the \u2018Typologies\u2019 for exam-oriented study. 4. Previous Years\u2019 Board Questions are also included in the book, which you should definitely solve to familiarize yourself with the exam-pattern. After completing your syllabus make sure to solve sample papers 2\u20133 months before exam. Solve oswaal sample question papers. They include 5 solved question papers and 10 self-assessment papers with hints covering important concepts from an examination perspective. It also include on tip notes, answering tips, commonly made errors and mind maps for quick revision and better retention. Just study methodically through out the year and scoring 90+ will be a cake walk for you. Hope this helps! ",

I scored 73% in 11th and 91.8% in not that high but my parents were satisfied and it was comparable to the Sharma ji \u2018s kid living next door, so I feel I am eligible to answer this question. So in simple words \u2018Yes \u2018 you can definitely do well. The reason there might have been a drop I your grades might be because of the sudden increase in the syllabus which you are not used to as 10th Standard was pretty chill. So give yourself time , study on a regular basis and you will definitely do well. All the best ! :) ",

But remember that,for c.e.t you need to have overall knowledge of 11th and 12th syllabus. So it will be very difficult to face c.e.t without 11th base.Already now if you have finished your 11th no problem and just concentrate on 12th,after finishing your 12th board exam one month gap will be given for the entrance exams such as kcet etc. That time you have to go through 11th syllabus , then only you can do well in c.e.t. C.e.t plays an important role in getting colleges for your precious dream courses so one should not neglect it from the beginning itself. Very sure that ,easily you can score in 12th theory exams even without the good base of 11th. But for entrance exams really you need to work hard in order to get good ranks and good colleges. ",
