            "answer_text": "Yes, they remain on your Kindle until you turn the WiFi back on.  Meanwhile, you will get an email notification that your library loan has ended, and the copy of the book will be considered \"returned\" to the library so that another person can check it out.  When you do turn the WiFi back on, the book will disappear and you will receive a \"notice\" on your Kindle that your library loan ended, and giving you the option to buy the book.  You can delete this notice as you would any content from your kindle. If you do turn your WiFi back on before you finish the book, and check it out from the library again later, Amazon will remember where you were in the book, which is very nice. ",
