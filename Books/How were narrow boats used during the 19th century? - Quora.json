            "answer_text": "First, the width of a boat is called its beam. Narrow boats were used in the 19C for the same purposes they were used for in the 20C, which are two: Narrow beam is still used on boats that need to go fast, such as warships or boats needed for criminal activities, such as smuggling. Narrow beam boats aren\u2019t as wide, and thus produce less drag in the water, enabling them to go faster than wider boats. While in the USN, I was stationed on a cruiser that was over six hundred feet long and only fifty feet in beam at its widest point. When necessary, that ship could go as fast as a car on a highway.One purpose for which narrow-beam boats are less used now is for movement in very narrow canals. Before railroads became common, Western countries began constructing myriad canals to move people and goods in an age when roads weren\u2019t good. Because only primitive techniques were available for the construction of these canals, many of them weren\u2019t very wide, and boats had to be built accordingly. Narrow boats were also much easier to move through canals by hand or animal power, which was the most common practice. The problem with narrow boats is that they can carry less payload than wider ones.This problem of trying to travel through very narrow canals isn\u2019t as serious as it used to be, but navies being able to move very quickly becomes an ever more pressing need.

            "answer_text": "Known also as working boats. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, narrow boats were used on the canals and navigable rivers in the UK to carry coal, iron ore, salt and many other large scale products to where they were needed - in the mills and factories that sprang up from the 1770s onwards due to the Industrial Revolution. A few carried passengers. They became uneconomic to use after the 1830s due to,the rise of the railways, which were faster and could haul more trucks than a horse could pull narrow boats. ",
