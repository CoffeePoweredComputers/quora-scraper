            "answer_text": "The answer is yes and no, both at the Sametime depending on what type of story that needs to be conveyed.  Video games are very effective in conveying stories that have in them role playing and decision making.  In most video games the story keeps progressing irrespective of the choice player makes and at the same time giving the player a much more personalised experience which is not really possible with the movies.  Role playing games generally induce a feeling of us being a part of story and thus making emotionally and intellectually attached to the plot of the game. It basically depends on the creator's idea of what he/she wants the user to experinece.  some games are designed to be played innumerable times and such games mostly have a short story or no story at all (with a few exceptions though, in terms of tge game modes)  where as some are designed to give the player the experience of being the driving force of the game's story.  All said,  it's just the fact that we get to interact and in some cases being able to control the plot of the game that makes them better story conveying medium when the story is all about experience and immersion.  But with movies its mostly what the creator wants us to see and interpret things according to one's own sensuality.  The lack of interaction makes them a solid medium for inducing a particular emotion in the viewers.  Games are no match for movies when it's the emotion that needs to be conveyed.  Its the difference between playing someone and watching someone play someone that actually steers this discussion of which is a better medium. ",

            "answer_text": "When you say better, you may want to put up some criteria. If you wanted to tell an epic to every miniscule detail, games can do this easily as players can potentially log hundreds of hours of gameplay chunks at a time. Imagine how long one Harry Potter movie would be if they included every detail in the book; they would have had to film it like they did The Hobbit! On the flip side unless the game is made to be like an interactive movie (Heavy Rain, The Order: 1886), there are some things you can do with film that are hard to pull off in a game. An example would be a scene of foreshadow where the camera focuses on a brief moment of action. If this was done in a game during a non scenimatic scene with a free camera, you could easily miss this moment.  As well, if a game focuses on a task required to progress the story that's mundane, that can really take the player out of the story whereas a movie could handle this with a montage or cut away to some other characters to give the idea that time is passing. Immersion can really carry a story along, though, and give huge emotional impact. There's a game with a cutscene that won't progress until you pull the trigger of your gun. You as the player don't want to do it, and it gives you empathy for the character you're playing. But you have to. It's emotionally gripping. ",

            "answer_text": "Telling specific stories with a linear narrative progression is much easier to do as a film. It's just way easier to make sure your viewer is looking where you want them to look if you are in control of the camera. It's also much easier to keep your production values consistently high if the viewer can't make decisions and the storyline doesn't branch toward different endings. What videogames ARE very good at is helping the player empathize with what it's like to be in a certain situation. They are good at expressing a worldview through their rules and circumstances.  If you want to help your viewer understand what it's like to be something like a soldier, videogames are a better medium for that; if you want to tell the story of what happened to a particular soldier, movies are better.

            "answer_text": "It certainly depends on the story. Games- while usually following a someone lineal story, still contain a certain amount of freedom. This is what for me differentiates a video game from a book. Also, films tend to just be more user friendly. As fun as it is to play something like The Last of Us, someone who has never played a game before might struggle, and much rather watch a movie about the same topic. Overall, I believe personally that films (and all other mediums) are superior to video games in storytelling capabilities. ",
