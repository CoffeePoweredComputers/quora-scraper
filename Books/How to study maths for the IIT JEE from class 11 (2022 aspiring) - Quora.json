            "answer_text": "The foundation for Maths\u2026 There's actually nothing of topics or anything as foundation though, but actually instead it is how your brain is trained to the problems\u2026 that's built in your classes 1-10. Now in my case our math class 1-5 (a simple hindi medium school of Haryana board) at that time was like very high level from classes and in fact the things which I studied the things I knew in class 2 again in class 6 or 7 (CBSE)\u2026 difference\u2026 The thing is\u2026 mind was well shaped\u2026 Simply test your mind\u2026 take some very seeming construction problem or geometry or trigonometry\u2026 how you can solve in just in your mind will give an idea\u2026 take a very complex function in x say which is not solvable without calculator (like y=xe^x - very simple) and try to mould very much to find x without calc if fn value is given. You'll know your level and that'd give a start\u2026 My interest in maths attracted me to the trickiest functions and trigonometry and dimensions and calculus problems\u2026 Started with RD Sharma Objective maths in class 11th summer vacations and finished each question upto chapter 7\u2026 that much was more than enough for me to start visualizing problems\u2026 When you start seeing things, things become easy\u2026 and i could see functions and solutions forming in my mind\u2026 after that I was with my school textbooks and later on JEE Advanced problems and few JEE magazines only I think that much would be enough as you can understand the rest\u2026 (In my whole 2 years, I attended classes (more than 100% attendance can say) I didn't have phone and TV.. in fact school library, books, and above all my mind to solve my problems\u2026 (had great teachers but never bothered them much for this)\u2026 and daily I had averaged 6 hours to study, and for weeks I'd study one subject and then other and like that\u2026 no tensions of keeping up with school nor coaching\u2026 all that was an important factor for my mind that's why I mentioned\u2026) \u201cMathematics is decoding the shapes by shaping your minds\" -always applies.
