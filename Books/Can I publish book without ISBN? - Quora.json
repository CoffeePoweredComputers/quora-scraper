            "answer_text": "Yes, you should. And here is why. You can sell your ebook with a barcode instead of an ISBN. Amazon will give you one. Smashwords will give you one. This will get you into major ebook retailers where indie authors make most of their income: Kindle, iBooks, Kobo, B&N. Amazon will give you a free Amazon number to sell your book in their print-on-demand store. Almost all indie print sales go through Amazon. And you can purchase your own books in bulk at very competitive prices through KDP and sell them at book fairs or on consignment. If you sell more than a thousand books, you can buy an ISBN at that point and then sell your books through IngramSparks to libraries and small bookshops. There is no need to tie up $175 that would be better used on marketing to go through Ingram for your first book. ",

            "answer_text": "You can publish without an ISBN. However, by doing so, you guarantee that your boo will not be sold in physical bookstores. Many online retailers will not carry an ebook without an ISBN, either. Most libraries (at least in the US) will not aquire or list a book without an ISBN. If you want the widest possible distribution of a book, it should have an ISBN. Having an ISBN assigned to a self-published book costs some money. You need to determine what markets would be opened by having an ISBN, and whether the extra sales those markets might generate would be worth the cost. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but NO distributor (like Ingram Content or Baker & Taylor) and no book store will take you copies or list your book in their data bases. This would be the route for people selling books out of the trunk of their car. Also understand that NO ONE can find your book. Say someone see\u2019s a friend who bought one direct and they want to order a copy, they won\u2019t be able to do it unless you list your address and cost of the book plus shipping, because NO STORE will be able to find your book without and ISBN.
