            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve got to be honest here. I think \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e is absolutely illogical. Here\u2019s why: The use of Chinese (Manderian) Characters make no sense. About 1,500 years ago missionaries from China arrived on Japanese soil by boat. At this time Japanese had no writing system\u2014 at all. It was a purely verbal language. This is the beginning of its illogicality. Japanese people did not understand Chinese characters or their semantic meaning, but they thought the characters looked cool and memorized their pronunciation, and then began writing Chinese characters phonetically to write Japanese down on paper in streams of continuous characters to symbolize that Japanese is a spurt of two-syllable sounds until they finish their thought/sentence \u2014 no breaks in speaking for words. But since Chinese is a very logical and methodological language, with both a phonetic and semantic meaning to most characters, this behavior didn\u2019t make any logical sense. The reason, Japanese people didn\u2019t understand which parts of the Chinese characters were phonetic and which were semantic, so they kept writing both, ignorant to what it meant. Eventually, Japanese people decided that writing out full Chinese characters for Japanese sounds was too much work. So rather than drop the phonetic elements of Chinese characters and begin using only the semantic elements of Chinese characters coupled with native Japanese pronunciations for corresponding words, they decided instead to \u2018simplify\u2019 the strokes of the full Chinese character \u2014 still ignorant of the true meaning of the characters. This is how Kana was created. Both Hiragana and Katakana were made in this way. The problem, of course, is that these new simplified characters were to be Japan\u2019s first native writing system. But they were based on an ignorant understanding of Chinese characters, which took into account only the phonetic pronunciations of such Characters! So, Kana became strictly a phonetic alphabet with no semantic meaning. This is a lot better than misusing Chinese characters, but in principle, its no different. I think Japanese would be better off simply using phonetic portions of Chinese characters stacked next to each other for combined meaning, with japanese pronunciation. Basically, it would make more sense if Japanese were more like Chinese. But it isn\u2019t. Japanese has a different word order than Chinese, and arguably, Japanese doesn\u2019t even really have words, its more like a string of sounds such that when arranged in a spefic order a message appears. In fact, Japanese language faculty often mention a single two-syllable sound, slways conposed of one consonant followed by one vowel, can be thought of as a single \u2018word.\u2019 Not all single sounds have meaning, only \u2018particles\u2019 fall into this category. Things like nouns are a sequence of two-syllable consonsnt + vowel sounds. In Japanese, more complex information simply becomes a longer sequence of sounds stringed together. The longer the sequence, the more its saying. All Japanese words may be written phonetically using only Kana. This represents the true nature of the Japanese language, primarily audible with an afterthought phonetic writing system. But the Japanese were dissatisfied with Kana! They lost the \u2018cool\u2019 look of Chinese characters, or as some historians write, \u2018prestige.\u2019 So modern Japan decided to bring back Chinese characters. This was given the name \u2018Kanji\u2019 \u2014 literal translation: \u2018Chinese Character.\u2019 So now we have the original, full, Chinese characters coming back into the scene. Except that Kana still remains! Which was itself based on those same exact Chinese characters! This is the second downfall of Japanese. It\u2019s circular. Now they had to figure out how to mix Kanji with Kana and have a writing system that still made some kind of sense. What was decided was to figure out the semantic meaning of original Chinese characters, and then use them for semantic meaning coupled with native Japanese pronunciation of those words, with Kana written above or below the Kanji characters for sounding out the meaning of the word, called Furigana, mixed then with Kana for conjugation of verbs + adjectives and for forming noun phrases, sentences, and predicates; for adding copulas and adverbs, etc. But even after they learned the true meaning of Chinese characters, both phonetic and semantic, instead of doing the logical thing, which would be to strip Chinese characters of their phonetic parts, and begin to write only their semantic parts, with the Japanese native pronunciation, they kept writing the same exact characters as before. This is where modern Japanese sits today, with the Japanese Government maintaining a list of \u2018officially used\u2019 Japanese Characters called the Joyo Kanji. Japanese has basically nothing to do with its writing system. If you want to truly understand Japanese, you have to realize that it\u2019s writing system is just a proxy to access the real language of Japanese, which is and always has been primarily an audible language, which is why when you study Japanese in college all the important exams and checks of understanding are audible, spoken exams. There seems to be no ryhm or reason for the sounds of certain words over others. These exams focus on listening and comprehension, plus your ability to recall the correct sounds of vocabulary, and conjugate verbs in your head on the fly, and pronounce them correctly, in the right order to form a grammatical sentence. The learning process in a Japanese language class is not to help you slowly build a sentence with the help of dictionaries and alphabets, the learning process is whether or not you can memorize sounds full-stop, without the help of any writing system to guide you, as if not being able to is a total loss. In fact, it\u2019s almost the opposite. Your verbal memory of the correct sequence of sounds is what guides you to learn the writing system, rather than the other way around like most languages. What matters in Japanese is whether or not you can speak, not whether or not you understand it\u2019s proxy. This is so deeply engraved that Japanese people literally translate \u2018foreign words\u2019 into pronunciations compatible with the consonant + vowel sound phrases they use to speak. This is the primary function of Katakana. For example, my name Robert Wilson is of English origin. It\u2019s an english name. But if I were to go to Japan I would have to translate my name into \u30eb\u30bd\u30fc\u30cc\u30fb\u30ed\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8. Literal translation: Lusoonu, Robaato. Because Japanese people intentionally butcher foriegn words. So, Japanese\u2019s writing system basically makes little to no sense at all, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s writing system is a proxy to the language. But does a language which doesn\u2019t rely on a writing system make any real sense? \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Certainly not for the student, at least. For whatever it\u2019s worth, I think Classical Japanese is slightly better off than modern Japanese, but ultimately suffers the same flaws. Ultimately I think Chinese is the more logical language. To learn Chinese, check out this textbook. Though, even better is Traditional Manderian as spoken and written in Taiwan. The simplified charachter\u2019s of PRC\u2019s Manderian are an attempt at erasing China\u2019s history by making old texts unreadable to Chinese. It also makes Manderian more like Japanese, and carries the same logical idiocy via \u2018sinplifying.\u2019 To me, \u2018simplifying\u2019 an Asian language consists of stripping away any and all logical elements of a language and then replace them all with chronological rote memorization of steps with a meaning attached. As a result of this general trend in Japan, China and Korea, I wonder if anatomically East Asian people are predisposed to be better at memorizing and worse at logical reasoning. Props to Taiwan for recognizing this trend and saying \u2018no\u2019 to \u2018simplifying\u2019 their language and \u2018no\u2019 to erasing their historical texts and culture. ",

            "answer_text": "Japanese is quite logical. But it\u2019s remarkably different from a lot of other languages in the world and, if you were to keep the word order but use English words, it would sound a lot like Yoda from Star Wars. Japanese also has several levels of formality ranging from Keigo (\u656c\u8a9e), an ultra polite form of speaking that even a lot of Japanese people struggle with, to hyoujungo (\u6a19\u6e96\u8a9e), the standard dialect of the country, to the various local dialects collectively known as \u65b9\u8a00. So this can make it an annoying language to deal with but certainly not illogical. One thing it can be, though, is extremely minimal; almost like caveman speak. They simply don\u2019t bother with elements in a sentence that don\u2019t absolutely need to be spoken. This minimalness can also carry with it a kind of nebulous hyper applicability to Japanese words that can be used across multiple situations exactly as they are. Whereas, in English, you would need to construct customized sentences, as it were, for each situation. So, although you might understand what\u2019s being said, translating it into English sometimes proves surprisingly difficult. ",
