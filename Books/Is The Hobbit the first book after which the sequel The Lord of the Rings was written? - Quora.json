            "answer_text": "It was written first, but loosely associated with the much older tales that were still unpublished at the time. Which we now have as The Silmarillion. Lord of the Rings was conceived as a sequel after The Hobbit was a big success. He took time to decide what it should be. You can find this in the four-volume The History of The Lord of the Rings, but this is heavy reading. He also decided early on to include characters from the 1932 poem The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. Old Man Willow, the Barrow-Wight and Goldberry are all there. He also decided to make it a lot deeper and darker, in part because of the threat and then the arrival of World War Two. But also says that much of the plot would have stood even if the war had not happened. ",

            "answer_text": "Tolkien had many works in progress. The Hobbit was shared with his children as it was being written but he had many notes from his many linguistic ventures. When the Hobbit was a success, he began to compile the history of Middle Earth and put together the Lord of The Rings in the process and tried to publish it in one large volume, the publishers divided it into three and he began to work on the other notes. He was a professor and had many other projects in linguistics, including a translation of Beowulf. His other works never reached novel form and some of them were published in the Appendices in the Lord of the Rings, the compilation of poems of The Adventures of Tom Bombadil with other shorter stories such as Leaf By Niggle. The Silmarillion is bits and pieces, incoherent with some larger pieces of the story of the rise and fall of Numenor, an explanation of Creation. The first published was the Hobbit, then the Lord of the Rings, then the other pieces. ",
