            "answer_text": "I have seen, indeed i own, many books that I know were original products by the publisher, because I bought them directly, but which now have dirty pages and are damaged. Indeed I am looking at one such book as i type. Unless the book was sold as \u201cnew\u201d, such pages merely indicate that it was used and is now in less than good condition. Check the copyright page. If the book is a legitimate publication by a secondary publisher, it will so indicate on that page. Check the ISBN, if the book is recent enough to have one. ISBN\u2019s can be looked up online, and code for the publisher as well as the title. However, if someone wanted to \u201cforge\u201d a book, making a replica as exact as possible, there might well be no clearcut way to tell the difference. Books are not designed as high-security objects. But I find it hard to see why anyone would do this, unless the book were a collectable in short supply with a high price in the secondary market. In that case things such as the exact weight and quality nof the paper used, and trivial details of the printing, particularly any errors in the original. might be used to make the distinction, but none of these are foolproof. Unless this is a collectable for which you paid a collector\u2019s price, i don\u2019t see why you would care. ",

            "answer_text": "More often than not, pirated sellers do pop up on many Ecommerce sites and many a times readers are none the wiser. The truth is that if someone really wants to pirate a title they would figure out a way to do so. Nowadays pirated copies do not look or feel like what we think pirated copies should be like. As in, we no longer have lower resolution covers, typos or print defects. Pirated sellers and printers have honed their craft and go above and beyond to make an exact replica. As a book seller, I am unable to figure out which is a pirated copy. The only way we are able to tell in our office is with the weight of the book. Even the information in the copyright and verso pages can be copied and are not unique. Options for authors and publishers to make each copy unique are limited and they are expensive and not 100% efficient. As someone had said here, if you are querying for a collector's item or have paid a very large sum for a book then you can check with the seller. You would have to assume that major book stores would not be selling pirated copies. If you are buying from other avenues then you can check if the seller has rights to sell the book. If the book was traditionally published then the publishing house would only selll it from major distributiea most of the times. You can cross check with the publisher if required. I hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "I am not sure if it's going to help you. You'll find this thing on the back cover of your book.  That's ISBN. International Standard Book Number which consists of 13 digits along with a barcode(books published before 2007 have the 10 digit version). Looks something like this    \u200b The first three digits 978 imply that the product belongs to book industry\u200b. The next digit tells you about the language of print. 1 and 0 for English. 2- French. 3 - German 4- Japanese and so on... Then 1234 is the publisher code. And the remaining digits are specific to the book, edition, format and all. The newer version of the book has a different ISBN. You can call the publishing house and cross check this info. Most importantly, a damaged book can be originally published as well. Usually, these misprint/damaged books are filtered out before they end in market.  Whatever might be the case, contact customer care and request for an exchange/return. ",
