Traditionally, students start Hogwarts at 11 years old, which is where this story starts as well. Since then, each book covers 1 year of his schooling life and he is 1 year older in each subsequent book. Hence, in the Fourth book, Goblet of Fire, he is in Fourth year of his schooling and he is 14 years old. In the first 2-3 chapters of each book, there's a mention of his birthday and how old he is turning now. That's also a good way to keep track. ",
