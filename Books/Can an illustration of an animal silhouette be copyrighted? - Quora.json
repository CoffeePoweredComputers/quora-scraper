            "answer_text": "The answers so far have a mistaken understanding of copyright law, insofar as U.S. law is involved. Let\u2019s assume the illustration was made in the U.S., so that we know your question is about U.S. law. If so, the correct answer can be found here: What Does Copyright Protect? In a nutshell, \u201cCopyright \u2026 protects original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works\u2026\u201d that are fixed in a tangible medium. Thus, there are only a few very simple questions that need to be answered to know whether your illustration is protected by copyright: Did you make the illustration? Is it on paper or other tangible medium? Was it your original work? Was there even a \u201cslight amount\u201d of originality or creative expression? If yes, it is protected by copyright, from the moment you made the illustration. Registering your copyright in your illustration is a different matter, but that\u2019s not what the question asked. Several of the other answers conflate the existence of copyright protection with meaningful enforcement of your copyright. Those are not the same thing, at all. Copyright protects the author only against someone else copying their creative expression. Thus, anyone else who creates an illustration of an animal silhouette, without copying your specific version of it (or someone else\u2019s), has a copyright in their illustration, too. Proving copyright infringement requires (simplifying here) access to your copyrighted work and substantial similarity between your work and the alleged copy. If your illustration is simple, it\u2019s difficult to show that someone else\u2019s illustration is substantially similar. The result is that your copyright protection is probably very limited, but that doesn\u2019t mean that your illustration isn\u2019t protected by copyright. ",

            "answer_text": "You must understand your copyrights. It is not copyright it is copyrights, a set of rights. To start an education about topic I recommend you read from cover to cover the The Graphic Artists Guild Handbook: Pricing & Ethical Guidelines. In addition consider consulting an attorney, one well versed in and that loves copyrights law and intellectual property. You can also read publications. One is titled The Copyright Guide A Fiendly Handbook to Protecting and Profiting From Copyrights by Lee Wilson These are some possible information sources of many on the copyrights topic. To get additional information on what copyrights are I suggest you check out this link: U.S. Copyright Office Can you draw a unique animal silhouette, create the unique silhouette in a 2d fixed form such as a black print on white paper. That art you can register for copyright. Go online sign up and register the work, pay the fee. Then you may have to defend the copyrighted image, that is not so easy. But it should be easy to enforce and defend ones copyrights, so if you agree then support the Case Act. You can read a bit about that follow this link CASE Act Stalled in Senate Due to Single Holdout, Says Copyright Alliance ",

            "answer_text": "In principle, yes. If you took a photo of the Grand Canyon, it is your picture. You decided how to frame it, the angle, the time of day, etc. So you can copyright that picture. But the only benefit of copyright is to prevent someone else from using your \u201cart\u201d without permission or payment. Therefore, it must be something sufficiently unique that a judge could tell when someone has used YOUR image, as opposed to having created one from scratch. In fact, it should be sufficiently unique that no one else is likely to have accidentally reproduced an image indistinguishable from yours. The silhouette of a teapot probably won\u2019t cut it. A \u201cgeneric\u201d silhouette of a roadrunner (meep! meep!) may be too simple to copyright. But if no one has used it as a trademark for a business, you might be able to get it trademarked. This would not prevent others from copying and sharing your trademark - but if your business is successful, and a competitor comes along and tries to sell their product or services using your trademarked logo, they could be sued for attempting to pass their poorly made, knock-off products as yours, or attempting to make it appear that their services are endorsed by your company.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll start by assuming this is asked as it applies to the United States. The answer is, yes it can \u2014 but there\u2019s more information needed to say whether that\u2019s true in your case. The most relevant thing you need to read is the concept of threshold of originality. This is what determines whether your silhouette is sufficiently unique to be eligible for copyright protection. And keep in mind, my answer is based on experience in publishing and design, not as an intellectual-property attorney. The protection of an illustration can get complicated depending on how it\u2019s used, its form, and whether it needs to be trademarked. But everything hinges on the threshold of originality, so read up on that. Thanks for the A2A! [Answered: Can an illustration of an animal silhouette be copyrighted?] ",

If it\u2019s just a copy of the Playboy bunny head like we\u2019d all made in plastics back in school, no. The problem is that it\u2019s just too undefined. It could be challenged in court. The copyright office may also reject it. I\u2019d give them a call and ask. It\u2019s only $35 so if you have the money and want to possibly waste it, do it. I\u2019ll be frank. Services like Getty Images make these kinds of things available and they have a big war chest if you ever challenge the on your copyright. Of course if you have a form and a number and they don\u2019t, and their images is a copy of your image, then you could win hands down. If there\u2019s is slightly different and you can match the two up perfectly, you could lose. ",
