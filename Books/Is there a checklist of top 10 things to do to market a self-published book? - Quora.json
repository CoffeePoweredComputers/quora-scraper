            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tough one! and I\u2019m not sure there is a top 10 list. The first thing I would suggest is make sure you deliver a well edited book, try to keep the grammatical and spelling errors down to a minimum. After that it\u2019s kind of like seek and find, how do you make the masses aware of your book, without trying to hard sell it? There\u2019s a key right there as far as I\u2019m concerned. You don\u2019t know me from Adam, but I\u2019m going to let you know right now that I have some pretty good books that you need to check out on Amazon/Kindle. Oh, and by the way if you\u2019ll give me your e-mail address, I\u2019ll add it to my growing collection of people I have permission to bother with my solicitations. How do you like that? what is your reaction to that? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to market your book, but that\u2019s just me. So how do you market your book? You\u2019ve got to make people aware of it, but how? Is there a way to get your self a few die hard fans? Word of mouth is key in the promotion of your book! I\u2019ve advertised give a ways on Craig\u2019s List with mine, it\u2019ll get you a few people, but I think they\u2019re mainly just curious. There is no ironed out straight path to it, but there are plenty of outlets available to getting your book out there. As far as mass appeal, it probably won\u2019t happen over night, write another one! while you\u2019re waiting to be discovered. I started back in January with one e-book. I didn\u2019t light up the skies with sales or anything remarkable, I just kept writing in between setting things up for a digital platform. I almost have that in place, and I have 7 books available on Kindle. I\u2019m still pondering ways to create a means of that stuff going viral, and I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have your platform in place. If you get anything out of this it\u2019s figure out how to go Viral! and have your Digital platform in place! Good Luck! Robert ",

            "answer_text": "The cover should reflect the genre and expectations of the readers of the genre.The blurb should be enticing without giving the plot away or containing back story.The book should be edited and proofread, then continually proofread by the author until no errors are found. (This wont guarantee there are none, but lessen the likelihood.)Especially the first 10% of the book should hook the reader and make them want to read the rest. Part of this is the writing, and part of it is making sure its polished so well, there are no obvious errors visible.There is no point in marketing if the book itself hasn\u2019t been presented properly.Use the backmatter. Advertise your other books there. Solicit joining your mailing list, Amazon, Bookbub and Goodreads follows, your Facebook group and page, Instagram account, etc.Join an author discussion forum and learn where others market for your genre. Learn what they recommend doing, and not doing.The best way of advertising a book, is to write another one in the same series, or a spin off series. You will notice there is no marketing advice in the above. Marketing is what you do last. If get the above wrong, no amount of marketing will work for you. For example, if you get the cover wrong, and the blurb puts people off, or the sample reads badly or contains a lot of obvious errors, your marketing money will be wasted. ",
