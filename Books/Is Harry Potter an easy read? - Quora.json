            "answer_text": "It depends. If you mean is it easy, and filled with little words, no. They are listed as a fourth-sixth reading level on most websites I found. Many children are smart enough for them by third grade, but these are usually \u2018gifted\u2019 children. In the US, most schools tell the parents the child\u2019s reading level, although I don\u2019t know how it works in other countries. Reading levels are basically what grade they would be in for reading. For example, Although I was in 8th grade, I had a College reading level. If you mean is it a pleasant read, with fun scenery and a happy ending, no. The first book is fine, with the beginning half of the book being normal world building. But even that book had hints of abuse and death, and the end has a fair bit of violence and fighting. I love Harry Potter, but it is not for faint of heart. I would get why some schools banned it, if it was for the violence, and not \u2018witchcraft.\u2019 Now, is it worth it? Absolutely. These books are filled with wonder and magic, and are written beautifully. You can feel the emotions through the book, and almost see Hogwarts. It is absolutely beautiful and mysterious, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy it. But get ready to be invested!!! Grade Reading Levels of Harry Potter Books ",

            "answer_text": "I can only assume that the Harry Potter books are easy reading, otherwise they would not be so well received by millions of readers, worldwide, of widely differing reading skills. At the same time, I can\u2019t give a verdict of my own. The schoolboy wizard is not my cup of tea, as they say, and I have no intention of reading him. If you only saw the number of books I still have every intention of reading, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised at what I say. Reading and writing have long been the principal occupations of my working days, in which I can only say there are not sufficient hours - at least, not if one needs to sleep from time to time. So no hard feelings of any kind, but definitely no Harry Potter! ",
