            "answer_text": "If we're talking self publishing, you are the publisher; Amazon KDP, Create Space, Smashwords, Draft2Digital and all other options are distributors. Now that we get that out of the way, yes, it is possible. I live in Asia and have no US or UK citizenship and I publish fiction on as many e-retailers as I can (as of early 2015, GooglePlay and All Romance eBooks, in addition to your usual Amazon, Kobo, Apple, Nook and Smashwords). No charge, each distributor takes a cut from every copy you sell, and they're all on top of things when it comes to taxes and ensuring that they follow the regulations, based on the treaty between countries. It's the one thing you want to prioritize, as far as living outside of US and publishing ebooks are concerned: the taxes. The treaty between my country and the US requires all the distributors to withhold 30% of the royalties, which is a pain, until I provide an EIN. Other than that, everybody welcomes your ebook(s) -- except for Nook (Barnes & Nobles) which does not accept international authors yet. I'm not sure if Kobo does, but I have always distributed my books to Nook, Kobo and Apple via Draft2Digital -- it's just more practical at the moment. Amazon and GooglePlay send money direct to my account; Draft2Digital, Smashwords and ARe pay via PayPal. Amazon and Draft2Digital pay 60 days after the end of the month, GooglePlay pays about a week after, while Smashwords and ARe pay per quarter, 30-45 days after. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, we regularly publish authors from outside of the US or UK. The only requirement (apart from that you are an author we want, of course) is that you can receive money from a US bank into your bank account for your royalties and advance. It's important to remember that a book publishing contract does not constitute an offer of employment. ",
