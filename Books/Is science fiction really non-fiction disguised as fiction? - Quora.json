            "answer_text": "No, at least most of it. One can write popular science \u201cdisguised\u201d as science fiction; this will mostly be targeted at younger audience, to make reading about science more entertaining, but is not what we consider \u201ctop-notch sci-fi\u201d. In good science fiction (say, P.K.Dick, Ursula K. Le Guin, Stanislaw Lem, Iain M. Banks, Octavia E. Butler\u2026) science plays second fiddle, if even that. What interests top sci-fi authors is what any good literature explores, the proverbial human condition. What does it mean to be human, how do we interact, what is \u201cI\u201d, good and evil, love and hatred, what are our prejudices, where do they come from and how can we overcome them\u2026? Thar said, there are sci-fi authors who explore some topics also interesting science, e.g. Greg Egan. But even while he plays, say, with interpretation of quantum mechanics, he is more interested in people punt into his strange worlds. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Fiction is fiction. The characters and plots are made up. Now, some science fiction (not all) does try to extrapolate possible future technology, and good science fiction writers keep up-to-date on science and technology, so advances they present in their fiction may well come to pass. (Indeed, some science fictional technology has inspired real-world advances.) But that\u2019s a far cry from claiming science fiction is non-fiction, which it is not. ",
