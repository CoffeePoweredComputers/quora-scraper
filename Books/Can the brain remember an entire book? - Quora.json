            "answer_text": "Ofcourse yes!!!\u2026.but will need a lot amount of work. The human brain consists of about one billion neurons. Each neuron forms about 1,000 connections to other neurons, amounting to more than a trillion connections. If each neuron could only help store a single memory, running out of space would be a problem. You might have only a few gigabytes of storage space, similar to the space in an iPod or a USB flash drive. Yet neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time, exponentially increasing the brain\u2019s memory storage capacity to something closer to around 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes). For comparison, if your brain worked like a digital video recorder in a television, 2.5 petabytes would be enough to hold three million hours of TV shows. You would have to leave the TV running continuously for more than 300 years to use up all that storage. That indirectly means that\u2026 \u2014- BRAIN HAS THE POWER TO STORE WHOLE INTERNET..!!! \u2014- OUR BRAIN = 25 SUPERCOMPUTERS Hope it helps. ",

Human Brain is the biggest repository that it can store each and every minute of your life in it. It can accommodate all the books from the biggest library in the world and still wont run out of space. Hope you got your answer! ;) ",
