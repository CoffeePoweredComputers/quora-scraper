            "answer_text": "Yes. My philosophy class has been exceptionally easy this semester. One of the reasons is that the class is set up to be easy if you read the book. I chuckle at the grading scale: Essay point scale: 5 = excellent; clear and persuasive 4 = good; could offer a bit more support 3 = OK but superficial 2 = needs improvement; lacking in clarity1 = there were words on the page Even if you are not a great writer, notice that very little is actually about the writing and more about the content? I love classes like this, because reading is the easy part and if you don\u2019t do it, you end up with 3,2, or 1 on the grades. I remember essays on Shakespeare in high school, a quick google comes up with a common one, \u201cWhat is the role of fate in Romeo and Juliet?\u201d Well\u2026 there are four ways you can do this essay. You can read the book and decide yourself.You can read the cliff notes and take their opinion.You can watch the movie and decide from the director\u2019s interpretation.You can bullshit the entire paper.Which of these four do you think are difficult to figure out for the teacher? Do you really think shoveling three pages of BS will not be caught? In the above scale, the highest you are likely to get is that 3 (okay, but superficial), but more likely 1 or 2. Now the teacher most likely has the cliff notes also, so this is seriously a poor choice. The teacher most likely has seen the movie, if only to see what to expect from her students who choose #3 as a path. That leaves #1. There is a 5th choice, and that is called plagiarism. Highly dangerous territory there. Your teacher has google too. So googling grade saving essays? Not a viable choice. Copying your brother/sister\u2019s essay, bad choice. The teacher may or may not remember the entire essay, but it doesn\u2019t take more than a twinge of memory to pull out your sibling\u2019s folder from a past file and peek. Busted. So again that leaves #1. A personal, non-plagiarized view based on the opinion of someone who actually read the literature. Easily recognizable. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to be honest here (this usually means I\u2019m lying). I, as a teacher, would like to think that I can tell when a student hasn\u2019t read a book. I, as a person, who used to be a student who didn\u2019t always read the book, but got As on the tests knows that it\u2019s not always the case. There are 2 important questions here. 1. How deeply is the teacher going to go into the questioning? 2 How do you define reading a book? To answer the first question if the teacher is going to ask thinks like what happened in this chapter, who are are these characters, basic stuff, you might be able to get away without reading the book. You know the characters, you know the plot, know what\u2019s going on and kinda get through the rest. Second question: When I was in college I could speed read a large novel in a very short period of time. I would know the characters, read the first couple chapters to understand what was going on the turn on the speed. Most of the time I could write a good paper about this book. I could answer quiz questions and everything else I needed. Did I thoroughly and completely read the novel and gain a real appreciation for the details and characters ect\u2026.NO. So the answer to your question is somewhere between these 2 answers. Can you guess without any knowledge of a book and get through a test. No. You are going to fail. If you read a good amount of the book, know the characters, know the plot, can you maybe get a good grade, maybe. Read the book. It\u2019s the best way to do well. Anything else is just rolling the dice\u2026.This is my honest answer. I find being honest eliminates all doubts. So if deep down you are thinking that you might be able to fool your teacher, you might be right, but it\u2019s a maybe. Fool some teachers on some days, and some days on some teachers but not all teachers on all the days\u2026 ",

There are factual questions, like \u201cWhat did Romeo do when he first saw Juliet?\u201d, and there are inference questions, like \u201cWhy would Romeo react the way he did when he first saw Juliet?\u201d One question tells us that you read it. The other question tells us that you understood it. Fortunately, for me at least, my students fall into patterns. The ones who didn\u2019t read the first book will be the same ones who don\u2019t read any other book. It makes it easier for me. ",

Then we'd talk about the interpretation. Students don't want to read on their own. Make reading more enjoyable by getting them into character while you have them for the hour. you can have fun and make your reading students want to be in your class.
