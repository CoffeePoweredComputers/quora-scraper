            "answer_text": "Ok, I won't call it a difficult read but yeah complicated. He creates a world for you and you have to enter that world come what may.. He takes care of each and every detail and sometimes it's so minutely detailed that you tend to lose the touch from the main storyline. Another thing is, as I've already said, he creates a world and entering it is quite a task. For example, The first book of Stephen King's The Dark Tower series is the gunslinger. Though, the book is the shortest, yet it would take a hell of a time to get into that world. So the first book is creating a world for you, and by the time you reach the fourth book (Wizard and Glass), which is BTW the longest book in the series, you'll start enjoying the series. Another thing what makes it complicated, saying it as a non American (Indian), are the American terminologies and slangs.. like I, came across many new words like Wonky, Palavar, Guffaw and also phrases like \u201cdoing a joint\u201d and American style of naming the addresses like \u201c22 3rd\u201d or \u201c55 6th\u201d etc. (never been to The USA so sorry if I've named the addresses wrongly). Well, if you are new to reading novels, I won't Suggest you Stephen King. Rather go for J.K. Rowlings or Neil Gaiman. ",

            "answer_text": "His books are not hard to read, but \u201cIt\u201d is way too long. I read half way through it and just abandoned it. This is coming from a guy who reads fifty books a year. \u201cIt\u201d was like reading the Bible\u2026.long. \u201cIt\u201d also repeats the same plots over and over again, with the same characters. Sometimes, King takes you down multiple plots that don\u2019t really have anything to do with the main plot, which is the creepy Clown and how they are going to kill it. ",
