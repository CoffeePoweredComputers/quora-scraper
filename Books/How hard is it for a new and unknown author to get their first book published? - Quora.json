            "answer_text": "Let me tell you a secret. Unknown authors think that the worst position to be in is a new and unknown author. It\u2019s not. The worst position to be in is an author who was published badly. When you are new and unknown, there is a possibility that you are the Next Big Thing. You might be the next Booker prize winner, the Oprah pick of the year, the next mega seller. You probably won\u2019t be, but there is always the possibility. An agent or editor looking at your book will have that at the back of their mind. But if you\u2019ve already been published and didn\u2019t earn out your advance? Or if you self-published and sold less than 100 copies? Yeah, there goes that. This book that you are submitting now might be a much better book, but your previous sales history will be taken into account. Yes, if you are well-known for something else, then it\u2019s an asset. When an Instagram star wants to write a book, publishers do pay attention. But being an Insta star is not essential to write a great book. But don\u2019t assume that you are doomed because you are not already famous. Most novelists are famous for nothing except writing books. That\u2019s their job. ",
