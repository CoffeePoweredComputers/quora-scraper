            "answer_text": "Physically, I think so. However, being an Alpha is all about willpower. Toothless had huge amounts of willpower, particularly when he burst out of that ice in HTTYD2. The Bewilderbeasts had the willpower to enslave dragons, as it were, to bend the minds of other dragons to their will. I don\u2019t know the physics behind Toothless\u2019 \u2018Alpha Mode\u2019 or if it was explained in The Hidden World, but I do know that a lot of what he did was due to his owerwhelming wish to protect Hiccup. If another dragon could find that motivation, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d be able to some pretty special things as well. Particularly Titanwings, which are physically much more powerful and have special features. I do think that it comes much more naturally to species like the Bewilderbeasts, Red Deaths, and Foreverwings, though, since they all seem to be able to control others. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on the situation. If it is like a small pack of dragons, then common dragons like Deadly Nadders, Monstrous Nightmares can be the \u2018Alpha\u2019 or \u2018Leader\u2019. But if we\u2019re talking about the King of Dragons, than its usually species like Bewilderbeasts and Night Furies. The Alpha or King of Dragons usually has special abilities. EXAMPLES:  The photo above shows Toothless\u2019 ability to camouflage. This photo is actually a better example of \u2018Titan\u2019 mode or \u2018Alpha\u2019 mode.  My theory is that Night Furies are the \u2018true\u2019 King of Dragons due to the fact that even Drago\u2019s Bewilderbeast bowed down in respect to Toothless and his Queen. ",

            "answer_text": "No. I wouldn\u2019t say so. Can any species? Probably. I think it depends on the will and strength of the individual dragon. Toothless had what it takes and even though he was most likely the smallest alpha of all, he had to be the best ever. He had all the qualities of a great leader. Loyalty, compassion, determination, and stubborn will. He couldn\u2019t be controlled because those he loved were more and important to him than obeying the whims of a mad man. And that\u2019s what makes a leader, being able to resist and stand against opposition and protect his own. That\u2019s what makes an alpha. ",

And the title Alpha refers to the King of Dragons. Of course there can be queens of the nest who are mostly of the same species but Titan wing. The exception to this was the Red Death which used Some sort of homing signals to partially control the other dragons. ",
