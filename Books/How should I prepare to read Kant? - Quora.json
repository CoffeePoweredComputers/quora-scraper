            "answer_text": "My personal introduction to Kant came from reading James Jeans\u2019 Physics and Philosophy (1943). This book is not about Kant\u2019s philosophy, but briefly discusses his approach to metaphysics in the context of important scientific and philosophical problems. Kant is never an easy read. It is almost necessary to engage the services of a university level instructor. As an alternative you might take a look at the online Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. ",
