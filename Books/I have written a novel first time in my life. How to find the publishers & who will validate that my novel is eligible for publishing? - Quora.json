            "answer_text": "There are two option 1)You can self publish. There are sites like amazon direct publish where you can sell your novels. And there are sites like wattpad, inkitt, iauthor, etc. It is good to build your novel. You can get people to critique your work and you can improve it. You can publish it even now. While it may make you popular, it wont make you rich. At the same time you can experiment with your work. It will be yours and yours only. And if your book is really popular and good publishers come to you with offers. Even here there are sharks you have to be careful about. You can also start your own blog, publish your story there. You can allow google to advertise in you website by adsense for a side income. You will still have to promote your work in social media. 2)There are publishing companies like penguin publishing house, harper collins, etc. You have to keep on pitching. Sometime if you are lucky, yours will be selected. But for any aspiring writer its a long period of waiting and rejection. Its a very very slow process. Once your pitch is accepted, they will professionally help you to edit your novel. They will promote your novel. Basically, the advantage will be their default traffic. You don\u2019t have to work on building that. But its very helpful if you know one or two important people. It may speed up the process. There are also legitimate writing contests that will publish your work and also give you a sum if you win. In between there are sites that offers help if you pay them a small amount. Its a calculated risk. But it will be completely your loss if they failed to help. And there is the matter of plagiarism. They reject you but they use your manuscript without your consent. So be very careful where you submit your works. Because if they acquire a copyright, your will lose badly. ",
