            "answer_text": "Critique for poetry and fiction is quite a bit about what the reader's perception is, namely what their mind sees, the emotion it evokes, the sounds that sing or clunk. A poet should be very interested if the reader stumbles, wanders off in their mind with thoughts about their dog mid love poem, or simply raises an eyebrow, thinking huh? A good way to pass on your mis-connect is to underline parts and say, \"this doesn't evoke an image\", or \"are you missing a verb\", or \"how does this relate?\" Modern poems often are slippery, starting with one idea and slipping into another related memory, but the connection might be clear in the Poet's mind but not the readers, i.e. three images of different places and different people might produce, \"how do these connect?\" Saying so will alert the poet that the imagined guitar music in all three, isn't provided by the poem. A simple, \"how do these relate?\" can provide enough information to a reader. Good clear feedback that is nonjudgmental, i.e. saying \"three dumpy places that mean nothing?\" might step on someone's heart without knowing. Keeping a neutral tone can help a writer/poet stay in the imagined moment during editing, rather then sending them into a rampage or cry. Provide feedback in terms of the intended result, did you smell the flowers, were you dancing along in joy or untouched? Summarize your thoughts and explain what you took away with you during the reading. Provide positives even if you don't understand the overall intent, such as, \"I'm not sure why these images connect for you, but I loved imagining myself in each place, good details.\" ",

            "answer_text": "I don't critique poems for content, but for structure. My most fundamental measure is \"musicality,\" meaning how the lines scan for cadence. If cadence is off for me, I say so. Should I spy a clich\u00e9 I so note. I typically cut and condense with my edits. If you start with exposition or end with a hacknyed summation, I'll ask you to chop all this off at either end. ",
