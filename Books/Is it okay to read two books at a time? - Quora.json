            "answer_text": "Yes and No It\u2019s okay to read two books at a time. Why? Because you might find books more interesting when jumping from one book to another after reading say 50\u201360 pages, and this continuous to and fro shift will make you feel cherished until a time. I\u2019ve done this a several times while reading a classic fiction (Which requires a complete attention) and a spiritual/self-help book. I\u2019d read 20\u201330 pages of a classic fiction and then would read some 150\u2013200 pages of spirituality books, and if I\u2019m reading a general fiction, I\u2019d read 200\u2013300 pages of it and read spirituality books. This thing can be done only when there is a difference of genre. However, It\u2019s only okay, when you\u2019re stuck in a book and want to be quick with reading. It\u2019s not okay to read two books at a time because it might distract you from the plot, characters, moral of the story and what the authors wanted to see. It might happen that you find yourself trying to link a plot of one with another, when there\u2019s no relation between them actually. I haven\u2019t done this for more than 3 books. So, yeah, this is how you go ahead with reading two/three/four books at a time.  When I took this picture, I was reading The God of Small Things (1997 book), Strategy by Harvard Business Review and The Man Who Knew Infinity (book) at a same time. See these all books are of different genres. I think you\u2019d like to read some of my answers on the topic of book, including recommendations too, here. Akshat Solanki's post in Read Something ",

            "answer_text": "I only recommend doing so if you need to do so in order to maintain your interest level. Burnout can be likened to rubbing on your sleeve. For example, if you rub on the same spot on your sleeve, then you will quickly develop a hole. If you, however, constantly change where on your sleeve you are rubbing, then your sleeve will not wear out. The same applies to avoiding burnout when reading. Burned out on a subject? Switch to another subject or another book. What is the problem with reading one book at a time? For many, it is burnout and boredom. Alternating between books has other downsides. This primarily includes confusion. You may quickly become confused if you attempt to read multiple books on one subject. This, however, depends on the type of knowledge you are acquiring. There are two general types of knowledge: Skills-Based: This is acquisition of specific skills that you apply, such as cooking, sales, negotiation, management, public speaking, time management, decision making creativity, etc. These skills need to be deliberately practiced and mastered. This requires constant reference to your notes on the book you have read. Jumping around from book to book for skills-based knowledge can be likened to attempting to master golf and going to a new coach every time. You would likely make slow progress and be confused as hell. Mastering skills-based knowledge requires a structured approach. The true constraint here is not the actual knowledge that is acquired but rather what you do with that knowledge. In other words, the real value provided here is the skills that are developed, not the knowledge that is acquired. To do this requires constant review and practice of the material you learned. If you are constantly jumping around from book to book or subject to subject then you will be terribly confused and will never develop any skills. Instead, you will end up burnt out and overwhelmed.Knowledge-Based: Knowledge-based knowledge is different. Here, you can jump around and jumping around (from book to book, or subject to subject) often increases your progress. Why? Knowledge-based knowledge accumulates and compounds quicker than skills-based knowledge because it is rooted in knowledge, not the acquisition of skills. For example, if you alternate reading between 10 different books on economics, then you will slowly integrate this knowledge into a holistic understanding of the topic. Authors in this genre also tend to explain complex topics using different perspectives and analogies. Jumping around on a complex topic can help you develop a more holistic viewpoint and can help increase your understanding of a complex topic when you are stuck. Additionally, this type of knowledge tends to be more objective than skills-based knowledge. Skills-based knowledge is more subjective (Ex: there are thousands of management techniques and all have their merit). For example, if you are attempting to learn the rudiments of venture capital, then I recommend picking up 10 books on the subject. Stuck on one book? Move to the next because the author may explain the concepts differently either using different terminology or a different perspective. As you read through the books, the knowledge you have previously gained will be more thoroughly integrated because many of the points in knowledge-based books are repeated in each book and thus you have the benefit of repetition. Skills-based books on the other hand often present entirely new concepts and methods so if you jump around here then confusion will result.Summary: Skills - Acquiring skills requires practice and developing habits. Skills-based knowledge is highly subjective. This learning must be more structured. Stick to one book or collection of books at a time. Develop a cohesive plan and then practice the skills over and over again. Reading multiple books = confusion.Knowledge - Knowledge-based knowledge is more objective. This knowledge is cumulative. Jump around all you want. Reading multiple books = a holistic understanding.For skills-based knowledge (sales, time management, etc.), you have a few options: Read and master one book at a time.Read several books at a time with the initial goal being comprehension (not retention). Once you are done reading the books, then you can review the books and develop a cohesive plan that ties all of the knowledge from the books together. For example, I often read 5\u201310 (or 20\u201330) books on a topic. I might pick up 10 books for example on time management. I quickly read all 10 books and highlight them in Kindle. Once I am done, then I have my assistant extract the notes to an MS Word document. I then organize the notes into one cohesive strategy and practice the skills until I burn them into my subconscious.For knowledge-based knowledge (Economics, Social Sciences, Political Science, etc.), jump around all you want. It may help you. On a side note, you must take notes on skills-based books, unless you are one of those geniuses that can read a book and remember everything verbatim. With that being said, audio books do not work well for developing skills-based knowledge, unless you take notes or read the book and highlight it. ",
