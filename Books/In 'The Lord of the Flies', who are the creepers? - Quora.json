            "answer_text": "Creepers in a literal term are vines. Metaphorically, they could symbolise society's grasp on the boys. This could be seen when Jack was cutting at the creepers with his knife, which could show how society was already losing its grip on him. Or in the beginning when Piggy was caught in the creepers, society to him was his aunt, and his aunt probably wouldn't want him to chase after Ralph \"on account of his asthma\". So the creepers don't really symbolise one specific person. They symbolise society, and sometimes they are literally just vines that get in the way. ",
