            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that he was not always as disabled as he is today. Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 1963. The doctors initially gave him two years to live but the disease's onset was not as rapid as they had expected. Two years later, he was still walking, albeit with a stick. Hawking was married to his first wife, Jane Wilde, on the 14th of July 1965. As can be seen in the photo, he was using a stick at that time but still relatively able.  The couple had their first son, Robert (b.\u20091967) and then first daughter Lucy (b.\u20091970). He did not start using a wheelchair until the end of the 1960's so he would probably have been able to perform in bed in a relatively normal manner. The couple's third child Timothy (b.\u20091979) was born significantly later. At the end of the 1970's, Hawking's disability had progressed to the point that he was finding it difficult to speak and be understood. However, he had not lost complete control of his body. He was still able to drive his wheelchair. I wouldn't care to imagine, but since this is what the question asked, you might imagine that nocturnal activity was still possible but with his wife taking the lead. ",

            "answer_text": "There is subtext here people are missing.  Non-disabled people think, to one degree or another,  and at some time or another, that:  1) people with disabilities  are not physically capable of sex. 2)   no one would/should want to have sex with people with disabilities. 3)  if people with disabilities have sex it's probably with other people with disabilities. 4)  people with disabilities should not be allowed to have sex because it's medically unwise, or exploitative/abusive.  5) people with disabilities shouldn't reproduce because it would lead to more people with disabilities and/or they are incapable of being proper parents. I've been quadriplegic for 31 years. Of all my achievements (successful businesses, civil rights legislation, founder of a charter school,  founder of the Pomona Arts Colony) it is the fact that I am married and have four children that garners the most surprise and questions.  It is the ignorance and bigotry inherent in the list above that drives such dismay. I've had close friends and family confess their prejudice in this regard. As a sociology undergraduate, I studied it. As a civil rights activist, I've fought against it. Hell, before my accident (and sadly for several more years), I bought into it too. It is pervasive and largely unchallenged. Before anybody leaps to deny there is such prejudice against people with disabilities,  that we have made incredible progress in legal protections for, and cultural acceptance of, people with disabilities, I agree there has been progress.  However, I think few people understand the full scale and seriousness of the problem.   Disbelieving peoples' sexuality questions their humanity and disputes their value.  We literally aren't human without our sexuality.  Taking it away with ignorance or intent dehumanizes  us and has led to everything from asinine questions on Quora to the Nazis' First Genocide (a quarter million people with disabilities executed and the technology for the Holocaust perfected, all so that nobody who had \u201ca life not worth living\u201d would suffer the burden of breathing). Does that sound like an overreach? Every couple of years or so a sterilization scandal erupts revealing that large numbers of people with disabilities have been abused and maimed to prevent them from having sex and children. These are crimes against humanity, acts of hate and rehearsals of genocide that are rarely punished. Every year a judge or two makes the news by taking children away from their disabled parents, stating that it's obvious a blind, or paralyzed, or deaf parent can't be trusted to care for their children. Every year hundreds of judges and officials and doctors and educators undermine our parental rights/reproductive coverage/sex education/sexual health services/birth control/etc. but have the manners not to point to a disability as justification.  These are not medieval or even 20th century problems; this is current. When my wife and I first tried to adopt, multiple agencies tried to discourage us arguing that my disability  meant I was incapable of properly caring for a child, that it wouldn't be fair to a child to have a father that couldn't do many fatherly things, and even, maybe God didn't intend for me to have a child. When we had two of our children the traditional way, one agency actually disputed this, insisting that our two biological children must've been adopted making us, according to their policy, ineligible of having anymore.  (We eventually found an \"alternative\" agency that valued all sorts of parents and  matched us with our other two sons.) Now, if you will excuse me, I am in the mood to go upstairs and have a nooner with my wife. That's not really news, I know. Every person with a disability I have ever met has had a sex life. In fact, I suspect every  HUMAN BEING I've ever met is sexual.  But maybe I should pose a Quora question, just to make sure. DO NON-DISABLED PEOPLE HAVE SEX, OR DO THEY JUST HAVE A LOT LESS BECAUSE OF ALL THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATES THEY IGNORE? ",
