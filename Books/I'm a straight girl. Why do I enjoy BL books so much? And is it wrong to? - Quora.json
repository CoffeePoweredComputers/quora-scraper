            "answer_text": "it more depends why you enjoy those books. why do you have a preference of mlm over straight couples or wlw couples? do you find hetero love stories typical and boring, and the storylines of mlm to be a lot more engaging? are you bored of hetero relationships in media in general and feel like this is something new? do you find mlm couples more attractive than straight ones, and enjoy reading about two people of the same gender you\u2019re attracted to more than only one? which is also why you dont seem to be into wlw stories? do you like the characters themselves and find that you just like them together the same way you\u2019d like a straight couple? in my opinion, of course it\u2019s not wrong to appreciate a mlm relationship in writing. but if you only like reading about boys doing weird sexual shit because you think it\u2019s hot, that\u2019s not good at all. that\u2019s fetishizing a whole group of people and that\u2019s disgusting. it\u2019s just the opposite of the idea of typical straight guys watching lesbian porn. so tldr: figure out why you enjoy these books, because it\u2019s not wrong to like a gay relationship, but it is wrong to fetishize it.
