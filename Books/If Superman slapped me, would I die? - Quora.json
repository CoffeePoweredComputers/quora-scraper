            "answer_text": "If Superman slapped you with all the force he possibly could, yes you would die instantly.   The thing about Superman is that he is very aware of how strong he is and is constantly holding back as much as he can in any situation.  There are several villains he has gone all out against (Doomsday, Darkseid, Mongul, etc.), but when he recognizes that he only needs a fraction of his strength to take out a bad guy, he is able to hold himself back. If Superman was to see you as a threat, then he would make sure to slap you only hard enough to stop you, nothing more. ",

            "answer_text": "If Superman slapped you, it would only be because you ABSOLUTELY deserved it. But the guilt you would feel afterwards would be even more powerful than the actual physical sting, because even if you did deserve it, Superman wouldn\u2019t do it full force, and would feel bad about it afterwards too. So you\u2019d both stand there feeling guilty. But Superman would probably offer to buy you some ice cream afterwards, so it\u2019s okay. ",
