            "answer_text": "To answer that homework question, you need to look at The Aeneid in the section in which Aeneas visits the underworld and chats with his deceased father, Anchises. After a long catalog of future Roman heroes, generals, leaders, and orators, Anchises pauses his speech. He does a quick contrast between the skills of Rome and the skills of the Greeks and Persians. He indicates other people will be good at sculpture, or oratory, or astronomy. However, Romans will have one special talent that they are best at, which defines them uniquely. For the first time in the poem, Virgil refers to Aeneas and the Trojan people as Romans specifically, after they hear their mandate from Jupiter. Read that section, and you\u2019ll see what Virgil thinks it means to be a Roman. ",
