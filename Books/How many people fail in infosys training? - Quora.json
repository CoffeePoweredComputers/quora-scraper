            "answer_text": "It is all based on the individual's performance and no partiality will be seen during training stages by Infosys. I don't know everything but something about the policy because I was at the verge of getting kicked out and I cleared all my papers only during third attempt. In my batch there were 700 students and out of them 14 got out of Infy during Infy, the batch next to me had a total of 300+ and in that 22 were sent out. So you want to sustain you want to work your ass off and guarantee your job in Infosys. Infosys training is one of the toughest training compared to other IT companies but you can clear it once you get the concepts. You get three attempts to prove yourselves and if you can't you need to go out and the pass mark is 65 out of 100. This is for generic training. When you enter stream pass mark will be 50 but the barrier over here is you need to get 65+ as an average of all stream exams. Not having an average of 65? You are out. My friends average was 63.5 and no soft corner was taken and he was sent out. Just remember \" When the going gets tough, the tough gets going\". All the best ! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the person himself. Infosys will try their level best not to fail you. In my batch in 2018, no one really failed the training except few who wanted to fail because they got a good job offer somewhere else. They give you three chances to pass the exam and the level of exam drops after every re-test that means you will find easier problems to solve in your retests. As I told you, Infosys will try their level best to help you to successfully complete your training. But, if you don't want to pass then it's not in their hands. So, I will give you one 'guru mantra' just be focused in the class when they are teaching otherwise you will struggle and you will have to give extra hours, when everyone else will be enjoying. So it's better to focus during the class and complete your assignments. Wish you all luck for your training in Mysore, it's a happening place. So, enjoy yourself there and don't be much worried about the exams and tests, just be focused you will pass all the exams easily. Cheers \u2764\ufe0f ",
