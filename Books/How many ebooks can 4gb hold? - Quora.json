The space requirement isn\u2019t going to be an issue any time soon. The 2 GB edition can roughly store up to 1,100 books, of which some of the space is used for the system software (including the OS). An added 2 GB in the 4 GB edition increases the amount of books to roughly 2100, considering every book is on an average 1.5 MB in size. Consider 1 MB size files, we get close to 3150 books. ",
