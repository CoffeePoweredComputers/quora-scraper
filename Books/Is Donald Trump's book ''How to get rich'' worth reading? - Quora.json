            "answer_text": "According to experts like Warren Buffet, had Trump spent all his working life sitting around and watching TV, having put his father\u2019s money into a Tracker Fund, he would now be billions richer. So he has worked all his life, cheated people throughout his career, and yet managed to destroy his own potential wealth to the tune of billions. Minus x billion is a pretty bad return on a lifetime\u2019s work. My aunt was a nurse, she married a diver. They both worked hard, bought a house with some land, and eventually they sold a bit of the land for housing, and now they have a fair amount of money. Trump, on the other hand, in effect lost billions. My aunt\u2019s book would probably be of more use - but she hasn\u2019t written one, and would think the idea was a joke! Pity Trump doesn\u2019t have the same humility. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps for entertainment purposes, but that's about it. By any practical measure, Donald Trump is a disaster of a businessman and a terrible investor.  He inherited a lot of money, and then proceeded to lead many companies into bankruptcy, and basically single handidly destroyed several others, including the USFL.  Donald Trump\u2019s Less-Than-Artful Failure in Pro Football  Donald Trump started rich, and as a businessman never proved any talent in getting rich...with one BIG exception. Like Kim Kardashian, The Donald is an expert in self promotion.  And self promoters can enrich themselves, massively, in today's world.  Self promotion on that scale, however, is fleeting and not easily taught, and of little practical use for the rest of us non-celebrities. ",
