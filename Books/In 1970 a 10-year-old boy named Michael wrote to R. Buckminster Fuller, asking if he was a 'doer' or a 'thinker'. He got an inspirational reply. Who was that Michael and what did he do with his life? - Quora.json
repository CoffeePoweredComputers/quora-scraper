He works in partnership with leaders and workgroups, offering insight and resources for planning, organizing, implementing, documenting and evaluating organization development, learning and change. Anyways this is a copy of the letter Fuller send back to the 10 yr-old Michael. Dear Michael, Thank you very much for your recent letter concerning \u201cthinkers and doers. \u201dThe things to do are: the things that need doing: that you seeneed to be done, and no one else seems to see need to be done. Thenyou will conceive your own way of doing that which needs to be done \u2014 that no one else has told you to do or how to do it. This will bring out the real you that often gets buried inside a character that has  acquired a superficial array of behaviors induced or imposed by others on the individual. Try making experiments of anything you conceive and are intensely interested in. Don\u2019t be disappointed if something doesn\u2019t work. That is what you want to know \u2014 the truth about everything \u2013and then the truth about combinations of things. Some combinations  have  such logic and integrity that they can work coherently  despite non-working elements embraced by their system. Whenever you come to a word with which you are not familiar, find it in the dictionary and write a sentence which uses that new word. Words are tools \u2014 and once you have learned how to use a tool  you will never forget it. Just looking for the meaning of the word is not enough. If your vocabulary is comprehensive, you        can  comprehend both fine and large patterns of experience. You have what is most important in life \u2014 initiative. Because of it, you wrote to me. I am answering to the best of my capability. You will find the world responding to your earnest initiative.Sincerely yours,Buckminster Fuller Source: michaelherman.com (links to: http://michaelherman.com) ",
