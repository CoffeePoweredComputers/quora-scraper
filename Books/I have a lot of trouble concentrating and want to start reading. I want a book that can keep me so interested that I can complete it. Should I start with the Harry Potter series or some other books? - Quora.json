            "answer_text": "If you have problems in concentrating with Harry Potter then you are in trouble indeed.  I CANNOT QUITE BELIEVE IT ACTUALLY . If you are sure you like reading and want to pursue it then I will suggest that don't compare your reading speed with anyone. Some people like to finish the book when they start it (I belong to this group. It is not a healthy life I do not recommend this - I once stayed up for two days straight finishing Gone with the Wind). Others prefer to read more slowly and over time. Retention is the key  As long as you can remember what you had read previously when you start reading again, it is not really a problem. As you keep reading, eventually your concentration will improve and so will your speed.  While Harry Potter is really gripping - if you are having problems with sustaining your interest I suggest picking up a smaller book. Try reading the classics like Lord of the Flies or Robinson Crusoe or if you like fantasy then a smaller series like The Hunger Games is also not a bad idea.  A really good book is The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime - it is a very engaging book and comparatively simple to read and quite thin as well.  Science Fiction is fascinating as well.  Try Brave New World by Aldous Huxley.  Do not despair Reader ! This is the most rewarding journey you have undertaken and now you must be brave and keep at it !  If you comment and let me know what kinds of books you like, I am sure I could recommend something which you might want to invest your time in. ",
