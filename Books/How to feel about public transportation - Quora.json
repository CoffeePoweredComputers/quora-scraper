            "answer_text": "I think public transportation is a \u201cpublic good\u201d which is worthy of government support for the following reasons: 1). Relieves automobile traffic congestion. 2). Where dedicated rights of ways are available (and even lesser efforts along the lines of bus lanes and traffic signals preferential to buses) public transport can get people to work much faster giving citizens more free time to spend with family, community and other worthwhile pursuits. This is especially true with rail transport on dedicated rights of way such as subway, commuter rail and elevated rail. Many light rail systems (such the PAT light rail in Pittsburgh\u2019s South Hills) have a majority of their trackage on dedicate rights of way with limited amounts of street running (i.e., Beechview). 3). Generally less air pollution per passenger mile. 4). Less land usage per passenger mile. 5). Offers transportation alternatives to those unable to afford a private automobile. 6). Allows many who do own cars to use them on an occasional rather than a daily basis. Also precludes the need for a second car and/or a loner when one\u2019s auto is in the shop. (These two both (as well as almost all the others) applied to me when I lived in a Pittsburgh neighborhood (Shadyside) and worked in downtown Pittsburgh). Hopefully other Quorans will offer more supporting reasons as well. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on where do you stay. If at all you feel that public transportation takes equal amount of time in case you take your personal vehicle I would really encourage it. You will save money and a lot of it and I think you will come across many different people. Sometimes it is also possible that you are a regular traveler with some other people and you have your own group. Well, I have seen this case in India. Apart from that, government encourages public transportation for several reasons. If more people will use public transportation, lesser will be the pollution, lesser will be the traffic, higher will be your savings, it will be easy to manage the city and so on. Let me give you an example of Mumbai.   You can see the number of people travelling on local trains even if there is no space? Why? well, Mumbai is densely populated and so the traffic on roads is very dense. People use local trains because it helps them to reach their destination in less than one fourth the time when they will travel using their own vehicle or taxi. Rich, middle class as well as poor people use these trains. And it is never bad, because you are saving your time and your money. You should use these facilities because you are paying taxes. ",
