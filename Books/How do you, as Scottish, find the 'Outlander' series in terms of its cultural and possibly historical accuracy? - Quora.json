            "answer_text": "Original Question: \u201cHow do you, as Scottish, find the \"Outlander\" series in terms of its cultural and possibly historical accuracy?\u201d I\u2019m a fan, and not only because Jamie Fraser is incredibly sexy in a kilt. Dinna fash, Sassenach. Read on and I\u2019ll explain why.  I work part time as a tour guide at a Scottish Castle (Castle Fraser, no less) and my interest in the Jacobites long predates that of Diana Gabaldon. I stress that the observations and opinions I give in this answer are entirely my own and in no way represent my employer. Around about 2014, I began noticing that a very significant proportion of our overseas visitors were enthusiastic Outlander fans. Hardly any of my fellow Scots had even heard of Outlander back then. The show had not been on UK television and the reasons for this are themselves interesting. Follow the \u201cFurther Reading\u201d link after this answer discover why. Anyway, given that our visitor numbers were up at least 10% and approximately 80% of our foreign visitors loved the series, I consider it my professional responsibility to find out what they found so enthralling. I started with the books, then watched the TV series when it was release on DVD. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books and most of the first three TV series (until the plot moved to the Caribbean and New World and got a bit silly). Some of my fellow Scottish history buffs are rather dismissive of Outlander, but many of them have never bothered to actually read the books or watch the series. I have. In my opinions, Outlander is generally very well researched and it is historical fiction not a historical documentary or academic textbook. On almost all counts, Outlander gets the setting and context for the story right, or near enough so, to thoroughly please me. I do take issue with the portrayal of Bonnie Prince Charlie, who although poorly advised and naive, must have been very charismatic to be so beloved of the Jacobite soldiers who followed him and Highland Scots who protected him after Culloden. Outlander is a great introduction to this period in history, and real fans can then delve further into actual historical sources. I love meeting fans of Outlander at my work. They are informed and enthusiastic, which is a great for me as a guide. I can explain the real history and link this to the actual Jacobite supporting family who once lived at Castle Fraser. I also believe that the books and TV show capture something genuine of the spirit and culture of modern Scotland. The dry wit, the sense of community, the gorgeous scenery and the cadence of the Scottish tongue. So feel free, be my guest, enjoy Outlander. You have my full support in doing so. Scotland is every bit as wonderful at those books make it seem.
