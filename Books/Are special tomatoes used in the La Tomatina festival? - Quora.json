            "answer_text": "Yes, they have to be very ripe tomatoes. The city of Bu\u00f1ol will provide you with enough tomatoes. You do not have to bring them, anyway. You can read my answer to other question about the Tomatation of Bu\u00f1ol: All you have to do is to Google la tomatina and read lots of pages about The Famous Tomatation of Bu\u00f1ol, Spain. When I was younger I never heard about this Tomatation of Bu\u00f1ol. I do remember when they started to show them on the news on TV. It looked very funny. If you want to go there have a happy tomatation. Don\u2019t forget to wear safety goggles. Or swimming goggles. Or diving goggles. ",
