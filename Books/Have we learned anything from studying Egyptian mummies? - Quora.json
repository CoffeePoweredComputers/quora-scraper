            "answer_text": "Well, we learnt of what diseases they may have died. Some wealthy folks were overweight and some died of a clogged artery. We found out that Tutankhamun died of a necrotic foot and broken knee combined with malaria. Some were murdered like Takabuti and Ramses III, the latter having his throat sliced by his own son. Some died of tuberculosis. I am not an expert in epidemiology, but I guess it is important what kind of diseases the ancient people had from an evolutionary point of view. Molecular evidence for tuberculosis in an ancient Egyptian mummy We learnt that they had bad teeth, because they would eat bread which had sand in it. Where there is sand everywhere, there is sand also in wheat. They would see a lot abscesses at the CT scans. Unlike a popular belief, they didn\u2019t have good dentists, nor did they perform dental surgeries. A very interesting thing is that they used sunscreen to protect them from the desert sun, made from \u201cextracts of rice, jasmine, and lupine plants whose products are still used in skin care today\u201d. Sunscreen - Wikipedia Another interesting aspect is that for example, remains from the worker village around the pyramids had their broken bones mended and healed, thus the Egyptian medics were quite good at that time and also it implies that the pyramids weren\u2019t built by lower class people like slaves, but Egyptian people. Giza Secret Revealed: How 10,000 Pyramid Builders Got Fed [The] meat-rich diet, along with the availability of medical care (the skeletons of some workers show healed bones), would have been an additional lure for ancient Egyptians to work on the pyramids. \"People were taken care of, and they were well fed when they were down there working, so there would have been an attractiveness to that,\" A female mummy was found with a prosthetic toe made of wood that was actually pretty comfortable when replicated in modern times and worn by participants in the experiment.  3,000-Year-Old Wooden Toe Prosthetic Discovered on Egyptian Mummy This is what I know of, there are certainly more.
