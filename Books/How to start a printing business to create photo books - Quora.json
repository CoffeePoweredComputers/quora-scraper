            "answer_text": "I looked into it. My concept was to create albums for athletes and dancers. You can think of it as private Sports Illustrated. Printing is the easy part. I had sufficient photography skill, but that is not too common. Shooting pictures of athletes in motion in dim lighting is hard. Until recently, SLRs were loud cameras, but now we have comparable mirrorless cameras that are quiet. Your clients would need to be willing to pay you a lot of money and you would be competing with existing photographers. I would have needed to charge several hundred dollars per client. Video is cheaper, but a good photo can evoke emotional response better. You would need to find people who believe in that and who have enough money to pay for this level of service. I would have started in the dance and fitness communities to help them document achievements. There would be an overflow into martial arts and other sports later. As far as final printing, there are many printers who would make your lay flat photobooks. That is a success problem thanks to the weddings industry. ",
