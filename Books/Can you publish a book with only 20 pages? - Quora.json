            "answer_text": "Yes, even shorter books were published in the past. Most are not called a \u201cbook\u201d, though, but \u201cbooklet\u201d or even \u201cpamphlet\u201d. The major risk for short books is that they can get negative reviews, only due to their length. Not many people look at the page count, before ordering a book. If books in your category are usually much longer, you risk people complaining about the length of the booklet they bought from you. But if you want to try and publish a book with only twenty pages, you could read how this can be done here: Thomas P. Buehner's answer to Is there a minimum number of pages needed to be called a book or can a book be written with just 5 pages? ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking from experience, I have once published a 35 pages book which people call a \u201cChapbook\u201d. But I wasn\u2019t actually satisfied with the length when it was printed, it seemed so short and small. So I just sat there asking myself this \u201cIf I was a reader, would I really consider buying a book this thin?\u201d and the answer came to no surprise.. NO! Then I unpublished it, took my full time and worked on what I would call a real book. It\u2019s a 110 pages book, which I\u2019m 100% satisfied with. What I\u2019m saying here is that you should put yourself in a readers\u2019 shoes, think about how it would look and do not rush into making something you may regret later. By the way, I\u2019m talking about certain genres. If it\u2019s a poetry collection or a novel then that\u2019s what you should consider, yet if it\u2019s a children book then I have no idea how it works. Remember that the main goal is to be happy and proud of writing something out, and a book is really a thing. Hope I could be helpful, and best of luck! ",

One of the most successful book series by Penguin was their Ladybird series of children\u2019s books, many of them around 20 pages. Poetry is often published in a format called a chapbook, which contains 20 to 30 pages. ",

Your imagination and sensibility as an author will decide what your book is meant for. However, some standard industry guidelines are necessary to be understood. We at Exceller books always advise authors to write at least 50 pages to give the book a publishable size and thickness because the feel (along with the content) is equally important. If you need expert guidance to publish your book, we will be glad to help you with whatever you require for your book from editing to printing, distribution and promotion. . ",

I think Amazon allows you to publish stories as long as they\u2019re at least 2500 words, which I know doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but a lot of erotic stories are shorter, even though they\u2019re mostly 5000, which would be\u2026 20 pages?
