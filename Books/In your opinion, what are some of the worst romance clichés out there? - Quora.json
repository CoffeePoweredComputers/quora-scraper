Oh dear, this trope is all the rage in teenage romance stories, and I\u2019m so sick of it. Admiring your love interest is fine. Constantly gushing about them for over 20 episodes is not.Love at first sight. Not sure if this exists in real life, but the way it happens in films and books is really really dumb.Pair the spares. A and B are the main characters who, unsurprisingly, get together in the end. Each has a suitors, C and D, who become a couple afterwards, without any believable development.Stalking is love and Romanticized abuse. These two should be self-explanatory.",
