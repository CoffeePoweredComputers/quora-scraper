            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s in digital format convert it to PDF file and upload it to Ingram Spark and ask for the NO PUBLISH UPC instead of the ISBN. It has the same $50 fee, plus printing, tax and shipping charges. You can get as many copies as you want, but it won\u2019t be formally published (although do realize that according to the Copyright office is you let go of copies beyond family and friends, to people you don\u2019t know, it is technically considered published). You still need to format the book into some type of shape and size. If you do it straight out of the computer it would be 8.5 x 11. If you don\u2019t MIRROR the images it will be single page with blank on the back. If you don\u2019t put a PAGE NUMBER insert into either the header of footer in the center of it, you will NOT have page numbers. If you don\u2019t write a table of contents with page numbers you won\u2019t have a contents page. You have to use PARAGRAPH to indent or put lines between your paragraphs. You have to INSERT PAGE BREAK between each chapter or grouping or the title pages or they will all be meshed together. Those are things YOU have to do or YOU have to pay someone to do for you. Otherwise they will print it as it is. Now, once you make the PDF (all word processors do that) you can look through it on your computer screen and THAT is exactly how the INSIDE of your book will look. Like it or change it. You can change it\u2019s size, rearrange things, change margins, make chapter headings bold and large. Make another PDF until you look through it and like it. That\u2019s your book. That\u2019s how it will look when it comes back bound from Ingram Spark, except they will put a soft or hard cover over it. It must be at least a few pages in size, as they can\u2019t print very small, thin books. You must have a COVER separate in PDF, front (on the right) and back (on the left) if you want a cover. And it has to fit the TEMPLATE the give you. It can just say the title or MY BOOK on the front and nothing on the back or spine. If you want writing on the spine you have to do that with a Paint Program and the book has to be thick enough for a spine. Probably 35 - 40 pages. Otherwise it\u2019s stapled, no spine. If you want a picture it can\u2019t be copyrighted. A selfie of you is okay. A selfie of your house is ok. A selfie of your garden is okay. A picture of your kids birthday that you took is ok. They\u2019ll put a UPC on the back cover. Probably so they can bill it to you. $50, plus $5 for a black and white paperback to 300 pages, or $10 for a full color book of 300 pages or $20 for a hardbound (cloth or plastic) book. Plus $2 handling. Plus $4\u2013$6 shipping. Plus sales tax on the total amount. So you\u2019re looking at $62-$82 for the FIRST book and $12 to $30 for a second copy. If you order more at the same time they would be cheaper because of shipping and handling. Larger or smaller books will change the price in either direction by $1-$5. 800 pages is probably the largest you can go. There might be a minimum number of pages. Ingram Spark. They\u2019re on the internet and advertising! Alternative. Go to Staples copy center with your digital file, have them print it out on regular typing paper and get one of those plastic covers with the slide on gizmo to hold them together. Probably cost you $10 to $30 that way. You\u2019ll have it the same day. Just won\u2019t look like a book, look more like a school report. ",

Your work needs to be in the form of a \u201cpress\u201d copy and a type setting company can help you with that. Be sure that your book has been proof read at least before you get your press copy. You don\u2019t want to be embarrassed by spelling mistakes from future readers. Good luck! ",
