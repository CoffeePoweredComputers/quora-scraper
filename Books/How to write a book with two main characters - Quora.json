            "answer_text": "I might be qualified to answer this, since I\u2019m working on a 2-Protagonist story myself for a long time. I have thought about this subject a lot and learned crucial insights. But I shall reveal it in the last. So lets begin, shall we? There are not one multiple ways of doing it but it all boils down to : What kind of book you are aiming to write here? For example : Are the two main characters separated by space-time? A story of that sort might have a plot like this: Time:A leader of an allied army unit fights through the beaches of Normandy to streets of Berlin. A journalist retraces their steps in modern time in search of what he believes to be a hidden Nazi treasure.A series of crimes committed years ago, had a sole witness/survivor lost in time. His story deals with how he hid himself/survived. A detective starts investigating a series of murders in modern times that are remarkably similar in nature and finds out about the witness.SpaceTwo superpowers are at the brink of a war. There are Missing nuclear weapons in play. A leader of an elite Special Forces team hunts for the missing weapons in remote hostile territory. Meanwhile a Spy in home country tries to buy time by managing the affairs diplomatically, keeping tempers cool and investigating the case with the aim of finding the real culprits.Or using the same premise it could be two spies in rival countries, investigating the cases from their respective sides and according to material/resources/information available to them. Through their \u2018spy stuff\u2019 they each come to \u2018sense\u2019 that someone on the other side is doing exactly what they are: trying to prevent a war. They seek each other out, arrange a meeting, compare notes and then mount a joint operation to bring the culprits to justice.Or better yet, invert the whole thing. Have the two Chief Advisers of their respective \u2018Current Administration/King\u2019, be angry and disgusted for a variety of reasons. Have them misguide the Leader and destabilize the country from within, goad them into waging war with rival country. Have these \u2018Advisers\u2019 realize that someone from the other side is trying to do the same. They seek each other out, compare notes, shake hands, and together bring down the two unbeatable Superpowers in an years long brutal war, ravaging everything the countries stood for and when nothing\u2019s left, together they walk into sunset, finally at peace.Hell, it could literally be space. Make it a sci-fi and show how in a crisis the two main characters, living on 2 different planets, with different social/political/economical conditions, respond. Are the two main characters fighting on the opposite sides? Each could have his own backstory as well as current actions affecting the other in ongoing conflict. Or introduce a time element here and have them recount the events of a war long lost/won.  Or, instead of war, it could simply be a normal, innocent teen romance where boy-meets-girl but both have a series of misunderstandings (happening naturally/or facilitated explicitly) by a string of naive/jealous friends. So that both main characters have quite different interpretation of same events and decide to hate each other before coming together for their happily ever after. Or, a romance where before that happily ever after, the story is told from one character\u2019s POV but after, it was told by another till death do them part.  Or you could make it about a guy on loose accused of serial-killing (I know, I love conflict like these, rather than petty, unnecessary, boring romance - I mean why not just eat the girl who annoys you so much, right?), Anyway, the serial killer could actually be in it just so he could have revenge on all those who did him wrong. The other main character could be the guy who betrayed him, who must now be showed as a new boss of his old organization - or the FBI officer hunting him down. Or hey, make it about all three!  In my own story, a spy-thriller I\u2019m working on for 5 years now, the polite and nice anti-hero returns home and starts working under a mutual friend of the brash and arrogant Hero - who secretly works for Military Intelligence. Conflict flares up between the two but they develop a mutual respect of sorts; the hero returns to active duty where he learns the guy might be a Cyber Warfare expert/mass-manipulator, Hero gets suspended from active duty (its a cover) and returns home himself, to spy on his newest best friend. Note that my two protagonists are not separated by space-time, which is the easiest method to implement. They work on opposite sides, yes, but their real actions are hidden. So open conflict is hard to implement. Plus, the interaction between the two is constant, not just one or two occasions, because they meet daily at lunch and at other occasions. So actions of one is going to affect another. Their lives are intertwined very closely.  lessons I learned while writing 2-protagonist story: If space-time separation convenience isn\u2019t present, and there are no 3rd party villains - a common cause or a common enemy they can unite against, Implementing conflict becomes very hard. A lot of mysteries/thrillers work because we don\u2019t usually know what\u2019s going on in the mind of the villain. If we get to know that, after every alternate chapter or even scene, you can bet you are going to scratch a lot of your head, and hair down in frustration.Be prepared to have a longer novel, if you\u2019re serious about being fare to both of them. Now you\u2019re gonna have to worry about not 1 but 2 different backstories, pros, cons, key weaknesses, triggers, fears, relationships, mindset, language use, skills and motives. It\u2019ll stretch. For example: This is my first ever attempt at writing anything but in five years, I have written maybe 6,50,000 words total \u2014 how much more will follow and how much of them are going to end in the final manuscript is something I still don\u2019t know. Admittedly its getting divided in different parts but you know\u2026Interaction, or atleast effect of action by one on another is a must to keep the story intriguing. Unless time separation is at play.Balancing them is yet another aspect which is subtle yet crucial ingredient of this complicated recipe. A symmetry of sorts is needed. Even if its opposite of sorts. Taking my story for example, The villain is a computer genius, but the hero doesn\u2019t know sh*t about technology unless its social media. Villain doesn\u2019t like socializing (he can manipulate people in order to make them like him or to make them do certain things) but its not something he enjoys, and he\u2019s especially awkward around girls. The hero, on the other hand, is basically the super aggressive Alpha male with lots of friends idolizing him and women swooning over, but he has trouble seeing the larger picture, the greater good. He\u2019s a good warrior but bad, bad strategist. He likes to tackle problems head-on, and solve it with sheer force and immense willpower, preferably a solution involving hand-to-hand combat. Villain on the other hand isn\u2019t even remotely good with martial arts, or even interested in it. Thinks pretty long term, being a brilliant strategist, and almost always frames someone else, or uses other people to do his dirty work, preferably without them even realizing it.In my story, the conflict is as much internal as external. Both protagonists are constantly battling moral and ethical dilemmas. The villain even have an inner voice like a devil on his shoulder which constantly sneers at him, goads him, urges him to embrace it - the Dark Side so to speak. The conflict is result of ambiguous events which are independent of, or caused by one party, and other wondering about its motive and implications. Chess you might say. The interest is maintained through complexity of the plot and innovative strategies to solve the \u2018puzzle pieces\u2019. The research done, verisimilitude and current events (including COVID-19) playing big parts in story, also contribute to keep the reader glued. So that was my 2 cents for how to implement a 2-protagonist story. I hope I helped. Comments are most welcome as I\u2019d love to hear what other people think of the whole concept and my take on it.

            "answer_text": "How do you write a book with two main characters? The same way you would if there were ten main characters or only one. There is a difference between a main character and a PROTAGONIST. A protagonist has a viewpoint in the story\u2026 the narrative is experienced through that character\u2019s eyes. Nothing requires you to have to multiple protagonists. I have 4 series all with multiple main characters\u2026 but with one exception they all have just one viewpoint \u2026 and that one book series only had 1 book where I did it. In fact, multiple viewpoints made it impossible to run that one book through a critique group because they kept forgetting who was who\u2026 yadda yadda\u2026 very frustrating. That was this one :  There they are, five main characters, 4 viewpoints\u2026 writing group brains exploding\u2026 moving on. I actually prefer this image \u2026 but, you know publisher\u2026  Sorry for that digression\u2026 protagonists \u2026 viewpoints. You have to consider the scenes in the book (usually around 60) can one character be in every scene? That\u2019s what it boils down to. If they CAN\u2019T, then you consider adding another protagonist. This is where you begin to weigh things like whether that relevant information must involve a direct interaction with the protagonist\u2026 or whether another cast member can simply convey that info. I have written like 20 books and I think I only really needed the extra protagonist once \u2026 even though I did it a couple other times in works that, admittedly, ended up not getting published. ",
