            "answer_text": "I started by focusing on systems instead of goals. I used goals merely as a direction to go, rather than an objective to complete. From there, I broke each goal down into actions that I could accomplish daily that were small, seemingly insignificant. Then, I decided when, where, and in what order I would do each goal. I wanted to be healthier, so I decided I would floss more. I already brushed my teeth before bed, so when I started designing my habits I set myself up to floss before I brushed my teeth. From there, the other habits started slowly falling into place. I wanted to journal more and read more, so I set up a system to floss, then brush my teeth, then journal, then read, then go to bed. I also never did more than I thought I could handle: even after doing this for a month I tell myself I will only write a single sentence in my journal. If I want to write more than so be it. I tell myself to read only 10 pages. If the book is interesting then I\u2019ll read more. Once you get into the mindset of implementing tiny, almost ignorable actions that slowly build up over time without requiring you to think at all the habits, and with them the results, develop automatically.
