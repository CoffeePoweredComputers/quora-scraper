            "answer_text": "The only answer I would venture is that Donald Trump is not a prolific reader. Prolific readers, particularly those of substantial books, tend to have a wider vocabulary. Trump, whether in interviews or on Twitter, uses an exceedingly limited range of words. He also uses the same words over and over again, often repeating words within two to three sentences. His adjectives, in particular, are few: sad, huge, tremendous, wonderful, the best, the best, bad, good, bad people, good people. His words often paint a starkly black and white understanding of the world; his is a mind that does not admit any nuances. There was an interview where Trump was asked about his favorite book. He replied with All Quiet on the Western Front, a book commonly assigned to students in late junior high or early high school. Megyn Keller, the interviewer, smelled something off and asked him to name the last book he read. He responded: \u201cI read passages, I read areas, chapters, I don\u2019t have the time. When was the last time I watched a baseball game? I\u2019m watching you all the time.\u201d So, my guess is Trump hasn\u2019t read a book cover to cover since K-12. However, we do know from interviews with people who worked for Trump that Trump religiously goes through all newspaper/magazine clippings that mention him. These days, that\u2019s bound to be fairly voluminous. ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody knows. I'm assuming Wharton required some textbooks as a prerequisite to graduation. We know two bits of information from Trump - he read All Quiet on the Western Front, or I guess he said it was a good book. Maybe he saw the movie. That was good too. We also know he had a book of Hitler's speeches by his bed, but I don't know if he actually said he read it. Somebody said it was a gift. Whatever. Let's give him a soft 2, plus whatever Wharton required. And that doesn't include graphic novels or classic comics, which I don't think anybody has asked him about. ",
