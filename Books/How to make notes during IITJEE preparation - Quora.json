            "answer_text": "If you are enrolled in an institute: The notes of the institute is enough. If you want more compact version, follow these steps- After returning from coaching, revise the notes.Make a separate notebook to note down the refined points and all formulas which you recognize as more important.Instead of the above point, you can highlight the points in the same notebook with a highlighter. This would save some time. But, do write formulae in a separate notebook. Comes in handy while revision.After every chapter notes, leave some space so that when you read or solve some book and observe some new point there, you can add in the notes.If you aren't enrolled in any institute: You have to repeat the above points but the notes in the first place will be created by you only. Take a good book and study from it. Make points and again strike out obvious points and keep the important ones in another textbook. Some good books for theory and numerical: Refer Mayank Kumar Chordia's answer to Which are the best books that we should start with for JEE preparation after the end of 10th class and at the beginning of 11th class? Mayank Kumar Chordia's answer to Is there any need to buy some extra books except the books and modules given by ALLEN to get a rank under 100 in the IIT JEE? All the best! :) ",

Even if you see your notes after a long time you should be able to recollect the concepts. The above things should be taken care of while you make notes. Keep your notes simple. Just note down the important points and formulas. Remember:- you are not writing the next h.c.verma or r.d.sharma. You can an example or two for each concept. All the best! ",
