But then again let me ask you a question, has man not tried to create AI robots that think and do things on their own, wouldn\u2019t it be amazing to see a robot who looked like a normal man and did EVERYTHING a normal man could do\u2026so the same thing as God\u2026we are that amazing to God that in the bible it was said and the devil and God had a conversation and the devil asked \u201cWhat is man that you have made him little lower than God\u201d meaning yes we are higher than angels Also you cannot question what God does\u2026if by chance lets say God does not exist why has this topic of God always carried on I remember reading an article where a man said one day the bible will go out of trend, right now the man is dead and his former house is used as a bible printing factory..coincidence? i think not ",

            "answer_text": "I have read the Bible and I still do not believe in God. What did I do wrong? From your question, it seems that you are disappointed that you still don't believe in god even though you've read the bible. Here's what I think you did wrong: you read the bible before you were a firm believer. That's the wrong way round. Only if you are a believer will the bible make any sense. Normally, to be a believer, you need to have been indoctrinated from a young age to believe in God, and perhaps other supernatural fantasies. Assuming you haven't been indoctrinated or that it the indoctrination (e.g. Parental sermons, Sunday School, Christmas, Attending Church etc.) hasn\u2019t worked for you, here are some ideas to help you make sense of the bible and believe in God: You must be willing to suspend your disbelief whilst you read the bible. This is similar to watching a film with major holes in its plot line (eg. Star Wars) - it spoils the entertainment if you analyse it too muchJust assume that god exists whilst you read the book. You then pick up on the bits that resonate with you and ignore / rationalise away all the inconsistent / inconvenient / ludicrous bits.Your mindset should be \u201cwhat can I learn about god\u201d rather than \"is there really a god\". That will make it much easier to apply confirmation-bias.Although the bible can be read like a piece of non-fiction, at no point should you critically analyse what you read. Remember, the exercise is about confirming a pre-existing belief, not questioning it.Ideally, you should read it with a bunch of hard-core believers (e.g. in a bible study group), so that their enthusiasm and steadfast refusal to apply logical thinking may rub off on you.Good Luck!
