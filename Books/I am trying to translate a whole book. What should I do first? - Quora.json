Make sure you have a good grasp of both languages :) Also, probably work out differences in structure (for instance Japanese uses Subject-Object-Verb IIRC as opposed to English order) and keep those in mind. Get ready to annotate. Idioms and other common cultural points will possibly be lost in translation or fail to make sense to the Language B reader, so you might want to make notes to clarify things. I don't have experience with this, but these would be my guesses on where to start. Good luck. ",
