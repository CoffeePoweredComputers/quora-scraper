            "answer_text": "Ok, if you really want it I hereby confess my crimes: When I was 10\u201313 I really didn\u2019t know what sexuality was. It was all about aesthetics and efficiency, I had an aesthetical admiration for male body because of its speed and strength, I despised \u201cthe girls\u201d and anything \u201cgirly\u201d (like actually many pre-teens do) which looked handicapped to me. In my little-boy mind this opinion was strongly supported by female vs male performance in sports. But actually I despised a lot of \u201cugly\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d males as well, fat guys, short guys, lazy guys etc. etc My schoolmates and some teacher spotted my \u201cgayness\u201d much before me. The accuses were basically being too much clean, polite, individualist, spiffy, dapper etc. which were quite true. But really, it wasn\u2019t a gay thing for me, with a Rangers Officer Father and a High-School Teacher Mother, being \u201cclean, polite, formal and dapper\u201d was compulsory, you wouldn\u2019t try anything else with my parents!, no shabbiness, no \u201cbad\u201d words, no dirt allowed, never! I began using words like \u201cfuck\u201d or \u201cshit\u201d much later, in front of my mother it\u2019s unthinkable even today. So they decided I was gay they called me \u201cfaggot\u201d and I didn\u2019t know what it meant exactly (I wonder if they did). I asked my father who said \u201cThey are men who make bad things in bed with other men\u201d, which puzzled me (fighting in a bed? what bad things?) but he went no farther in particulars. Schoolmates and some teacher tried to bully and insult me in different ways, I reacted very violently and \u201carrogant\u201d \u201creal bastard\u201d \u201cbully\u201d \u201cwho do you think you are?\u201d etc were added to the accuses. Despite being practically the only one with good discipline and correct behaviour in my class of all males, I received bad discipline marks from teachers and I was classified \u201cdisrupting\u201d. For the rest, my grades at school were always excellent and I could outrun retards who waited for me \u201cafter school, to give you a lesson (meaning gang beating)\u201d, so the \u201cgo to hell those inferior animals\u201d that\u2019s how I thought and I still think. As soon as the lessons finished, when they were still starting standing up, I\u2019d already jumped all the corridors, 3 level staircases and I was out running away before they had time to realise what happened. Well, if nothing else, I learned running like the wind, a healthy activity, the only pro at school, I was running all time! Normally, in such situations, you\u2019ll find a lot of suicides, unhappy kids, desperate kids ,,, But not me, I didn\u2019t give really a toss because I had much more interesting things to do than worry about schoolmates, cavemen teachers, I was lucky There was the national park nearby, mountains, animals, hunting and horses, jeeps, my father was commander of a ranger\u2019s outpost and there were the Rangers and I was their mascot, they were all trim and fit, kind, educated, funny, efficient and working all time making interesting things. Also we had a large library at home. Why should I give a toss of those barbarians at school? The high school was a bit better, I learned what sex was, I picked up only the hottest girls from the Swedish resort nearby to show other guys I could do it better (really only for that because sex was uneventful). I was always a solitary, I still am, I managed to have my own life, I had sex in cities, wow, gay saunas in Berlin, I couldn\u2019t imagine, it was sex heaven! vacations in Ibiza, hot clubs in LA, beaches in Italy, New York, an alley in Boston \u2026 always away, though, never in my town or nearby. Time passed by, The university, the Army, some years in the gulf. A few love stories, NATO bases as dating Clubs, funny, an American airman, an Italian parachuter, German soldiers, French\u2026 see the pattern? it doesn\u2019t take much, a collection of uniforms! the Rangers were the only ones who gave their friendship to that outcast little kid I had been. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- So, no mastubation with little teens, no porn, no gay messages, no gay models, no \u201cgay culture\u201d, no church, no sense of sin, no Flamboyant speaking, no feminine feeling, nothing! Why am I gay? because I liked male aesthetics, running and rowing or is it the other way out? Genetically (in the sense of gay-programmed), it seems risible to me, twins and siblings can often be gay, but they have similar experiences and context too, these experiments mean nothing and they\u2019re statistically irrelevant. I believe it\u2019s a genetical potentiality which had some useful survival function whose meaning we have lost and was triggered by special conditions in our past, this can be seen in some animals. Why Lions do that, it\u2019s a good story. Since we are intelligent and much more complicated, original behaviours are hidden by layers and layers of complexity, just like the elaborate mate-dance of straight males and females. Being something so extremely rare (2\u20133%) of population it\u2019s a behaviour whose meaning we can\u2019t easily identify. ",
