            "answer_text": "Hmm, This is the only question for which i was really confused about. Since, you didn\u2019t mentioned that you are a Medical/Engineering/School/Casual student, i will consider some cases:- (This is a completely experience based answer w/ some suggestions of my friends) INTRO:- HCV- HCV is a \u201cConcept-Clearer\u201d, Since, the no. of questions in HCV is less but awesome, it is a great book to master your concepts.DC- on the other hand DC is more like a \u201cTheory+Practice Book\u201d, after HCV, you can go for DC to practice questions for building speed and accuracy.Theory of HCV & DC- Theory in DC and HCV are both good and to-the-point, no need to compare theory part!Case 1- Medical Aspirant i am also a medical aspirant and i am using both the books, these books are completely different. It is strongly recommended for a med aspirant to solve HCV\u2019s Examples, Objective-I and Objective-II (no exercises) and then move to DC for gaining speed, That\u2019s it! Case 2- Engineering Aspirant Just complete HCV 2\u20133 times, if you are able to solve and tackle all the questions in HCV, you are all set for rock the exam! After mastering HCV, just go for some previous year question and you are all set! (no need to go for anything else, trust me!) Case 3- Casual Physics Lover Dont think about any other book than \u2018HC Verma\u2019 just start reading it from cover page, index, preface till the last page of the book, and i am damn sure that you will start to love and relate physics to the real life scenario like a PRO! So, in a nutshell, it is completely a \u2018Case-Based-Choice\u2019, there is nothing like \u2018This is better than this\u2019 just choose wisely. I think, i was able to make this clear in your mind that what\u2019s the basic difference between both the books, i hope that helps! Thank you for reading (Apologies for my mistakes!) ",
