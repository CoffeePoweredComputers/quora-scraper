            "answer_text": "As I recall, Will Graham, the FBI psychological profiler, made the connection because Dr. Lecter had copies of something called, \u2018Wound Man\u2019 on the walls of his office? I believe that \u2018Wound Man\u2019 was a type of medievel text which showed the potential wounds which could be inflicted by any given enemy on a combatants body? He instantly knew that Dr. Lecter was the killer that the FBI had been hunting? However, Dr. Lecter instantly realised that Graham had \u2018rumbled\u2019 him and crept up behind Graham, wearing only his socks which gave him a greater element of stealth! He then attempted to disembowel Graham with a carpet knife - obviously inflicting horrific injuries to Graham which almost proved fatal! Graham suffered a great psychological damage too which required him to stay at a psychological institution. As I recall, Shiloh? Dr. Lecter was caught and sentenced to an indefinite period behind bars as a result. During his trial, Dr. Lecter never entered a plea! ",

While waiting for Lecter to come back, Will came to his books, while looking at them, he happened to look up and saw a book on top of the book case, sticking out. The book was \u201cWound Man,\u201d and had pictures of dissections that mimicked the killings. Lecter saw the look on his face and knew he was caught. He went to do an errand and returned without socks, stabbing Will. Will never told Lecter how he figured out it was he. Lector had no idea it was the book and this ate him up, because Will kept it a secret. ",
