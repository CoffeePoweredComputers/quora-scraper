Similarly, this well-known version of Ramayana too presents the story of Rama's return to Vaikuntha.As Hanuman asked Vasuki about the ring, he took Hanuman to the center of Nag Lok and made him stood in front of a Hanuman was a powerful avatar of Lord Shiva who incarnated as the protector of Sri Rama. It was difficult for anyone to hurt Rama when Hanuman was there to fight for him. To distract himRama throws his ring in a crack on the ground and asked Hanuman to fetch it. After that, Hanuman took the size of an insect and entered the crack. Later, he realized that it was the way to Nag Lok. Where he met the King Vasuki entering the world of Serpents.He took Hanuman to the center of Nag Lok and made him stood in front of a mountain of rings. Hanuman started searching for Rama's ring and found it at once. Later, he realized that every ring in the mountain belongs to Rama. Later, Hanuman asked Vasuki about the confusion of ring mountain. Vasuki explained him various facts about life and death.As Hanuman realizes that there is no coincidence or accident that he landed in Nag Lok while searching for Rama's ring, there was a reason for whatever happened in the epic. Not only the characters but even the narrative turns out to be something inspiring for the world. There is always someone to teach the world a good lesson.",

Lord Mahavishnu is the cause and Lord Ram is the effect Hanuman replied stating \" I wont come to a place where Lord Rama is not there. I will Stay back in this world and keep mediating on You Rama.\" Lord Ram said \"Hanuman there will be a time even i wont be there in this world\" Lord Hanuman, replied As long as this world exists there will be someone uttering your name.
