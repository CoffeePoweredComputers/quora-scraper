            "answer_text": "As in terms of using 'smart' words and meaningful dialogue or plots, most of them are. In my opinion they are made to be read for fun, although some teach you important lessons in life or make you think more in general. Reading YA doesn't make you any more clever but isn't completely useless. As long as YA isn't the only kind of books a person reads, it's fine. I used to read a lot of books of the aforementioned genre but then I realised that they are all pretty similar. I still read them for fun, but nothing more than that. ",
