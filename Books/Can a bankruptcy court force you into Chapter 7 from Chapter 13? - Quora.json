            "answer_text": "ABSOLUTELY YES!!! A Ch13 is a privilege and if the trustee or the presiding BK judge feels it is not in the creditors best interest or the plan is unsound then they bounce you back to a 7 and that is it A CH13 is basically an indentured servant although not officially you agree to work for the creditors for a given period of time giving them all but the basic expenses in exchange for keeping some asserts that are above the limits set by a typical CH7 In MANY areas the trustees would rather adjust a asset list then play the game of the 13 The trustees only get paid based on the small fees you pay to them plus a share of the close out. If you enter into a CH13 and the plan sucks they have spend months monitoring your action and then have to tosas you into a 7 of you fail anyway Sometimes it is easier to say that they extend the asset forgiveness and allow you to go down the 7 route day one As far as which is better it is actually better to do the 7 if you can keep everything you want becuase it gets you done with and also lets the 10 year timer begin sooner. PLUS you avoid the trustee expenses and the HASSLE of reporting Dr D ",

            "answer_text": "Involuntary conversion from Chapter 13 bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 case is extremely rare. It almost never happens. I handle Chapter 13 cases all the time. In my 37 years of bankruptcy law practice, I have seen it occur, (involuntary conversion) on only two occasions. In both of those cases the debtors had lied to the court, were attempting to hide assets, and were trying to unfairly manipulate the court system in bad faith. You can read more about Chapter 13 and how it works in my free bankruptcy ebook. Chapter 13 is an incredible debt relief remedy. It is principally used to cure the default on mortgage loans, and to manage debts like taxes which are usually non dischargeable in Chapter 7 cases. It can also be used to retain assets, like a small business, which might be jeopardized in a Chapter 7 case. ",

The payment plan filed with the court must meet certain criteria and the average layman couldn\u2019t write one the court would likely approve. If you can file a Chapter 7, and have the fortitude to complete some 23 different forms, you can file without an attorney. It\u2019s not really forcing you from 7 to 13, it\u2019s more like being allowed to file a 7 instead of 13. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. If you misbehave, so to speak, or you have no realistic hope of confirming a chapter 13 plan, the judge has authority to convert your case to chapter 7. Note that it is possible to convert from chapter 7 TO chapter 13, if the judge permits it. If the case started in chapter 13, however, you have the right to voluntarily dismiss a chapter 13 case for any reason. So if the case started in 13 and it looks like the judge is inclined to convert it to 7 and you don\u2019t want to be in 7, then voluntarily dismiss the 13 (can\u2019t voluntarily dismiss a chapter 7 case).
