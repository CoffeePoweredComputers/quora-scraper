            "answer_text": "In Quantum Physics, a sub-atomic particle can be present and absent at the same time.  In Fiverr, making money can be easy and hard at the same time.  Confused? Let me explain. Making money on Fiverr is almost like going to the gym you know. Very hard at first and then\u2026pretty easy.  You see, when you\u2019re new at the platform, you\u2019re bombarded with so much competition that it\u2019s really easy to give up. Depending on what you\u2019re good at, it\u2019s a really crowded place.  I\u2019ve been a content writer and copywriter at the platform for over 2 years with a Level One Profile and a 5 star rating\u2026 but let me tell you\u2026 almost anyone can do copy-writing these days using apps and websites such as Grammarly to help them (if you wanted to be a copywriter, download Grammarly it will make you life much, much easier. Welcome!) You might want to do something that\u2019s more on demand or mainstream, such as logo designing\u2026 but yes, Fiverr is also flooded with logo designers and websites such as canva and Wix logo maker that have made logo making extremely easy for anyone without skills (Again, you\u2019re welcome). So here\u2019s the bottom line\u2026 I know Fiverr is the best platform for beginners, but because of that there are so many beginners that you will struggle. Just think about it\u2026 in websites such as Upworok, you are screened before entering the platform.  Almost anyone from anywhere around the world can join Fiverr. So here\u2019s what I suggest, If you are really good at something\u2026 you\u2019re gonna succeed. But if you\u2019re just starting out or learning (which is completely okay), suggest you do what I did. I learned everyday.  I made freelancing my passion and I never paid a single penny to learn\u2026 no courses or anything like that (so now you know this isn\u2019t a marketing answer lol) but I watched YouTube videos, researched on Google and read success stories. I learned new writing techniques, gimmicks and styles from the internet daily. I read tons of books and learned how to make my writings more attractive. Only because of that, I was able to succeed. Other beginners started maybe with a perfect profile but never improved\u2026 so they got stuck. As you learn and improve\u2026 you\u2019re skills will sharpen and you will get more and more positive reviews, and therefore your pay will also increase.  If you\u2019re a pro (or someone very qualified) you just have to be patient and work hard and realize that getting orders early is very rare on Fiverr\u2026 but not getting orders after you get a few 5 star reviews is rare.  So if you\u2019re new\u2026 I suggest  You have a good gig description with zero errorsHave multiple gigsRespond to the 10 buyer requests everydayAdvertise on social media platformsNever give up and be patient!Now you know that it really is easy\u2026 and difficult at the same time! Good luck!  PS: I take hours of my time answering questions, trying to help fellow freelancers.
