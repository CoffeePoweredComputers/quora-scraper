            "answer_text": "Common for nonfiction books that sell well. New editions were published of The Joy of Cooking, The World is Flat, and my own book, Groundswell. If a book isn't a good seller, it's unlikely that the publisher will publish a revised edition. Often small errors are corrected in subsequent printings but that's not a whole new edition. Academic books are different as you noted. Textbooks are revised often. Updated editions add stuff and change the pagination. This means students can't buy used copies of the old edition and use them for a course - the assignments won't match. A cynical ploy to generate more sales of required books. ",

            "answer_text": "Asker here. I\u2019m interested about cases where the author(s) realized issues with book after the release. A related observation is that while collaborative fiction might result in too many cooks spoiling the proverbial broth, a good collaboration might result in something akin to perfection, or at least avoidance of a lot of issues which may otherwise not get corrected. Some examples (direct ones or tangentially related)\u2026 Penrod (1914) - Revised edition published in 2017 to remove the \u2018racially sensitive\u2019 parts.Ringworld - Wikipedia - Ringworld revised edition + its sequel incorporating feedback regarding Ringworld\u2019s instability.The Hammer of God by Clarke - Developed from his earlier short storyThe City and the Stars by Clarke - Wiki mentions it as a rewrite of an earlier novelThe below case is of revision BEFORE the release and must be quite common, but I found it particularly interesting\u2026 The Mote in God\u2019s Eye - Niven and Pournelle getting extensive advice from the great Robert A. Heinlein - Wayback Machine \u2018Subj: Motelight\u2019 ",
