            "answer_text": "This has happened to me with three books. The first was Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses. At 572 pages, this is a longish read, made longer by its difficulty. I had no idea what was going on for the first 200 pages. It was like being swallowed by an alternate universe where everyone ate magic mushrooms for breakfast. At around page 300, it all became clearer, and I began to understand what an important work of genius this is. When I got to the end, I had to reread it with the knowledge, understanding and admiration I had gained the first time round. I also spent a lot of time in the Plymouth reference library, checking out the historical and Moslem-related aspects of the story. This left me with a respect for Rushdie\u2019s scholarship - a respect denied him by those who prefer the worship of an idol to the pure Islam. His book has been misinterpreted as blasphemous, when it actually seeks to purify. Rushdie never casts blame in his writing: he understands human error and frailty only too well. But sometimes there are outcomes which seem just. There is a lot of surrealism and fun along the way too. The second was Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency by Douglas Adams. At 288 pages, I thought this was going to be a lightish read, after the manner of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. I was wrong. It is a literary work, possibly of some importance. Some might deny this, so I will explain why. Throughout the writing of this book Adams listened over and over to a six movement cantata by Bach, Bleib bei uns denn es will Abend werden (Abide with us, for evening draws near).[1][2] This cantata is based on the account at Luke chapter 24, in which two disciples are walking to the village of Emmaus, on the day of Christ\u2019s resurrection, when they encounter a stranger. They have doubts about the resurrection of Jesus, and are sad. Following this passage of scripture, the cantata is about fear and courage, loss of faith and sorrow, death and resurrection, salvation despite condemnation, and the contrast between light and darkness as the evening draws in. It is about the salvation of the soul, the moment of choice between belief and unbelief.  The theme of Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency is similarly concerned with the nature of life, death and resurrection. But just as the music of Bach overlays one theme with another, so the various aspects of life and death in the book are overlain by the more eastern spiritual concept of \u201cthe interconnectedness of all things\u201d. In the end it is this belief that prevails. In Bach\u2019s music, one melody is often set against others in a way which is harmonious with regard to the sounds of the notes, but with each melody following a different rhythm. The tunes are interconnected. In Adams\u2019 book there are multiple storylines, a completeness of all genres, all following this single idea of the interconnected nature of life and death. Oh, and of time. Time is important in this book. It is important to music too. The book is written following Bach\u2019s music. In Hitchhiker\u2019s we learn of the great question to which the answer is given as 42. This book may be seen as an attempt to answer this question of life, the universe, and everything by a human rather than a computer. I have read it five or six times now, but still have a great deal to understand about Adams\u2019 most remarkable accomplishment. If you have read it and thought it was simple, you may be missing something. The third was early this year, and was the online fanfic Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Eliezer Yudkowsky. This astonishing work is available free here: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality . It is not at all difficult, but it is l o n g - 661,619 words long. I enjoyed Rowling\u2019s books, which I read all at once at the end of last year, and it does help to have read these first, but this was something else. I hardly came up for air for several days, and when I got to the end, I had to start again because\u2026well, because\u2026well, I don\u2019t know why. Gluttony maybe. Or I still had questions. Or I couldn\u2019t bear that it was over. Something like that. Not everyone is as enthralled by HPMOR as I am. Maybe I am not all that rational.
