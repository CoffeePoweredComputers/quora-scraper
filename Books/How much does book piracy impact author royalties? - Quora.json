            "answer_text": "It\u2019s very difficult to say, because it depends so much on variable factors, and there is no way to calculate what the sales would have been in a world where piracy doesn\u2019t exist. I had a book pirated, and from sales data I would have made twice as much on that book if it hadn\u2019t been pirated. On the other hand, those who illegally downloaded it clearly weren\u2019t willing to spend money, so maybe they wouldn\u2019t have bought it at all if there hadn\u2019t been a pirated version available. Other variables include the popularity of the author, whether they have a fanbase who would spend money because they admire the author, even if they weren\u2019t enthusiastic for the book itself, the book\u2019s price (an ebook sold at $0.99 will have a different impact to a paperback selling at 9.99), and a number of other things. Bottom line: Piracy is bad and hurts authors. Don\u2019t do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably not at all. If you write Harry Potter, maybe. But most books sell so little that they don\u2019t generate much interest at all from piracy. There is some current ideas that piracy actually helps spread interest in your book and increases sales. Your book is piracy worthy. It helps if you put references to your other books in back or somewhere of your current book. Spreading your book around gets people interested. Most people don\u2019t steal books. So you can run on that most people will just go and buy a new copy if they are interested. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it at all. I would cross reference your other books and just keep moving forward ",
