            "answer_text": "In theory, you could scan the pages of a book, generate one long PDF file from all pages\u2019 scans, and upload it to your Kindle library. Then read it on your Kindle. In practice, reading a PDF document on a Kindle is like trying to read a newspaper with a magnifying glass, having all space outside the magnifying glass obscured. It is so bothersome that I would honestly consider giving up reading altogether. By the way \u2026 As no idea is too dumb to be implemented, some publishers actually \u201cconvert\u201d printed books this way to ebooks. They send the scan through OCR software (which tries to recognize all the characters) and publish the result as an ebook \u2014 with most of the errors of the OCR software uncorrected. Those are the ebooks where readers complain about the many typos that are not in the printed edition. Typical errors are \u201ce\u201d replaced by \u201cc\u201d, or \u201craffle\u201d spelled as \u201crafAe\u201d, because the software was confused by the printed book\u2019s font, which merged the combination \u201cfl\u201d to a typographic ligature:  ",

If you mean between Kindle devices, it is a simple matter of just adding / downloading to the new device. If you mean two or more \u201caccounts\u201d \u2026. ie. John Green\u2019s account & John Grey\u2019s account \u2026. sorry, but that\u2019s not allowed. If YOU are both of these people, you might appeal to Amazon to merge the accounts. If that is possible, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d require proof. ",
