            "answer_text": "The principal consideration, as Isaac Serville notes, is to focus on the principal audience\u2014young adults\u2014and the degree to which the book will engage them. Example (I always like to give examples, vs. empty opinion): I wrote a YA book in which the principal protagonist, a girl from age two to twenty, is involved with a series of adults who include her parents and other men and women. Rather than just make this assertion, I am offering the synopsis below, for optional reading. Comments welcome, as always, and will be answered as appropriate. The basic goal of the book was to tell the story of survival by a young girl, to inspire others who might have suffered similar trauma.  THE RED PRINCESS (75,000 words, complete) The book tells of a girl unwanted and rejected at birth by her powerful San Francisco parents. Traumatized and enraged, she suffers from OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder): enacting repetitive rituals, selective mutism (refusing to speak), trichotillomania (hair pulling) and self-mutilation (cutting and burning herself). From childhood her parents neglect her (they get her no professional help!) despite her 135 IQ, and her peers reject her cruelly. The material has two sources: the first few chapters, and the later materials. The early chapters, first written by the author as a child, were re-written by her at the request of a psychiatrist and reflect her sophistication as an older person, now 20, especially vs. the challenges of reading and writing; the rest were her unedited notebook and diary entries. For consistent reading, and to convey character and meaning, the over-all style of the author\u2019s original records has been kept as closely as possible but this is the work not of an experienced professional writer but of a young person with a passion for using words. Her writings reveal a creative, intelligent and gentle autodidact who teaches herself to read and write competently, despite her anger, catatonic withdrawal and endless self-destructive acts of which she is ashamed. She survives childhood trauma to escape self-obsession and to find and give love, helped by three remarkable friends: a Jamaican woman who becomes her surrogate mother and creates in her \u201cThe Red Princess\u201d to give her personal power and recover her self worth, a retired Navy pilot who saves her life during a suicide attempt, and a motorcycle messenger in England who shows her physical tenderness. The book describes her attempts to achieve via ballet, modeling and\u2014at high risk\u2014motorcycle racing, despite her refusal to speak to her parents or strangers, and to energize her writing aspirations. The writing is at once frightening, inspiring and erotic. No attempt was made to reduce the impact of the graphic passages but factual material, including dates, places and circumstances, was modified for legal reasons, to protect individuals living and dead (including the notebook/ diary writer and her parents), whose privacy must be respected and remain uncompromised.

            "answer_text": "Typically, your characters should be a slight bit older than your target audience. So if you\u2019re writing for adults, your characters should be adults. If you\u2019re writing for 12-year-olds, write about maybe 13-or-14-year-olds. If you\u2019re writing a book for teenagers, the characters can be teenagers, or they can be 18/19/20, it doesn\u2019t matter much. Maybe a 16 year old isn\u2019t going to want to read about a 50 year old, but characters in their 20s and 30s are totally acceptable. If your protagonist is an adult, it shouldn\u2019t take away from the story at all. What makes a good protagonist is how their character develops and changes, not how old they are. ",
