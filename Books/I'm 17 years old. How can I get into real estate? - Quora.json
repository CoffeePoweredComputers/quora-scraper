            "answer_text": "I think your question should be, \"How can I be successful?\" Real estate sales might have looked like the best route during the last few decades, but now there are too many people thinking the same thing. These days, the odds of becoming ultra-successful in real estate aren't any better than the chance that you will become an ultra-successful actor or musician. Start right now by getting a job in sales (not working behind a cash register at the local Abercrombie & Fitch, but a job where you have to personally sell the benefits of a complex product and then actually close deals). At the same time you are working full time in sales, go to school full time and work on your critical thinking and research skills. Get a degree in something you're passionate about and then follow it up with an advanced degree in management, law, or finance. That's what's going to separate you from those who chose real estate because they weren't qualified to do anything else. When I first started in commercial real estate, one of the partners said it well, \"If you want to make a million bucks a year, it's one of the easiest fields to do that in. But, if you want to make two hundred thousand a year, it's one of the hardest.\" I just turned 60, never made a bunch of money, but managed to retire debt-free five years ago after paying off our home on the California coast. I managed to do that by saving instead of spending, by doing home improvements myself, by settling for safe investments (it's way easier to make money by working than it is by \"investing\", or gambling as is more often the case) and by marrying a spouse with a great retirement plan. If you're like me and have high hopes but don't really have the drive to excel (as in literally working night and day, seven days a week) cover the downside by becoming qualified for a job with a stable salary and a good pension. Be true to yourself - if you aren't motivated enough to start right now, you probably won't be motivated enough to start next year. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Jillayne. Go to college. It will open many more doors. Sure NY state only requires you to be 18 yo but Manhattan is not like the rest of NY state. Manhattan is a unique place in the real estate universe and very competitive. While the state may issue you a salesperson license you can't do anything with it unless you are under the supervision of broker that holds your license. The top firms usually hire experienced agents or people entering real estate bringing experience from another fields.They may even require a college degree in lieu of work experience if they have training program.   The brightest and most talented from all over the world come here to make it. Most top real estate agents in Manhattan are highly educated and often enter real estate after very successful careers in other fields.  To be successful in Manhattan real estate you need to be smarter than your clients and customers. Manhattan buyers, sellers and renters are savvy and sophisticated. NYU has one of the best real estate schools in the country. It's very expensive, so if you can't afford a 4 year tuition at least take some courses or look at other schools. You can get your license and still go to college.  Top agents always need assistants.  It's a tough business. It's a straight commission. You need to have money until you make a sale. Start out doing rentals since 75% of housing in Manhattan is rental buildings. You will need to work your friends. If they go to college and get jobs in NYC when they graduate they will need apartments. You will need to work your friends parents too as they probably will have the money to buy. Growing up here will give you a slight edge by already know neighborhoods, buildings and people who live here that will need to buy and sell and rent.  I think a college degree while not required for the state license will help you in the future in real estate or any professional career.  It's hard work and stressful, sales is not for everyone but you have your whole life ahead of you. Education and hard work can give you the potential for a rewarding lucrative career. Good Luck! ",
