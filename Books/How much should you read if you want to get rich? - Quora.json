            "answer_text": "So basically you want to get rich. And you somehow think reading books is the key to get you there. So you are asking how much (volume? frequency?) should you read if you want to get rich. I'm sorry, feel free to call me a troll, but this question reminds me of this guy Tai Lopez, a lot.  You can Google around about him if you're interested.. LOL. I'd say there isn't significant correlation between how much or how frequent you read and your level of wealth. Volume and frequency of reading isn't the key. You can spend 20 hours a day reading 100000 comic books but it's probably not going to make you rich (money wise). It might actually make you a broke man since you have to buy those books. If you are a person driven by a specific goal, which sounds like you are. What I'd say is: read with a goals and questions in mind. You'll either find solutions to your questions and formulas to get to your goals or you'll find better (more achievable, more meaningful, more money in your case, etc.) goals.  In fact, take a step back, if you want to get rich, what matters is just having a direction and then execute to go about achieving it. Yes you may realized you're wrong half way through pursuing something, in which case you find new direction and repeat. It's very hard to find directions giving the world is changing very fast and in my honest opinion, you are not likely to find a direction to what's next through reading most of the books giving publishing cycle for a book is very long and industries like IT and many more are changing way faster than that. I'd argue job experience in cutting edge field, internet and socializing is more important. But let's say if you somehow found your direction, then you just need to read about your focused field until you become an expert to succeed. Let's say if you live in WA where marijuana just got legalized. You did your research and are determined that's the way to get rich. Then, reading as much as you can about growing plants might help you a lot in getting rich. But still, like I said above, experiences can be gained faster through finding a mentor, searching the web, etc. So my conclusion is, the formula you're trying to solve is invalid / incomplete. There isn't just reading in the formula and the volume / frequency of reading aren't the key. On a higher level, goal setting, persistence and execution are far more important. ",

            "answer_text": "This seems like such a simple question. But I don't think it is at all. First of all, I'm going to accept that the goal is to become rich. I don't think this is an ideal goal by any means, but it's a goal that a lot of people have, it probably makes more sense than having a goal of becoming poor and I think it's more desirable than a goal of smacking as many people as you can in the face, so that's fine. The goal is to become rich. The problem is that this is where it gets complex. Because there are tons of ways to become rich. You can read a lot, like Todd Combs (see Dan Kanivas answer), or Warren Buffett, or Elon Musk, or Bill Gates, or pretty much every successful lawyer you'll ever meet. These guys have become rich at least partly because they've managed to take in more information and use that information more successfully than everyone else. If you want to take that approach to becoming rich then you are going to want to read. A lot. Not a lot as in \"a whole book\" or a lot as in \"a whole book every week\". A LOT. Like, if you're awake and not talking to someone else or doing those kind of things that keep us alive (eating, drinking) or healthy & groomed (showering, exercising) then you're reading. (And for those exercising moments....that's what audiobooks are for). If you're taking this route then the answer to how much should you read is \"as much as you can\". Read books, read articles, read academic papers, read blogs, read newspapers, read magazines, read the back of cereal packets and understand you don't need that much sugar (because you've read the academic paper). Read it all. Alternatively, there are other approaches to getting rich. Baseball players don't need to read. Pop stars and Movie stars don't need to read. Video games players don't need to read. There are lots of people who've made a lot more money than me in a similar line of work that don't read. Real-estate developers don't need to read. Heck, I'm not even sure that some high profile real-estate developers CAN read. There are many ways to become rich without reading. Either way is fine with me. I've chosen to spend much of my life reading and by any reasonable measure I've done pretty well. But I have a brain that's suited to reading (or does it just feel like that because I've had so much practice?) Maybe you'd rather do something else. In fact it's not even clear to me spending your time reading is the most obvious or easiest path to financial success for a lot of people. I'll just add one thing though. Coming back to my point at the start about the goal being to get rich. When we talk about being rich we normally think about money. But there are other ways to consider yourself rich than how much money you have in the bank and one of those ways is to be rich in knowledge and your understanding of the world. For this kind of richness you can never read enough. ",
