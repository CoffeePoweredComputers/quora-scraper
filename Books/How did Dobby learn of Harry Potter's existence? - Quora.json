            "answer_text": "I suspect that when Draco was very young Narcissa read the unauthorised \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 books to him, the ones in which Harry was portrayed as a heroic magical prodigy who lived in a magical palace and defeated Acromantulas at the age of six, and Dobby listened in and came to believe that Harry was a Great Wizard and liberator. How he twisted this into believing that the Great Harry Potter had to be protected, even at the cost of subjecting him to imprisonment, torture, and horrible life-threatening injury, is beyond me - but then I\u2019m not a comic-relief insane house elf. For me, the greatest moment in the whole series was when Bellatrix knifed the little creep. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHow did Dobby learn of Harry Potter\u2019s existence?\u201d That\u2019s a pretty simple answer. He learned of it from the Malfoys. Lucious was one of Voldemort\u2019s biggest followers. Undoubtedly, he heard the whole tale of what had happened when Voldemort was beaten, so I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve talked about it at length at home in front of Dobby. He barely noticed Dobby\u2019s existence unless he needed anything, so I doubt he would\u2019ve cared what he said in front of him. Lucious was also basically the defacto leader of the former death eaters after Voldemort\u2019s fall, so I\u2019d be fairly certain that a lot of them frequented his Manor and talked about all sorts of things involving Voldemort and Harry Potter. After Draco\u2019s first year, he saw fit to talk continuously about Harry Potter and how much he hated him after he came home. I\u2019m sure there were plenty of discussions about Harry between Draco and Lucious. ",
