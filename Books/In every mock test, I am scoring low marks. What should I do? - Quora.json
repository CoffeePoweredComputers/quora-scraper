            "answer_text": "Any competitive examination is all about consistency and putting the right effort. 3 Months of time is actually the amount of time required for preparation to pull off a decent percentile for CAT. There are many other examinations like NMAT, CMAT, XAT, MH-CET, and SNAP that could be covered with the same syllabus. I have a friend who scored 80+ percentile in CAT but made it through XAT. So I would highly recommend, not to give up and make a proper time-table, perhaps for at least 3 hours a day. For Quants and LRDI, you can first focus on important and frequently occurring concepts by analyzing previous year question paper, and based on marks and number of questions, you ll get a rough idea. Then take up each chapter one by one and complete it. Focus more on the previous year's question paper and sectional mocks. For VARC, you need to solve RCs daily, there are many open-source platforms like CRACKU, Learn4Exam and 2iim that provides daily doses. You can pick those up and start solving at your leisure. Norman and Lewis is recommended but if you see it practically it becomes difficult. The other thing that you could do is to pick up the previous year's VARC and start solving it. You can refer to Tips and Tricks of VARC by Tony Xavier based on practical approaches Tony Xavier. Mock Strategy: Attempt Mocks every week if possible or else once in 10 days and try to mark only write ones. These exams are all about accuracy than attempting all. Take 3-4 hours of time in analyzing the mock test, then check what were the concepts that you knew and how much time you actually took, were there any faster ways to solve or what you could have done better. This way your mock scores will increase gradually, not in a day or two but perhaps in weeks or after a month. Above all this, always believe in yourself and never lose hope. Everybody goes through the same pain and effort. In the end it's all about consistency and the right effort that will make you shine. Keep yourself motivated throughout your journey. ",
