            "answer_text": "It is very possible that you will receive another free trial offer from LinkedIn, but less likely that you will get trial trial for the same plan and that too via email.  I myself have received multiple free trials from Linkedin.  Here's how their strategy works:- They will offer you a free trial, send you some nice emails to get you onboarded, push in your news feed that 'X is now a premium member' - a sort of marketing stunt - If you do not cancel your trial, they will autobill you, if you cancel they wont give up on you yet. - They will keep sending you emails with reduced incentive e.g get 50% off on X subscription. But dont fall for that. - Disabling adblocker on LinkedIn is probably the most useful thing to do if you want free stuff. Keep an eye on the sidebar ads, every now and then they will offer a free trial but for a different subscription type. e.g Sales navigator, recruiter plan etc. This mostly should be based on how you are using linkedin.  Here are a few tricks: Search jobs, go to job post pages, you will find a button saying 'try this for free' (compare where you stand against other applicants) Try searching for different types of developers etc. Keep an eye on the sidebar ad on search page, it might popup 'Recruiter plan' trial Try going to mid senior level profiles, search a company name and go through multiple people from the same company. Click on inmail buttons. You might see an option of Sales navigator trial. If you need Premium plan just to view 3rd degree profiles, then there's a hack for that. Linkedin shows first name and initial for last name, asks you to buy premium to view this profile. Go to google, search for that name and add other keywords such as company name or university name from that linkedin profile (you will see this in a summary box), you'll find a linkedin search result on google with fullname. Now go back to linkedin and search with that full name, add company as a filter. Bam! ",

            "answer_text": "LinkedIn offers the free eval of various licenses periodically. I would not expect to see the same license review anytime soon or again at all. However, LinkedIn may entice you to try another subscription option. I encourage you to consider getting really good at LinkedIn before you spend money paying for Premium subscriptions. You could subscribe to the LinkedIn Business Premium and if you decide not to continue the subscription try LinkedIn Sales Navigator at another time. Be very careful though, LinkedIn payment policy clearly says no Refunds. Therefore, I encourage \u2018tire kickers\u2019 to subscribe month to month at first. This will allow you an easy out over the annual subscription. If you want to commit long term you can always renew the subscription later for the annual fee. I hope this is helpful. Tedd ",
