            "answer_text": "Read the book a second time. Seriously. I have a metaphor I use for remembering new information. You need to have hooks in your brain to hold on to things. If it\u2019s a subject you know, say, botany, and you already have a bunch of info on the subject, you have developed the hooks for information about plants. So if you read a new book that builds on that old information, you will retain more of it than if you are reading in an entirely different field, like linguistics. You don\u2019t have any hooks for linguistics, so the information has a tendency to slip away. If you find that you\u2019ve finished a book and don\u2019t remember any information, then start again from the beginning. You don\u2019t need to read the entire thing, but skim the chapters that you want to remember more about. But there are ways to build those hooks, and most of them are fairly simple. Read a chapter of your book, then write some notes about what you learned. Write, not type on your laptop. Writing conveys information to your brain in a different way than typing. It works the way doodling or fidgeting does. It helps you focus better. Or tell someone about what you read. The act of framing the new information in a simple explanation for someone else will anchor it in your mind. Even just doing this for yourself is useful. Close the book, close your eyes and ask yourself, \u201cWhat did I just learn?\u201d Bear in mind that you shouldn\u2019t expect to remember more than about 10% of what you read. What you should recall is the general information from the book, and how to find the info again when you need it. You might even want to make a list of books, with the title, author and general subject matter, so you can refer to it as needed. I find that if I read several books on the same subject in a row, I will retain the information much better than if I read a book on one subject, then another, and then a third on yet another subject. Some people\u2019s brains work differently, and they can read widely rather than deeply, and still hold onto what they learn. It\u2019s a matter of individual style, and you may need to try both methods to figure out which works best for you. Lastly, there\u2019s the matter of concentration and location. Just as doctors advise us to refrain from reading or using electronic gear in bed to improve our sleep, you need to have a place in your home that is comfortable for reading. If you want to take notes, you need a table that is at a good height to write on. If you are distracted by noises, then you need a quiet room where you can sit comfortably and focus on your book. If you are one of those people who enjoys music while you read, make sure it\u2019s not something that requires you to pay too much attention to it. I find that instrumental music helps me concentrate, but anything with lyrics is death on reading, even reading for pleasure. Most of this is common sense, and all of it is very personal, so you should decide what works for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A\u2026 Before getting into a proper response to answering your question, I like to share some broad perspectives about reading. At the deep level, reading doesn't give the reader a lot of \"knowledge\". I like to say unequivocally that the reader has only a lot of \"information\", and not \"knowledge\". To me, as I have responded to earlier questions on Quora (seeking a distinction between \"idea\" and \"information\") \"information\" is just an organised gathering or collection of facts, that are conceptually coherent and personally relevant to oneself. A post or a book or a magazine article or even a news broadcast that one has just read and/or heard and understood, is just \"information\". \"Information\" becomes useful as soon as you can see through it, from the standpoint of a specific pattern of relationship, or \"connecting the dots\" as Steve Jobs so eloquently put it for us, to come up with an \"idea\" i.e. the creative process, of using it to create a productive outcome or a concrete deliverable in your life, in your work, in your business, or even for your client(s). That's to say, there has to be a personal relevancy to action, in order to determine the usefulness or viability of \"information\". Upon putting the \"idea\" to work, then only one gets to know - and experience - whether the \"idea\" has worked, or didn't work. Better still, one may even get to know what might work better, or faster, or even smarter, the next time round. This is then aptly called, \"experience\". Over time, cumulative \"experience\" then becomes \"knowledge\". To recap, and putting this initiative in another way, reading a series of posts or books or magazine articles or even listening to a news broadcast, is \"information\", or what I like to call \"word experience\". Through execution and implementation with all the sweat equity, and not forgetting adapting and evolving in different application contexts through time, only then, one gets \"knowledge\", or what I like to call \"world experience\". The Smartest Person of the 20th Century Albert Einstein is believed to have said it best: \"Knowledge is experience; everything else is just information! Think about it. The Internet is invariably packed with lots of \"information\" (Sad to say, with all the Good, the Bad and the Ugly). A lot of folks always think that by just googling, they have lots of \"knowledge\". To sum up my point, \"knowledge\" is not measured by what's stored in the head; it's what you do and what you don't. That's to say, your ultimate productivity matters the most! That's why Elon Musk is so different from many of us. He puts what he has read to work. He has been a voracious reader since he was a kid. He has even devoured the entire Encyclopedia Britannica. Interestingly, he has read all about rockets and rocket science. He is now running three ginormous and complex projects: Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity. OK, now, back to your question: As long as your reading involves thinking about what you have been reading and doing what you have been thinking, as I have illustrated, you are likely to produce great results, probably just like Elon Musk. Who knows? Thanks for reading\u2026 for more help follow me on qoura.. keep reading,keep learning,keep upvoting,keep sharing\u2026 ",
