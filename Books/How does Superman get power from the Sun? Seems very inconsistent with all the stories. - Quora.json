            "answer_text": "Well the problem isn't new. Not even the writers agree on that. Some writers choose to say that Superman doesn't just absorbs solar energy but other energies as well.  Which other energies?! They never specify. And it is clear why they never do it. If they don't say which energies then it can't be debunked. Unlike the whole solar battery nonsense. And I say nonsense because of things like this\u2026  So in order to keep Superman depowered they need to place him in a jail with all those red solar energy emitters constantly on. At one point the facilities were damaged and the main reactor was gone, which made the solar emitters go down in power. All it took was exactly that, and Superman immediately began regaining his powers! Which makes absolutely no sense at all from a solar battery point of view, seeing he was several meters underground with no yellow sunlight to recharge. And Superman had been imprisioned by over a year if I'm not mistaken, so anyone that was thinking on commenting 'Maybe he still had stored yellow solar energy in his cells', then I say, stop right not! Because you're being beyond idiotic. All that time and any remnant of yellow solar energy would be gone. Also without any more solar energy to recharge how would his powers recharge on their own? So bottom line is that Superman powers (and thus the powers of all kryptonians) are not actually fully solar fueled. Sunlight does indeed seem to help sometimes, but most of the times it alone can not justify Superman power levels. Or those of any other kryptonian.  So you can either accept the solar and other energies explanation, or you'll have to make room for the other explanations. One such explanation is that kryptonians can directly draw on stellar energy. More so from the source closest to them. Here's one such example given to us by the Eradicator (which has kryptonian origins).  So the Eradicator on Earth, he could directly draw power from the Sun. Not only that, but because of his unique nature he could also manipulate the energies of the sun itself without even needing to be in direct contact with the sun. Which has more \u201crecently\u201d been used again only this time in another way and by Superman himself.  So as you can see here, the unbalanced power of Superman was drawing the Sun towards the Earth. Meaning he draws power directly from stellar energy. Meaning he's no battery but rather a conduit for all forms of stellar energy, except one\u2026 Red solar energy! Although in the past Batman has indeed given us this explanation\u2026  The truth is that what he says makes no sense whatsoever. If Batman had said that when exposed to red solar energy a kryptonian would lose all of their powers with the exception of those purely physical and mental (sensory input), now that would have been acceptable. For if the energy is still there in the body, it makes sense that powers like flying and heat vision can't be \u201caccessed\u201d but considering the energy is there in the body (it didn't simply disappeared) then all physical abilities had to remain until all energy was depleted. So on that aspect alone what Batman said made absolutely zero sense, hence it is worth nothing. What Batman said debunks itself. After all what Batman said is no different from saying your cellphone battery has energy but your cellphone can't use it just because. No actual explanation, just a simple \u201cbecause it is so\u201d. And I call that\u2026 \u201cIdiots Logic\u201d Another explanation that has been given and supported by at least two different sources was that Superman powers do not come from the sun but rather sunlight only acts as a trigger that activates those kryptonian metagenes.  So sunlight or solar energy that isn't red, serves to create super energy bonds, on a subatomic level. And it's that change in the subatomic behavior of the matter that makes up kryptonian bodies that gives them their powers.     And here we see The Chief (from Doom Patrol) that had captured a live kryptonian during the New Krypton arc, and did a full examination on its body. And the AI performing the tests determined that kryptonian powers are not a result of any special organ or their DNA. But rather the matter that made up the body of the kryptonian had an unique energy pattern. Once the Chief duplicated that pattern into his own human body, he immediately at night gained kryptonian powers. And we have been told time and time again that something unique is present in the bodies of kryptonians. Seeing humans have gained kryptonian powers from simple things as a lightning hitting Superman while he's touching you. Or during the Pre-Flashpoint period we even had a kryptonian device that was used to transfer memories during questioning, being used by a human primary school teacher on Superman. And that alone is enough to give her not just all the powers of a kryptonian but also other abilities like power transference and telepathy, that kryptonians do not naturally possess.  So it all began with something as simple as a kryptonian interrogation device.  Here is the power transfer that Superman and no other kryptonian has under a yellow star, but they do have it under a blue star.     Power transference is only temporary as it is with the power they gain with blue stars. And below you can see how even after all is fixed\u2026        \u2026that human kept the kryptonian powers all the same.  So lame explanations like this one\u2026   \u2026 Is no explanation whatsoever. Nature has its limits! It can't simply continuously evolve like there are no rules.  So the solutions to your problem are all present here in this answer. Or you can continue to believe in DC Comics official explanation and not understand anything, really because there's nothing to understand. You can't make sense of an explanation that is fundamentally wrong at its core. ",
