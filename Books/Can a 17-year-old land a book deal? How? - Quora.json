            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Age has nothing to do with publishing. Several teens have published novels in the past. It\u2019s only a matter of writing a tremendous book, then finding an agent who will represent it and sell it to a publishing house. Most people, regardless of age, take many years to do that, however. Learning how to write a compelling and marketable novel takes a very long time of reading and writing. There are always exceptions, but they are rare. You can also publish yourself on platforms like Amazon and Draft 2 Digital (among others), or get started by posting and critiquing on platforms like Tapas or Wattpad to get some more experience. I get this question a lot at school visits, and honestly, the number one thing a teen can do to prepare for writing and publishing a book is to go have adventures. That\u2019s hard during COVID, but it is important to not fall into the habit of just doing school, then writing, then school, then writing\u2026etc. Life experiences in the real world all add to the writer\u2019s toolkit.
