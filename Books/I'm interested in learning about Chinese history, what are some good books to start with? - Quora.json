For remembering names, i suggest mostly remembering the title of the emperor instead of name, most people in China do that too anyway, they would have a lot of trouble remembering the actual name of every emperor.

            "answer_text": "The Cambridge history of China is a must read. I grew up in a typical Chinese intellectual family with extensive exposure to Chinese history but still learned enormously from that book mostly written by scholars from the U.S and U.K. Unlike the traditional Chinese historians, they had better global view of Chinese history with incredibly solid evidence to back up.  In addition, they paid more attention to the economic and financial condition of each dynasty which used to be ignored by Chinese. ",
