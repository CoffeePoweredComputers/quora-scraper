            "answer_text": "I think that is something you can be fairly confidant of. BUT! Reading faster is not necessarily a good thing. Yes, I know this goes against what all the self-help books are telling you. Here\u2019s a question. Do you read to devour words, or do you read to get the content the author is trying to impart to you? If the second, then please don\u2019t worry about your reading speed. Concentrate on comprehension. Comprehension is everything, speed is incidental. With any activity in life, you can see that those who have done it long, and have spent the hours needed to perfect it, do it fluidly, with no hesitations, with no stumbling. Look at an elite figure skater, or gymnast. To the untrained eye their movements appear blindingly fast. I guarantee you that if you ask them, they will say that speed was NOT what they practised \u2026 precision was. The speed just happens, it\u2019s integral to precision. So with reading. Concentrate on doing it well. Speed will come. And yes, do LOTS of it! ",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. It certainly can\u2019t hurt but it is no guarantee of increasing your reading rate. Speed reading is a trainable skill involving eye movements and field of view. But reading speed is worthless without retention. They are difficult to find, but find some font books. They are usually public domain novels that start with large print and gradually the font decreases in imperceptible increments. These trick you into reading 50 pages in 20 minutes and the next 50 pages in 25 - 30 minutes. Your mind forces you to read at an increased speed to keep up your page pace. The secret to speed reading is skipping the spaces. You were taught to see a space as a pause between words. Your eyes need to constantly remain in motion to increase your reading rate. ",
