            "answer_text": "It will get \u201creturned\u201d automatically on the due date. There's nothing to digitally \u201creturn,\" although you may need to delete the expiration letter from Amazon or the book \u201ccover\u201d from your device. It seems as though I can finish reading an e-book after the expiration date on my Kindle Paperwhite as long as don't I return to the home page till I'm done with the book. The library actually buys a license to download the book to customers x number of times. They keep their license and the book, you get a temporary copy that will disappear when you return the book or when it expires. I don't know how that works, but it does. Borrowed ePub books, or presumably iBooks, may look a little different but work the same way. All of your Kindle books, purchased or borrowed, deleted or not, are on a list in the Amazon Cloud that you can see on the Amazon site. If you want a record, there it is, in Your Content and Devices. It's a pain to delete the expired library books from the list, so my list is miles long. Maybe they've fixed it by now. ",

            "answer_text": "How does an electronic book download from a library get returned? If you\u2019re using an eReader the most normal method is to download the book via Adobe Digital Editions (a free download), I\u2019m not certain if all eReaders can download directly but I download to my laptop before transferring the book to my reader. The software companies\u2014e.g. Kobo, Adobe\u2014cooperate to limit the time I may read the book on my device: most libraries allow 21 days, some allow only 14. At the end of that time, if I haven\u2019t renewed the book, my laptop still retains a copy of the file but the text turns to gobbledegook. It\u2019s called Digital Rights Management (DRM) and is used to protect authors and publishers. ",
