            "answer_text": "After 50 years with Judo a part of my life, I have some thoughts. The obvious answer is practice\u2026 but how much? Twice a week leads to slow but steady progress. Three times a week leads to much more rapid advancement of skills. To be a serious competitor requires cross training and additional focus on competitive skills under a sensei who has been a winner. But don\u2019t forget to let your body rest and use your mind to reflect on what is working and what is not matching your expectations (hansei). Although I once made it to the US nationals I was never a serious competitor. You don\u2019t need to win Shiai matches to get better at Judo or to gain life enhancing skills. Practice kata and techniques as well as randori. Kano (Judi\u2019s founder) focused heavily on kata early, not just at grading time. Uchi kome practice is how you develop the skills for randori and shiai. You cannot gain the muscle memory you need without repetition and focus on the small corrections every technique requires. Learn and internalize the guiding principles of Judo: Jita Kyoei means mutual welfare and benefit. It means you help your Uke take the fall. You give them a chance to tap out of an arm lock. And you help each other to learn. This principle applies in all aspects of life. Sei ryoku zenyo means maximum efficiency with minimum effort. It means BEND YOUR KNEES. It means apply kuzushi FIRST (off balance your opponent). When a technique is done right it is almost effortless. You can FEEL the flow of momentum when you get it right. Pay attention to the small details of your body and your uke to find the Sei ryoku zenyo. One thing I love about Judo is that it is a sport of an inch or two. Put your foot HERE and it takes huge effort to complete the throw. Put it one inch further back or turn it 20 degrees to face the right direction and suddenly the throw becomes effortless. This is hard to teach. First learn the basics of each technique so it becomes one movement. Then you are ready to learn how it really works. Look for the placement and angle of the feet. Watch the flow of uke\u2019s center of gravity through the whole throw. Tiny changes can make all the difference. Learn to be a good uke. Judo techniques and training are designed to allow you to fight at full force without getting hurt. That\u2019s why we learn to fall first. Falling skills are far more likely to help you than tachi waza or ne waza. My falling skills have kept me out the hospital at least three times. When you good at falling you can relax in randori. Then you won\u2019t telegraph your intentions through body tension. Your sword (body) becomes inscrutable as the zen master Munenori said. Show respect and demonstrate discipline. Bow properly (heels together, face forward, no slouching nods). Enter and leave the mat and bow in and out of class with your judogi neat and squared and your obi tied correctly. When not actively practicing, sit in seiza or cross legged and watch and learn. Genchi genbutsu means Go Look Go See. Resting does not mean learning stops. Never turn down a request to practice from a higher rank - they are trying to help you learn. In randori, practice with higher ranks or bigger judoka than you. You learn much more from someone better than you. As you advance, change this and share your knowledge with lower ranks too (jita kyoei). In ne waza (ground fighting), technique is equally important but they often do not have names. I have learned more from my current sensei about this in the past 3 years than in the past 30 years. Find a sensei who can explain what he or she is doing and why. Balance and leverage are even more important on the ground. Finally, pay attention to the fact that most judo techniques are defensive. Uke attacks, tori GIVES WAY, then takes control by applying kuzushi using uke\u2019s momentum, fits in (tsuri) to restablish solid kyosei (balance in the presence of opposing tensions) and then applies the kake (complete the throw). These are all one smooth movement when fully learned. Learning to counter an opponent\u2019s attack is essential once the basics of techniques have been absorbed. Judo is as much a philosophy as a martial art. It can influence all aspects of life and make you a more fulfilled and confident person. It has done that and more for me I hope you found these thoughts useful. ",

            "answer_text": "With 28 years in love with Judo this is my advice: Judo is not different from any other martial art or sport in this matter, only intense, continued practice and study can make progress in Judo, just to support my words take this video as I did, like the answer to most of my questions relate to Judo Masahiko Kimura  But to be more sensitive to your concerns, the uchi komi  practice is just wonderful to success, don't try to make yourself good many techniques, just pick one favorite (Tokui Waza), one to counter your opponents  resistance and one to counter their techniques (Kaeshi Waza). How to pick your favorite technique?, easy, don\u2019t do it, let your Sensei to take one the suits you, is simple to pick any one that impress you or others, but the thru is that maybe the right one for you, is not the one you like, but once you give it a chance and strain yourself really hard, to make it your favorite technique, you\u2019ll find the soft way.  And best of all Sensei's are just humans and can be wrong, but it's easier for him to evaluate the error and give you another technique because he can see at both, you and your opponent, and he have more experience than you. There are times when you get frustrated because you feel that you are not progressing or your strategy is not working with a particular opponent, in these moments increase your body resistance, do more repetitions and try work on principles, for example: \u201cThe inner circle\u201d, you can give your entire life to only this principle and won\u2019t be a waste of time and just one, but the one.  You\u2019ll be always progressing inclusive when you don\u2019t feel it, keep training ",

            "answer_text": "The only way to really improve it to train under a good instructor. Ideally you should be doing a combination of compliant drilling and randori - pick a couple of techniques, drill them extensively and apply them in randori too, then when you've built up muscle memory try another set of techniques, and so on, until you're confident in a few different ones. You need to train regularly to improve - it will take a long, long time to get even a basic level of competence if you're training only once a week. If you increase that to twice a week, you'll make progress much, much faster. Three times a week seems to be the optimum for someone training recreationally who wants to do a bit of competition - you make progress faster, your fitness levels improve faster, and you still have plenty of time to rest/recover and stay on top of any family/social/study/work commitments you might have. It helps to train with a range of abilities - you learn a lot whether you're training with a relative beginner or someone much better than you. Get as much exposure to different styles and body types as you can and as much time on the mats as you can. ",

After practicing so long, I found that you will not see the improvements immediately, but I suddenly found myself better after so long; probably after high school. It's tough when the people you practice with continue to beat you the same way, but they're likely getting better as well. I eventually briefly started teaching judo and saw that judo is not easily grasped; however, those who kept showing up improved. The learning curve is steep where physical strength and endurance will only take you so far, which makes the path to mastering judo that much more frustrating. That said, I understood why people stopped showing up. However, the whole process teaches you how to lose and I think that's the most important because it teaches discipline and respect for those who stick it out. ",

You only have a split second to react to the opponents shift in body movements force and direction, so having the muscle memory to correctly react to a given situation is very important. (when to attack or counter) Also do not just practice for the sake of practicing, what I mean is be conscious of your form and understand the fundamentals and purpose of each technique. If your a beginner focus on uchikomi and your entry techniques, solo and with a partner and have someone to comment on your form and technique. ",

At least, study the meaning of the throws in Japanese. It helped me a lot to think of things as \"Reaping - Hip - throw\" (Harai-Goshi), for example. And the obvious things, the difference between a \"Barai\"/\"Harai\" (a sweep) and a \"Gari\" (a reap), or \"If there is 'Koshi/Goshi', I must use the hip. If there's 'Seoi', the opponent must pass through my back\", etc. It even helped my double-leg, in jiu-jitsu. \"Morote-Gari\" (a \"Gari\" - reap - using both \"moro\" hands \"te\"), for me, is almost a short explanation. And I got that with a couple of days of searching for words and meanings, I'm not talking about years of serious grammar study. Try and see if it works! ",

From that point on whenever my teacher would instruct us to practice this kick, I would sit back and observe the other practitioners in my dujo do it. And I've emphasized observe because I havent just looked at them with tears of jealousy rolling down my cheek, I would put in the mental effort of analyzing everything they do, from the beginning to the end of the kick. Ive asked them why they do things the way they do (e.g \"why do you lift your elbow to shoulder height\"), and after a while I would apply what ive learned to my kick.
