            "answer_text": "There is quite a bit of work being done in the R community to handle larger datasets and there are a number of packages available. It is also the first choice among the statisticians / analyst community at Google where I work and I suspect that this is the case at Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, etc. all companies that regularly use \"big\" datasets.  For popularity of R among data analysis software, please review this article:http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/ From that same article, I borrow  a plot of Google Scholar hits for different statistical software across time. It is clear that R is growing steadily while SAS and SPSS are not.     Based on the comment requesting Google Search Hits stats, I am including some Google Trends plot for SAS, SPSS, Minitab and Stata. For obvious reasons, I could not find a clean search term relevant for \"R\"     I am including the plot of monthly traffic for different email discussion lists re: various statistical software from the same source as above.  http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/    see below for some example packages that address how to big data sets and parallel computing  (reference: http://industrialengineertools.blogspot.com/2010/10/r-references-for-handling-big-data.html) For a fuller listing, please see the CRAN page for high performance and parallel computing:  http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html  R is reported as being used by about half of all data miners in the 2011 Data Miners Survey http://www.rexeranalytics.com/Data-Miner-Survey-Results-2011.html Excerpt\" TOOLS:  R continued its rise this year and is now being used by close to half of all data miners (47%).  R users report preferring it for being free, open source, and having a wide variety of algorithms.  Many people also cited R's flexibility and the strength of the user community.  In the 2011 survey we asked R users to tell us more about their use of R.  Read the R user comments about why these use R (pros), the cons of using R, why they select their R interface, and how they use R in conjuction with other tools.  STATISTICA is selected as the primary data mining tool by the most data miners (17%).  Data miners report using an average of 4 software tools overall.  STATISTICA, KNIME, Rapid Miner and Salford Systems received the strongest satisfaction ratings in 2011. \" ",

            "answer_text": "I hate to say this but a good analyst will not rely on one single tool. For example, I like to use SAS for data clearing and data analysis because of its well support for querying funcationlity. But R provides way more rich packages for fancy data mining algorithms. You will find other tools such as python is even easier (if you like programming) to manipulate the data or change data from one form to another form. If you join a company and the company uses SAS, then price is never a problem to you. But when you are at home and want to do some fun stuff, yes, you are more likely to use R because it is free. So learning to use more than one tool is always helpful. When it comes to enterprise, it is even true that according to different IT support levels and different purpose and different knowledge level of senior management, the choices are different. Never let the different choice mislead you to think that one tool is a superset or always better than another. When it comes to you, you will always find some time that SAS is more handy than R and reversely some other time.So again I hate to say this but spend time on multiple tools rather than trying to seek the absoulte \"best\" one and stick to it is always true. I used to find the \"best\" programming language but always fail from time to time. Thank god that in data analysis world, there aren't that many new options poping up, isn't it:) ",

            "answer_text": "SAS stands for Statistical Analysis System. Nowadays SAS has become one of the major choices of every business. That\u2019s why it is becoming the market leader in commercial analytics space. SAS offers a variety of functions along with a great UI. These features help the individuals to learn this software at a rapid speed. Apart from that the individuals also get technical support whenever they require. SAS is a bit costly and doesn\u2019t provide the latest and most effective statistical functions. R: R is an open source programming language. It was developed by the researchers. That\u2019s why the majority of professor and researchers are using R. The best part of R is that it is an open source programming language. Due to its open-source nature, all the latest techniques get released immediately with R. This language is having plenty of documentation along with the community to helps its users whenever they get into trouble using R. SAS vs R 1.Availability / Price As I\u2019ve already mentioned that SAS is commercial software, not an open source. It is one of the most expensive statistics software. Majority of professionals are not able to purchase SAS. But the majority of large enterprises are using this software. That\u2019s why it is holding the larger market share than R. In other word SAS is not for an individual rather than it is for the organisation. On the other hand, R is an open source software. Therefore anyone can download it and use it by paying any charges. Price is a big concern between SAS vs R. 2. Ease of learning SAS is easy to learn for anyone whether it is a professional or the beginner one. Basically, SAS works on PROC SQL which can be easily understood by the individuals who already understand the SQL. Apart from that SAS also offers great UI to the users along with plenty of tutorials. These tutorials are quite helpful in understanding the SAS software. In addition, it also offers that complete user manual whenever you purchase the software. On the other hand, R is a tough programming language. It is quite tough for the beginner to use the R programming language. It requires lots of efforts and dedication to master the R programming language. R is a low-level programming language thus it needs a write a longer code in it. 3. Progress in the application R is an open source programming language, That\u2019s why it always get the latest features faster than SAS. On the other hand, SAS provides the latest features in the new updates. The development process of SAS is now becoming faster. On the other hand, R used by some of the professors in the past. The best part of SAS upgradation is that all its latest features analyzed in the managing environment. On the other hand in R there are not well-analysed features comes when we get the latest update of R., In fact, R provides an open source community where the programmers and researchers do their contribution to make R better.

            "answer_text": "As a consultant with one of the largest firms in the data science area, I have advised almost all my clients (I met an average of 2 fortune 500 CXO level folks every week) to move from SAS to R. And guess what, money was never the reason. Pretty much every large company has a boutique analytics division today, and SAS licenses are surely affordable for them. However, you'll find many of my favorite arguments listed in the answers already given. One thing I'll still repeat, is the community. With R users, help is always available, regardless of whether you want to pay for it or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at the moment as SAS can handle large datasets easily whereas it is somewhat a problem with R but because R is free and almost getting updated on a daily basis and with the rise in unstructured data, SAS needs to pull its socks up otherwise R and Python will overtake it! I do like the various graph options in R whereas for the same thing one will have to buy SAS Visualization tool! There are numerous blogs available online which will give a detailed difference - go through some of the blogs at Data Analytics courses @ Analytics Leap - you might find a better answer.

            "answer_text": "Yes, R can often be an alternative to SAS depending on what you trying to accomplish. SAS and R are two common programming languages and software packages which are often used interchangeably. SAS and R are typically used for data management, data manipulation and data analysis. The choice between SAS and R is often personal preference as many features and functionalities are shared between the two tools. One of the main differences between R and SAS is that R is open-source, meaning it can be obtained, used and modified for no cost. SAS on the other hand needs to be licensed for commercial and non-academic use. It is also worth noting that some SAS users who are accustomed to the point and click functions/tools in SAS, such as SAS Enterprise or SAS Visual Analytics, will find that R is much more programming based.

For example if I am running a code and I am stuck with errors, I can call up SAS and they will actually provide me help. This feature is very very useful. R is mainly used in research but there are some packages that are being recognised in business analytics. ",
