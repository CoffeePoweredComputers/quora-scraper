            "answer_text": "With AU$55000 you can live in Australia with your wife and kids. However, this is not a handsome salary an engineer or IT professional get. The very fact that you are getting PR visa means there is a shortage of engineers and IT professionals in Australia. Also on your arrival the Australian Government will not provide you and your family with any financial assistance for the first 102 weeks.I suggest well before you arrive here, start looking for job through seek.com.au and Australian News Papers if available in the place in India where you live. Please find the addresses of employment agents dealing in IT jobs in Melbourne (like Hays.com.au), and send your resume (your wife's too if she intend to work), inform the employment agents about your estimated date of your arrival in Melbourne which helps in finding a suitable jobs for you. If you have friends in Melbourne then contact them and ask them to provide the addresses of employers who may have some openings for you.Once you arrive in Australia start looking available jobs and my suggestion is take any available job in your area of experience, then build on that to look for more appropriate job.Hope this helps and Good Luck.

            "answer_text": "You can certainly live on 55,000 AUD for one year in Melbourne, you could probably do it for half that if you didn\u2019t mind living in a little flat outside of the centre of Melbourne. Whether you\u2019ll find a job in one year is really anyone\u2019s guess, you might find one the week you arrive, or it might take a year, I really couldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s guessing at that point. You can certainly live in Melbourne if you\u2019ve got $55,000 AUD saved though, you can rent a pretty nice place for $1500 a month if you don\u2019t mind being outside of the city, i.e. maybe 45 mins on the train, or slightly less than that in the car.
