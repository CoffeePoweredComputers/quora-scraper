            "answer_text": "I feel that the consequences you\u2019re facing are because of two reasons : You don\u2019t like to readYou haven\u2019t found anything interesting to read, yet.For the first reason, I don\u2019t think anyone else can help you except yourself. You need to do a thorough introspection and find out if you even like to read or not. Reading books because you think it\u2019s cool, or if you feel peer pressure, or if you feel it\u2019s a nice hobby to have, or it\u2019s a good habit to flaunt on social media, or you fear not reading at all are not the reasons to read. At that rate, I don\u2019t think you will ever enjoy reading. You should find something you really enjoy doing. However, if it\u2019s the latter, then I feel you might just be struggling with some concentration issues. I would suggest you start by reading short stories, short articles. There are several blogging sites like Medium, Wordpress etc. where you can read short pieces. It\u2019s not necessary that you need to read books in order to be an avid reader. Some people love to read the newspaper, some love to read poetry. You can take your pick! In case you want to try your hand at books, find out the genre that attracts you the most to read. If you\u2019ve been reading the same books since 5 years and have not been able to finish them, why not go for a change of books/genre. It\u2019s okay to not finish a book if you don\u2019t like it. Reading is a personal journey. If you really want to read, you need to keep trying until you find a book that stays. The book that lights up your mind. I\u2019m sure if you keep trying, you will definitely find a book that you just can\u2019t keep down! ",

            "answer_text": "Some people just don't like to read. I don't like to snowboard. It happens. If you want to enjoy a book, you have to find it interesting enough to hold your attention. I bet you watch movies to the end. Why is that? Likely because you enjoy the storyline or characters, or the growth a character portrays in his/her story. All these things are in books, as well. Just like binge watching a new Netflix show, you have to find one you like, and stick with it. ",
