            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know where you read that, but it\u2019s fake history! There are differences between Churches in what they regard as \u2018canonical\u2019 - official parts of the Bible. All Churches have the same New Testament: the difference is in the Old Testament. The New Testament consists of 27 books. In the Old Testament, the Catholic Church recognises 46 books, but Protestant Bibles contain only 39. The Catholic Church hasn\u2019t removed any books, but the Protestants have. Martin Luther, one of the first Protestants, also wanted to remove three books from the New Testament, but that idea didn\u2019t catch on. The King James Bible was translated for the Anglican church, under the influence of Protestantism, and contains only 39 books of the Old Testament. It also contains a section called the \u2018Apocrypha\u2019, which consists of the books the Protestants removed from the Catholic Bible. However it presents them differently - so the book of Daniel (in the Catholic Bible) was turned into the KJV\u2019s Book of Daniel, and three \u2018stories\u2019 which were put into the Apocrypha. If you add up the bits of books which the KJV lists as \u2018Apocrypha\u2019, you get 14 books. So the Catholic Church didn\u2019t remove booksthe King James version was therefore not influenced by the Catholic Church in doing sothe Protestants did remove books - and some of them would have liked to remove more - and the KJV was a Protestant Bible.However there was a Catholic who influenced this, but he lived 1200 years earlier. St Jerome, who translated the Scriptures into Latin and finished this work in 405AD, preferred the \u201cHebrew\u201d canon of the Old Testament to the \u201cSeptuagint\u201d one. Other Catholic at the time - including St Augustine - disagreed, pointing out that there were quotations in the New Testament which came from the Septuagint, so it made sense to use the Septuagint in a Christian Bible. The Protestants of the 1600s were recycling Jerome\u2019s arguments, which had been discounted by the Catholics. ",

            "answer_text": "The KJV of 1611 is essentially a transliterated Latin Vulgate presented in English. If you can read Latin, then you can see the word selection quite clearly. King James I tried to be both pro-Catholic and pro-Protestant when it came to the exact translation. He gave strict orders that if there was conflict between the Latin and the Greek that the remedy would be to resolve the conflict in favor of the Latin. He wanted to avoid controversy even if the heart of scriptural truth favored Koine Greek. The KJV of 1611 included the 14 books we know as the Apocrypha. These were the books removed in 1684 from the Catholic version. These books were regarded as sacred but not inspired. The drive to print scripture in English combined with the influence of education with the ability to read English by the common man spearheaded the publication. The English Puritans made a good faith argument that the \u201cBible\u201d should only be the \u201csole scriptura\u201d, that is, one book of only the inspired scriptures. Wisdom and historical literature that was not inspired should not be included. The Catholic Church did not want believers to leave the Roman Catholic Church to align with the growing Protestant movement. Therefore, it was still regarded as sacred but not inspired. A change ensued. Publishers printed both KJV Bibles, the with and the without Apocrypha, based on demand. The New English Bible of 1971 still included the Apocrypha between the Old and New Testaments. Neither the Catholic faith or the Protestant faith ever associated any subscription of the Apocrypha as a condition of salvation and eternal life. This matter should be just a footnote in Christian history not a major event. King James 1611 edition included the Apocrypha to mirror the Catholic version at that time. ",
