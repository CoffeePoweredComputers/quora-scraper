            "answer_text": "You question has social and psychological aspects. As for reading aloud to become a better speaker, the answer is yes it will help. But if you want to do that to improve your speaker skills, without going into a very elaborate training, I will give you one tip related to what you are already doing: Practice saying aloud what YOU think was the meaning of the sentence or the paragraph you just read. Take one idea you just read, including its supporting arguments.Think what it means, how you would say it in your own words.Then say it aloud in your own words.How do you feel about it?Adjust your statement until you feel that what you are saying is exactly what you mean.Then practice making that statement aloud and with conviction.You might find it a little difficult at the beginning but you will get better fast.It will take you far beyond than just reading aloud something written by someone else. The trust you have in the author artificially helps you speak with more conviction. Then, you fall short when it is something you speak about that comes from you. The exercice above will help increase that confidence in yourself while practicing without having to write something beforehand. GillesVelocityReading.com ",

            "answer_text": "Reading aloud is useful when the goal is proofreading, because you can force yourself to read the words exactly as you have written them, whereas when you read silently your mind is more likely to insert the words you intended to write.  For instance, reading your question details aloud, a few typos jumped out:  1. \"help be\" instead of \"help me\"2. \"this made me\" instead of \"this has made me\" If the goal is making sure what you have written is what you intended to write, reading aloud can be helpful.
