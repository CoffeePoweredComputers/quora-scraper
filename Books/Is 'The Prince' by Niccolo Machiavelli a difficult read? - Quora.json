            "answer_text": "It's written in Medieval Italian, so, if you're a monolingual American, it would/will be difficult. In translation into English, it is not difficult for so someone with schooling through at least 10th grade by standards in place to the late 1980s. I would recommend reading about \u201cThe Prince\u201d in Cliffs Notes and others like it before you start. It's a lot easier to read and understand an opus when you have an idea of what to expect. Next you'll be reading Marcus Aurelius \u2014 and enjoying having read it. Much more enjoyment comes from having read a difficult work than in reading it. ",
