            "answer_text": "Well, apparently there are many wrong ways that you can try to kill yourself. Rat Poison - I don't know why people have this obsession with rat poisoning, Ekta Kapoor has totally brainwashed people's minds. Firstly, yes you might die due to rat poisoning, but it might even take weeks, in fact it takes about 3 or 4 days to notice any symptoms. At first there will be internal bleeding, resulting in loss of blood through urine and stool, then vomiting, followed by scars and bruises on your face, and then if you are lucky, if there is an organ failure, then you might die.Hanging yourself on the fan - Well, nowadays fans are made of plastic, and are designed to hold maximum 25 kgs and if you live in an apartment, then there's a pretty slim chance of experiencing instant death, as you need to drop from minimum 9 feet to die instantly, without pain, and apartments are not usually that tall. In old houses, fans were made of steel and ceiling used to be very high, they don't have the provisions these days.Jumping off your building - Well, now we are talking about possibilities, but note this, even jumping off the 6th floor of a tall building has a fatality rate of less than 33%, and you'll end up on a wheelchair, paralysis maybe.Cutting yourself with a sharp object - Well, be sure as to where you are cutting yourself, a cut at a random place on your body might just result in bleeding and then clot, you will not die, rather end up in severe pain from which you'll scream to escape, and just disturb your neighbours.So, be assured as to how you decide to kill yourself, and please do let me know about it.

I\u2019ve been having pervasive suicidal thoughts for a long time now, but I realized that I don\u2019t want to die, I just want my life to get better. Isn\u2019t that what you want? Wouldn\u2019t you prefer your life to get better rather than just end it all and never know what sort of happiness you could have potentially obtained if you stayed alive? Think not how to kill yourself, but how to better yourself and your overall life. instead of dwelling on finding ways to end your life, use that same energy in figuring out ways to make it better. Because you know deep down in your heart, that if things in your life weren\u2019t shit, and they got better then you would love to be alive, right? So stop wasting your time thinking about what you really don\u2019t want to do ( killing your self), and focus on what you really want ( to make your life better). makes sense now doesn\u2019t it?\ud83d\ude0e ",
