            "answer_text": "It's not that hard to get good marks in 2nd PUC,make sure to have a fixed time-table throughout the year Trust me,there is no need to study anything out of NCERT Now,let me tell you the strategy for each subject CHEMISTRY: \u201c Make sure your reading the complete ncert book \u201c First,you just go through the book, the best trick to remember the book is to make questions from every possible line from the NCERT book Revising is key,what matters the most is how much you revise and not how much you study. So,keep revising from the questions you made earlier. At some time, you will be so perfect that you will literally have the whole textbook in your mind. I recommend jeevith book for guide,the book has divided the whole chapter in terms of questions,it will help you to guess the type of questions that will be asked(this book is enough according to my opinion) MATHS: Again,nothing much is required other than NCERT book. Try to practice every problem atleast once. Calculus might be bit difficult, try to get it taught by a good teacher . Tip:Analyse past year papers and find out the type of questions frequently asked and practice accordingly if you do not have much time. PHYSICS: Studying from NCERT is bit difficult for physics,so make sure you have a good study material from college or any other publication(again, I recommend jeevith).I had studied from the study material given by my college. Numericals are not that hard in 2nd PUC,so understanding everything conceptually and solving from jeevith might be enough(you can even refer expert book) LANGUAGES: There is no particular strategy for languages because it mostly depends on evaluator. Make sure that you are attending all the tests of your college and make a fixed pattern of attending the language paper,because you will rarely get enough time for completing the exam especially in case of Kannada. Following this will definitely promise you a good score, If you follow all my tips strictly you can even score 100 in PCM Make sure that you solve previous papers in real time(3 hrs). All the very best\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb ",

            "answer_text": "Well, fist things always first, you need to set yourself a perfectly laid schedule(time table) and must try to follow it up, as much as possible if not strictly. Having a properly planned and organised schedule would surely prove to be an integral step towards your success, accounting for almost half of your job done and making things easier for you. Practice becomes a key aspect in your exam preparation and throughout the period you must devote yourself entirely for the purpose without any distractions. Being thorough with the prescribed NCERT text books forms the primary objective, be it for any subject. So before referring any other guides and reference material, reading NCERT books is of at most importance, thus make a habit and get acquainted with reading NCERT books. The more you practice effectively, the better results you reap. Solving the previous year question papers will surely help you up your confidence levels and strengthen your command over the subject. So try giving yourself as many of those mocks as possible, before you attempt the final exam, which will eventually help you in developing the much needed exam writing skills and prepare you mentally for the exam. Lo hogayi tayyari!! You must be ready now for your exam, having followed whatever I just said. ",
