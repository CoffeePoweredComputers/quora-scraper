            "answer_text": "Honestly, this question can be answered by reading the books carefully. She\u2019s been described in \u201cThe Son of Neptune\u201d and a few more details along the way of the Heroes of Olympus series. She\u2019d basically look exactly as she\u2019s been described. There is an issue with a characters description in a book though. Everyone has their own exact image of how someone looks. There is always the similarities because of hard set limits in the book, of course. Everyone\u2019s image of Reyna will have her have black hair, however, person a imagines her with short black hair while person b imagines her with black her that reaches to her mid back, as a simple example. Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is, there is no definite answer to how she\u2019d look in real life, because her looks are variable per person. There are major similarities (like the hair example), but the specifics, which is what makes for an non-identical look, would be different for each person. Only uncle Rick would be able to tell us EXACTLY how she\u2019d look, since he created her. ",

She is Puerto Rican and has a darker skin tone. Her height is never mentioned, but because she is always described as being \u201cregal\u201d and such, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s on the taller side. She is seen throughout the series wearing a purple toga over golden armor decorated with medals. ",
