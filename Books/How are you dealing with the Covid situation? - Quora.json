            "answer_text": "This question we all have to ask ourselves; great question. It\u2019s been a hard adjustment to say the least! I feel sadly for those who are suffering most. For me, I work part time from home so the adjustments aren\u2019t bad. Now that we can get out, it\u2019s wonderful with social distancing with family and friends. I think like anything in life, we have to go with the flow and make things work. Eating healthy, exercising and getting plenty of rest during this time is essential. I try not to watch a lot of news, as I feel that may be unhealthy; we can get overwhelmed with too much information. Wishing you the best in this phase of all of our lives! ",
