            "answer_text": "to learn the gestures and the moves : maybe a week. or less. to get confortable and to make some work with regularity and reproductibility (i.e. being able to leave your work for two days and take it back without noticeable differences of crocheting, tightness etc\u2026 I\u2019d say 6 months of very regular practice. the most often you crochet, the quicker it comes. (bonus advice : do not attempt to make a scarf before completing that step or you\u2019ll be so disappointed by the wonky results. the beauty of a scarf is in the perfect reguarity of the pattern and wideness and you can\u2019t achieve that before getting yours hands \u201cdone\u201d to the craft :). Make potholders, kitchen cloths, tawashis, \u201cinter frying pans\u201d (crocheted circles to prevent the metal against metal etchings), DO NOT make scarves until you perfectly master the regularity and do not even have to think about it to be perfect :) ) ",

            "answer_text": "A couple of hours for thr basics. I learned how to crochet by watching a basic instructional video on YouTube. Then once you learn the absolute basics which is chain then single crochet and turning. You can build from there learning new stitches which goes single, half double, then doubles and so on. In the first 6hrs after learning the most basic step I crocheted a couple of small fingerless gloves. You have to learn what each stitch is called to follow any pattern out there as they all use abrieviated forms of the names of the stitches. I learned how to crochet in a few hours. I've since gone from beginner to intermediate level and I started crocheting back in March. My husband teaches me whatever doesn't make sense as he crochets too. I love making blankets and hats and I've done a couple of scarves. Once you learn how to do the basics it's easy to learn from there. ",
