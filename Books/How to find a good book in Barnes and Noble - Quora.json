            "answer_text": "Question: How can I find a good book in Barnes and Noble? Define \u2018good book.\u2019 What do you consider \u2018good\u2019 in a book? I personally enjoy books on science, philosophy (probably going to end up as my college minor), politics (my major in college is political science) and religion. I also ended up getting a book on learning the basics of Spanish to hopefully learn extra while also taking my clase de Espanol in college. I currently even own a great copy of the Qur\u2019an that I got from Barnes & Noble for less than $40 that is in great condition and has the text in Arabic, English and is full of commentary and an introduction that has the history of Islam in it and I also found a Bhagivida Gita there too, along with many other texts from diverse religions. I also own a copy of Mein Kampf, primarily because I am eager to study the logic Hitler employed and what he thought as well as contemplate how his deranged, illogical thoughts convinced so many. My point is that what is considered a \u201cgood book\u201d is subjective and depends entirely on your interests. So, to help you decide what a good book you can get, ask yourself to following: Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction?: Whichever you prefer to read on a daily basis will determine what kind of book you should get to read for fun.If fiction, what genres you prefer?: Science fiction? Historical fiction? Mystery? Horror?If fiction, which authors have you read already?: If you\u2019ve already read a Stephen King book and liked it, go for another King book. Or, better yet, find an author who inspired King. H.P. Lovecraft, for example. You can get all his major works in one book at B&N for around $20.If nonfiction, are you seeking to look more on something you know about or learn something new?: Say you know a ton on Biology. In that case, get a larger book that goes more in-depth on the topic. If not, get introductory books. Look at me with my book on Espanol. I could have gotten a huge book on learning all of it, but I chose an introductory book because I am, at best, proficient at understanding it but can\u2019t speak it for crap (despite taking a high level Spanish course in college right now). However, I read tons on history and would seek a more in-depth book on it most of the time.You can ask these kinds of questions to see what kind of books you want to get and to look for them in the store itself. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Richard McKeen\u2019s answer was great. I just wanted to add something. Once you have determined what type of book you would like, do not be afraid to ask for suggestions either from the staff, or other customers browsing the section that interests you. I have friends who own a used book store, and the love to give suggestions. I have found some of my favorite books this way. I have also, as a customer, given suggestions to people who asked, or who seemed to be struggling with what to choose. People who really like books, or anything really, usually love to share their expertise on the subject. Happy reading! ",
