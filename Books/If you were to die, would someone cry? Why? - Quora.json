I can say my family and friends will cry but for that to happen I should die now tomorrow they may hate me for something I did. But as an organ donor I hope someone receiving my organ will cry for me for sure but soon it will be wiped with the smiles of their family and friends. That person will cry for the death of my soul while keeping part of my body alive. ",
