            "answer_text": "You can do it by sleeping for 4.5 hours instead of 4. Please note that you must cut down on your sleep only occasionally on the days where a dire need exists. If you make lesser sleep a habit, you will hurt your health and peace of mind in the long run. That said, a complete sleep is not about sleeping for 8 hours.  For example, you can wake up tired even after sleeping for about 8 hours or you can even wake up fresh by sleeping for only 3 hours or 4.5 hours. Are you thinking \u201cThat\u2019s impossible for me. I sleep over 7 hours but still feel sleepy in the morning.\u201d You wake up tired because you did not wake up at the right time. Waking up 20 minutes earlier could have changed this all. You can wake up fresh with lesser sleep by understanding the concept of sleep cycles. The ideal time to wake up is based on the time you go to sleep. If you get into bed exactly the same time every night, the wake-up time is as easy as eating a cake. It will be at the same time every day. Unfortunately, we have dishes to do, TV to watch, an unexpected phone call to answer and so on, making it difficult to go to bed at the same time every day. In most cases for most people, going to bed at the same time is like the timing of a flight departure. There is a time of departure mentioned but we already know that it won't be accurate. Similarly, since your sleeping time varies you have to calculate the ideal time to wake up on a daily basis by understanding sleep cycles.  Calculating your wake up time using Sleep Cycles: Sleep consists of sleep cycles of 90 min or 1.5 hours each. Every night you go through multiple sleep cycles. The hack that you can use is, to ensure you wake up towards the end of the sleep cycle. If you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle, the cycle is broken and you wake up exhausted. If you wake up towards the end of one cycle or early in the next cycle, you tend to remain fresh. Please note that the sleep cycle starts after you fall asleep(not when you get into bed). Therefore, you must also take into account the time you need to fall asleep. As per statistics, most people need 14 mins to fall asleep after they get into bed. Let us take an example. If you get into bed at 10:45 PM and fall asleep at 11 PM, the ideal time for you to wake up is around the mark of 12:30 AM, 2 AM, 3:30 AM, 5 AM, 6:30 AM and so on. If you didn\u2019t notice, all these slots are multiple of 90 mins since you fell asleep. Waking up at 12:20 AM or 2:10 AM or 5:05 AM is fine and will still keep you fresh. Waking up at 1:30 AM or 5:30 AM is breaking your sleep cycle waking you up at a point that you hate getting out of bed. In simple words, aim to wake up within the last 10 or the first 10 minutes of a sleep cycle. Do not wake up in the 10\u201380 minute window of the sleep cycle. On the long run, it is recommended to sleep for at least 6 hours on average. You can still wake up fresh with 3 or 4.5 hours of sleep daily, but it is not a good habit to follow in the long run. How many hours of sleep is good for you is subjective and varies from person to person. Some people manage with only 4.5 hours of sleep while some need 6 or 7.5 hours. Since there is some math involved, you can avoid all those calculations by using this link when you hit the bed - What time should I wake up to not feel tired? It tells you what time should you wake up. The green slots indicate sufficient sleep while the orange slots indicate shortage or excess sleep in the long run. It takes into account the 14 minutes that you need to fall asleep too. All you need to do is pick a slot among the many slots on the link and set your alarm. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a challenge for you. Put the four fingers of your non-dominant hand (if you\u2019re right-handed that\u2019s your left hand, and left-handed then it\u2019s your right!) on these keys on your keyboard. D F G H Now in a moment press them in the following order: FHGD. Not yet! Do this as quickly as you can and time it - see how many times you can manage it properly (FGHD isn\u2019t good enough) in 30 seconds. Okay, go! Do the same thing again tomorrow. Guess what? Without any further practice you\u2019ll almost certainly have improved! (No refunds if it doesn\u2019t happen, though!) Why? Because while you slept your mind will have been working on helping you learn that. And a thousand other things you\u2019ve taken in during the day. \u2026 But there\u2019s more - a lot more. Sleep also performs a range of vital services that we know about, and there may well be others of which we\u2019re unaware. So we need to be aware that there may be risks tampering with its structure or duration. We need sleep that operates in a very specific way. People with depression, for instance, go into a dream state far earlier than others, and although there is insufficient evidence to draw confident conclusions, this may be one of the reasons why they wake feeling they haven\u2019t benefitted from it. There is a specific structure and specific lengths of time to our dreams and non-dream states. Our dreams increase in length as we go through the night, and in between them we have periods when we seem to be \u2018thinking\u2019 without conscious awareness. Tampering with these natural systems may not be wise. In addition, we need to be aware of the many other functions sleep can provide so long as we don\u2019t mess with it: Our brain cells contract during the night so that waste material such as dead cells can be cleared. Our body\u2019s core temperature has to drop during our sleep - rats that were prevented from doing this died after just two weeks. Clearly this temperature drop is vital although we aren\u2019t yet sure as to what function it performs. In addition there are a number of other known benefits that come from sleep, such as the body repairing and healing itself, emotional issues being addressed, and the storing of information. Further, we know that long-term sleep deficiency can cause a range of major problems - including, in the long-term, dementia. So many wonderful things happen when we\u2019re asleep! There are claims that we can cut down sleep and not be affected, but I\u2019ve yet to see reasonable proof of this. So I can only recommend that you allow yourself to sleep as nature has determined rather than trying to overrule her. Perhaps there is a way to compress sleep, but what happens to the hours you spend dreaming? And what about the time you seem to need where you aren\u2019t dreaming? What we do know is that usually if you are sleep-deprived then you will do less well in all sorts of ways - including in the DFGH test! Good luck. ",

If for some reason you are in a condition to allow yourself only 3\u20134 hrs of sleeps here\u2019s how you can pull of a day(productively) - Steps() Exercise when you get up , some stretching , jogging , basically get warmed up .This should get your body in energy mode.When you take the shower do a hot - cold switch , to really wake you up.(you have to cruel to yourself)You have to consume high energy boosting foods. You would want to stay away from high carbs which take to long to digest , or high sugary material like cakes and candy stuff , this will lead to a spike in your blood sugar, followed by a sugar crash and a dip in your energy.Research a little and find those foods which give energy boost with high blood sugar level. For e.g yogurt , popcorn , green salad.Consume highly caffeinated drinks throughout the day , to keep yourself alert.Take power naps of 45min\u20131hr during the day followed by light exercise to keep yourself alert.If you feel too much clutter in your head, you can clear it with caffeine or a micro-nap. Micro-nap works only when your mind is at its limit and full of clutter.Put on some white-noise , sleep for 30 -min .P.S - your body can\u2019t handle this on a regular basis , 2\u20133 days tops.I suggest you don\u2019t do this . It is really harmful for the body as well as the mind. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say there are a few things you can do for effective sleep that may \u201cfeel\u201d like you got 9 hours sleep. However I would never recommend getting 4 hours of sleep if you can help it! Here are some good tips: 1.) Do not be around blue light before bed (your phone, tv, tablet, kindle\u2026..). It can keep your brain from being truly ready for sleep, sort of like taking a nap after being active in the sun. 2.) Do yoga/meditate/do a pre-sleep activity. Have a sleep pre-game mentality, something you do every night before sleep. I read before bed every night. I have trained my body to think: reading=bedtime. Have a routine before bed! 3.) Be free from sleep-stopping drugs. Alcohol (1-hour metabolic rate for an adult male) should be avoided before bed. Coffee (a 6-hour half-life) should be avoided in the evenings, even if it doesn\u2019t \u201ceffect you\u201d. Your sleepy receptors in your brain have been blocked, let your body do its thing. 4.) Make sure you wake up at the correct time in your sleep cycle. I have other writing on this where I go into more depth, but it goes like this: Ever wake up from a nap feeling awesome and ready to go? Ever wake up and feel worse than you did when you laid down? Usually that depends on where you were in your sleep cycle when you woke up Waking up at the correct time in your sleep cycle is not an exact science (although some apps, like SleepCycle, can help) but the easiest thing is to train your body with the same bedtime and wake-up time every day.

            "answer_text": "Sleep is an indispensable part of our lives that is essential for our physical and emotional well-being. Getting an inadequate amount of sleep can make a person feel less productive and also damage our brain cells in the long run. Coming back to the original question of how you can sleep 8 hours in 4 hours. A person can consider getting a biphasic or polyphasic sleep for him to be productive throughout the day. Biphasic sleep involves sleeping during two periods in 24 hours while polyphasic sleep involves sleeping 3 or 4 more times. It helps the person to get quality sleep and the person feels more alert and focussed. While this kind of sleep isn\u2019t advisable in the long run, it can help you perform better at work if your work requires you to put in some extra hours. Getting at least 6-7 hours of sleep is essential for every person to be functional and maintain his immunity. A lack of sleep can make a person less immune to infections and diseases. Therefore, if it isn\u2019t possible for you to get a 6-7 hour sleep in one go, you can consider getting a biphasic sleep. You should also make certain changes to your lifestyle such as avoiding caffeine before bed, exercising daily, and indulging in healthy eating to keep yourself in shape and stay productive throughout the day.

            "answer_text": "There is a technique called power nap. It is a short nap with is taken to increase your mental alertness and release stress. Getting 8 hour sleep in 3 hour or less would not be beneficial as according to a new study sleeping more leads to a sttong and more permanent memory than compared to sogging your night hours in front of the lamp. However during the day when you have even an hour of free time you can take a short nap which would be beneficial and would act as a stress buster. To get the benefit of 8 hour sleep you should take a minimum of four to five hour sleep at night and do insert a nap or two during the day time. Sleep enerziges our brain and restores the neural connections and reduces the synaptic tension between the neurons. Thus it is absolutely necessary for our brain as brain would not be able to make new connections and hence new memories without sleep. ",

Aim for quality when we can\u2019t get quantity. Reduce your caffeine intake. Relax before bed. Meditate. Yoga. Exercise.

Sometimes we get what we aim for. Sometimes we don\u2019t. ",

But you could get most of the rest out of those three hours. Take heavy deep breath before nap .Do some pushups before nap , so you could get exhausted and fall asleep quickly .Room should be dark enough .Room Temperature should be moderate .Hope you find answer useful ;) \u270cPeace ",

From what I saw, it is quite clear that you cannot sleep 8 hours in 4 hours. It has been tried, tested and nothing worked. You cannot sleep fast. There are some things that just cannot be done. Some people want to sleep fast because they sleep late and they have to wake up early the next day. Your mind works according to its own rules. The truth is that we have very little control of our body, sleep is one of them. You can stop yourself from sleeping but you cant force yourself to sleep unless you take a sleeping pill. It is not possible to sleep 8 hours in 4 hours. ",

Sleep in a dark place, but make sure it is not to hot and there's fresh air flow. If you want to fake that you slept 8 hours. You might take a cold shower, since it causes for a shock reaction, you'll be awake immediately. Caffeine will help a great deal as well, keep in mind that after some 4\u20136 hours the effect is gone. Then there are amphetamines as well. A hundred times more powerful than caffeine, but more dangerous as well, and costly (only buy it from an official apothecary, otherwise you'll kill yourself). ",

Well , a few points need to be taken care of and you will be good to go. Never sleep on empty stomach. I repeat never. It's advisable to have something atleast before an hour of your sleeping time.Inculcate more carbs and fibres in your diet. Carbs on being broken down to simpler substances create a loss of energy , which promote a good sound sleep.Drink lots of water. Water is good for brain functioning. Greater the oxygen at your disposal , Sounder the sleep you get.Find a fixed time to sleep. People with a fixed sleep routine are always rewarded with an effective sleep.Try inculcating these few things in your lifestyle. There are 90 percent chances if not less that you will sooner be highly productive on your sleep. ",

Definitely try to get at least six hours of sleep whenever possible because you can\u2019t make up for a sleep deficit in the future. The negative effects are physical and mental so do your best to find a good sleep schedule that works for you and adapt to it! For me it was a trial and error process until I found the best and easiest times for me to sleep are midnight to 8am, but of course that changes some nights if I can\u2019t sleep until later or get tired earlier. If insomnia is still an issue for you after trying to get into the habit of sleeping at the same time or at least for the same amount of time every night, you may need to try melatonin or get a prescription sleep aid to help get you on a better sleep schedule.

It goes through the same schedule every night and what does not get done, does not get done. The body will not pick up where it left off. I have never read what the schedule is. Maybe nobody knows.

Second: Try and understand your stress factors. Things thats making you more anxious. See if you can avoid few. Meditation is something which can be practised to get that mental rest.
