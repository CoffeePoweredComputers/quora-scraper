            "answer_text": "Yes. Ok, jokes aside, your question is very vague, that's why I have such answer. Really, you could at least write your age, what kind of books do you like, fiction or nonfiction etc. If we talk in general here is something to consider.  Fiction books are usually easier than nonfiction. Adventures are usually easier than drama. Children book... Well, it's too obvious. Interesting books are easier than boring. More generally, the books that are about something that you care about are easier. For example, suppose that you are an artistic type of person. To read a book about dancing could be fun for you, while a text book on quantum physics will be almost impossible to read. Not because you are unable to comprehend the subject, but because you don't care about it and you are forcing yourself to read and this process seams like torture. If you find the right book for you it will be hard to drag you away from it. The only problem is to find such a book. There is no universal solution for everyone, obviously. Here is my advice: try different books, as many as you can. Try different genres, authors, time periods. Until you find your kind of books. But don't stop there, there may be more than one kind of books for you. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIt may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime...\u201d \u2015 Khaled Hosseini, The Kite Runner  Love for books is one such thing, if it happens, it would change the whole paradigm and the way you perceive this world.  And you don't need a \"good and easy to read\" books to make you fall for them.  They are an enigma who draws you towards them and never let you go.  Reading books is like a setting on journey of self-discovery, you never knew that you liked a certain genre till you read them.  So i would recommend that you read more and more books of different genre.  What i can really help you with is recommend you good starting point from different genres.  1. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini.  A beautiful story of guilt and redemption set in Afghanistan.  2. Shantaram (novel) by Gregory David Roberts. Based on a true story of a convict and a heroin addict who fled to India after breaking out of prison.  Surreal biography with unbelievable plots and twists. 3. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. A satirical novel which is setup in a sci-fi world.  4. The Notebook (novel) by Nicholas Sparks. A heartwarming love story which has inspired many directors to bring the story on celluloid.  A must read for romantics at heart. 5. And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie.  A blood thrilling classic which is relevant even in the modern times.  Christie is the best selling author of all time and this was her one of the best works. Honorable mentions: The Lord of the Rings, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Atlas Shrugged. However, i would add that you can avoid reading Popular Classic Novels Books when you're just starting as they lack in modern day references that you can relate to. Hope this helps.  Happy reading.
