            "answer_text": "I am not a doctor, but I did work as an EMT for over 15 years, a cop for over 24 years and have served 8 years in the Army. I am over 68 years old, and still have a vivid memory of my father telling me about the Spanish Influenza pandemic that took place when he was 8 and 9 years old. He told me of playing king of the mountain atop stacked coffins filled with the victims of the deadly disease. That too began slowly then accelerated rapidly into a nightmare that most chose to forget because the memories were just to terrible to cope with. I am afraid we are on the brink of another such outbreak, and if so, I pray it ends within a year. While I don\u2019t see civilization breaking down over this, I can see it is, to some extent, uniting the political parties to work toward the continuation of our nation post infection. I am hoping to survive the major impact, living in a very rural area does, perhaps give me a bit of an advantage, however we also suffer from a lack of supplies when the pipeline drys up as it is already showing signs of impacting us. As was advised by the mayors of the east coast when talking to the mayors of the major west coast cities: Set your seamstresses to sewing shrouds, set your carpenters to building coffins, and set your construction workers to digging graves. This may well be as good advice in 2020 as it was in 1919 about 101 years ago. At first I thought that folks were going overboard, I still feel this may be the case, however when the Supreme Court canceled their hearings in the next session, I became very concerned, I have only read of this happening once in recent memory, that being the Spanish Influenza of 1918. Now all around everything is canceled. I can\u2019t even get in the local nursing home to visit my mom, who calls me a couple times a day wondering why I have abandoned her after promising her I would see her regularly. Being her last surviving child, it is hard on both of us, my two sisters who died last year would have celebrated birthdays this month. It\u2019s tough on everyone but the old folks suffer the greatest, as is always the case. I am just recovering from a bout with seasonal flu that morphed into pneumonia, I was happy that I was in good enough health to recover at home with a couple doses of antibiotics from my good doctor. That said, it was a bit of a hint at what may follow. Our Sate announced they have cancelled all school classes from Kindergarten to graduate school for perhaps the rest of the school year. Indeed, I am worried, and I am staying home. Our daughter who lives with us works full time at a motel as a manager, and part time as a volunteer Ambulance Squad member, she has been an EMT for over 25 years now, we are proud but she does have an increased risk as she must respond to those ill with this damn virus, and may well bring it home. Guess that\u2019s what I get for bringing up a wonderful daughter who cares for not only her crippled up old folks but the people of our town as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How dangerous is the coronavirus (COVID-19)? A: Very. [ This answer was originally posted Jan 30, 2020 ] [18 Mar update: With their own outbreak appearing to be under control, the Chinese government is engaging in a massive disinformation campaign, to deflect attention from the fact that THEIR negligence lead to the virus, via poor food hygiene standards, and then made it MUCH worse by hiding it for 2 months (Nov 2109 thru early Jan 2019). This article outlines some of those issues, and has links to a variety of documenting sources. China is not at blame for the US\u2019s incompetent response: the US CDC has primary responsibility for that. But China is to blame for the existence of the virus \u2014 through negligence \u2014 and for it\u2019s spread \u2014 through corrupt attempts at concealment and cover-up. ] [10 Mar update: The quarantine in China seems to be working. It appears that S Korea may be getting things under control. Unfortunately, the \u2018day-late/dollar-short\u2019 quarantines in the West are not working well: see this site, to track the numbers: Coronavirus Update (Live) ] [28 Feb update: As of today, WHO raises coronavirus threat assessment to its highest level'. This is official permission to, well, not panic, but to be deeply concerned!] [ 25 Feb update: Just today, the US CDC gave everybody permission to \u2018panic\u2019: US health officials say coronavirus will likely cause a global pandemic ] An important distinction: \u201cCoronaviruses\u201d are a class, and not an individual thing. The coronavirus that\u2019s in the news had the extremely awkward name of \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d but is now \u201cCOVID-19\u2032 and there are other names being used, including just \u201ccoronavirus\u201d. However, other coronaviruses cause: SARS => Severe acute respiratory syndrome - WikipediaMERS => Middle East respiratory syndrome - Wikipediaabout 20% of colds: Coronavirus Infections\u2014More Than Just the Common Cold (JAMA)And then, of course, the awkwardly named 2019-nCoV from Wuhan, China: Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - Wikipedia causes the COVID-19 infection. Though the reported mortality rate of 2% is much lower than previous Chinese-sourced coronavirus infections, such as SARS, COVID-19 appears to be much, much more infectious than previous coronavirus infections. As a result, current projections indicate that 2019-nCoV will kill many more people in total than SARS or MERS have done. [16 Feb 2020 update: COVID-19 has now killed 1775+, and is still going strong. That is more deaths than SARS & MERS combined. ] Current reports suggest that infected people may be symptom-free for TWO WEEKS AFTER they beginning shedding the virus. If this proves to be correct ,2019-nCoV is likely to be impossible to control. Even worse? The US CDC now confirms that COVID-19 can be transmitted by infected individuals who show NO symptoms: Coronavirus can be spread by people who don\u2019t show symptoms, CDC warns And 2% mortality, with a 90% infection rate, means many, many more deaths than people seem to realize. Even with an 80% infection rate, a 2% mortality means that  30 Jan 2020: WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency31 Jan 2020: U.S. declares public health emergency over coronavirus7 Feb 2020: Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation reports (from the UN\u2019s WHO)12 Feb 2020: China reports gush of retrospective COVID-19 cases13 Feb 2020: Cruise ship from hell gets worse: Cases Of COVID-19 Soar On Quarantined Coronavirus Cruise Ship25 Feb 2020: Today, the US CDC officially gave everyone in the US permission to \u2018panic\u2019: US health officials say coronavirus will likely cause a global pandemicGiven how carefully the UN\u2019s WHO, the US CDC, and similar agencies avoid drama, there statements are pretty alarming. Also, this answer: Mitchell Tsai's answer to How serious is the 2019\u201320 Coronavirus? is much more complete \u2014 but also much, much more technical \u2014 than mine.  COVID-19 coronavirus facts: Few of the \u2018facts\u2019 are known for certain, and may change over the next month. It is clear that China has been \u2018managing\u2019 the news about 2019-nCoV, and both the US CDC and the UN\u2019s WHO consider \u2018news management\u2019 to be part of their mandate, as well. So . . . you should know that the situation is at least as a bad as they say, but may be worse, and may be much worse than China reports..Mortality is reported to be ~2%, so if you get it, you have a 98% chance of surviving. Reportedly, the mortality is lower among children & adolescents, but higher in older adults. .BUT . . . even survivors can take THREE WEEKS or longer to recover. Being stuck in bed for 3 weeks is no joke. For example, students may have to repeat the year..But, it is apparently extremely infectious, and nobody is resistant, much less immune. SARS \u2014 also courtesy of China \u2014 was much, much less infectious. Current figures suggest that up to 90% of people exposed to COVID-19 even slightly, will be infected..Reported mechanisms for transmitting the coronavirus infection are VERY hard to completely eliminate, and includeperson-to-person saliva, directly or via dropletperson-to-person nasal & respiratory secretions (snot) , directly or via airborne dropletsperson-to-surface-to-person, presumably from either saliva or snot on those surfaces.China is now (15 Feb 2020) disinfecting bank notes, which is very concerning: China Quarantines Cash to Sanitize Old Bank Notes From Virus.It is unknown how effective efforts to contain 2019-nCoV/ COVID-19. The range of possibilities goes from very effective to very ineffective..Regardless of containment efforts, the apparent infectivity of 2019-nCoV virtually guarantees that everyone will be exposed eventually, UNLESS a vaccine is created first. So is it dangerous? If containment efforts cannot slow expansion enough to allow most people to receive a vaccination, death rates may be close to those with the 1918 influenza epidemic.For example, if 75% of the worlds population is exposed within 18 months (not long enough for a vaccine!), then 63 million deaths can be expected. This assumes a world population of 7 billion, at 75% exposure rate over 18 months, an 80% infection rate, and 1.5% mortality rate. Most people would consider 63,000,000 additional deaths within 18 months dangerous..Regardless, the economic impact will be huge, with most US and European airlines and airports eliminating or greatly restricting flights to China. Control efforts will require closing malls, schools, theaters, churches and so on. This has been done in the US before, with the poliovirus. But the US was far more rural, with far fewer points of contact than is the case today.Just imagine the effects of closing the subways in New York and London!.Bottom line? Facts are emerging and may be revised. But based on current information COVID-19 is very dangerous indeed..What can you do?First, prepare for perhaps a month at home, with no travel. You\u2019ll need food, entertainment. and some water. Worst case, utilities are likely to keep working, so you don\u2019t need to go all \u2018prepper\u2019..Ask that your politicians pressure China, and other nations, to outlaw the human consumption of \u201cbushmeat\u201d and the like. The new coronavirus apparently came from eating a bat!These national food habits have led to many serious infections, including SARS, Ebola, and now WuFlu. Also, kissing camels (really!) needs to be sanctioned, since it is a significant contributor to the spread of MERS.

            "answer_text": " YES, IT IS A SERIOUS OUTBREAK. The COVID-19 (Corona Virus) can be classified among similar pandemics like the Ebola Virus which emerged in 2014 with a recorded a death toll of about 12,000 before it was declared over in 2016. Latest updates on the statistics of the COVID-19 cases revealed that there has been an estimate of 87,000 cases worldwide with a death toll of nearly 3,000 and about 43,000 patients who have been cured. As at today, The governor of Washington declared a state of emergency after a man died there of COVID-19, the first such reported death in the United States. More than 50 people in a nursing facility are sick and being tested for the virus. It will shock you that, In what appears to be a rather drastic measure to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID 19), North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un allegedly sanctioned for the execution of the first North Korean patient tested positive for the deadly strain of the virus. THE PATIENT WAS SHOT DEAD What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Symptoms of Infection: Common symptoms of infection include; respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Prevention is better than cure WHO has issued new COVID-19 guidance for businesses and employers, which outlines simple ways to prevent the spread of the virus, things to consider when employees travel and how to get your business ready in case COVID-19 arrives in your community.

            "answer_text": "Serious? Yes, but only for those who are elderly or unable to seek proper medical care. Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to possess a very special combination of two attributes. First, it would have to be so unfamiliar that no existing therapy or vaccine could be applied to it. Second, it would need to have a high and surreptitious transmissibility before symptoms occur. The first is essential because any microbe from a known class of pathogens would, by definition, have family members that could serve as models for containment and countermeasures. The second would allow the hypothetical disease to spread without being detected by even the most astute clinicians. The three infectious diseases most likely to be considered extinction-level threats in the world today\u2014influenza, HIV, and Ebola\u2014don\u2019t meet these two requirements. Influenza, for instance, despite its well-established ability to kill on a large scale, its contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift away from our vaccines, is still what I would call a \u201cknown unknown.\u201d While there are many mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at least the time of Hippocrates, humans have been attuned to its risk. And in the modern era, a full-fledged industry of influenza preparedness exists, with effective vaccine strategies and antiviral therapies. HIV, which has killed 39 million people over several decades, is similarly limited due to several factors. Most importantly, HIV\u2019s dependency on blood and body fluid for transmission (similar to Ebola) requires intimate human-to-human contact, which limits contagion. Highly potent antiviral therapy allows most people to live normally with the disease, and a substantial group of the population has genetic mutations that render them impervious to infection in the first place. Lastly, simple prevention strategies such as needle exchange for injection drug users and barrier contraceptives\u2014when available\u2014can curtail transmission risk. Ebola, for many of the same reasons as HIV as well as several others, also falls short of the mark. This is especially due to the fact that it spreads almost exclusively through people with easily recognizable symptoms, plus the taming of its once unfathomable 90 percent mortality rate by simple supportive care. Beyond those three, every other known disease falls short of what seems required to wipe out humans\u2014which is, of course, why we\u2019re still here. And it\u2019s not that diseases are ineffective. On the contrary, diseases\u2019 failure to knock us out is a testament to just how resilient humans are. Part of our evolutionary heritage is our immune system, one of the most complex on the planet, even without the benefit of vaccines or the helping hand of antimicrobial drugs. This system, when viewed at a species level, can adapt to almost any enemy imaginable. Coupled to genetic variations amongst humans\u2014which open up the possibility for a range of advantages, from imperviousness to infection to a tendency for mild symptoms\u2014this adaptability ensures that almost any infectious disease onslaught will leave a large proportion of the population alive to rebuild, in contrast to the fictional Hollywood versions. While the immune system\u2019s role can never be understated, an even more powerful protector is the faculty of consciousness. Humans are not the most prolific, quickly evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet, but as Aristotle identified, humans are the rational animals\u2014and it is this fundamental distinguishing characteristic that allows humans to form abstractions, think in principles, and plan long-range. These capacities, in turn, allow humans to modify, alter, and improve themselves and their environments. Consciousness equips us, at an individual and a species level, to make nature safe for the species through such technological marvels as antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines, and sanitation. When humans began to focus their minds on the problems posed by infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short. In many ways, human consciousness became infectious diseases\u2019 worthiest adversary. None of this is meant to allay all fears of infectious diseases. To totally adopt a Panglossian viewpoint would be foolish\u2014and dangerous. Humans do face countless threats from infectious diseases: witness Zika. And if not handled appropriately, severe calamity could, and will, ensue. The West African Ebola outbreak, for instance, festered for months before major efforts to bring it under control were initiated. When it comes to infectious diseases, I\u2019m worried about the failure of institutions to understand the full impact of outbreaks. I\u2019m worried about countries that don\u2019t have the infrastructure or resources to combat these outbreaks when they come. But as long as we can keep adapting, I\u2019m not worried about the future of the human race. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not dangerous in terms of the probability of each individual\u2019s full recovery, but it presents concerns for the hospital system because it transmits fast and no one is immune. The true mortality rate, even for vulnerable populations, seems to be below 1%, thankfully. This is not sinking in for average Americans, who are walking around terrified, convinced they, individually, must avoid the virus at all costs or die. This unwarranted fear is driving irrationality that may ultimately harm more people than the virus itself ever would have. We knew about the psychology of pandemics before this one arrived. People fear the unknown. When West Nile was new, it was all you heard about, and everyone believed it had a 10% fatality rate. Now that all the data is in, we know that rate is below 1%. But no one wants to hear about statistics like this right now. They like to hear about stretchers being stacked in the hallways of hospitals, hospital ships docking in NYC, healthcare workers getting sick themselves, and they love most of all the random \u201coutlier\u201d stories such as the 25-year-old with no preexisting conditions who is in the ICU, or the 44-year-old healthy father of five who died. Job loss increases mortality by 73%, and the Great Depression killed many and traumatized others for life, but people can\u2019t imagine living through that as easily as they can imagine being added to the number of those killed by this \u201cdeadly virus.\u201d Therefore, rationality and logic have left the building, absolutely no balancing is taking place, people are exclusively focused on \u201cstopping the virus at all costs.\u201d This behavior is grounded in pure fear, emotion, and irrationality. You will hear otherwise smart people (those capable of earning income from home) declare vehemently that they will stay inside for three months to save \u201cthousands of lives,\u201d suggesting that anyone who disagrees this should be done is a killer. Well, some people actually HAVE to leave in order to EAT, so that\u2019s a pretty immediate need. Moreover, the flu killed 62k Americans in 2017\u201318, so under this theory (any sacrifice is warranted to save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d), we need to quarantine every winter. Coronavirus transmits fast, and we don\u2019t want it to overwhelm hospitals. The virus is already everywhere, so this is really our only control over it\u2014ensuring everyone who needs care is able to receive it. But you hear almost zero from the media about actual hospital capacity. It\u2019s all about \u201cdeaths doubling\u201d and \u201cpassing China\u201d and \u201cover 100,000 cases now.\u201d This makes the virus seem way more dangerous (in terms of the probability of each individual\u2019s full recovery) than it actually is, which humans are already psychologically primed to believe. A LEADER needs to step up, call out the groupthink and psychosocial dynamics, and put this virus into proper context before humanity\u2019s collective panicked, anxious grasp for \u201ccontrol at any cost\u201d destroys the entire planet.

            "answer_text": "Back when HIV was first discovered (in a flurry of activity far less spectacular and much slower in scientific terms) there were all sorts of ethical and legal arguments that arose from the threat that patients carrying that contagious virus posed to the community. Remember Magic Johnson retiring? Now, let me tell you three things: \u2018In 2017, there were 16,350 deaths among adults and adolescents with diagnosed HIV in the United States and 6 dependent areas. These deaths may be due to any cause\u2019. (U.S. Statistics). Let that sink in. People are complaining that COVID-19 patients are being classified as fatalities when in fact they \u2018died from other causes\u2019. Well, even when you include all mechanisms of death for AIDS patients in the USA you get less than 17000 people in a year. COVID-19 has killed 100,000 people in six months.SARS-CoV2 also infects immune system cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects T lymphocytes through its spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Yep. The same sorts of cells whose number and behaviour we use to determine the severity of HIV.HIV has well-researched and well-established treatment paradigms with effective antivirals that can render the disease almost dormant for decades. More exotically, there are actually populations of people (in Scandinavia, mostly) who are naturally \u2018immune\u2019 to HIV. (HIV Resistant Mutation).None of these things are true for COVID-19.In summary, on one hand you have a well-known, treatable disease with minimal mortality and a large number of asymptomatic carriers and on the other hand you have an immunologically-invasive phenomenon with often unpredictable cascading consequences of organ failure that have now been linked to widespread involvement of endothelium. The world needs to realise that right now you are much better off contracting HIV than COVID-19.  SARS-1 left lymphocytes alone. SARS-2 doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t replicate in T-cells, but I\u2019ll bet my bottom dollar they don\u2019t work so good once it\u2019s in there. ",

            "answer_text": "Surprisingly, despite all precautionary measures taken, the latest estimation would be a fatality rate of somewhere in the range of \u20181 in 50 million\u2019 (correction, I meant 50 per million! \ud83e\udd74), with respect to all estimated cases. For starters, that's not sounding really threatening in the first place. (Which isn't my conclusion, by the way. Just started with referring official numbers and statistics.) Formally it's not a pandemic, but still an (worldwide) epidemic. The meaning of the word \u2018pandemic\u2019 has been adjusted a bit. But that's oke.\ud83d\ude0e\u270c\ufe0f Officially, a more recent scientifically based fatality rate estimation, with respect to confirmed cases, named the \u2018case fatality rate\u2019, was said to be 0.26%. Meanwhile it's estimated somewhere between 0.1 and 0.2%, which is almost the same as the flu. Some sources even mention less than 0.1%, i.e. less deadly than the flu (which already does have a vaccin, not to forget). Below 50 years old the chance of dying is about 0.001% or less. Twenty years or younger practically zero. About 99% or more of all fatalities suffered from underlying illnesses. It's less contagious than the flu, for the influenzavirus is much more common. But due to this, the human body has more problems resisting the relatively newer, less common coronavirus, with of course, in particularly Covid19. Our immune system isn't very familiar with it (yet) and adjusting will be harder, in some cases much harder. Hence becoming immune will take longer, with healthy people being longer contagious as well. And due to this more dangerous to a small, vulnerable group of people in multiple ways. I.e. in general not at all quite as dangerous as first predicted by far, but unfortunately very dangerous to a specific group of vulnerable people. I.e. the flip side of this would be the fact a certain group of highly vulnerable people are particularly at risk. Healthy people, unaware of infection, are infecting vulnerables. Those vulnerables will much more likely developing severe symptoms, with a 20 till 30% fatality rate. That's another story and really something to be seriously considering. However, it puts some questions with respect to measures taken worldwide, which seem to be counterproductive in many ways. The last thing to do is ordening everybody to stay inside. It creates a perfect environment for this particular virus. Also severely decreasing health, resistance and fitness, due to stress, lack of sunlight (and vitamin D3 production) and lack of exercise. Not unimportant either, lacking physical contact lowers immune systems as well. With the virus spreading through the air and (bad) ventilation systems. And important, practically not having a chance outside or in well ventilated places. The longer being within an infected area, the bigger change of getting ill and the more severe its symptoms will become. A lockdown after a lot of people already were infected, putting sick people between the healthy, has proven to be causing the peak in the weeks after. Hence (like) the superspread events. The second biggest mistake would be the wrong treatment per patient. All patients are treated the same, as having coronavirus, which puts people's very lives on stake, when suffering from dangerous underlying symptoms. And that's exactly what seems to have happened, unfortunately. Herde immunity in the strictest sense is a fairytale with respect to coronaviruses, by the way. That has been proven numerous times with respect to all known other coronaviruses, as well as in animals. However, with respect to all viruses we're probably getting pretty close by now, for our body produces typical (corona)virus antibodies. A sort of (effective) one size fits all, one might say. \ud83d\ude09 Just making small adjustments from infection to infection and per type of (corona)virus, if possible. Fear and (moral) panic are some of the reasons the wrong, in some cases even counterproductive, measures were taken, and models weren't adjusted after important new scientific conclusions and information. Which may sound like an oxymoron, but unfortunately isn't uncommon at all in times of crisis. The perfect storm, one might say. \ud83e\udd14 Only hoping something will be learned from this, with respect to future precautionary measures. \ud83d\ude0c PS: It's also tempting to start calling - like some did - the WHO, and others who were simply following its advice and warnings without questioning, things like: \u201cA bunch of rank, arrogant amateurs!\u201d and \u201cAll balderdash and chicanery!\u201d. Or: \u201cIf their IQ\u2019s would be displayed in temperature, the whole globe would be turning into \u2018Snowbal Earth, Part Two\u2019!\u201c. But I won't. \ud83d\ude09 (In case of \u2018Snowball Earth, Part Two\u2019, Covid19 would be the least of our problems, so every disadvantage has its advantage. And a bit of humor helps putting things into perspective, doesn't it? \ud83d\ude42) However, what I do want to say is the fact they indeed could've (or probably should've) done better in general and just hoping we'll do better from know on. Unfortunately, I don't discount the possibility we could have been better off, if it hadn't been for the WHO. \ud83d\ude44 ",

            "answer_text": "Coronaviruses are not particularly dangerous. There are 4 strains circulating among people, all of which cause mild upper respiratory infections (aka common cold). However, 3 strains (SARS, MERS, and nCov) cause deadly pneumonia. These viruses only circulate in animals, and cause occasional outbreaks among people. Generally speaking, being too lethal is not good for viruses, as infected hosts may be too sick to spread the disease. For example, SARS is infectious only when patients are very sick, which makes it less likely to spread (actually the majority of transmission occurred between patients and doctors). As a result, viruses causing mild, less lethal diseases are favored by the selective pressure. Such rule does not apply to zoonotic viruses however. Because these viruses don\u2019t circulate among humans, but animals instead, they are adapted to animals but not human. When they infect a new species, they may be either too weak (i.e., unable to spread at all) or too aggressive (i.e., unable to spread efficiently). However, if the viral spread continues, viruses causing milder diseases are more favored until it reaches an equilibrium. For example, the Spanish flu (which was an avian flu strain) was very lethal when initially introduced to human, but eventually became milder seasonal flu strains[1](contrary to people\u2019s belief, the Spanish flu was never gone, as some genetic segments are still circulating). However, we should remain cautious as something unexpected may happen during the adaptation. Because human adapted viruses will be very different from the initial one, anything could happen during such a long evolution path. For example, a mutation that enables the virus to replicate faster or evade the white blood cells better may increase both the infectivity and lethality, which is advantageous in the short term. This could probably explain why the death toll of the Spanish flu spiked at the second wave. So even the general trend is becoming better, something nasty can still happen.

            "answer_text": "The World Health Organisation says that approximately 80 per cent of those with the virus recover without needing any special treatment. And only one in six becomes seriously ill - that's around 15 per cent of cases which are severe, and 5 percent which are critical. According to a report of a joint World Health Organization-China mission of 25 infectious disease experts held in China late last month, 80 per cent of known cases are mild - which are not dangerous. There is also a slim chance of being hospitalised with a moderate case, unless the individual is really struggling to catch their breath or are exceptionally dehydrated.  And in severe cases, coronavirus can lead to pneumonia which is life threatening. However, government advisers in the UK believe that the chances of dying from coronavirus is between 0.5 percent and one percent. Intensive care specialist Professor Hugh Montgomery spoke to Channel 4 about how infectious COVID-19 is compared to the flu. He explained that when one person has flu, they infect an average of 1.3 people. Each of those people can then go on and infect a further 1.3 people each. If this happens ten times, the one person who originally contracted the flu has caused a further 14 people to get it. Who is most at risk? Anyone over the age of 70 - regardless to underlying health conditionsAnyone under 70 with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancerPregnant womenAnyone taking medication that weakens your immune systemSome of the symptoms are similar to ones you would experience with a cold or flu, so it can be difficult to differentiate - see what symptoms there are in a mild, moderate and severe case below. Symptoms of a mild case Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said: \"[A] mild infection starts normally with a fever, although it may take a couple of days to get a fever. \u201cYou will have some respiratory symptoms; you have some aches and pains. You'll have a dry cough. This is what the majority of individuals will have.\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security continues by saying it is \"nothing that will make you feel like you need to run to a hospital.\" These symptoms can usually be treated by drinking plenty of fluids, taking pain medication as needed and resting at home, but if they worsen contact your GP.

            "answer_text": "This disease is very dangerous made more dangerous by the leadership in the USA. Typically Trump and his myopic type blame China, the victim and hero, for this situation instead of their own incompetence. . First of all China was faced with a novel virus that took time to determine it was not a common cold or flue virus. It took time then to determine what and how bad the virus was. Then it took time to verify the information to make sure the virus was something other countries needed to be careful with. Even with that required study and investigation, China was still able to tell the world the genetic make up of the virus by January 9th 2020. Some western countries began to take measures on the presumption the virus may turn into a pandemic at that point. Trump and his administration thought for some reason the US would not be bothered by the disease, it was China\u2019s problem. Even with his own investigation people warning of a possible pandemic, Trump continued to ignore the seriousness of the disease until March 13 2020 when he called it a national emergency. China showed the world how to deal with the disease but Trump and his minions want to blame China for their incompetence. China was a hero not a hindrance at fighting this disease. Now the US is the epicentre of the disease which will be with us for sometime thanks to Trump\u2019s incompetence. There are more than one million infected in the US and many more to come. Each time this disease has a chance to replicate it can mutate. The US has given this disease the ability it needs now to come back and infect everyone with a mutation of its original form that will be even bigger and more robust than what we face now. Thanks to Trump\u2019s incompetence the world economy has been brought a halt. Makes you wonder if it was incompetence or something he could use to vilify China some more then use as an excuse to start a war with them. ",

            "answer_text": "It is very dangerous! COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that is spread by droplet spread and body fluids. It has an R0 (defined as the number of other people an infected person will subsequently infect) of at least 2\u20133 (This number was published early on by the WHO based on data from China which, IMHO is extremely flawed given the experience now unfolding around the world and especially in Europe). My personal opinion is that the R0 is much higher\u2026 Much has been made in the media of the apparently low mortality with this virus\u2026 Well, that is false! Again the false data from China gave that impression and the experience elsewhere belies that! Part of the problem is the use of the case fatality rate as a metric of mortality\u2026 Doctors and epidemiologists, because we know exactly what its definition is know what the case fatality rate means - and, also what it doesn\u2019t mean! Clearly, the media, politicians, and the general public have little comprehension here and therefore use the data well out of context\u2026 The first misconception that needs to be dealt with is that the case fatality rate is written in stone\u2026 It is NOT! As soon as either the number of cases reported or the number of deaths increases then the previous calculation of the case fatality rate becomes invalid and the calculation needs to be with the updated data. In fact, this is also true for other measures of mortality (and we will discuss these measures shortly)\u2026 To understand what the case fatality rate is, and is NOT, telling one, one needs to understand how the case fatality rate is defined: case fatality rate = reported deaths (to date) / reported cases (to date) Now this definition is fixed and can be found in any publication dealing with public health or epidemiology. It provides a running rate of mortality as a percentage of total cases. Nothing more and nothing less\u2026 It is an EXCEPTIONALLY poor metric of real mortality especially early on in an epidemic for reasons that will become clear\u2026 The big problem with the case fatality rate as defined above is that it mixes active cases with closed cases to provide a fatality rate. A closed case is a case with an outcome - either death or recovery. It really makes no sense to calculate a mortality rate and include cases that are still active! After all, one does not know the outcome of those cases yet! The result of this is that the real mortality rate is vastly underestimated by this calculation because all the active cases are included as part of the denominator\u2026 However, if one calculates mortality using ONLY the closed cases then a very different picture emerges\u2026 Case fatality rate (at 17/03/2020) = 7173 deaths / 182683 as a percentage is 3.93% Mortality rate calculated using ONLY closed cases (at 17/02/2020) = 7173 / (7173 + 79883) as a percentage is 8.24% Calculating mortality using only closed cases, especially early on in an epidemic, where the proportion of active cases to total cases is high, is a much more accurate measure of true mortality\u2026 Astute readers may also have realized a couple of things about the case fatality rate and mortality rate according to closed cases: Firstly, as the epidemic progresses the two numbers trend toward each other; and Secondly, once the epidemic is over (all cases now closed), both calculations will yield EXACTLY the same result! Now, I believe that the data from China is very flawed! The reason I say this is that the apparent pattern of this epidemic is SO DIFFERENT comparing China with the rest of the world that is difficult to believe that one is looking at data from the SAME epidemic! Now, in order to stay on topic with the question (and I will shortly make the connection between all this stuff about different ways of calculating mortality with the essence of the question) I will not go off on a tangent to explain all the reasons why I believe the data from China is fundamentally flawed. Rather I will demonstrate, now that the rest of the world has both more cases and more deaths than China, the extraordinary differences between China and the rest of the world with respect to this epidemic\u2026 Chinese data: case fatality rate = 4% Mortality rate (as per closed cases) = 4.5% The reason why these two percentages are pretty close is that, according to the statistics anyway, China does not have many active cases and the proportion of active cases to total cases is now fairly small. Rest of the World data: case fatality rate = 3.9% Mortality rate (as per closed cases) = 26% Looking at the case fatality rates one can be seduced into thinking that the rest of the world is having a fairly similar experience to China\u2026 However, looking just at closed cases it is clear that things are MARKEDLY different - so different in fact it is hard to believe we are on the same planet! The real (closed case) mortality rates outside of China are SIX TIMES greater, with change left over, than China\u2019s closed case mortality rates. I do not believe, FOR A SECOND, that this is due to China\u2019s \u201cworld beating\u201d medical system (as if!) is responsible, or any of the other possible reasonable fudge factors like incomplete reporting, different population demographics making people more of less susceptible to dying from this virus etc! This can only be due to systematic fraud on the part of China to hide the true reality of the consequences of this epidemic! Now back to the question! Is the COVID-19 virus dangerous? An unqualified YES! It is both extraordinarily contagious and it is a killer! That current closed case mortality rate of 26% that I calculated for the rest of the world is a MUCH more accurate and sobering number than any statistics that include China! Yes, I expect that closed case mortality rate to drop some as this epidemic progresses, but not by that much! And, when one realizes that COVID-19 is a NOVEL virus and that no individual (apart from the relative handful who have recovered from COVID-19 infection so far) has any immunity to this virus and prominent virologists (I am not a virologist but rather an intensivist) and epidemiologists are predicting that 40\u201370% of the world\u2019s population will be infected then a death toll of 500 million is very plausible! Perhaps the panic amongst the stock markets around the world and the extraordinary measures being implemented around the world by nearly every government on earth now make some sense! I do not advocate panic, and the purpose of sharing this information is not to make people panic but rather to inform\u2026 Nonetheless, I see this epidemic as being the biggest event in the history of anyone who is living, and once this is over we will be living in a world that has fundamentally changed\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "COVID-19 is now the name for Corona Virus, so named because it appears to have a \u201ccrown\u201d around it when viewed under a high powered microscope. The current information we have is that most cases (80%) are very mild, resembling the common cold, and a mild one at that. Some people may be infected and not even know it. These people may be carriers of the virus. For the other 20%, the symptoms can be quite severe and resemble the flu, (influenza). This means symptoms like a cold, only with a fever, body aches, chills, and maybe pneumonia, becoming very serious. The fatality rate is very low, ranging between 2 and 3%. Which is no comfort if your loved one dies, (I understand). Pneumonia is a medical condition where a build up of fluid in the lungs makes it difficult to breathe. This can be signaled by a raspity or rattling sound when breathing in and out, pain in the chest, and a dry cough, with or without mucous. In extreme cases of Pneumonia, the patient\u2019s lips may turn blue, and this is time for emergency action, as this means the patient cannot get enough oxygen. We also know that COVID-19 rarely strikes children. There have been no juvenile cases, so far, but can be very hard on the elderly. So, if you or anyone you care for has a runny nose, cough, sneezing, and a fever over 99*F, seek medical attention. The odds are that is it NOT COVID-19, (the Corona Virus), because the Respiratory virus season runs from October through May. But, if it is, you will want to know in order to protect your family and loved ones. ",

Some people have no symptoms at all, while others become so sick that they eventually need mechanical assistance to breathe.  The risk of developing dangerous symptoms of COVID-19 may be increased in people who are older and also in people of any age who have other serious health problems \u2014 such as heart or lung conditions, weakened immune systems, severe obesity, or diabetes. Older age People of any age, even children, can catch COVID-19. But it most commonly affects middle-aged and older adults. The risk of developing dangerous symptoms is higher in people age 65 and older. The highest rate of mortality from the disease is in people age 80 and older. Risks are even higher for older people when they have underlying health conditions. Nursing home residents are at high risk because they often have multiple underlying health problems, combined with advanced age. And germs can spread very easily between people who live in close proximity to each other. Lung problems, including asthma COVID-19 targets the lungs, so you're more likely to develop severe symptoms if you have preexisting lung problems, such as: Moderate to severe asthmaChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)Lung cancerCystic fibrosisPulmonary fibrosisWhile some medications for these conditions can weaken your immune system, it's important to stay on your maintenance medications to keep symptoms as controlled as possible. You may want to talk to your doctor about obtaining an emergency supply of prescription medications, such as asthma inhalers.

            "answer_text": "Attention!!! COVID-19 is NOT a low risk virus, it\u2019s a killer!!! The truth are not like some politicians in many countries said, some politicians even suggest peoples don not wear masks, I don\u2019t know what fucking wrong with them. In many places of China, without masks, peoples are not allowed on street, will been captured, tested and isolated (if they are infected suspect) immediately. But in some countries, some peoples said they don\u2019t need masks because of it\u2019s not freedom, I think they are fucking crazy. Without right medical assistance, there will have one die in every five to ten cases, it is far danger than \u201cflu\u201d. Yes, in China, the rate of death on COVID-19 are pretty low Even in Wuhan, the city with the worst situation in China. (Because of a patient storm, the number of patients increase too fast, overload local medical resources, caused many patients cannot get medical assistance ASAP ,then maybe death) Even for that, the death rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan is still controlled in about 8%, and descend everyday after we built two emergent temporary hospitals. The other places in China are basically controlled in about 0.1%. But all of this are based on a good and common medical environment, the fee of COVID-19 treatment and testing are all free in China, in Wuhan every persons were tested in few days, that means 9 million peoples, not many countries on this world can make a such thing, for example, I guess the U.S. could never do it. Only few advanced, little and wealthy countries like Singapore can do that. And in Iran, the death rate reached 20%, I think that is because of lacking tests, the number of infected in Iran should be bigger than they tested, so the real number should be a little lower that 20%. I guess the final number should be 10% to 20%, but anyway, it is still a killer. So I suggest, if you feel infected maybe, DO NOT STAY AT HOME, WEARING A MASK, AND GO HOSPITAL ASAP, it will kill your in a very high rate, especially for old men and women over 40, infected and without medical assistance means death. Well, that\u2019s all, I have been stay at home in Shanghai for nearly two months after Chinese New Year, the situation in China are basically in controlled now, except Wuhan, all other places are basically without increase cases. Now the new problem of China are how to treat the cases import from aboard, like Korea, Japan and Italy. ",

            "answer_text": "** Saturday, March 21st. 2020 ** I believe Government intervention into the Chinese virus** will only prolong the life of it. It is not a pandemic in the United States. It is an epidemic that, like most mild viruses, cause only minor symptoms in people without compromised immune systems. It could pass in a few weeks. The pandemic alarm is being spread to crash our economy ahead of the 2020 election. Know this! If this virus is a pandemic in the U.S. we would have already had thousands of deaths. We are a large country with many more people than, for example, Italy, who already have 4000 death\u2019s. That is a Pandemic. Because President Trump took action early in January to limit who could enter the country and because he has continued to close paths for the virus to enter new cases into the U.S. we remain well in control of the virus. The worst parts of our country are those who have provided areas of tent slums with insufficient or zero bathrooms, no running water, no bathing facilities, without warm shelters, and garbage collection and disposal. Indeed, the viruses would die out faster if these conditions did not exist for so many. These are the places who call themselves sanctuary cities but are in actuality sanctuary for destitution, disease, filth, and violent foreign or domestic criminals. **Calling out a place where a viral epidemic has been allowed to spread unchecked from it\u2019s borders without warning is not racist. It is proper to refer to China with the noun Chinese. It does not refer to race but to location that has many ethnicity and cultures. The Chinese virus is proper and writing of Chinese goods, Chinese politics, Chinese engineering, etc. has been used in educational, reporting, and popular literature in the entire world including the United States for many generations.

            "answer_text": "That depends on many factors. The Guardian (March 21) and some other news media stated that about 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case [WHO said the same] \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment. [1] Also, the amount of the coronavirus that you first take in may play a factor in the severity of your symptoms (other aspects being equal).[2] CDC (March 18, ): among patients with COVID-19 in the United States the estimated fatality rate among persons aged 19 years and younger was 0%; 1% among persons aged 20\u201354 years; 1% to 3% among persons aged 55-64 years, and ranging from 10% to 27% among persons aged 85 and up. 80 percent of US coronavirus deaths are people 65 and older.[3] 80 percent of US coronavirus deaths are people 65 and older.[4] The worldwide fatality rate (Feb. 29) for those 80 years old and up was 14.8%, almost twice that of those 70-79 years old (8.0%) and which itself is over twice as much as those aged 60-69 years old (3.6%), which rate is over twice as much as those aged 50-59 years old (1.3%) while for those aged 40-49 years old it is 0.4%, and 0.2% for those aged 10-39 years old. As regards health conditions, those must vulnerable are those with Cardiovascular disease, then Diabetes, and after that Diabetes, Hypertension, then Cancer.[5] Live Science reported (March 30) that, a recent study of COVID-19 cases in the United States estimated a mortality rate of 10% to 27% for those ages 85 and over, 3% to 11% for those ages 65 to 84, 1% to 3% for those ages 55 to 64 and less than 1% for those ages 20 to 54. South Korea, which conducted more than 140,000 tests for COVID-19, officials found a overall fatality rate of 0.6%[6] . More than 99% of Italy's coronavirus fatalities were people who suffered from previous medical conditions.[7] Three out of four young NYC Coronavirus fatalities had other medical conditions (Mar. 27),[8] and as of March 23 Italy and South Korea had reported no fatalities for the 10 to 19 years old age group. China reported that 0.2 percent of cases for these young people end in death[9]. More on worldwide demographic and health condition fatality rates: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/ Another study of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, estimates that the death rate among people who were infected and developed symptoms was 1.4 percent. The study, reported yesterday in Nature Medicine, suggests that the overall CFR\u2014including people who are infected but do not develop symptoms\u2014will prove to be much lower in the United States than many people feared[10] . Therefore the COVID-19 coronavirus is especially dangerous to the aged and those with certain per-existing conditions, these being the most vulnerable. However, since you use the word \u201cdangerous\u201d then that must be understood in terms of context, as in dangerous to who and who. Being in the womb places one in danger as vulnerable to death, since America murders over 2,000 of those souls a day[11]. Let me also add for perspective that the US death toll from Covid-19 after 2 months (Feb-March) is 5,000[12](4\u20131), which is less than the average from motor vehicle accidents (over 90 people deaths per day,[13] 39,404 people in 2018 - though many are omitted - with a 12.04 death rate per 100,000 population[14]). And out of 169,936 preventable deaths in 2017, an estimated 125,300 preventable injury-related deaths were in homes and communities, (about 75% of all preventable injury-related deaths). In addition, obesity and being overweight are together the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States[15]. Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": " Firstly, we already know 1) the speed with which it has spread, it's planetary proportions, hence a pandemic, which didn't happen with other viruses; 2) we still don't know all the characteristics of the virus; 3) Covid-19 differs from SARS in terms of its length of incubation, it's infection rate, the seriousness of its clinical effects and the range of its spread in the community; 4) although there are some outstanding similarities between SARS and Covid-19, it is the differences which will determine whether using the measures taken against SARS will be successful against Covid-19. This remains a massive incognito. Better than trying to find out about the more obvious causes, why don't we try and understand why and how all this started? Now I know that ambient air pollution is the largest environmental health problem in the world. Fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 millionths of a meter, known as PM2.5, was the fifth-leading cause of death in the world in 2015, factoring in approximately 4.1 million global deaths annually. In the United States, PM2.5 contributed to about 88,000 deaths in 2015 \u2013 more than diabetes, influenza, kidney disease or suicide. (Source: Fine particle air pollution is a public health emergency hiding in plain sight) But even behind that huge dramatic but visible problem Covid-19, is a symptom of a far more serious problem, our \"polluted\" and stressed-out minds, as confirmed by neurologists. I believe a new scientific paradigm will emerge to deal with these, as yet, unproven Laws, which so subtly rule our planet! The science of Ayurdeva teaches us Man is a microcosm, a universe in itself, which is directly tied to the cosmic forces. In its surroundings, the macrocosm. Individual existence is inseparable from the cosmic whole, and thus everything we do to ourselves (what we do to others, let's not go there) has subtly intangible effects, like the \"anatomy\" of this virus. Corinna Lathan, a CEO at Anthro Tronixa, revealed a study which shows that people who spend more time with chronically ill patients, themselves become a \"second victim\". In other words, the functioning of their own cognitive system is adversely affected. Makes one think! Lathan believes that ignoring the health of our brains incurs enormous costs. Non-contagious diseases (NCD) will cost $47 trillion. According to the WHO, these are the largest cause of death in this planet. 40 million deaths attributed to NCDs every year. According to the WHO it is still beyond our reach to even have as objectives the reduction of premature NCD deaths by a third, by prevention and treatment, by promoting Mental health and wellbeing.  The WHO says \"the world is not following a good path\". It calls for \"Good measures requiring not only an individual attitude, but also public policies'.  It is the WHO that calls for better Mental health and individual attitude. \"Cleansing\" our own minds. ",

            "answer_text": "Leftist fear mongers create panic among ignorant part of population that it is very dangerous. Nonsense. Read this article: How deadly is the new coronavirus? I can add several things. The time had passed since it was published and mortality rate on the cruise ship \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d has increased to 1.5% (just like the article predicted). However, what article didn\u2019t mention is that amount of infected people on the ship was less than 20% (only 1 out of 5) It proves that media lies claiming that coronavirus is more contagious than seasonal flu. It is less contagious. I will give another example supporting my claim. In Seattle nursing home \u201cLife Care\u201d (where basically it started in USA) out of 120 residents 81 got sick (and 30 of them died). Well this is obviously higher percentage than on the ship (66%). However, it lasted undetected much longer also. The first patient was admitted to a hospital on February 16 with high fever. Then between 16 and 26 several more got into hospital but nursing home didn\u2019t react. On February 26 it had big Mardy Gras party. And then it started. On the first days of March they conducted the tests and then few days later found that 50 more got sick with coronavirus. Only then they started to act. So, for almost 4 weeks they did absolutely nothing and virus was getting from one person to another freely. If our liars from the media would be correct and 1 person indeed infects 2 more then by the middle of March not 81 but the entire nursing home would be sick. Actually all 120 residents would be sick by the end of February if you would believe fear mongers lies. The leftist propaganda wants to make animals from the regular people in order to defeat Trump in November, to scare them and to convince them that present administration is incompetent. I am not Trump supporter.. I just don\u2019t like to be fooled. And suggest the same to you. Be homo sapiens, not a scared animal. ",

But with high infectivity. In general terms it causes only mild infection in most of the cases. A large number of cases are asymptomatic. Severe cases are very very few. But the problem is media highlighting critical cases make it look like very dangerous. And due to mild nature it's infectivity is very high. As people are mostly unaware that they have got the infection and they keep it spreading. Take example of TB. There are a lot of medications for it and there is also a vaccine. Still the mortality rate is 12%. Whereas covid19 without any vaccine or drug has mortality rate of 6%. What to do? Keep yourself isolated or try atleast.Even if you get the infection do not worry. Keep monitoring yourself and rush to hospital only if necessary.Do not panic.If you got infection do not infect others.P. S. In coming two years we all gonna infected with Covid-19. As the days are passing our understanding about the disease is improving. I hope the world soon get their breathing space open. ",

            "answer_text": "THE PANIC BUYERS MAKE EVERYTHING WORSE Coming from West Germany where the situation is among the worst in Europe, people are worried. Not because they\u2019re afraid of getting coronavirus or even their personal financials, but because the GROCERY STORES ARE EMPTYING. Try to go to a DM in Germany and purchase mouthwash or cleaning supplies, they\u2019re dwindling. How about getting some pasta or toilet paper from the local supermarket? It\u2019s tough. This makes everything worse by adding a new dimension to the panic. Now, people are left going from store to store for essential supplies which is thereby increasing the amount of time they\u2019re spending outside exposed and transmitting COVID-19. For the people who are most at risk from the virus, those same people also tend to find it difficult to shop for themselves and now have a new barrier to deal with. I think it\u2019s important for people to practice good hygiene practices, respect local government's recommendations for social distancing and limited gatherings, and be smart when out in public. The next thing that\u2019s worse is the loneliness and fake news factor. If all gatherings of more then a couple of people are forbidden and everyone\u2019s scared, people are going to get lonely. Based on the way Europe is currently exploding in cases and the overall lax attitude towards the quarantine I expect the situation in regions like Germany and Spain are only going to get worse. A reasonable estimate will be large institutions will not be open for something on the magnitude of at least 6 MONTHS, with aftershock from the financial recession/businesses shutting down/low morale potentially lasting longer is an ensuing issue. Two things are apparent from my perspective: 1. We need better quality news from better quality news outlets - Remember Panic is the enemy here. It causes us to spread fake news on a biological topic which we may not be accredited in, and it makes us suspend our critical thinking. A lot of news outlets like this one benefit from making the situation sound scarier than it actually is because it\u2019s more engaging content. We need to report the facts on the issue, the true mortality rate, and the real measures that are being taken by local governments. One of the tools I used to find out about surrounding border closures was Source for international COVID-19 outbreaks, which allowed me to subscribe to news outlets from countries that I planned to travel to, thus allowing me to be prepared and aware if border closures were an imminent risk. It also allowed my parents from Canada to subscribe to German news to see what the situation truly was in Germany and how I would be affected. 2. We need to actively keep up to date with friends and family - Call up your mother and see how she\u2019s dealing with everything. How\u2019s your friend doing financially that\u2019s highly invested in risky stocks? The greatest vehicle to maintain connections during this difficult time is the internet and phone, essentially anything not in person. If your relatives are struggling, give them a call and offer to help. This could be an opportunity for everyone to practice compassion and awareness for your neighbor. I think you\u2019ll find people are a lot more gracious and open to assistance during times like this then it may seem. Who knows, you might even rebuild a broken relationship or make a new friend. Stay safe and happy social distancing ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is a major concern. It has already killed over 4000 people in a short span of time. It is the worst pandemic in recent times. The entire world is shattered. Novel coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough without runny nose. This is the simplest way to identify. the Wuhan virus (called COVID 19) will be killed at a temperature of 30-35 degrees, therefore, drink more hot water. You can tell your friends and relatives to drink more hot water to prevent it. Go under the Sun for a long time. It has been cold season recently, and drinking hot water is also very comfortable. Drinking warm water is effective for mostly all viruses. Avoid taking non-veg food and avoid very cold food including icecream etc. 1. This virus is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm diameter), so any normal mask (not just the N95 feature) should be able to filter it out. However, when someone who's infected sneezes in front of you, it will take a great 3 meters (about 10 feet) before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live for at least 12 hours. So remember if you come in contact with any metal surface, wash your hands with soap thoroughly. Don't depend on the sanitizers. 3. The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent should kill the virus. For winter clothing that does not require daily washing, you can put it out under the sun for 4 hours to kill the virus. symptoms of the pneumonia caused by Coronavirus: 1. It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have the dry sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4 days 2. Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and drips into the trachea and enter the lungs, causing pneumonia. This process will take 5 to 6 days. 3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You will feel like you are drowning in water. It's important to seek immediate medical attention if you feel like this. prevention: 1. The most common way of getting infected is by touching things in public, so you must wash your hands frequently. The virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but a lot of damage can happen in those 5-10 mins (you may rub your eyes or pick your nose unwittingly). 2. Aside from washing your hands frequently, you can gargle with Betadine Sore Throat Gargle to eliminate or minimize the germs while they are still in your throat (before dripping down to your lungs). 3. Follow traditional Indian lifestyle and lead a life of ethics and values. Traditional Indian values and lifestyle is the best to fight against such deadly diseases. 4. This virus is only an early warning. The nature may have many more such diseases in future. This is a reaction of nature against over-exploitation of nature by human beings. A recent article in Malayasia mentioned Jain Philosophy as the best solution at the present moment. Jain Saints don\u2019t eat after Sunset, they are vegetarians, they always take boiled water. They eat freshly cooked food and are very scientific about what to eat and what not to eat. They use Muhbatti (a type of Mask). These practices they have been following for thousands of years. They are in news now. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps a better question is WHY is it dangerous. What is the death vector that actually does the killing of infected patients? Here is the very latest from the doctors that are fighting the greatest number of cases in NYC: Ventilators are overused for Covid-19 patients, doctors say - STAT All that business of oxygen saturation levels, CO2 removal, gummy yellow fluid in the lungs, strikes me as really significant. The death rate, even with ventilators, seems to agree with the idea that old treatment methods don\u2019t work on this virus. It also seemed to me to be a breakthrough discovery that there are similarities to altitude sickness. I wonder if drugs like acetazolamide (Diamox, Diamox Sequels) and/or dexamethasone (AK-Dex, Ocu-Dex) would make a difference. (I learned about them in Aviation Physiology classes in the Navy related to treating altitude sickness). It would appear that patients would benefit from ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) equipment or treatment - (specifically a VV ECMO). Using a VV ECMO addresses the blood oxygenation issue but without the aerosolized virus particle problem that might be a problem using CPAP, BiPAP and ventilators. Bottom line: This issue of oxygen saturation levels pops out at me as being the baseline fundamental issue contributing to the high death rate of the virus. Address this symptom and the rest can be resolved with standard care until they can come up with a vaccine that stops the initial infection. A study has shown an improvement in 6-month survival without severe disability in patients getting ECMO versus conventional ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome.

On the other hand this disruption, forced \u201choliday\u201d might become a special rehab program, weaning us off the \u201cold\u201d, cancer-like, excessive, consumerist, self-destructive Human paradigm, like an alcoholic who suddenly finds oneself locked into a place without alcohol for a few weeks, months. As we will get used to this state we will feel like walking up from a coma, from an evil hypnosis which used to be our life so far with its 24/7 rat race, the incessant, all-encompassing media, marketing, entertainment brainwash that didn't allow us to think even for a moment, to ponder about who we really are, why we live, why we are called Human beings, what goals, purpose we should choose for ourselves since every second in every day the goals, purposes, targets were dictated for us. Suddenly we can breath, think, look ahead, we can observe Nature recovering from the \u201dHuman virus\u201d, we can get used to a more natural, more Humane existence. So if we use this forced rehab wisely we can turn the virus from serious problem until an unprecedented opportunity for building a new Human paradigm for ourselves. We need to learn and understand that these things don't happen randomly but we exist in a deterministic Natural system that is progressing towards an optimal goal, which is the full, seamless integration of the whole system we are also part of. Thus we don't actually have a free choice about finding how to integrate into Nature by first of all integrating with each other in a global Human society. But we can choose the manner how we reach that integration. This can unfold through recurring, worsening crisis situations, plagues until intolerable suffering will convince us, or we can use the unique insight the virus lockdown provides to see how we could consciously, proactively learn how to integrate with each other above and against our inherently selfish, egotistic, exploitative reflexes, software.

All of those people out of work may not be exposed to the virus, but that still doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll stop it.

Surely this disease is contagious. To know how contagious this virus is, let's listen to a true story.  New York March 2nd, 2020 50 Year old attorney who worked near Grand Central Station in Manhattan tested positive for the Coronavirus on March 2nd, 2 days later his son tested positive, his neighbor who drove him to the hospital tested positive, the friend of the attorney tested positive and so did his friend\u2019s son, his friend's daughter, and his friends wife! A few days later 3 members of the Young Israel Congregation of New Rochelle tested positive for the virus. The same event the 50-year-old attorney attended. On March 7th the government announced 23 other cases linked to the attorney(who first caught the virus) due to the virus! On March 8th 12 more cases were reported in the same area, New Rochelle, causing the whole locality to isolate.  The condition does not seem to improve, cases are increasing exponentially, below is a graph which shows this  Though the death rate may seem low, this is not really true for people who are above the age of 50 and people with respiratory problems. The virus has already been declared a pandemic and it seems there is no stopping it unless and until a vaccine has been found. ",

We will see if these assertions hold up in light of evidence based on blood testing for antibodies in a sample of Californians by professors at Stanford University. A pre-peer-review draft of the Stanford study of antibody prevalence in Santa Clara County (Bay Area, pop. 2m) was published Friday on MedRxiv.com. If its finding that the true number of cases there is 50\u201385x the official case count is correct and broadly applicable to the whole country, the way we view this pandemic is about to change radically. Very radically. It would imply that the mortality rate is around 90% lower than previously thought\u20140.1% or slightly higher, not 1.0%\u2014and that the number of US cases is dramatically higher\u201436,000,000 to 61,000,000, not 720k. Obviously, peer review may lead to modification of the study\u2019s conclusions (or it may not). And studies elsewhere are needed to confirm its applicability to the rest of the state, country, and world. A Stanford University YouTube channel has already uploaded a discussion of the study\u2019s findings with one of its authors, professor of medicine Jay Bhattacharya, MD, PhD. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Edit, April 20: The study has been getting a mixed response, a lot of it negative, from the public, including a number of scientists. But the plot thickens: Today another study, this one from USC and LA Public Health, is broadly in line with it, estimating that in LA county the undercount of actual cases is 28\u201355-fold. These studies are going to be coming in at an increasing rate. ",

            "answer_text": "The lethality rate of COVID-19 looks to be somewhere between 0.5\u20131.0%. This means that out of a thousand people who are infected by this virus approximately 5 to 10 or so will die. A Dutch study released on April 16th seems to indicate that 3% of the Dutch population has antibodies for this disease. The Dutch population as of 2019 is approximately 17.28 million. Therefore the number infected is more or less 518,400. WHO also pinned the spread globally in the 2%-4% range. As of April 24th there have been 4177 COVID-19 related deaths in the Netherlands. Lethality = (Number dead/number infected) *100% = 0.8%. Now there is an eight day gap (in my data) which impacts my calculations favouring the numerator but I would argue that death numbers are probably understated to begin with so that 0.8% seems about right. The Dutch though have a slightly older population than the US (average age = 41 compared to 38) and this could skew lethality rates towards the higher end in comparison. An LA county study released three days ago seems to indicate that 4.1% of the adult population has been infected. They supply a range of 2.5% to 5.6%. This translates to 221,000 to 442,000 infections in the county. Using a midpoint value of 330,000 and a death number of 600 one can roughly ballpark the lethality here as lethality = (600/330000)*100% = 0.18% or approximately 0.2%. This seems to be on the low end. However if deaths are unreported the numerator could be out by 50% or so. New York as we stand already has over 1000 deaths/million meaning that any value of lethality less than 0.1% (or close to it) is likely way off.

            "answer_text": "I think covid - 19 will definitely become a serious problem for the world because right now south Africa starts its full lock down today for the next 21 days. Many people have been been affected by this as most travellers and traders especially those from Zimbabwe have now been stranded as they traveled to the border without knowing the news of the lock down only to realize that the border has been closed. Remember, Zimbabwe is going under a difficult economic situation, so most people have migrated to South Africa and some do cross border trading. So this lock down means these migrants are failing to join their families for Easter.Some migrant workers are afraid that if they go home to their countries, they will not be allowed back to South Africa resulting in them loosing their jobs. There are many migrant workers in south Africa from Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Lesotho (etc).Some are afraid that their employers will not pay for the time they were sitting at home. People are in panic mode everywhere in south Africa and they are hoarding food as they do not know how this lock down will end. A sad story in my country Zimbabwe is that people are afraid and they also do not want to move around in public places, but how can they avoid it for a country with no mealie meal (it's the staple food). It has been scarce and every day people are queuing in lines to get the precious commodity. Just two days ago, a son of a prominent business person Zororo Makamba passed away becoming the first person to die in Zimbabwe of the virus, it was then the public realized that the government was lying all along that they were fully prepared for the virus as Zororo\u2019s family fumed telling the world that their son died a lonely, painful death with Noone tending to him as the nurses and doctors at Wilkins isolation hospital refused to attend him fearing for their safety as they do not have protective clothing. The family also fumed after being asked to pay united States $120.000 so a ventilator could be bought from another private clinic and when they bought it, there were no sockets to plug in the ventilator machine at the ward in Wilkins and the nurses did not know how to use it. Source:The daily news Now, if such rich people suffer like that, what will become of us, that's the question on the Zimbabweans mind. God help us, let there be a cure. To make matters worse, masks and sanitizers are no longer found in pharmacy stores, they have run out. Those who are personally selling them are doing that at a very high price. Edit:Thank you guys for the up votes, I also would like to add that since I wrote this article the following African states have also gone on lock down south Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Rwanda, Kenya . COVID is serious and its affecting the social lives of people, economic styles of countries are at a stand still, hospitals are overwhelmed,. ",

            "answer_text": "To date the transmission of animal coronavirus to humans has only been confirmed for the SARS and MERS viruses, while there is no evidence for the new COVID-19 virus that it can be transmitted from humans to animals and back from animals to humans. However, caution should always be practiced. The new coronavirus was first identified towards the end of 2019 in Wuhan in the Chinese province of Hubei. The infection spread rapidly, causing a dangerous respiratory disease in humans with a mortality rate of around 2%. The virus was named 'SARS-CoV-2'; the disease caused by the virus is called 'coronavirus disease 2019', which is abbreviated to 'COVID-19'. Various coronaviruses form the large Coronaviridae family and are often present in many species of animals, including domestic animals such as cattle, horses, pigs, dogs and cats. Infection of a host requires a low amount of virus, and coronavirus infections can spread rapidly. In rare cases, animal coronaviruses can infect humans and then spread from person to person. This was the case for SARS and MERS a few years ago, however, today these viruses do not pose a significant risk and are not spreading. In the early stages of the epidemic, at the outbreak of the new COVID-19 virus in Wuhan, China, many patients had a proven link to a central major market (a suspected source of infection) where seafood and various live animals are sold, suggesting the transmission of a new virus through animals (when eaten) to humans. It was subsequently shown that the growing number of patients could not be epidemiologically linked to direct or indirect contacts in that market or to animal products, which confirmed the initial suspicion that the virus could spread from person to person. Human-to-human transmission was subsequently confirmed in many countries outside China. Several cities report that, based on to the first cases identified, the number of patients increased sharply in a very short period of time, especially in places with a larger number of infected people, and there are also many unexplained ways of infection. Diseases caused by animal coronaviruses are mostly manifested as respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders. Infections of cats with coronavirus are manifested by fever, accompanied by loss of appetite, inactivity and weight loss, which in 90% of cases is accompanied by gastrointestinal inflammation with the appearance of fluid in the abdominal cavity. In dogs, it is known that the intestinal and lung types of coronaviruses are caused by two different viruses. Bovine coronavirus causes the so-called winter diarrhoea in cattle, and the same virus is found in the causative agents of the bovine respiratory complex. Equine coronavirus is often found when diarrhoea occurs. In pigs, the well-known type of TGE coronavirus is, as is the case with the PED virus, a typical intestinal virus. The PRCV virus, which causes milder respiratory disease in pigs, is also widespread. Even in poultry, coronaviruses infect the respiratory tract. HOWEVER, NONE OF THESE VIRUSES HAVE BEEN TRANSMITTED FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS AND DO NOT CAUSE INFECTIONS IN HUMANS. To date the transmission of animal coronavirus to humans has been confirmed only for the SARS and MERS viruses, while there is no evidence that the new COVID-19 virus can be transmitted from humans to animals and back from animals to humans. However, caution should always be practiced. Protection against a potential source of animal contamination involves avoiding unnecessary contact with unknown animals and the mandatory washing and disinfection of hands after contact with animals. Care must also be taken to ensure that meat, meat products and eggs are properly heat treated before being eaten. If you want to know more about this, then I will suggest you this link Questions About Covid-19 And Microwave Sterilization Equipment. I hope it will help you to learn something extra knowledge about the COVID- 19. ",

            "answer_text": "Not very, but almost certainly higher than annual flu mortality. To understand covid 19 mortality, it is necessary to spend a little time understanding the relevant definitions, and sourcing meaningful data according to those definitions. The random sampling done in Iceland, which has also tested about 15% of its population, is a good place to start. All age death rate is most likely in the range 0.1 to 0.4%, centred on about one death in 400 infections. This has been apparent since late March. Useful categories are: infection rate (not confirmed infections which is misleading) death rate due to covid death rate with covid (but not because of) The infection becomes hazardous in old age, possibly reaching 5 to 10% mortality. Pre-existing life threatening illness also multiplies the death rate due to covid infection. These are the people who should have been protected. Mortality below the age of 50 is fairly low, below 30 very low and is a very mild, usually symptomless and almost never fatal infection in children. The Iceland data gives a broad over view. They have about 1% infection rate, producing 10 dead out of 3600 infections (random sample data). This also gives a very rough idea of the infection rate of other countries, taking into account population size and number of covid deaths. Those approaching 0.5% overall death rate are likely also approaching herd immunity. Those countries which have had a rush of cases also have considerable over lap with the back ground death rate, so the death rate due to covid will be revised downward. Those countries that have escaped with relatively few deaths compared to population size will have many more deaths before generalised immunity is established. ",

(see: Coronavirus Update (Live): 14,644,360 Cases and 608,911 Deaths from COVID-19 Virus Pandemic). If you divide 143,289 by 3,898,550, you get 0.03675 or 3.675%. That number has been as high as 7.0% and may again return to those levels. However, even 3.675% is 306.5% higher the known death rate for the yearly Flu, which is about 1.2%.

That\u2019s because they\u2019re calculating the mortality rate based on the number of deaths divided by the number of cases, and not the number of resolved cases (recovered and died). That\u2019s a misleading metric as it takes time for the virus to kill. For example, you could simultaneously exposed 1,000,000 people to the Ebola virus. In the first day the mortality rate would probably be 0%. After the outbreak is completely finished however you can properly calculate the mortality rate (which was averaged around 50%). This is also illustrated the the history of other Coronavirus outbreaks. During the SARS epidemic the mortality rate was about 3%. It was only after all the cases were resolved that the final calculation was about 9%. In the case of 2019-nCov, as of today there are 813 deaths and 2,685 recovered. The sum of those values is total number of resolved cases. The real mortality rate is the total number of deaths divided by the total number of resolved cases. So the current real mortality rate is 813/3498 which is about 23%. This value will probably change significantly as we learn the true number of cases, however it won\u2019t change as dramatically as the mortality rate being used by MSM as the values we\u2019re using here are proven numbers of cases, deaths, and recoveries and this can be seen as a sort of case study.

Sure plagues have been happening all the time in history. But based on all the signs of prophecies in the tenach and Jewish scriptures, we are now extremely close to the redemption (there are even reports amongst us jews, that some of our saints amongst us are already holding meetings with the messiah, and they know already who it's going to be, and he himself knows already that \u201che\u201d will be chosen for the job). But another noteworthy proof that this time this is \u201cit\u201d: I've understood that children are immune to the virus. If so, then that's obviously because God doesn't punish people under the age of 20 (\u201cusually\u201d, anyway he's much more linient with them). Sure throughout history children have suffered just as much as adults, but god is usually doing everything in a kind of hidden way where we can think everything is random and there's no justice, although even then on some deep level at least everything is just, But it's hidden from us. But it's been said by our saints, that once the time for the redemption comes and it's time for god to get rid of all the wicked who don't deserve to be redeemed, in \u201cthose plagues and wars and calamities \u201cthat god will send to the world to kill of the wicked; only the wicked will die, and the righteous will be saved. It seems to me that that's the reason why under 20's aren't effected by this plague, if that's true. ",

            "answer_text": "Difficult to assess. It is certainly a nasty respiratory virus that can cause severe pneumonia in anyone, but seems to be particularly dangerous to the elderly and chronic sick. The mortality rate is difficult to estimate as there are probably a lot of mildly affected cases that don\u2019t get reported. Current official figures worldwide (9th March) are 112,000 cases with 4,000 deaths - a mortality rate of about 3.6%. However if we look at the Diamond Princess incident where we know every case because everyone was tested we see that there were 696 cases with 7 deaths, a more reassuring mortality rate of 1%. As this was a cruise ship I would guess that there were a fair number of the elderly amongst those infected (particularly reassuring for me as the quote mortality rate for my age is usually given as 10%). In any case the worldwide growth factor seems to be currently at 1, so I\u2019m going to stick my neck out and predict that the epidemic is getting under control. I wonder if in six months we'll be wondering what all the fuss was about. Data from Coronavirus Cases Edit 28th March. It appears that the growth factor (R0) is at leat 2.2 so it looks like my optimism was unfounded. The epidemic it now appears was already out of control when I wrote three weeks ago. ",

COVID-19 is a very serious disease. Not only for the elderly but for the young, it will eventually recover. Their lungs will be permanently damaged. Imagine that you may never be able to go rock climbing, skiing or swimming. Please don't believe the current severity and mortality rates, which are based on Chinese data. And what is China's approach? Wuhan isolates all mild patients and suspected patients and conducts medical intervention for mild patients. It is difficult for mild patients to fight the virus on their own. You can refer to the data from Italy. At present, the mortality rate in Italy accounts for 7.17% of the tested patients. But this data is not final, because it takes about 8 days for the new coronavirus to be found (mild) and die. If combined with the number of people diagnosed in Italy 8 days ago, the mortality of COVID-19 in Italy is about 30%.

And since there is a period of 14 days being infectious, there were 800 NEW people plus average 7 times that for the other days they are still active. This brings the total people around me to 5600. Now I am in an area which was the last to move to the next level\u2026 so I will say 10,000/population, meaning that 1/300 chance for me meeting a single person\u2026 just to be easy on the calculations. But I figure that for every 5 minutes with an infectious carrier, I have a 1/30 chance of getting the virus. So it depends. If I go to a store for 30 minutes. And am within 6 feet of, say 10 people during the whole time (not always the same person but random)\u2026 that one trip .. I will be.. 6x5 minutes, 10 people is 1/30 times 10 bringing my risk to 1/3 per the chance of the average person being infected..which is 1/300. 1/900 will be it.. about .1%. NOW.. if I wear a mask.. .05%, If they all wear masks, .01%. And this is Canada. How many new cases per population are you in and is your area higher risk? AND really important. How often are you out of your little bubble of the same people?!!! And for how long? The USA has, on average, 5 times the viral load than we do here. ",

So, even the buttons in the elevator have been laminated:  Some reports suggest that the virus can spread via aerosol: Related: Novel Coronavirus Can Transmit Via Aerosol In order to prevent the spread of the virus, the Chinese government has taken various measures including requiring all those returning to the cities like Shanghai to self-quarantine for two weeks, installing temperature checks at metro stations, and closing schools indefinitely. Following an extended Spring Festival break, we are now getting back to work\u2026 kind of. While the national holiday may have officially come to an end on Monday, many companies in China have not resumed work because of continued fears surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. Other companies have told employees to work from home. So far we didn\u2019t see a typical weekday rush hour. Instead, a significantly sparser crowd hit the street, all wearing masks and some dragging along disinfectant. Moreover, since we don't have vaccines for the novel coronavirus, prevention is still the best medicine. We usually don't go out. It\u2019s much better to be safe than sorry. :) We are all hopeful.

Most of the posts on this sight are dated and do not reflect the latest CDC information. In the US, half of all deaths were occupants of Long-Term Care Facilities. That group represents just 1.7% of the population. The residents of LTCFs accounted for 38,800 or 53% of all COVID-19 deaths (based on recent data). The rest of the country, the 98.3%, have experienced approximately 34,600 deaths, or 47% of the nation\u2019s total COVID-19 deaths That means the death rate, deaths expressed as a percent of those living in medical care institutions, is 0.682%, more than 50 times the death rate of the rest of the population at 0.012%. The death rate for the overall populations is 0.022% says CDC. In other words, the death rate for 98.3% of the population is more like seasonal flu. The secondary death rate from lock downs is just beginning. The experts and politicians got it wrong big time aided by media hysteria. It appears no apologies will be offered by politicians or media.

It has also been declared as a Pandemic by the World Health Organisation. In India too, there have been around 7.91 million cases and 119 thousand deaths because of coronavirus. Furthermore, since this is a new strain of the novel Coronavirus, no cure is yet available. Consequently, adopting preventative measures is one of the only ways to reduce the chances of infection as well as the spread of this virus. Some of these measures include \u2013 Hands should be washed as frequently as possible with running water and soap. In case the soap is not available, alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be used.Wear a mask while going out.Maintaining a minimum 3-meter distance between you and other individuals while outdoors.Proper hygiene should be maintained.Individuals who have an existing health issue or are over the age of 60 stands at a greater risk of contamination. They can consider opting for a covid-19 insurance plan along with following the above-mentioned tips. With this policy in place, they can cover the expenses for a range of treatment required to fight coronavirus infection, which includes hospitalization, medical consultation, ambulance charges, etc. Read More: COVID 19 Protection \u2013 Why COVID 19 Insurance Cover Is Important For You And Your Family ",

Young people, on the other hand, appear to be better protected against the virus. A report by the World Health Organization and China, based on the 75,465 cases reported up to 20 February, found that only 2.4 per cent of cases were in those aged 18 or under. We don\u2019t yet know if children aren\u2019t catching the virus at the same rate as adults, or if they just don\u2019t show symptoms when they do have the virus. It is also difficult to estimate how fatal the virus is. Most estimates put the rate at somewhere between 1 and 2 per cent of infections. This is higher in older populations \u2013 a report covering 44,672 cases put the fatality rate at 8 per cent for those in their 70s and 14.8 per cent for people aged 80 or over. But the exact figure is impossible to calculate, because we can\u2019t be sure how many people have caught the virus, says Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh, UK Read more: Coronavirus: What are the worst symptoms and how deadly is covid-19?

The website of the said Ministry has also given link of Helpline Numbers of States & Union Territories for corona-virus. A few more steps taken by the Ministry have also been given on the website which inter-alia include travel advisories, imposing restrictions for international passengers, , etc. The Government of India has declared the novel corona virus outbreak in the country a \"notified disaster\" on 14.03.2020 and called it \"a special one-time dispensation\", to contain the spread of the infectious virus. The government said money from each state's Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) would be used for temporary accommodation and supply of food, water and medical care for patients and people in quarantine camps. The Government also decided that SDRF funds will also be used to pay for additional testing centres and the cost of protective equipment for police, healthcare and municipal authorities, as well as that of thermal scanners and other necessary equipment for government hospitals. All such expenditure will be drawn only from the state's funds and not the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF). Also, total expenditure on equipment cannot exceed 10 per cent of the fund's annual allocation. ",

Based on all 72,314 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, suspected, and asymptomatic cases in China as of February 11, a paper by the Chinese CCDC released on February 17 and published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology [1] has found that the risk of death increases the older you are. COVID-19 Fatality Rate by AGE: AGE. DEATH RATE 80+ years old. 14.8% 70-79 years old. 8.0% 60-69 years old. 3.6% 50-59 years old. 1.3% 40-49 years old. 0.4% 30-39 years old. 0.2% 20-29 years old. 0.2% 10-19 years old. 0.2% 0-9 years old. no fatalities In general, relatively few cases are seen among children. COVID-19 Fatality Rate by SEX: SEX. DEATH RATE Male. 2.8% Female. 1.7% The overall mortality rate ~2.1%; in Wuhan, ~4.9%, in Hubei Province, ~3.1%. 97% of the country's total deaths (414) were in the Hubei Province. Fatality rate in other provinces was 0.16%. Deaths in Wuhan were 313, accounting for 74% of China's total. For the world, the disease isn't that dangerous as compared to other past or current diseases.

Most people compare the number of fatalities to the number of infections on the same date and get about 2% fatality, but it is wrong. It takes at least 9 days for a person dianosed to die, so you have to compare the number of fatalities to the number of infections 9 days before, and if you do that you will see that 2019-nCoV is fatal in more than 15% of the cases so far. Coronavirus Update (Live): 24,627 Cases and 493 Deaths from the Wuhan China Virus Outbreak Fortunately the treatment is improving, and vaccination will hopefully come soon: Flu and HIV Drugs Show Efficacy Against Coronavirus Meanwhile, the travel restrictions will hold the infection from spreading too fast; if left unchecked, at the current 20% a day it can potentially sicken everybody in the world in 2.5 months. It looks like the infection in China is still growing unabated, the incubation period of it is about 2 weeks, which means it had already spread much wider than we see today, especially in China, where people travel a lot during the New Year celebrations, it looks bad, we will see how it works out.

On the cruise liner that was stuck in Japan the mortality rate was 0.6% of the people who tested positively for the Coronavirus. Compared to cholera, ebola, HIV this is low mortality. The main issue for Coronavirus is not that it is deadly that it is transmitted before signs of infection appear, so infected hosts do not look sick but are carriers. It is like the story of Typhoid Mary, who didn\u2019t get sick herself but gave the infection to many others. By the time Coronavirus infected individuals develop symptoms they have already infected others. Another issue is that we don\u2019t know a lot about the disease yet like is infection primarily through aerosol (coughing and sneezing) or other routes as well. ",

Shouldn't the most vulnerable be quarantined? And why are the rates for the oldest included with the youngest? This means all get judged as one. Younger people should be left to their schooling and work\u2026 4\u201321\u201320 Germany's ratio of 29.987 for cases reported-to-deaths is the best in Europe. Canada has a 21.598 ratio and the USA has 18.431. Germany has taken a stricter approach in closing down its society with early-on testing for Covid-19. In theory, fewer sick will allow it to start up its economy before those of other more advanced countries. While its stricter lock-down has apparently resulted in fewer casualties, Sweden has taken an opener approach: masks; 'distancing'; work at home; etc. Its ratio of cases to death is 8.861 and public facilities are open- bars, parks, restaurants, schools, etc. But it's larger neighbors have about the same ratio: the UK has 7.443; Spain has 9.954; Italy has 7.463; and France has 7.668. Only Sweden has an open approach to Covid-19 control. Its results are equal to those of other European countries except for Germanys'. The problem with the closed approach is that it happens at the expense of economies. Swedens' will still work while those of other closed-approach societies will need re-starting. Many in the latter countries will have had their lives disrupted. Shouldn't susceptibles quarantine while others proceed with school, work, and homelife? Why kill the collective life of the many for the sake of the few? ",

            "answer_text": "Michelle Sokoll asks how dangerous Is the COVID-19 virus. We are beginning to see the answer being played out each day. From the medical perspective, the latest is the awareness of significant proportions that may have no symptoms, as reported from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt. Meanwhile we read the report of the first of the Fusco family in New Jersey who died in two days. This may reflect more the precision details of the host and not the nature and danger of the virus. Either way there are things that the virus does to humans after it successfully infects the individual. Those without symptoms may recover with the gift of antibodies. Even for those with mild cases, there may be similar processes triggered as in those with raging fatal illness. Both release cytokines into the serum plus other cell-based responses. The fever and chlls of influenza may be due to the Interferon cytokine that is triggered. Used as a medication, Interferon almost predictably has a side effect of fever and chills. Our understanding on how to treat this is rapidly advancing by leaps and bounds. ",

Its been a month it\u2019s building up and will probably stretch till end of March if not into Mid April. That means sales and marketing teams are not able to meet clients. Extrapolate that to any business and it\u2019s a certain loss. It also means the order pipeline for next two quarters is severely dented. IT tech giants on the west coast of US who got hammered during 2008 reacted late with layoffs and cuts. The manager who survived that are already laying off people. This is coming straight from executives who are in planning boardroom as I gather industry wide feedback. Plans are in place for massive layoffs and deep cuts in workforce. This obviously leads to unemployment. Unemployment leads to mortgage defaults which leads to direct impacts to banking. A Doppler effect will ensure the whole train wreck is about to unfold. Smart folks who were considering downsizing their current homes will do so quickly and proactively without waiting for an offer that meets their target. When US catches cold India catches pneumonia. Any cuts in American IT budgets means more lay-off in India. This will further impact internal consumption in India as disposable incomes evaporate from the economy. By catering to Shaheen baug like stupidity Indian are playing into hands to mischief mongers. Mark this answer and keeping returning every two months becomes we are about to run off tracks. I am worried for my family and our communities because in recession no one comes out a winner not even capitalist. We are collectively staring down the barrel of a deep recession and that too very soon. ",

That\u2019s 0.01% right? So is that a threat? And who\u2019s it killing, young adults and kids? Not really, it\u2019s killing old people and other with underlying medical conditions like obesity. Sooooo it\u2019s hard to really say.   The panic is absolutely a threat. Kids today are screwed entering the workforce.. they will never be able to recover from this economically, so many generational livelihoods are gone, education is tanking, depression is up, suicide is up, domestic violence\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t look like it ending soon. That\u2019s a threat for me as it directly hurts my kids and wife. So yeah, I\u2019d definitely say it\u2019s a threat. Maybe not the virus itself but the overreaction to it: definitely. ",

A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Moreover, Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. The first death from coronavirus infection was reported on 9th Jan 2020 in Wuhan, China. From then on, the disease became a threat to the other countries that have Chinese people traveling frequently. Until 31st Jan 2020, there are 9,800 confirmed cases around the world and 213 dead reported cases. However, the reported death cases are only in China until now. There are four continents record cases of infection. Asia has China, of course, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, South Korean, Japan, Philippines, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka. Europe has Finland, Germany, Italy, and France. Canada and the United State are the two countries in South America record cases of infection. In Oceana, Australia records 9 cases of infection.

In my country alone: A woman, after testing positive, went to a supermarket and coughed and sneezed over all the fresh produce. She was arrested.A person working for NAB bank faked having Covid-19.Police have been coughed and spat on by people pretending to have covid-19.People are ignoring the self-isolation rules.At least one family have bought a trolley full of baby formula by going in and buying the two pack limit, placing it in their trolley outside, and going in for more.Someone was tested positive for covid-19 and went around licking trolley handles.As long as people keep being complete fucking morons like the examples listed above, the pandemic will only keep spreading.

The virus has infected hundreds of people since the outbreak began started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The virus was first spotted by Scientist Leo Poon, who thinks that it likely started in an animal and has quickly spread to humans. Poon, who is a virologist at the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong said: \u201cWhat we know is it causes pneumonia and then doesn\u2019t respond to antibiotic treatment, which is not surprising, but then in terms of mortality, SARS kills 10% of the individuals.\u201d At the moment, It is not apparent how deadly the newly discovered Wuhan coronavirus will be, but total fatality rates at present are lower than those of MERS and SARS combined. Experts, however, stress that the data will change rapidly as the outbreak develops. The World Health Organization has offered guidance to many countries on ways to prepare for it, and how to look out for the sick and also treat patients. Below is what you must know about coronaviruses and the Wuhan coronavirus to be specific. Chinese Coronavirus - How Worried Should We Be? Everything You Need to Know ",

            "answer_text": "Where we arrive at crowd invulnerability is scientifically identified with the germ's inclination to spread, communicated as its multiplication number, or R0. The R0 for the coronavirus is somewhere in the range of 2 and 2.5, researchers gauge (pdf), which means each contaminated individual passes it to around two others, missing measures to contain the disease. To envision how group invulnerability functions, consider coronavirus cases increasing in a defenseless populace along these lines: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. In any case, if a large portion of the individuals are insusceptible, half of those diseases won't ever occur, thus the spreading speed is successfully cut in two. At that point, as per the Science Media Center, the flare-up stews along like this rather: 1, 1, 1, 1 \u2026 The episode is snuffed out once the disease rate is under 1. The present germ's pace of spread is higher than that of the customary influenza, however like that of novel emanant flu viruses that have every so often cleared the globe previously. \"That is like pandemic influenza of 1918, and it suggests that the finish of this pestilence will require almost half of the populace to be insusceptible, either from an antibody, which isn't on the prompt skyline, or from normal disease,\" Harvard University disease transmission specialist Marc Lipsitch told a social affair of specialists on a video call this end of the week. The more irresistible an infection is, the more individuals should be invulnerable for us to accomplish group insusceptibility. Measles, one of the most effortlessly transmitted infections with a R0 more than 12, requires about 90% of individuals to be safe for unprotected individuals to get a free ride from the crowd. That is the reason new episodes can begin when even little quantities of individuals quit the measles antibody. So also, if the coronavirus spreads more effectively than the specialists might suspect, more individuals should get it before group insusceptibility is come to. For a R0 of 3, for instance, 66% of the populace must be safe before the impact kicks in, as indicated by the most straightforward model. Regardless of whether it's half or 60% or 80%, those figures infer billions tainted and millions slaughtered the world over, in spite of the fact that the more gradually the pandemic unfurls, the more noteworthy the possibility for new medications or antibodies to help. The most up to date epidemiological models created in the UK presently prescribe forceful \"concealment\" of the infection. The essential strategies being encouraged is disengage wiped out individuals, attempt to diminish social contacts by 75%, and close schools. Those monetarily expensive measures could proceed for a long time. \"Stifling transmission implies that we won't develop group resistance,\" says Azra Ghani, the lead disease transmission specialist on the new model of the flare-up from Imperial College London. The exchange off of progress is \"that we are driving it down to such a low level, that we need to keep those [measures] set up. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer depends on whether you're looking at the fatality rate (the risk of death among those who are infected) or the total number of deaths. So far, influenza has caused far more deaths this flu season, both in the US and worldwide, than COVID-19. This is why you may have heard it said that the flu is a bigger threat. Regarding the fatality rate, it appears that the risk of death with the pandemic coronavirus infection (commonly estimated at 3% to 4%) is less than it was for SARS (approximately 11%) and MERS (about 35%), but may be higher than the risk from seasonal flu (which averages about 0.1%). What we do know so far is the risk of death very much depends on your age and your overall health. Children appear to be at very low risk of severe disease and death. Older adults and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or lung disease have a higher chance of developing complications like pneumonia, which could be deadly. ",

This is the first pandemic known to be caused by the emergence of a new corona virus. The reports say that illnesses have ranged from very mild to severe including illness resulting in death. Most experts believe the current fatality rate is exaggerated by serious under diagnosis of mild cases and it will kill many if we do not take necessary measures as soon as possible.The virus has caused severe respiratory disease and more than approximately 3 percent of the confirmed cases.

            "answer_text": "\u201cWe'd all like to believe that facts trump falsehoods, but unfortunately this is often not the case. Misinformation is easy to believe, and even easier to spread. AN UNTRUTH CAN BE REPEATED INTO REALITY BY SIMPLY BOMBARDING THE PUBLIC. via advertisements, news, and social media. It's that easy. Psychologists are demonstrating that repetition is the prime conduit for shaping beliefs. In the 1940s, Floyd Allport and Milton Lepkin conducted pioneering research demonstrating that newspapers could be used to boost morale for the war effort. By repeating positive headlines, EVEN IF THEY WERE MISLEADING WITH THE DETAILS, the public would believe that events are going smoothly, and would thus stand firmly behind the cause. The tactic worked to great effect. Over time, studies have shown that repetition leads to familiarity, which is the key to fostering belief. In a 2007 paper published in the journal Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Doctor Norbert Schwarz, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, had this to say: \u201cPerceived familiarity exerts the observed influence because, under natural conditions, FREQUENT EXPOSURE TO AN OPINION IS OFTEN A VALID CUE THAT MANY PEOPLE SHARE IT , providing the social consensus information that figures prominently in Festinger's ''secondary reality tests.\" Moreover, daily conversational conduct is based on the assumption that communicated information is truthful and relevant (Grice, 1975), again fostering acceptance, in particular when it seems that one has ''heard this repeatedly.'' Unfortunately, ONCE FAMILIAR MISINFORMATION IS EMBEDDED INTO OUR PSYCHE, IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT (BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE) TO DISLODGE. Prior research from Schwarz has found that attempting to debunk myths by presenting contradicting facts can easily backfire. In one study, researchers hung up fliers listing myths about the flu vaccine and corresponding facts contradicting them. Three days later, participants who had read the flier reported less favorable attitudes towards the vaccination than control participants who hadn't read the flier. The research indicated that any repetition of misinformation -- even if the purpose is to debunk -- can serve to perpetuate it. This means that those fighting for the spread of truth have to perform a delicate tap-dance when it comes to quelling misinformation, as any actual mention of the misinformation could hinder their honest pursuits.\u201d I read an article not too long ago where the writer said \u201cwhatever you focus on, that becomes your reality\u201d. People have allowed themselves to become so focused on the corona virus, and the fear that was deliberately inculcated into them because of their ignorance of God and how the body really functions, that their entire lives revolve around it. It has become their reality. They wear their fear in the form of surgical masks, gas masks and latex gloves and think that they are safe. They do not realize that the government has them consenting to their own destruction. Staying confined indoors and agreeing to quarantine yourself WHEN YOU ARE NOT SICK is insanity. The same symptoms of this so called deadly flu are the same symptoms that you get from the so-called flu, or the common cold. They were the same symptoms that occurred when they made up the \u201cswine\u201d flu and the \u201cebola\u201d virus. People are scared to sneeze in public. Why? The corona virus. It never occurs to them that sneezing is God\u2019s way of violently clearing the nasal passage of obstructions that could hinder breathing. It is also one of the many ways that toxins are eliminated from your blood via mucous. No one has ever dropped dead from sneezing. Coughing clears your lungs of debris and also eliminates toxic waste from your blood through the phleghm that is coughed up. A fever burns up toxins and all of these are not sickness but immune responses that were designed by a kindly God who shews forth his patience with our ignorance and many errors by trying to heal us of the diseases we have brought upon ourselves through our own willful ignorance. I have had my share these symptoms and am still here. People have been sneezing and coughing and having fevers since sin came into the world and no one ever died from any of these healing, acute \u201cdiseases\u201d. But I tell you what people HAVE died from. Being confined in closed up spaces, breathing poisonous substances - the same toxic substances contained in those hand sanitizers and cleaning products that everyone is buying up. From being UNCLEAN\u2026.from overcrowding such as was done to the Jewish people in the holocaust. From UNSANITARY CONDITIONS. FROM COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEMS that are a result of malnutrition from commercially processed foods. From a lack of fresh air, sunshine and exercise. Everything is closed but the grocery stores and big box stores selling this same commercial food. The liquor stores are open and no one questions this, because people are keeping their distance from each other. The government does not want people talking. They might see through the lies and they don\u2019t want that. They want you to do exactly what you are doing: sitting at home eating nutrient deficient commercial food that will weaken your immune system. When that happens, you will begin to cough, sneeze and develop fevers that God instituted to heal you. But because you don\u2019t believe this truth, you will succumb to the lie that you have a deadly virus and will submit, not only to any medical procedure or take their drugs (which will further weaken you) but you will now, by your own willful ignorance and consent be forcefully quarantined. These same commercially processed, dead, nutrient deficient foods were killing Americans before they made up the myth of the Corona virus - and will be killing them long after the Corona Virus has done it\u2019s evil deed of killing off first the homeless, then the elderly and then juveniles. They tell you that you should practice social distancing? Does anyone not see that they are FOSTERING AN ATMOSPHERE OF MISTRUST BETWEEN NEIGHBORS? Maintain a distance of 6 feet? When you DIE you are buried 6 FEET UNDER. You must keep a distance of 6 feet from your neighbor WHOM THE GOVERNMENT IS SUBTILLY TELLING YOU THAT YOU CANNOT TRUST, but you can SURELY trust government\u2026the same government that brought to pass the Patriot Act as a result of THEIR PLANNED 9/11 ATTACK that took away most of the rights that Americans had. This Corona virus is going to take away what\u2019s left of those rights and it\u2019s so obvious that the sheeple don\u2019t see it. They are taking away your rights by getting you to CONSENT to what they are doing to you. Their words are SLICK. Their \u201corders\u201d have no force and effect until you FIRST agree to them and THEN and only then does it become law. THEY EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO TELL YOU THAT ALL IS VOLUNTARY. In this way, you will not have a legal leg to stand on when they drag you into court and lock you in your home based concentration camp. Those key cards locks on those new apartments are there for a reason. It means someone, somewhere has ACCESS to those locks. It means that they can LOCK YOU IN so that you CANNOT GET OUT. You wouldn\u2019t go to jail if you were exposed to a murderer, nor would you need to VOLUNTARILY (or be coerced, threatened or intimidated) sit in a cell to \u201csee\u201d if you developed the symptoms of a murderer. Why then are people AGREEING to be quarantined? FEAR. Again, people have been sneezing, coughing and having fevers for thousands of years\u2026the common cold, food poisoning\u2026these are IMMUNE RESPONSES. They are protective and not harmful. Why then do they fear? Because they rely on doctors who get their license to practice on them from THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. Just as they convinced people that HIV is the cause of Aids without a shred of concrete proof and just as most people believed it then without doing one ounce of research OF THEIR OWN or QUESTIONING anything, so too are they doing it now. Does anyone remember the holocaust? Six million Jews were exterminated in the holocaust. How did they do it? How did they get these people into concentration camps? The exact same way that they are getting people to \u201cself-quarantine\u201d with the corona virus. DECEPTION. The modus operandi never changes. If you are \u201cSELF-QUARANTINED YOU ARE DOING IT TO YOURSELF. And the irony is, the psychopaths are probably sitting somewhere now, drinking CORONA beer and having a grand laugh at all the sheeple that they have managed to deceive with their lies. They are roaring with laughter at the wool that they have pulled over most of the worlds eyes. It sickens me and to be honest it breaks my heart because I know that many are going to die and most will not believe what is said here IF they even get the chance to read it. Even fewer will go out and do their own research. Yes, many will die but it won\u2019t be from a mysterious viral germ that flies through the air or from droplets that fly from the lungs of someone who coughs or sneezes., but from compromised immune systems. From the fear that checks elimination. From gluttony and overeating. From the domestic violence that will erupt from people who are \u201cself-quarantined\u201d with spouses and children they are not accustomed to being home with and don\u2019t know what to do with since they work all the time and their children are left with strangers all day. They have confined hemselves to their homes, because their god, the federal government says they \u201cshould\u201d. Should is not MUST and no order has any force or effect unless you FIRST agree.The evidence of that agreement is in the masks and gloves you wear. The evidence is your cooperation and compliance. It PROVES that you believe LIES. That you are DECEIVED. It will be because you are willfully ignorant of the God of the Authorized King James 1611. And if men will not have the God who is Truth, they will have the father of lies for their god. Whatever else he may be, he is surely a master manipulator. And so are his ministers. Yes, the Corona virus is dangerous. But only if you BELIEVE it is. Don\u2019t let it become your reality. ",

As per the data, we have lost lacs of lives in the world because of this disease. It is not wrong if we say that this disease is dangerous only because of not taking things seriously. We must take protective measures like using protective masks, medical goggles, sanitized gloves, aloe vera hand sanitizer on a continuous basis. Social distancing is very important otherwise these things cannot work for us. Its been more than three months now and we are still struggling for our lives I think this is the most dangerous disease. Please use precautions and do not take it lightly. ",

            "answer_text": "What is coronavirus? Corona-viruses were discovered in the 1960s early of that century ; the first virus discovered were virus in chickens and two viruses from the nasal cavities of human patients with the common that were subsequently named human coronavirus229E and human coronavirus OC43. Almost everyone gets a coronavirus disease at least once in their whole life, most likely as a young child. In the Abroad, coronaviruses are more common in the winter season, but anyone can come down with a coronavirus disease at any time. The name of the word \"coronavirus\" is derived from the Latin word corona, It means crown, which refers to the characteristic appearance of the affected virus particles : they have a fringe reminiscent of the solar corona. Coronaviruses primarily affect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. They also cause a range of diseases in farm animals and domesticated pets, some of which can be injurious and are a threat to the farming industry. In chickens/hens, the infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus, targets not only the breathing tract but also the urogenital tract. The coronavirus can spread to different organs throughout the chicken. Critical infections have high morbidity and tropism for the salivary, lachrymal and hardarian glands. Coronavirus particles: There are four common types of coronavirus that can infect humans. 229E (alpha coronavirus) NL63 (alpha coronavirus) OC43 (beta coronavirus) HKU1 (beta coronavirus) Rarer, more dangerous types include MERS-CoV, which causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS-CoV. Coronavirus Vaccine The vaccine will likely be based on a new technology that has been tested in animals/mammals and gone through early-stage trials in humans, but has yet to receive regulatory approval against any disease. There are no antiviral drugs that are approved for prevention/treatment for coronavirus. Common Symptoms of Coronavirus These are the most common symptoms of coronavirus \u00b7 Low grade fever \u00b7 Runny nose \u00b7 Coughing \u00b7 Sore throat Infection \u00b7 Breathlessness \u00b7 Aches \u00b7 Bacterial pneumonia \u00b7 Bronchitis How to prevent from coronavirus? \u00b7 Wash your hands with hand sanitizer. \u00b7 Keep your place clean. \u00b7 Use mask \u00b7 Avoid close contact with sick people. \u00b7 Avoid smoking and smoky areas. Coronavirus spreading the following ways \u00b7 Coughing and sneezing without covering the mouth. \u00b7 Touching hands with a person who has affected by the virus. \u00b7 Making contact the surface that has the virus What are the treatments for coronavirus infections? There are no specific treatments for coronavirus infections. \u00b7 Taking over-the-counter medicines for fever and cough. However, do not give aspirin and cough medicine to children. \u00b7 Using a room humidifier to help ease a sore throat and cough \u00b7 Getting plenty of rest \u00b7 Drinking fluids/waters.

            "answer_text": "The severity of the infection depends upon the age and underlying diseases that the patient already has. In most of the cases there are mild symptoms and you are safe so no reason to worry if you are young and have no underlying medical issue. On the other hand COVID-19 can cause severe symptoms like pnemonia and difficulty in breathing. I personally was inflected through pneumonia few years back and it was like very normal situation for me maybe because of my immunity or age. So no need to panic! Maintain good hygiene habits,wash your hands and I would say avoid sharing food too for few days until all this is under control . This way we can reduce the overhead on medical facilities and prevent ourself from being infected. One more thing to note: nowadays there is shortage of sanitizers in market because everyone is buying it. So I would like to note a point that you require a sanitizer only if you are travelling otherwise soap and water are best remedies to wash the germs away, better than a sanitizer. ",

People are struggling to look for the vaccine of the corona virus but they have not gotten it,. Even the supper power countries have not found the vaccine while on the other hand, people are dying in hundreds on a dailly basis. The COVID 19 is threatening to shut down the whole earth. Some countries have been locked down in attempt to control the corona virus. Some of the major cities have been locked down even in my country. People fear the corona virus because it is death. Coronaa virus has stopped all the national projects in all the nations. For sure corona virus is very serious, it is no longer a joke any more. People should take care of themselves by ensuring that the prevention measures are observed. Awareness on the dangers of the corona virus should be created in order to help those who lack the knowledge of the corona virus, those who believe on the myths that are circulating in some of the nations about the treatment of the corona virus pandemic.

Basically when you get the corona virus you are treated for common ailments that you have the symptomps for. The chances of you surviving depends entirely on how strong your immune system is.That is where another problem comes up because many are not that healthy from what I have observed. We do not eat healthy foods these days as we did in the past. This is what makes it dangerous. The second thing is how fast it spreads. It does so very fast. ",

Being a disease of viral origin all what we can do is a symptomatic treatment and for that we need elective ventillation for a span of atleast 3 days ,this would decrease the load on our lungs and it will begin to heal (yeah,,our lungs have great capacity to heal)..now the problem lies in the fact that we don't have such huge numbers of ventillators ,,which is making the situation all the more difficult !!!

Spring of 1918, final year of World War 1,September 1918 to January 1919, the deadliest, spread in part by troops first crowded together and then sent home, andFebruary to December 1919.Many famous people died in this pandemic -most notably for today's events , this list includes the grandfather of US President Donald Trump. A simple extrapolation of the Spanish Flu death rates to today's pandemic ( unlikely but helps to predict worst situation ) suggest staggering mortality numbers. A death of 2 % today would correspond to 150 million deaths. That is an unlikely outcome. Now, in economic terms I.e. effects on GDP is sobering but not alarming. The Spanish Flu reduces real per capita GDP by 6% in typical country. And just for comparison, the World War I reduced 8.4%. Thanks, ",

            "answer_text": "First discovered in the Wuhan city of China, COVID-19 till date has infected an upward of 180,000 individuals globally. This number is more than ten times higher than the SARS virus which affected approximately 8000 individuals back when it was discovered in 2003. The virus is highly contagious and due to it being transmitted from person to person, the number of infected cases have only increased since it was first discovered in December. Given the fact that there is no vaccination or medication for the COVID 19 disease the current levels of infection have forced WHO to declare the disease as Pandemic. While scientists are actively researching for a cure the number of deaths continues to rise. Basic personal hygiene and a healthy eating routine are only proven to help prevent the transmission and assist with recovery. In most cases the virus is known to cause cough, fever &bodyache, however in severe cases the disease is known to cause breathing issues or bluishness of skin. ",

Nearly 60,398 people all over the world have died out of Corona and 1,133,815 people are infected by the same. Corona outbreak is a serious issue because the symptoms of the pathogen may remain hidden during the initial 14 days of getting infected. This means that the victim does not understand that he or she is infected and may not follow any restrictions while mixing with others. In this, an infected person can further infect innumerable people unknowingly. This is the reason why this virus has taken the form of a \u2018pandemic\u2019. ",

CoVid 19 generally comes in at about 3.5%. (Regional variations in mortality run from about 2% to 8%) So, how dangerous CoVid 19 is depends some on what you contrast it with. Personally, I think that 80,000+ dead in the US is an indication of a dangerous disease. ",

This outbreak has killed almost 14,770 people and there are 343,394 cases of coronavirus all around the world. Not only covid-19 has affected people's lives but it also has affected the economy of the countries. Almost every government has quarantined all the people of their nation. And because these markets are shut down even the retail stores are closing. And people are facing many problems to get their basic necessities. So, what is the main concern? The main concern is, In this outbreak how are businesses going to survive and more importantly how are people going to survive if all the retail stores and businesses shut down!!  It is the most serious issue that the world is facing right now, the number of deaths and infected people is increasing day by day. Even after taking so many measures that are not under control, only personal hygiene and awareness can help you to fight this virus. Covid-19 is more dangerous for people who are suffering from diabetes, BP, lung disease. Also from the stats of dead people, it is clear that the recovery of old people is very less. But it is good to see that all the nations have united and are fighting together from this chronic disease. Taking a little bit of initiative and responsibility for society can help all of us to overcome this covid-19 outbreak. Thank you for reading!! ",
