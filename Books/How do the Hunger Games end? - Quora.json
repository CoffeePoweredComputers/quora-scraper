            "answer_text": "Well, it ends with the games being abolished. Katniss is put into exile for assassinating the new President Alma Coin due to the fact that Coin was responsible for Prim\u2019s death. Gale goes to District 2, knowing that as he had a partial role in Prim\u2019s death Katniss would never forgive him. Finnick and Annie have a son, no one knows what happened with Beetee, Johanna and Enobaria but Peeta also goes back to 12, reuniting with Katniss and Haymitch. Eventually, they create a memorial book to remember things that are too precious to forget, and Katniss realises that she needs her \u2018dandelion in the spring, \u2018 and so allows herself to fall in love with Peeta. In the epilogue set around 15-20 years later, it is shown that they got married and had 2 kids, a girl with black hair and blue eyes, and a boy with blind hair and grey eyes. Their names were never revealed. In the films the children change to a baby and a toddler, with both of them being Jennifer Lawrence's nephews. Both the films and the books end with the line: There are much worse games to play ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not entirely sure what your question means, but I will try and explain as best I can :) The Hunger Games (the book and film) ends with Katniss and Peeta both being victors of the 74th annual hunger games and going back to district 12 to celebrate and be reunited with their families. The Hunger Games Catching Fire (book and film) ends with Katniss waking up in district 13 with Gale beside her and being told that district 12 is no longer there - it has been bombed. The Hunger Games Mockingjay (book) ends with Katniss and Peeta and their 2 children living in district 12 happy and content. They won the revelation, President Coin and Snow are dead but so is Prim. Katniss\u2019 mother stays in the capitol and becomes a nurse and Gale moves to district 2 and becomes a soldier. If I didn\u2019t answer what you meant, then please leave a comment as I tried my best :) ",
