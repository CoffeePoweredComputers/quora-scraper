            "answer_text": "See for chemistry you should go for a particular publication for all the three sections i.e. PHYSICAL , INORGANIC and ORGANIC. In market there are numerous books under various publications like arihant,GRB cengage,balaji. SO I WILL TELL ABOUT THESE 4 PUBLICATIONS WHICH ARE MENTIONED ABOVE: ARIHANT:this book is really great for jee preparation.you can consider it but the problem is that this tends towards JEE ADVANCED more.since the question is also concern about jee mains then you should not do this book.CENGAGE:this book is also great and equal to the level of arihant's series.BUT it has also the same problem and another problem is that this book has 6 volumes(2 vol. for each part) so completing this book will be a tedious job to do!!GRB:i was not able to find any problem in this publication as the authors have written very nicely.Especially the organic book written by himanshu pandey is well known and is also used by toppers. I would say that it's the best book for organic.Similarly the physical chemistry portion is too good written by OP TANDON.but here comes the flaw, actually not a flaw but a not good thing that the inorganic chemistry book is of huge size and you should think that for just some percentage of marks you cannot study this much huge book.BALAJI:I am preparing from this publication so i can tell you the best things about it.physical chemistry: written by n.avasthi, a superb book which mathces the level of op tandon, the best part being that exercises are sorted into 3 level. Level 1 for jee mains and level 2 and 3 for jee advanced.inorganic chemistry: this book is written by vk jaiswal and it is also a great book. it is also sorted into the same levels!!organic chemistry: written by ms chouhan, acc. to me the best book which can be found for organic chemistry.This book is available in two parts: elementary problem in organic chemistry for jee mains.advanced problems in organic chemistry which is for jee advanced.SO I HAVE REVIEWED ALL THE PUBLICATIONS , NOW YOU CAN MAKE UR DECISION. IF YOU ASK ME THEN I WILL TELL YOU TO GO FOR BALAJI AS I M PREPARING FROM IT. AND I KNOW WHAT TYPE OF CONCEPT IT BUILDS!! ",

            "answer_text": "Indeed, a great trio! Hello, for jee main and jee advanced chemistry this set is best to conquer both theoretical as well as numerical problems. I have fully solved N Avasthi, MS chauhan and most of problems of VK Jaiswal. N Avasthi has sections divided for practice of jee main and jee advanced, also it has short topic summary to revise the main concepts of the topic. Ms chauhan is a problem practice book which is best book to solve most of the types of reactions in the syllabus, it comes in two editions separated for jee main and jee advanced, also it has solution book, which is the best thing about it. VK jaiswal has a lot of problems for jee main and jee advanced, well most of the problems are even not needed for jee advanced, because the paper theory is mostly inclined towards NCERT. One point to note is that, it depends on student how he or she makes the best use of it. These books could be more than sufficient for a student, for others, they can't be able to solve most of problem even after solving them . Prepare wisely. Best. ",
