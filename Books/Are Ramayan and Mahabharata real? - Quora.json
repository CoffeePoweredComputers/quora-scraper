            "answer_text": "Ramayana and Mahabharata were not considered as a work of fiction before the mughals invaded India and then the britishers.Mughals did their best to destroy our culture and started conversion. Our temples were demolished, scriptures were burnt and edited. Finally, Ramayana and Mahabharat got labelled as a work of fiction. Did you ever think why everytime sanatan dharam is targeted? If you think that Ramayana and Mahabhrata is not real because it is hard to believe that A person can lift a mountain and fly with the speed of light.Flying Aircrafts and nuclear weapon can exist thousands of year ago.A man can have ten heads.A woman can have 100 sons.A person can change his shape and size as he wants.Then hold on,Let me introduce some facts and points to prove that Ramayana and Mahabharata are not fictional, it is our history. Amazing Proofs that indicate Ramayana actually happened!  The Ramayana: History or mythology? The Ramayana is one of two epics, the other being the Mahabharata, which have had a crucial influence in shaping the nature of Indian civilization. The Ramayana existed in the oral tradition perhaps as far back as 1,500 BCE, but the fourth century BCE is generally accepted as the date of its composition in Sanskrit by Sage Valmiki. Many historians claim that Ramayana actually happened and is not a mythological folklore. Here are few evidences that make a compelling case\u2026 1/17  Cobra Hood cave, Sri Lanka The tradition states that Mata Sita was held in confinement in the Cobra Hood cave. There are many pre-historic drawings on its ceiling. An inscription in the cave that reads, \u2018Parumaka naguliya lene\u2019 further establishes a distinct link between Mata Sita and the Cobra Hood cave. The Demons who guarded Mata Sita while she was Ravana\u2019s prisoner called her her Naguliya \u2013 one who was born off the ploughshare. 2/17  Existence of Hanuman Garhi Lord Hanuman is one of the most important characters of Ramayana and an ardent devotee of Lord Rama. Hanuman Garhi, now a temple is a place in Ayodhya, where Hanuman ji was waiting patiently for Lord Rama who was in exile. Hanuman Garhi temple is also famous for its strategic location. It is situated at such a height and at such a site, from where the sunrises and sunsets are artistically visible. 3/17  Foot Prints of Lord Hanuman When Hanuman ji reached at Ashok Vatika, he is said to have come in the form of a giant. There are giant footprints on one side of the lake there which are said to be Hanuman's footprints, formed when he landed there. 4/17  Ram Sethu It is estimated that 'Rama's Bridge' is constructed in around 5000 B.C, with the use of wood and stones. This supports the claim of Ramayana being Historical. It is also backed by the construction method used to build the bridge is mentioned in the Valmiki's text. 5/17  Sync between time history and ages Archaeological studies reveal that the first human inhabitation happened in Sri Lanka around 1,750,000 years ago and it\u2019s been proved that the bridge\u2019s age dates back to the same equivalent. To top it, the dates mentioned in the text of Valmiki matches with that of primitive age as well. 6/17  Mystery of Floating stones In Ramayan it is mentioned that the Ram Setu was built by Stones and these stone starts floating on water by touch of Nala & Neel. Some such stones were scattered at Rameshwaram during the Tsunami, these stones still float on water. Many Geologist says RAMA Setu is built by natural process but failed to provide enough proofs. Apart from The Ramayana there are several facts which say Rama Setu is a man-made Structure. 7/17  Sanjeevani Mountain, Dunagiri Lord Hanumana carried the entire mountain that had Sanjeevani Booti when Lakshmana lost his consciousness during the war with Indrajeet. This mountain was named as Dunagiri. In most re-tellings of The Ramayana, after the medicines were used, Hanuman flies again to replace the mountain in its rightful place. There lies a scar on the side of Dunagiri where Hanumana sliced off a big chunk of mythological real estate, a scar which \u201cbleeds\u201d in the afternoon sun. 8/17  Himalayan Herbs in Sri Lanka Exotic alpine Himalayan species are found suddenly amidst tropical Sri Lankan vegetation, the legacy of Hanuman\u2019s heroic voyage carrying a mountain with life-restoring herbs called Sanjeevani. 9/17  Ashok Vatika, Sri Lanka It was the location where Mata Sita was held captive by Ravana after her abduction, because she refused to stay in Ravana's palace, and preferred to stay under the Ashoka tree, hence the name. Much of the Ashoka Vatika was destroyed by Hanuman ji, when he first visited Lanka, searching for Mata Sita. Its present location is believed to be the Hakgala Botanical Garden, the area is known as Seetha Eliya. 10/18  Existence of Lepakshi, Andhra Pradesh When Mata Sita was abducted by Ravana, they bumped into Jatayu, a demi-god in vulture form, who tried his best to stop Ravana. Lepakshi, in Andhra Pradesh, is said to be the place where Jatayu fell down. Shree Ram, accompanied by Hanuman ji and Laxman ji met the dying Jatayu. Shree Ram helped him to attain moksha by uttering the words \"Le Pakshi\", which is Telugu for \"Rise, bird\". There's also a large footprint in that area which is said to be that of Hanumana's.  11/17  Four-tusked elephants Sundar Kanda [4.27.12] states that Hanuman ji, on entering Lanka, sees Four-Tusked elephants guarding the palaces of Ravana. These elephants were tall and imposing and had been trained to protect Lanka from invaders. Well, fossil remains show that there were many steps in the evolution of the 'Modern Elephant' and there did exist four-tusked ancestors of elephants in various shapes and sizes such as Trilophodon, Tetralophodon, Gomphotherium etc around 20 million years ago! 12/17  Existence of Konda Kattu Gala, Ishtreepura This was one of the places to which King Ravana shifted Mata Sita as a precautionary measure which he was forced to take by Lord Hanuman's advent. There are lots of intruding tunnels and caves in this area. This seems to be a part of a great ingenious network of paths, which is interconnected to all the major areas of King Ravana's city. 13/17  Ravana\u2019s palace These tunnels prove beyond doubt the architectural brilliance of King Ravana. These tunnels served as a quick means of transport through the hills and also as a secret passage and networked all the important cities, airports and dairy farms. A close look at these tunnels indicates that they are man-made and not natural formations. This Buddhist shrine at Kalutara was where once King Ravana's palace and a tunnel existed there. 14/17  Kalaniya After King Ravana\u2019s death, Vibhishana was coronated as The King of Lanka by Lakshmana ji at Kelaniya. There are murals enshrined outside the Buddhist temple depicting the crowning of Vibhishana. The Kelani River is mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana and Vibhishana\u2019s palace was said to be on the banks of this river. 15/17  Proof of Lord Hanuman setting fire to Ravana\u2019s kingdom The color of the soil of the ancient battlefield is still red today, and is still surrounded by lighter colored earth. One of the airports of Ravana, torched by Hanuman ji when he came looking for Mata Sita, still has a scorched-earth look. A patch of darker soil surrounded by brown earth. 16/17  Divurumpola, Sri Lanka After Shree Ram rescued Mata Sita from Lanka, he made her go through Agni Pariksha to test her purity. The place where this is said to have happened is Divurumpola in Sri Lanka. There is a tree in that exact spot and even today, local disputes are settled through debates and discussions under that tree. 17/17  Ramalingam Since Shree Rama felt guilty of killing a Brahmin (Brahmahasthi Dosham), he decided to take penance at Munneswaram, 80 km from present Colombo. This is the place where lord Rama prayed to lord Shiva and lord Shiva answered his prayer by asking him to install four lingams. Out of this four, one of the linga was made of sand by Mata sita and other brought by lord hanuman from Kailash Mountain. Lingams at Rameshwaram and Manavari temple was built by lord Rama himself and so, is known as Ramlingam. Now, let\u2019s move to the mahabharata.  The Mahabharata: History or Fiction? If there be a word for the most incredible tale ever told \u2013 then it is the story of the Mahabharat. There is a great debate about whether there is any historical accuracy in the story of Mahabharata. This narrative is so remarkable that it has made numerous people speculate - \u2018Did it really happen? Let\u2019s find some proofs that indicate mahabharat is our itihas. 1/20   Decoding the language It has been written in the epic from time to time that Mahabharat is a \"itihas\" which exclusively means \"thus occured\". The words \"Puraan\" and \"Itihas\" were specifically coined by the ancient people to categorize the \"ancient\" and \"recent\" events. Both the words denote history that has occurred at different times. If the intentions of the writer were to write a poem or a work of fiction, he would have stated it to be a \"mahakavya\" or \"katha\".  2/20 Records of the Bharat-Dynasty It is mentioned in Aadiparva, Adhyaya 62 that the records of the Bharat-Dynasty are recorded in the Mahabharata. A number of dynasties with their long lineage of kings (more than 50 from Manu) have been presented in the work. If it were just fiction, 4-5 kings would have sufficed to build the story on. 3/20  Details of Kaliguga Read the description of Kaliyuga as mentioned in Mahabharata. Whatever Shree Krishna said tallies with creepy, mysterious accurateness with modern life as it exists today. And remember - this was written thousands of years ago! Fiction? Unlikely because there are way too many corroborations and tallying circumstances for it to be fiction. 4/20  The city of Dwaraka Marine archaeology has also been utilized in India off the coast of the ancient port city of Dwaraka in Gujarat, uncovering further evidence in support of statements in the Vedic scriptures. An entire submerged city at Dvaraka, the ancient port city of Lord Krishna with its massive fort walls, piers, warfs and jetty has been found in the ocean as described in the Mahabharata and other Vedic literatures. This sanskrit verse from the Mausala Parva 7 verse 40 of the Mahabharata, describes the disappearance of the city of Dvaraka into the sea. \"After all the people had set out, the ocean flooded Dvaraka, which still teemed with wealth of every kind. Whatever portion of land was passed over, the ocean immediately flooded over with its waters.\" 5/20  Ancient cities described in the Mahabharatha More than thirty-five sites in North India have yielded archaeological evidence and have been identified as ancient cities described in the Mahabharatha. Copper utensils, iron, seals, gold & silver ornaments, terracotta discs and painted grey ware pottery have all been found in these sites. Scientific dating of these artifacts corresponds to the non-aryan-invasion model of Indian antiquity. 6/20  Similarity between Ramayana and Mahabharata The dynasties recorded in the Ramayan and the Mahabharat concur without a difference. Even the relations between different kings and their dynasties in both the great \"epics\" match with each other. If both were mere \"epics\" written by two entirely different at two different times, why would everything match even upto minor details? Mahabharat is of a later date than the Ramayan. Why would the author of the Mahabharat borrow the same ideas and characters as those of the author of Ramayana? 7/20  Lineage of Shri Krishna The Greek historian Megasthenes has stated that Chandragupta Maurya was the 138 King in the lineage of Shri Krishna. This means that Shri Krishna did exist in the bygone era and that Mahabharat did really occur. 8/20  Present cities from Mahbaharata All places mentioned in Mahabharata are real places, all are identified as real places. For instance, Hastinapur is in UP. Indraprastha is the present day Delhi. Dwarka is located in Gujarat coast. Moreover, Mahabharata cities are not limited to present day India because Mahabharata referred Indian subcontinent as Bharata. For example, Gandhar could be present day Kandhar. 9/20  Astronomical references The Udyoga Parva of Mahabharata narrates that, just before the War, Lord Krishna went to Hastinapur in the month of Kartika on the day when moon was at the asterism Revati. On His way to Hastinapur, Krishna took rest for a day at a place called Brikasthala, and on that day the moon was at the asterism Bharani. The day on which Duryodhana turned down all the efforts of Krishna and made the war inevitable, the moon was resting at the asterism Pushya. 10/20  Bharat Varsh The country is named Bhaarat after the king Bharat (son of Dushyant & Shakuntala). What country would be named after the hero of a novel! 11/20  Hole in the Aryan theory European scholars brought the nomadic Aryan tribes, into India after 1500 BC. How could these Aryans create Sanskrit language, gain so much knowledge and write all these texts before 700 BC? Great Indian thinkers including Lokmanya Tilak, Sri Arbindo, and Dyanand Sarasvati rejected the European theory. 12/20  Mahabharata is written in verses It is ridiculous to say that these texts are fiction, because of its poetic nature. It was a custom to write everything (even Mathematical formulae) in poetic form. 13/20  Unrecorded history factor Maurya, Gupta and Indo-Greek dynasties, are also recorded in our Puraanas. These dynasties are accepted only because they are also recorded by Greek historians. What about the dynasties that existed before the Greek historians? 14/20  Citing Oppenheimer The architect of modern atomic bomb who was in charge of the Manhattan project was asked by a student after the manhattan explosion, \u201cHow do you feel after having exploded the first atomic bomb on earth\u201d. Oppenheimer\u2019s reply for the question was, \u201cnot first atomic bomb, but first atomic bomb in modern times\u201d. He strongly believed that nukes were used in ancient India. 15/20 Some Unanswered questions What made Oppenheimer believe that it was a nuclear war was the accurate descriptions of the weapons used in the Mahabharata war in the epic which match with that of modern nuclear weapons? How much truth is there in the stories that claim that a region in Kurukshetra still have high level of radio activity? 16/20  The Gregorian Calendar Not a surprise, but surely very interesting to note that the Gregorian Calendar indeed vouches for the Kurukshetra War to have taken place, as it states the beginning of Kali Yuga. Per the Calendar, the event occurred on February 18, 3102 BCE at 2:27:30 AM. Both, the Eastern and Western culture have accepted this date and time to have been the beginning of Kali Yuga and, also the death of Lord Krishna. 17/20  The Underwater Discoveries Among the extensive and deep underwater discoveries were the massive Dwarka city wall, a large door socket and a bastion from the fort wall, natural harbour, two rock-cut slipways of different width and sizes extending from the beach to the intertidal zone and numerous old stone ship anchors were excavated.  The three-headed motif on a sea-conch shell was also found in the excavation and such motif is referred in the scripture Harivamsa is a further proof of the existence of Dwarka city and a direct link to Kurukshetra war. 18/20  Perfect narration of the planetary positions Krishna left Hastinapura with Karna, on the day when the moon was yet to reach the asterism Uttara Phalguni. Karna accompanied Him to some distance to see him off and he then described to the Lord the positions of planets in the sky. He expressed his apprehension that such a planetary configuration stood for a very bad omen: such as large scale loss of life and drenching of blood. Vyasa narrated all these planetary positions in as many as sixteen verses as if someone was describing it after visualizing them in the sky. 19/20   Flying Aircraft & Nuclear War The Indian Epics, especially the MAHABHARATA, pick up the thread of the tale of devastation and destruction. Sanskrit scholars could not comprehend what was being described in the Epics until the dropping of the first atomic bombs on Japan.  There are Authentic Verses from Mahabharata: \u201cGurkha, flying a swift and powerful vimana (fast aircraft) hurled a single projectile (rocket) charged with the power of the Universe (nuclear device). An incandescent column of smoke and flame, as bright as ten thousand suns, rose with all its splendour.\u201d 20/20  The Ramayana and The Mahabharata doesn\u2019t have a happy ending. If you write a story, then the main character of your story will be shown as superior to everyone and glorified. He will not suffer. Just like movies, The villain dies in the end not hero. But in The Ramayana, Mata Sita the wife of hero suffers and in the last the hero(Shree Rama) dies. If it was a story then the story would have ended after Shree Rama killed Ravana. Shree Rama would returm to Ayodhya and rule the kingdom. Similarly in The Mahabharata, Arjuna forgets his dhanur vidya and can not lift his Gaandeev. Shree Krishna leaves his body and his entire dynasty ends. These were some facts and proofs that indicate that these are not just stories, these are our history. Stop calling them mythological or fictional stories. Thanks for reading! (Images were used for representation purpose only). Pic source: Internet ",

            "answer_text": "Let me put it this way.  Do you think that there could have been a flying monkey with the strength to lift a mountain weighing infinite tonnes? Do you think that a man could grow 10 heads after being decapitated? Is there any way that a monkey could fly up to the sun and try to swallow it? If there is any rational scientific explanations for these questions, then I'm all ears. My stand is that Ramayana and Mahabharata are great pieces of literature and should be considered that way.  Valmiki and Vyasa wrote wonderful mythologies which teach great moral values, but in doing so, they used a lot of metaphorical symbolism and and over-the-top imaginative scenarios to make it intriguing. At the same time, they didn't refrain from using real locations, that existed in Southern Asia to make the story more relate-able. The human mind is susceptible to delusion. Since it's been drilled into our minds to believe that a certain thing exists and it's real and it's good for you doesn't mean it is always necessarily true.  If it were true, we should be getting more plausible evidence of this. If Mahabharata is actually true, then millions of lives were lost in that war, that means certainly we should have found some form of evidence of a millions of humans and animals losing their lives in Kurukshetra. Even if most of the human corpses were cremated, there still must be thousands of animal corpses that were unaccounted for, whose fossils should have been found. For heaven's sake, if we can find millions of years old fossils of a T-Rex, can't we find some evidence for a great battle that happened relatively, much much later than the extinction of the Dinosaurs?

            "answer_text": "Yes, they are certainly based on true events. However, the exact historical dates are unknown. Many might argue them to be mythologies but there are some concrete reasons to believe them. One of the reasons is, the places described in Ramayana & Mahabharata still exist. For example, Ayodhya, Palk Strait, Sri Lanka, Mathura, Vrindavan, and so on. In Kurukshektra, that is in Haryana, where the battle of Mahabharata took place, still remains of metals, shaped as swords, clubs etc. are found. The historical ruins that are found are according to exact descriptions and definitions. Still, these accounts seems to be beyond reality. This is particularly because of the type of language used. Sometimes, they does not seem to make any sense. Let me give some reasons one finds hard to believe in them and their reasons too. :: At present times, our perceptions about words and descriptions has changed as time passed. There were technologies that exist in that time which might be beyond our imagination. We should take into account that, it was history and many unknown things existed at that time as the environment was utterly different and so were the peoples. It was just different time in a different society. It is sometimes bizarre for us to imagine ourselves in Victorian age. How can we imagine how would be the ages of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Also, Ramayana was earlier that Mahabharata. :: Another, aspect is the translation and descriptions by different persons in different point of time. We only know that, these epics were written by the saint Vyed Vyas in Sanskrit. But the original version is lost! What we have now are just the interpretations of many subsequent versions. :: Chronology: The time described in Ramayana and Mahabharata is based on Vedic descriptions. It is said that Mahabharata happened in Dwapar Yug, that existed for around 50,00, 000 years before 5000 years! And Ramayana is an account of what happened before Dwapar Yug! So, if we match this up with the western chronology of Prehistoric ages, like palaeolithic age, Mesolithic age, we can reach nowhere. For this, we should look closely to the prehistoric time sequences. There are huge gaps of thousands of years in the so called stone ages, that are unaccounted. Moreover, still relics and remains are discovered time to time that puts archaeologist to a complete jeopardy. The dates just do not match up! We cannot clam that the Vedic chronology is accurate, because we are even not sure of some Sanskrit words, there is a great possibility of misinterpretations. However, we also cannot believe the chronology of prehistoric stone ages. It is disappointing to know still there are people who believe Mahabharata is a story and not as a history. It would be interesting if these \u2018intellectuals\u2019 does not think Iliad and Odyssey were fairy tales and try to find logic behind Troy, Achilles and Hector. There are concrete historical evidences about Mahabharata and there are no exaggerations in any account. The anomalies occur only because of difference in understanding separate writings and inscriptions throughout history. Map of India in the Age of the Mahabharata There are tonnes of reliable material even on internet. The actual controversy is on the exact period when the war happened. Chronological timelines mentioned in scriptures does not match because they follow different calendars. What we follow now as 2017 is per Gregorian Calendar. There are dozens of such calendars throughout the world that follows unique timelines. In India itself there are several calendars following contrasting dates. About those absurdity of mythical powers, let me give an example. Lachit Borphukon was the great Ahom general who did not let Mughals enter Assam. He defeated the Mughal Army in the famous Battle of Saraighat in 1671. I was rather surprised looking at his personal sword preserved at Guwahati Museum. It is 12 feet long weighting 18 Kilos! Can you imagine someone fighting today with a 12 feet long sword weighting 18 Kilos in a face to face battle? Even a barely 350 years old history and its personalities appear as something hard to believe. What about a history that is more than 6000 years old? The truth is: Only fools assume darkness as void.

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s an old joke that if civilization were to be wiped out, and if the new species discovered JRR Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings they would believe it to be the past\u2019s religion just because the books are so immaculately crafted.  That\u2019s what most religious scriptures are fictional books, you don\u2019t want to learn what happened then or who did it, it is not history. Period. What a reader should take away from them are the profound lessons that a good reader can take away from any good book. Religious fanatics are like kids high on sugar, claiming their books are the best. Their author\u2019s the one telling the truth, but none of them are true.  Now. I haven\u2019t read either of the books. Scratch that, I haven\u2019t read any religious scripture. All my knowledge about them stems from a handful of animated movies and that should tell you enough I\u2019m no authority on this matter. But even if 10% of the movie is true to the source material that should tell you none of it was true. But the lessons of duty, honesty, truthfulness, honor will be ever relevant. Try and understand this beautiful extract from Rami Sivan\u2019s answer to the same question. Please try to understand - the ancient Hindus were never interested in HISTORY, they were interested in the quality of human character and the content and evolution of consciousness and modeling ideal behavior. These epics are not to be mined for historical data - which may or may not be there - history is HIS STORY and not relevant to us - here and now - what is important for us in MY STORY - how do these Epics help you to orient yourself in this crazy world, here and now! What lessons can be learned and what is the implication for adaptive action[1]!  Cheers. And I\u2019ll probably not be replying to the comments to this question, unless, of course, there\u2019s a joke involved. Footnotes[1] Rami Sivan's answer to Are Ramayan and Mahabharata real?",

I am answering it as an honest human and what as an individual person I feel about Ramayan and Mahabharata. No offense and strings to anyone. So, I've read all the other answers to this very question too and everyone is absolutely correct in their own sense and ways. Well I have a lil' different and controversial approach to this argument and yeah before I state why I have it, No I don't think they are completely real. I am not saying they are a writer's fantasy but rather they are not exactly absolute literal and what we read is on contrary just an outcome of rust, rush of exaggeration post 7000 years. So according to Google, Ramayana might have happened atleast 7000 or before years back and Mahabharata about 4000\u20135000. \u201c7000 years\u201d damn! There are some proofs that state the story is true, agreed! But what\u2019s the story? Sorry! Dropping the word 'story', rather what exactly happened? What happened 7000 years back, Obviously we don't have time machines and fossiles to prove Ramayana\u2019s eternal truth, yet we have marks (as in some belongings) that the actual story contained in some particular places and are still there. Some proofs (these very marks) existing today are the astonishing bridge between Srilanka and Rameshwaram (partially existing today), footsteps of this character called Hanuman (Jai shree Hanuman, I pray to Mr. Hanuman God so offense to him) and yeah how can we forget the rare species of flora called 'Sanjeevni' which is also found in Srilanka on contrary to it's true habitat which is Himalayas (contextual, if you have ever read Ramayana you'll relate to these points and if not it's okay. Either-ways we are trying to prove it's not real). So what? Well you got some proofs to showcase the story. Hooray! (I am going a little over the line now) It's a story! Ever heard of Chinese whisper? Well it's a game where things are keep adding on one statement and at last the whole statement changes, it still holds the original essence yet molested with additions, fornicated with edited lies (in hindi which also called as \u2018Masala lagakar batana\u2019). These additions aren't real, rather let's count them as ostentatious add-ons on the originality of the initial statements and instances that happened. So, maybe there were these three dudes- Ram, lakshman, Ravan ( Hold on! lemme get there) and they had this man fight over Sita who was totally into Ram and Ravan was just being the unwanted third wheel. So, Ram and his bruh Lakshman called over their guys called Vibhishan, Hanuman, Sugriv and others included and this other guy Ravan also called his guys Kumbhkaran, Megnath (okay, I know the names Kumbhkaran and Megnath name sounds pretty funny even for back then. Though Ram and Urmila and whatnot sounds less sarcast-y but just tryin\u2019 to explain it in a cute way) joined hands and things got a little out of hands and ended with blood on hands with an intense guy fight over this chick. And this story was been told to someone called 'A' after some years, with obvious additions and then to 'B' with some other obvious additions and add-ons and add-ons. So what happened? I am still not saying nothing happened, get me here! Things happened, things went down but with time it has been exaggerated with words, instances and props. Outcome was- we have a story with our guy called Hanuman taking the whole freaking mountain on his index finger to Srilanka via flying ( no personal jet required, just him and an exception to gravity. Gravity was like \u201clet him pass off, I am chilling here\u201d). Okay so now, 2020 upon us! And we still hear the whole Story and I believe every kid in India knows both of them by heart.( Honey I know, I know both of them in a pretty good way and totally respect when a snake protects you and when a kid can break trees with his finger. Well I am sure if my momma found out me writing this, she is def gonna hate me more. Jaja) we all know the stories but what's the bet they aren't the molested, exaggerated, manipulated, ostentatious version of stories in compared to what exactly happened? Well in one class we teach our kids that how we still can\u2019t prove 5D and 7D in theory and in another we are teaching with more intense information that a guy flew over one country to another and burned down the whole city with his tail (oh he has a tail, cause inherited from monkeys). So instead of saying that these are foul plays I urge to take them as stories, they might be true, might not be because getting so called proofs today on basis of story is so not contextual. Maybe there was a curious king who wanted to build a bridge over two countries and failed and declared it as Ram's agenda around 2000 years ago and it was just later on added to a 7000 years old story and ta da! Anything could had been written and you'll still read it as Mr. Ram has done it for you. Blindly trusting them is false, not trusting it okay, reading it as good stories and not caring much about them is i guess superb and the best choice. I mean you shouldn't be naive, read it for fun and maybe it happened, read it for the possibility of fiction and a good fantasy story. Personally I group them along fantasy fictionated non-fiction myths. \u2014Anyways I would still love to fly or get a full time personal poisonous yet domesticated 7-headed snake. NO OFFENSE ",

            "answer_text": "I subscribe to the folklorists' view, so my answer is probably not. Thanks for the A2A, Prathamesh Deshpande. Edit: It's been a while since I wrote that, and now I am more certain. The epics are 100% fictional. How do I conclude this? Let's start by talking about something more recent - say, Captain America. Just bear with me, this will be good. Captain America was a comic book superhero created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, who were both Jewish. In fact, they had created the Captain America comics before the USA officially entered WWII through the Pacific theatre. Yet the very first issue showed Cap socking Hitler on the Jaw. Notice some facts here: The World War II was a real multinational conflict fought on at least two different theatres/frontsThe USA entered said conflict, and was part of the alliance that emerged victoriousThe results of the Manhattan Project, and many such scientific and technological breakthroughs were indeed crucial in deciding the outcome of the war Much of this research was indeed done by scientists who had started fleeing Europe as far back as the 1920'sNow question: Given these facts, would anyone consider the Captain America franchise as \"real\"? Would anyone make a claim that Captain America was historical in nature? No. You can't learn history from Captain America, because it is not historical in nature. And yet the identical claim is being made for the Mahabharata, and to some extent, the Ramayana. Real, historical wars always have been popular subjects of fictional stories. Goodreads lists 740 such works related to World War II alone.  And then there's the talk of evidence. We have to understand that we are trying to verify the truth of the narrative here, not the setting. The only way to verify a narrative is to: Strip the narrative of any poetic license, hyperbole etc.Find independent sources which document the narrativeFind artifacts that can be unambiguously traced back to the events of the narrativeWe don't have any such evidence for the epics at all. In fact, we have every evidence that These were Iron Age stories[1] These were clearly set in a universe that has no bearing on reality as we know it - magic and deities were an integral part of these stories[2] The authors, redactors, and the retellers of the epics deliberately changed these stories with impunity, clearly demonstrating that they were aware of the fictional nature of these stories[3]The usual things provided as evidence have all been falsifiedThe Indus Valley civilization was strictly Bronze Age and had nothing to do with the epicsThe Gulf of Khambhat has been officially dismissed by the Govt. of India, and their funding revoked and research erasedThe isthmus/sand bar dubbed \"Ram setu\" is 100% a natural formationThe submerged part of Dwarka was a post-Mauryan siteIn fact all geographical locations associated with the epics are strictly post-Buddha and largely PuranicWe have positive evidence that these stories are works of fiction and therefore not \"real\".

            "answer_text": "Many say that there is no evidence to Rama and Krishna being real. And the same people say Jesus and Mohammed existed. Here is a refutation that Rama and Krishna are not Mythology but History!  Time and again, we have seen people referring to Ramayana and Mahabharata as Hindu Mythology. Last year, Abhinandan Sekhri of News Laundry was interviewing Vivek Agnihotri, the Director of the movie Buddha In A Traffic Jam and the author of the book Urban Naxals. Sekhri had that patented \u201cintellectual smirk\u201d and derision in his demeanor, words and even in the way he sat. He told Agnihotri, \u201cThere is some evidence that Jesus and Mohammed existed and there is no evidence to Rama and Krishna being real.\u201d I consistently see a lot of Internet Christians and Internet Muslims along with the intellectual brigade labeling Rama and Krishna as Hindu Mythology. This Mythology is a dirty word. Length and breadth of India has footprints of Rama and Krishna. Ramayana and Mahabharata are unchronicled and glamourised pieces of history. They are so old, we have no idea how to decode them. That is why the Western Indologists took the easy way out to condemn them as Mythology to serve the duel purpose of minimising the civilization of Bharat and glorifying their own flimsy history. We have happily swallowed this without questioning the prejudice. Coming to the Muslims and Christians who call Ramayana and Mahabharata as Mythology, I have paid with them in their own coin. There was a Christian Comrade who used to post like, \u201cWishing Happy Janmashtami to all those who believe in a mythological God who was born in a jail, married thousands of women and was killed by an arrow.\u201d He was smart enough to post \u201cEid Mubarak. Let peace and prosperity prevail as wished by the Holy Prophet PUBH.\u201d His Christmas and Easter messages too were very pious, full of love. I sent him a Christmas message, \u201cWishing Happy Christmas to all those who believe in a mythological Son of God who was born to a virgin, converted water into wine and was killed by nailing to a cross. Will come back to the return of the Son of God part during Easter.\u201d He was furious and called me on mobile just to call me communal. I sent him screen shots of his own Janmashtami message. He started arguing in the same manner that Abhinandan Sekhri did with Vivek Agnihotri. He told me, there was \u201csome\u201d evidence to Jesus and Mohammed but all of Ramayanaand Mahabharata was Mythology. I asked him, \u201cYou mean, a book that says God created this earth and worked hard for six days and took rest on the seventh day ? You mean the book that says he created Man out of nothing but needed the Man\u2019s rib to create woman ? You mean the God who created all of us but gave us will to sin willfully and sent his son to make an advanced atonement for all our sins with his blood ?\u201d He was losing his bearings. He said, \u201cSee, there are millions of references to Jesus and Mohammed worldwide. Rama and Krishna are just restricted to India. How can you explain that ?\u201d I replied, \u201cAli Baba, Aladin, Mandrake, Superman, Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Tom and Jerry are known worldwide. Shaktiman and Chhota Bhim are known mostly to Indians. So, according to you, the first set of characters exist and the second set don\u2019t. Right ? Well, Rama and Krishna are known not only in India but were known to most of Indian subcontinent, South Asia and even in the present day Islamic countries like Indonesia and Malaysia.\u201d I continued, \u201cIf you can believe a man split the Moon into two and went to heaven on a chariot drawn by golden horses, if you can believe in virgin birth and resurrection, you can as well believe in the Mythology of Krypton and the God who wears the underwear over his pants. If Rama and Krishna are Hindu Mythology, Jesus is Christian Mythology and Mohammed is Muslim Mythology. It is as simple as that. Either everything about faith is sacred, should be respected and out of bounds for criticism or everything is Mythology and can be questioned and criticised. You can not be selectively rational and be an irrational defendant of your own faith.\u201d This has worked well for me. Anybody who starts conversation with, \u201cAccording to Hindu Mythology\u2026\u201d gets \u201cAccording to Christian Mythology\u2026\u201d and \u201cAccording to Muslim Mythology\u2026\u201d from me. I am an agnostic in search of my identity. But I believe in fair play. I am proud of my roots that has not blinded me and bound me to believe in what a \u201csingle book\u201d says and negate everything else. I don\u2019t believe Rama and Krishna were Gods. I strongly believe they were historical human beings of extraordinary character. They were deified by the people of their times and the subsequent generations. If people can build temples for NTR, Khushboo, Sonia and Modi in the twenty first century, great men with magnificent achievements becoming Gods in ancient times should not surprise us. ",

If there be a word for the most incredible tale ever told \u2013 then it is the story of the Mahabharat. There is a great debate about whether there is any historical accuracy in the story of Mahabharata. This narrative is so remarkable that it has made numerous people speculate - \u2018Did it really happen? Let\u2019s find some answers\u2026 2. Decoding the language  It has been written in the epic from time to time that Mahabharat is a \"itihas\" which exclusively means \"thus occured\". The words \"Puraan\" and \"Itihas\" were specifically coined by the ancient people to categorize the \"ancient\" and \"recent\" events. Both the words denote history that has occurred at different times. If the intentions of the writer were to write a poem or a work of fiction, he would have stated it to be a \"mahakavya\" or \"katha\". 3. Records of the Bharat-Dynasty  It is mentioned in Aadiparva, Adhyaya 62 that the records of the Bharat-Dynasty are recorded in the Mahabharata. A number of dynasties with their long lineage of kings (more than 50 from Manu) have been presented in the work. If it were just fiction, 4-5 kings would have sufficed to build the story on. 4. Details of Kaliguga  Read the description of Kaliyuga as mentioned in Mahabharata. Whatever Krishna said tallies with creepy, mysterious accurateness with modern life as it exists today. And remember - this was written thousands of years ago! Fiction? Unlikely because there are way too many corroborations and tallying circumstances for it to be fiction. 5. The city of Dwaraka  Marine archaeology has also been utilized in India off the coast of the ancient port city of Dwaraka in Gujarat, uncovering further evidence in support of statements in the Vedic scriptures. An entire submerged city at Dvaraka, the ancient port city of Lord Krishna with its massive fort walls, piers, warfs and jetty has been found in the ocean as described in the Mahabharata and other Vedic literatures. 6. The unfortunate fate of Dwaraka  This sanskrit verse from the Mausala Parva 7 verse 40 of the Mahabharata, describes the disappearance of the city of Dvaraka into the sea. \"After all the people had set out, the ocean flooded Dvaraka, which still teemed with wealth of every kind. Whatever portion of land was passed over, the ocean immediately flooded over with its waters.\" 7. Ancient cities described in the Mahabharatha  More than thirty-five sites in North India have yielded archaeological evidence and have been identified as ancient cities described in the Mahabharatha. Copper utensils, iron, seals, gold & silver ornaments, terracotta discs and painted grey ware pottery have all been found in these sites. Scientific dating of these artifacts corresponds to the non-aryan-invasion model of Indian antiquity. 8. Similarity between Ramayana and Mahabharata  The dynasties recorded in the Ramayan and the Mahabharat concur without a difference. Even the relations between different kings and their dynasties in both the great \"epics\" match with each other. If both were mere \"epics\" written by two entirely different at two different times, why would everything match even upto minor details? Mahabharat is of a later date than the Ramayan. Why would the author of the Mahabharat borrow the same ideas and characters as those of the author of Ramayana? 9. Lineage of Shri Krishna  The Greek historian Megasthenes has stated that Chandragupta Maurya was the 138 King in the lineage of Shri Krishna. This means that Shri Krishna did exist in the bygone era and that Mahabharat did really occur. 10. Present cities from Mahbaharata  All places mentioned in Mahabharata are real places, all are identified as real places. For instance, Hastinapur is in UP. Indraprastha is the present day Delhi. Dwarka is located in Gujarat coast. Moreover, Mahabharata cities are not limited to present day India because Mahabharata referred Indian subcontinent as Bharata. For example, Gandhar could be present day Kandhar. 11. Astronomical references  The Udyoga Parva of Mahabharata narrates that, just before the War, Lord Krishna went to Hastinapur in the month of Kartika on the day when moon was at the asterism Revati. On His way to Hastinapur, Krishna took rest for a day at a place called Brikasthala, and on that day the moon was at the asterism Bharani. The day on which Duryodhana turned down all the efforts of Krishna and made the war inevitable, the moon was resting at the asterism Pushya. 12. Perfect narration of the planetary positions  Krishna left Hastinapura with Karna, on the day when the moon was yet to reach the asterism Uttara Phalguni. Karna accompanied Him to some distance to see Him off and he then described to the Lord the positions of planets in the sky and expressed his apprehension that such a planetary configuration stood for very bad omen: such as large scale loss of life and drenching of blood. Vyasa narrated all these planetary positions in as many as sixteen verses as if someone was describing it after visualizing them in the sky. 13. Bharat Varsh  The country is named Bhaarat after the king Bharat (son of Dushyant & Shakuntala). What country would be named after the hero of a novel! 14. Hole in the Aryan theory  European scholars brought the nomadic Aryan tribes, into India after 1500 BC. How could these Aryans create Sanskrit language, gain so much knowledge and write all these texts before 700 BC? Great Indian thinkers including Lokmanya Tilak, Sri Arbindo, and Dyanand Sarasvati rejected the European theory. 15. Mahabharata is written in verses  It is ridiculous to say that these texts are fiction, because of its poetic nature. It was a custom to write everything (even Mathematical formulae) in poetic form. 16. Unrecorded history factor  Maurya, Gupta and Indo-Greek dynasties, are also recorded in our Puraanas. These dynasties are accepted only because they are also recorded by Greek historians. What about the dynasties that existed before the Greek historians? 17. Flying Aircraft & Nuclear War  The Indian Epics, especially the MAHABHARATA, pick up the thread of the tale of devastation and destruction. Sanskrit scholars could not comprehend what was being described in the Epics until the dropping of the first atomic bombs on Japan. There are Authentic Verses from Mahabharata: \u201cGurkha, flying a swift and powerful vimana (fast aircraft) hurled a single projectile (rocket) charged with the power of the Universe (nuclear device). An incandescent column of smoke and flame, as bright as ten thousand suns, rose with all its splendor.\u201d 18. Citing Oppenheimer  The architect of modern atomic bomb who was in charge of the Manhattan project was asked by a student after the manhattan explosion, \u201cHow do you feel after having exploded the first atomic bomb on earth\u201d. Oppenheimer\u2019s reply for the question was, \u201cnot first atomic bomb, but first atomic bomb in modern times\u201d. He strongly believed that nukes were used in ancient India. 19. Some Unanswered questions  What made Oppenheimer believe that it was a nuclear war was the accurate descriptions of the weapons used in the Mahabharata war in the epic which match with that of modern nuclear weapons? How much truth is there in the stories that claim that a region in Kurukshetra still have high level of radio activity? ",

            "answer_text": "This is a silly question. The Mahabharata in 18 volumes is an ENCYCLOPEDIA - it contains everything \u2014 philosophy, theology, ethics, history, animal husbandry, astrology, Ayur Veda, architecture, domestic science, politics, myths, legends, humour, romance, war, etc. etc. etc. In fact the Mahabharata itself says that there is nothing in the human world which is not found in it. So what exactly do you want to know is \u201creal\u201d? The R\u0101m\u0101yana is an EPIC - it is a long poem about S\u012bt\u0101 - she is the central protagonist. Just as the Mah\u0101bharata is centered on Draupadi \u2014 both epics are about the \u201cmangala-s\u016btra\u201d or \u201ct\u0101li\u201d of these two women, according to a very famous Srivaishnava Acharya - Pillai Lok\u0101ch\u0101rya. Please try to understand - the ancient Hindus were never interested in HISTORY, they were interested in the quality of human character and the content and evolution of consciousness and modelling ideal behaviour. These epics are not to be mined for historical data - which may or may not be there - history is HIS STORY and not relevant to us - here and now - what is important for us in MY STORY - how do these Epics help you to orient yourself in this crazy world, here and now! What lessons can be learned and what is the implication for adaptive action! Whether Rama actually lived in real time and fought and defeated a 10 headed demon king who flew in a space-ship and kidnapped his wife, after taking the help of monkeys and bears etc. is irrelevant! What matters is what the story MEANS for us and how it modifies our behaviour in beneficial ways. Most of the events and narratives in these epics are like case-studies for us to discuss - Indians are by nature argumentative and they have been arguing over these stories for thousands of years!! So don\u2019t expect this question ever to be put to rest. There have been millions of Kings who\u2019s lives have been documented - do you know of any one now who worships Ramses or Alexander the Great? Do you know of anyone who has been inspired by them and transformed their lives? Do you known anyone who uses any historical King as a role-model? Are their stories still told as means of teaching children values? So again I ask you - If the battles in the Itihasas are proven beyond reasonable doubt to be REAL history - what difference does it make to your life right now? Will you pick up arms and rush out to do battle with the demonic forces of Chaos? Rami Sivan's answer to What is the source of truth in Hinduism?  ",

            "answer_text": "Hare Krishna ! Any normal human being with a little bit of intelligence can say that these are definitely real.. But some Rascals who dont even know that who they really are, will make childish guesses about these scriptures without any knowledge or scientific/logical reasoning.. They are nothing more than a frog\u2026a frog who is very much used to of living in a well that if someone tells him about a very big ocean of water..then frog will simply try to compare that ocean with the well.. because frog's limited knowledge will not allow to think beyond the well\u2026that is going on in today's world.. they are simply assuming or guessing things according to their own whims\u2026. But they do not know that Real facts start from where their little intelligence cease to act.. Now as far as scientific/logical evidences are concerned then you first of all must know what is real science.. So science is based on the facts, it is not like assuming or guessing, something. That is not science. Now next comes the source of information or gaining the knowledge/science part.. There are 3 ways to gain knowledge - - 1. \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0923 (seeing is believing), 2. \u0905\u0928\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0923 (Guessing something), 3. \u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0923 (Hearing from authority) Generally people follow blindly the 1st method or they consider it to be the perfect one.. but actually it is not the perfect way of learning or gaining knowledge because we are not perfect, what I mean is that - we have limited senses to perceive the things, tendency to cheat, illusioned, prone to make mistakes - - so these four defects will not allow us to know the real truth.. There are many examples to understand this like our eyes can only see in the visible range of light from 3800 to 7600 amgstrom, but it doesn't mean that waves doesn't exist beyond this range, our ears, smelling capacity each sense is limited, but there are some things which are beyond our perception\u2026we may see water on road in high summer time but it is just a reflection, there is no water in actual\u2026similarly thousands of other examples are there to prove our limitations .. So basically seeing is not believing always, there are chances of mistakes. Second method is anuman praman (guessing)\u2026you can easily understand this by a simple example of boy and girl sitting in a park.. Now you may assume that they are boyfriend-girlfriend but they can be brother sister also.. So simple thing is that your assumptions or guesses are simply based on what you are thinking or perceiving about a particular thing but that might not be true actually\u2026 Now the last and the best method of learning is \u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0923 (Hearing from Authority)\u2026. THE word AUTHORITY is very significant here\u2026 let us understand this by an example suppose a boy want to know that \u201cwho is my father \u201c.. Now by 1st method \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0923 (seeing is believing) he can't know this because he was not present physically when the process of his birth was going on by his parents.. second method is anuman praman, so he may keep on speculating about his father but he will not get it right.. Now comes the 3rd method of hearing from authority - if he simply asks his mother, then he can easily know who is his father without any defect/problem.. so what is important, authority is important.. His mother has the authority to tell him about his father\u2026 Similarly if you want the real knowledge /spiritual knowledge then you must go to a authorized & bona-fide person and that person in shastras is called \u2018Guru \u2018 now you may say that so many gurus are there where shall I go.. You must go to a person who has the knowledge, (\u0938\u092e\u093f\u0924-\u092a\u093e\u0923\u0940: \u0938\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0902 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e \u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0920\u092e M.U.1.2.12)who has seen the truth,who doesn't talk anything besides god,who consider himself as servant of god not himself as god,and most importantly who is authorized in disciple chain succession.. not someone like ass*ram, ra*rah*m or this guru that guru\u2026 So moral of the story is that if you really want to know that \u2018are these epics real\u2019 then go to a authorized person who is qualified to answer this question\u2026it is very simple to understand, just for example if you want to know about why did Roman Saini quit the IAS job then ask roman Saini because he is the authorized person to answer it.. Now if you keep on guessing or speculating or listening here & there, suppose you ask a punchar wala this question then he will answer according to his own whim . just gossiping here and there without knowing the actual fact.. . So all your efforts will be in vain.. There are lot of the things to discuss but I think this is not the right time & platform.. But if you really want to know what is real science, who are you, what is God, what are scriptures, etc etc then please please read from authorized sources like \u201cBhagvatgita As it is \u201cby srila prabhupada \u2018Iskcon\u2018founder acharaya, it is not any kind of blind faith, you can know more on google and by reading books by srila prabhupada.. Please invest some time in reading the book \u201cThe science of self realization \u201c. it is followed in many top universities & colleges like Harvard, MIT, Cambridge.. but the irony is that some Indian people don't even know about the hare krishna movement.. So please read books by srila prabhupada if you want logical and scientific understanding of the real science.. Krishna\u2019s science.. Thats all Hare krishna ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that both the Mahabharata and Ramayana were based on real events, stylized by later poets. The Ramayana was much more stylized than the Mahabharata. I\u2019ve answered several questions on Quora about the Mahabharata analyzing different questions from the standpoint that at its kernel, the Mahabharata is a real, historical story without any magic and supernatural elements. Over time, this has attracted its fair share of controversy, and various people on Quora have challenged my position as being unfair to Hinduism by disbelieving in it. Treating Krishna as a human being (rather than a God) especially attracts many negative comments. But this word, \u2018belief\u2019. What does it mean in Hindu philosophy? Throughout the Gita, Krishna says one must have shraddha if one is to benefit from the scriptures - the word translates to \u2018faith\u2019. When analyzing whether these epics are \u2018real\u2019, the real question we should ask ourselves is, is it possible to be a good Hindu - a Hindu with shraddha - while taking a non-supernatural position on the epics. Let\u2019s look at three books, in increasing order of \u2018un-believability\u2019 - the Gita, the Mahabharata, and the Ramayana. The Gita is almost completely devoid of supernatural elements, and in fact, many teachers of the Gita (my Guru included) teach it as a philosophical work. There are many lineages of Gurus who do the same. In fact, one great piece of advice I received when I began the study of the Gita was this: if there is any element of your understanding of Hindu scriptures which contradicts science and scientific observation, you must go back and change your interpretation of the scriptures \u2014 because the scriptures are a real, factual description of the Universe and can withstand scientific scrutiny. The Mahabharata is not a scripture in the way the Gita is. The puranas and itihasas do not hold the same status which is granted to the Vedas and the Upanishads. Even in the Vedas and Upanishads, there are the central teachings and there are the peripheral stories that are used as a vehicle to convey those teachings. So it is possible to believe in the Gita without believing that Lord Krishna stopped time in the middle of the battlefield and recited the verses to Arjuna. There is no shraddha problem with the Gita. Unfortunately, this cannot be said of the Mahabharata, which had layers and layers of interpolation on top of a core historical text. It is not possible to reconcile the possibility of supernatural, magical occurrences that happened 3000 or 5000 years ago, with the real archeological evidence from the Indus Valley Civilization, Egypt, China, and other contemporary historical events. Even some basic facts do not tally. We know for instance, using radiocarbon dating, that the iron age in India started around 1800BC. Yet there are references to iron in the Mahabharata - kings fight with swords, for instance Drona\u2019s head is cut off by Dhrishtadyumna using an iron sword. The logical conclusion to this is that (a) either the Mahabharata happened post the Iron Age, or (b) swords (and other iron artifacts) were a later interpolation to the Mahabharata, or (c) it was written (as a complete work of fiction) after that period. In all instances of this kind of discrepancy, I find the most consistent approach is option (b). Unlike the Ramayana, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of compromising to make the Mahabharata internally consistent and non-supernatural at the same time. The Critical Edition is a remarkably logical, factual and sane version of the Mahabharata, in which the supernatural episodes account for a small percentage of the total work. It is only the Amar Chitra Katha and BR Chopra versions of the Mahabharata that reinforce this stereotype of fights with magical weapons and divine interventions. For the sake of completeness, I also want to explain why I do not subscribe to (a) and (c). As we progress forward in history - for example, post the Iron Age, we see more and more archeological artifacts from Indian history, in the form of buildings, excavations, pottery, and references to India in other civilizations. The later we date the Mahabharata (and therefore the more advanced technology we are willing to accept), the less consistent it becomes with all of this historical record. I do not subscribe to (c) partly because of factual reasons and partly because of Shraddha. As long as it is consistent with science, there is no reason to disbelieve the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata is such a detailed work, with many vast areas that are totally unconnected with the main story, that if it was a fictional work, it would not make narrative sense. In his translation of the Critical Edition, Bibek Debroy gives the example of the description of Kripi, the wife of Drona. There is no earthly reason why this should be included in a story about a war, but there it is. Debroy cites hundreds of such extraneous details and descriptions as evidence that they described real events, and I agree with him. There is a particular kind of Hindu revivalist today who denies all three options (a), (b) and (c). According to this kind of person, the Mahabharata happened in all its detail, without any compromise, with all the supernatural elements and stories. Unfortunately, the only way that this could have happened is in a parallel universe with no Indus Valley and no historical evidence. It could only have happened in some other devaloka, whose history is hidden to our archeologists. For me, given my own spiritual education so far, it is this attitude of other-worldliness that demonstrates a lack of Shraddha. The beauty of Hindu philosophy is that it is immediate - relevant - applicable to our here and now. It has the most beautiful explanations of the human condition, and the most wonderful manual of how to live in this complicated, unpredictable world. I have found that many people who believe in the \u2018strong\u2019 version of the epics (i.e. magic, supernatural, etc.) are therefore less convinced about the need to apply the teachings of the scriptures to the world around them. These are the people who believe Ganga resides in Siva\u2019s top-knot, and at the same time don\u2019t think twice about building polluting industries on the Ganga\u2019s banks. True Shraddha means realizing that the divine Ganga of the scriptures is the same Ganga that flows through the enormity of our Northern plains; and it means living life according to the philosophy of the scriptures. These are the people who believe that Shiva grafted his own son\u2019s body on an elephant\u2019s head - but destroy the habitat of thousands of elephants for a half percent increase in GDP. The scriptures are real. And our belief in them elevates us and enlightens us - IF we choose to believe that they apply to our real lives here and now, and do not just deal with some idealized devaloka somewhere else. ",

            "answer_text": "It is true that we do not have official historical records to prove that Ramayana or Mahabharatha actually happened. But in my opinion, that should not be a reason to reject the possibility that these might have actually happened. Unfortunately, our official history does not have a clue about the kings,kingdoms and wars that happened before 6th Century BC. Earliest known king in India's official history is Bimbisara of Magadha who ruled between 558 to 491 BC. But clearly, he was not the first king as the historical records describe about Bimbisara avenging the death of his father who was also a king, and so on. The researchers don't know the names of the rulers who ruled during the Vedic period, and the pre-Vedic period (Indus valley civilization). It is possible that some of the vital historical records could have been lost when the grand libraries of Nalanda and Taxila were destroyed by the invaders. Also, the \u201cIndus script\u201d found in various artifacts from Mohanjo-daro, Harappa, Lothal etc. are not deciphered yet. If researchers find a way to interpret their meaning, I believe that will also help in uncovering our hidden history. The truth of Ramayana and Mahabharatha lies dormant inside a thick blanket of mystery that surrounds our ancient history. In my opinion there is a high chance that the events in Ramayana and Mahabharatha could have happened. If we eliminate the supernatural aspects from these stories, that could point to some real events happened during those times. These events might have inspired Valmiki and Vyasa to pen down Ramayana and Mahabharatha respectively. We should remember that we thought of Iliad, Homer's epic, to be a fiction, until archaeologists dug up the remnants of ancient city of Troy in present day Turkey. Let us hope that one day our historians and archaeologists will be able to solve this mystery! ",

            "answer_text": "Jai Sri Ram Who is Ram? An incarnation of Maha Vishnu born to Dhasaratha,the King of Ayodhya. Why Ram? Lord Vishnu took nine avatars till today but most popular one is RAM. The name that spread in all over the country . The name that really gives peace to the people. The name also have large of number of conflicts. If we read Ramayanam some questions may arise in our hearts , Why ram killed Valli in adharma manner , Why he left Sita, even we hate Rama for asking SITA to do Agnibath (AGNISNAN) to show her purity and for the sufferings of Sita.All athiests Target in Rama is a human because they didn't accept God some genius will say Ramayana is a fake Inthe name of Tamil , some jokers says An Aryan defeated Dravidian , Hindi vs Tamil, Rama is Hindi god . Rama born to human (king Dhasaratha) then how he is a GOD? Ram left his throne and went as a sanyasi to deep forest for fourteen years due to his father's order.If any person rather than ram will definitely refuse such an idiot order by his father. Ram didn't oppose his father he accepted it as the blessings of his father. What we have to understand from this ? Is Rama - in the name of respecting elders he took an idiot decision means , no. If he fought against his father he will continue as a king and will enjoy luxourios life but he will follow Dharma definitely . If he accepts his father's order he didn't live a luxurious life for fourteen years . As a normal people we will refuse father's order. But Rama - knows what is the life , what is soul and body he considered soul is the best. In Tamil there is a word INBAM - means bliss , INBAM classified in two SITRINBAM AND PERINBAM. SITRINBAM- means that we are getting from body like achieving or enjoying something not related to soul like living only with & for body ,money minded,sex minded , ego minded, living only for his family , interest in luxourious .These people will never refuse or will towards their luxourious life ,for their fame and for all the things for him .He/she may kill anyone for illegal attainance of other things like kingdom, money ,gold , men or women . SITRINBAM classifies in to two 1) Spritually god ( belief in god, helping others) but body minded- Sex,foodie, kingdom 2) No belief in god, disturbing others and body minded. PERINBAM - getting the blessings of god following the Dharma far away from the body but with soul. loves truly, donates and helps people not for name.His/Her soul connects with Spritual and Dharma.He and She lives a live for soul not for body. Rama chose PERINBAM he left his kingdom and his luxourious life. SITA - the mahalakshmi, followed Rama ; Lakshmana - the Adhishesha also followed Rama.Hence Ram,Sita,Lakshmana are good.Sita liked her husband's soul she wanted to live with him in difficult situation. The Queen became sanyasi she left all her ornaments and beautiful dresses she leaves her body and wants her soul to live with Rama . Lakshmana - the brother of Rama left his royal life he surrendered to Rama's feet . We fought with our brothers / sisters even with our parents for property, money, we are connected with body only we are humans. Rama - sita- laxmana are connected with soul hence they are GOD.Most important one is Hanuman - who followed , respected , praised Rama ,he helped Rama without expecting any treasure from him he expected the love from him .He is also connected spritually in soul with Rama. RAMA-SITA-LAXMANA-HANUMAN are GOD \" Truly anytime wherever Rama name is chanted the Hanuman will be there\" Ok ,Sita is god then why she didn't killed RAVANNA ? Sita - the Mahalakshmi avatar have sakthi (Power) to kill demons. But RAVANNA - the SHIVA devotee got a Vara(offer) from Shiva for immortal .Shiva gave it with a condition that incranation of Lord Vishnu can kill you.Hence SITA can't kill RAVANNA. RAVANNA captured Sita through his magical powers and went to srilanka .He didn't touch her, only with his magical powers he made Sita unconscious and lifted her body to PUSHPAVIMANAH with his magical powers and landed on a place called ASHOKAVANAM in srilanka where Sita was under the control of Demoness Trijata Because RAVANNA had a curse from Ramba , if he touched any women without her permission he will die . RAVANNA - A demon - A man with sprituality and body minded - SITRINBAM. RAVANNA was a great Shiva devotee.Generally Asura bhakti(devotion) is the greatest bhakti they suffered their body to get the blessings of God but they misuse the offer that they get from the God.Ravanna cut his own head to get the blessings from Shiva he got it.The famous SHIVATANDAVA stotram was also sung by RAVANNA.But he was occupied by SITRINBAM so he was defeated. Anjaneya - the son of Anjana- with Sprituallity and Soul minded- PERINBAM - Immortal RAMA KILLED VALLI IN ADHARMA MANNER? Valli ,the great warrior kidnapped his own's brother ( Sukhriva) wife .He also had a power he can't be defeated if anyone attacked in front of him , if anyone starts to attack in front of him , his power drains and goes to Valli. So Rama killed valli in backside (behind him). If a DHARMA is defeated by bad motivation - ADHARMAM If a ADHARMA is defeated by good motivation - DHARMAM Why Ram asked Sita to do AGNISNAN? Ravanna was defeated by Rama , adharama was defeated . But Rama asked Sita to do AGNISNAN. without questioning Ram , Sita did it .Here Rama shows her wife purity and trust on Sita . Ravanna tried a lot for her acceptance , once he came with a fake Rama head and he told Sita that he killed Ram ,now you have no choice , accept him .But Sita refused it she believed in Ram that Ram will come and save her .It shows the trust of Sita on Ram. Sufferings of Sita Once Ram heard a couple's conversation , the women questions about Sita's purity , ram fell too sad .He himself suffered that he is responsible for this .He worried about people's are blaming ,rumoring about Sita's purity hence he decided Ayodhya kindgom and Rama himself is not Correct for Sita .with the help of Lakshmana , Rama put Sita far away from Ayodhya and ordered her not to return Ayodhya . The abandoned Sita refuged in Valkmiki Ashramam where she gives birth lava and kusha. The aim of Ram avatar was fulfilled . Its time to go for this couple . Sita went to his mother Earth.Rama and all his followers left their body in Ganges.The immortal Hanuman is still. Is Ramayana is Aryan vs Dravida ? Some jokers says it but the truth will understand if we look @ Vibishanan,Vibishanan opposed the activities of Ravanna asked him to release Sita, but Ravanna refused to do it and threatened him.Vibishana helped Rama to kill Ravanna.After Ravanana , Vibishanan attained the throne and did an excellent administration. How to see Ram? If one who did RAMANAMMAPARAYANNA truly he can see Rama. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar is the best Example. In Tamilnadu there is a temple named ,Eri Katha Ramar where Rama and Lakshmana gave dharsan to Collector Colonel Lionel Blaze b/w 1975 to 1979 and stopped the rain to save from flood. Religion doesn't manner , the collector , a Christian worried about what to do if tank breaks in that time he saw two person with bow and arrow, blaze went on his knees and praised them .The collector wants to save people's life, so the god came and stopped the rain. After completing your family duties start your path towards Rama. Proof for Ramayana: Ram Sethu (Adams Bridge) is the proof of Ramayana in Rameeswaram Vishnu padh (foot) in Gaya. Ravanna: Ravanna is the most powerful man. He is the best astrologist too. He knows his death previously . Kumbakarana requests Ravanna if I die, the Ram should be Mahavishnu . Lord Shiva also warns him to surrender Sita .But he refused.He knows the things to be happened he should be killed by Mahavishnu due to his previous birth Curse.Hence he accepted the death. Conclusion : Ramayana tells us not to take affair in other's wife & property. It teaches us how to live how to live with Dharama and spritual . ",

            "answer_text": "Hello All,Apologies, but I don't think so!To agree on something that is real, it has to be proven with undisputed evidences, facts and realistic figures. Every religion has its own God and sacred scriptures. Religion and Science are opposite to each other. Science is based on Logic while Religions are usually based on Belief and Faith established over hundreds of years.1. Ramayana and Mahabharata are two biggest and most popular epics in Hindu Mythology. We have other mythologies also across the globe like Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Arabian etc. which have their own tales and stories of the gods they worshipped.2. Ramayana and Mahabharata are like Biographies written by Valmiki and Ved Vyas respectively on Lord Rama and Lord Krishna. There is no original copy available. The version we have today is derived from various literary works written much later and somehow preserved.3. The vastness and prosperity of kingdoms, palaces, people and many miracles and incidents described in these epics are much far from reality. Also, all the places that are mentioned belong to Indian Sub continent only.In present day world (say last 1000 years), so many biographies and auto-biographies have been written in many languages since the people evolved writing and reading rules. Will you blindly believe on whatever is written in any such book, scripture about a person? If yes, then we should not have been questioning the integrity of any book. However, in this literary world, we all have minds to remember and imagine, mouths to speak and read, and hands to write and document. So, obviously, it is very difficult to have a unanimously agreed version of any biography or auto biography or any real-life incident unless it is proven and unchallenged by anyone else.We rely so much on Science and Technology today. 80% of the things we use today in our lives are the gifts of science. Similarly our minds have also evolved so much over time. We have ability to analyse and decide based on the knowledge and information available today on what is right what is wrong, what is true what is false, what is good what is bad, what is real what is fiction. Actually we have applied logic and science in each and every field of our life but not in religion. Because that would hurt our sentiments, beliefs, faith on our religion and the stories that are written in the religious scriptures.We should keep our faith high in religion and the literary Ramayana and Mahabharata epics but cannot believe in them literally due to the fact that we don't believe in any information or a saying unless it is 100% proved.

            "answer_text": "Many of us seem to believe that all the ancient Indian literature say, before 1000 BC is not based on any real events but purely based on human imagination. If so, there is no way to know anything about the ancient ways of life, how societies have evolved over time. Unfortunately, there were no conscious efforts at recording history for future generations in ancient times, especially when there was no script. People just recollect certain important incidents happened and pass on to others, in their own style. The Vedas, for example are not without historical points. Although nothing is proved beyond doubt, events such as the Battle of Ten Kings, the existence of Saraswati river, the glories of ancient tribes are all there for discerning researchers. Other than these stories and epics, there are no authentic base for ancient history. We are fortunate to have certain ancient texts and treatises like Vedas, Puranas and Itihasas, that can help us to get some idea of how people lived and what are the social norms, what are the laws and customs and so on. Although everything may not have solid proof, there has always been scope for debate as to what is fact and what is imagination. Even for that matter, even the modern recorded history is subject to different interpretations. Some even said that history is biased towards the victorious. Can anybody tell us exactly why and how the partition of our country into India and Pakistan took place? There are different versions, and different narrations. Indians have one version, Pakistanis have another version, British have some other version, Congress party have some other version, BJP has some other version. Similarly, if you ask someone to narrate the history of Moghul dynasty, he will give his own version. As for the proofs, proofs such as the archeological findings, they keep on changing with new findings. It is a continuous process. The Kurukshetra battle may be one such incident. People who lived at that time might be knowing how the battle was fought what was the background etc. But as the story passes through generations, intermingled with the creative imaginations of the story tellers over the ages. In the absence of any authentic history, we do depend upon the stories and literature of the age for knowing the history, cultural ethos, and ways of life. In ancient ages, history was not separately recorded. Important events are remembered, passed on from generation to generation. ",

            "answer_text": "I have read both, and many parts of them more than once. I worship Krishna and Rama and have no trouble believing them both to be real accounts of real people involved in real events. This is not because I am a great scholar and have read the research papers of Western academics, nor because I have sifted through archeological evidence or made calculations based on the eclipses and planetary positions described in the books. Nor am I botanist who can confirm that the descriptions of flora and fauna and the geographical locations are precise. I haven\u2019t swum underwater off Gujarat searching for the ruins of Dwarka. I\u2019m pretty lazy when it comes to this sort of investigation. I have read accounts of all these with interest and noted that they confirm my acceptance of them as real, but this all came after I accepted them as real. That decision was very quick and simple. Srila Prabhupada said they were real, and I believe everything he says. Growing up I never heard of Srila Prabhupada nor of Mahabharata and Ramayana. I heard a bit about Jesus and how the universe appeared and formed itself and humans are just another kind of ape. It wasn\u2019t great, but there you are, that\u2019s how it is. One thing became clear though as I entered my late teens, there are a lot of things going on that we don't know much about. Modern science has discovered some interesting things, but it hasn\u2019t answered many interesting questions yet, and the most interesting ones, well to be blunt, it can\u2019t answer them at all. Now, if a person accepts Mahabharat and Ramayana as real there\u2019s a lot of fascinating information in them. They throw doors wide open to a whole different way of looking at things and deciding what to do in life. They lead to recognizing that much of what we have learnt is not necessarily true, but a \u2018best guess\u2019 from limited data. The conclusions in these books are very profound, but not everyone wants to be bothered with profound conclusions. Some would rather keep things simple. Eat, work, eat, sex, sleep. repeat till no longer possible. Be a good person. (You get to decide what\u2019s good). But some of us dare to dream that there is more going on than just a ball of matter spinning in orbit, hurtling through space with nothing guiding it. That we are not just animated chemicals that appear to be alive for a while till our heart stops and all life disappears, like a fountain when the pump is switched off. We are free to accept Mahabharat and Ramayana as real because we dare to say \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d to those telling us we are apes and we have to invent some purpose for staying alive for however long we can stay alive. We don\u2019t sift through these books, looking for some gems of wisdom which we pick out while ignoring the bits that don\u2019t appeal. We don\u2019t regard them simply as stories to showcase ethical life for humans, that they are symbolically portraying the inner struggles of morality that introspective people wrestle with by creating a story out of thin air, like a modern Hollywood/Bollywood/Tollywood production. For us every character is real, every event happened, the messages are still there, they are deliberately arranged like that because the personalities involved in the stories are the scriptwriters for the universe, and the inhabitants of the universe are the cast. This is a Cosmicollywood production, not a cartoon, and for us, the show is magnificent because it\u2019s all real.  ",

            "answer_text": "-Ramayana.  1 ) When Jatayu had fallen to the ground while trying to save Sita from Ravana, later Lord Ram and Lakshman came there. He praised Jatayu effort and uttered the divine words Le Pakshi which means Rise bird. This place exists now and is the proof of Ramayana.  2) There are some giant footprints found within Sri Lanka near the place where Sita was kept. These are of Hanuman as he had giant body and thse footprints are also found within Lepakshi .  3) Within Valmiki Ramayana, he describes how Ravana built hot water wells to supply naturally hot water to Lanka. These are are present to this day within the Lanka. This proves that Ramayana was true. 4) Floating stones bridge made by Lord Rama.   The bridge which Lord Rama made along with the monkeys to cross the sea is there upto this date if you see with the help of Google Maps. You are able to see the bridge linking Sri Lanka and India . .It took 21 days for Lord Rama to reach Lanka and surprisingly, google Maps show that it takes 21 days on foot to reach Sri Lanka. Scientists have tried to find out why some of these stones float within Rameshwaram but have not been able to find out why. 5)Some places within Ravana's palace have patches of burnt soil which indicates that Ravana setting fire to Hanuman's tale and Hanuman burning Lanka is true. This soil pH is high which could be due to the fire.  There are such places like the place where Sita was kept, place where Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshman lived , SitaEliya, Sitamarhi-place where Sita went into the lap of her mother and cave paintings showing that the Ramayana was true. Ramayana and Mahabharat were true and one should take all good values from those divine books. -Mahabharata. 1) Whatever Krishna said within the Mahabharat about Kaliyuga tallies with what's going on within Kaliyuga. He rightly described it that time and it's mentioned within the epic. How could it be fake?  2 ) An entire submerged city has been found within Gujarat which was Dwarka, Shri Krishna abode. The walls, pillars are found underwater by marine archeologists and investigators. The only mention of Dwarka submerging is within Mahabharat. It's true then, not fake. 3 ) All places within the Mahabharata are real and are found even today. Hastinapur is within U.P , Kandhar would be past's Gandhar. Also, there are copper utensils, coins discovered within many cities as described by Mahabharata. Lord Krishna told the divine words of wisdom, the Bhagvad Gita which is the sacred book of Hindus. If there was no Mahabharat, no Krishna, then who told these words? Therefore Mahabharata was real and Lord Krishna was real. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether or not the Mahabharata actually happened is a difficult thing to say. One can at best make a guess. Leaving aside the archeological evidence, one can take astronomical route. Many astronomical signs are present in the epic itself, notably in the Udyogaparva and Bhishmaparva. These astronomical events may be taken as basis for a computer aided search by simulating the past sky. I am particularly influenced by the works of Narahari Achar. First of all, its generally accepted that the war took place at the transition between Dwapara and Kaliyuga, around 3000 BCE. Out of many signs mentioned in the epic, the following planetary configurations are common in both (and more important towards establishing a unique date) of the Parvas mentioned above:1)  conjunction of Sani (Saturn) with Rohini (Aldebaran)2)  retrograde motion of Angaraka (Mars) just before reaching Jyestha (Antares)3)  a lunar eclipse on the kartika purnima (that is near Pleiades),followed by4)  a solar eclipse at jyestha.Narahari Achar then talks of the method as follows(using a planetarium software): A search is made for the years in which there is a conjunction of Saturn (Sani) with Aldebaran (Rohini) between 3500 BCE and 500 CE. As Saturn takes an average of 29.5 years to go around the sun once, the event also repeats with the same period. There are 137 such conjunctions during the interval specified above. A search is then made for those years from among these 137 dates when Mars (Angaraka) is retrograde before reaching Antares (Jyestha). Since the retrograde motion of Mars repeats with the same period as its synodic period, a spread of two years on either side of each of the dates was considered in the search. The search reduced the set to just seventeen: 3271 BCE, 3067 BCE, 2830 BCE,  2625 BCE, 2388 BCE, 2183 BCE, 1946 BCE, 1741 BCE, 1503 BCE, 1299 BCE, 1061 BCE, 857 BCE, 620 BCE, 415 BCE, 28 CE, 233 CE and 470 CE, when Saturn was near Aldebaran and Mars executed a retrograde motion before reaching Antares. A search is then made for those years in whichthere is a lunar eclipse near Pleiades (i.e., on the Kartika Purnima). This reduces the set to just two, 3067 BCE and 2183 BCE. It turns out that in both of these years the lunar eclipse is followed by a solar eclipse at Jyestha. A sequence of \u2018two eclipses within a period of 13 days\u2019 also occurs in the two eclipse seasons. When one considers the fact that Bhisma passed away on the Magha Sukla astami, after the occurrence of winter solstice, a unique date results, for the winter solstice in January 13, 3066 BCE occurred on Suklapancami, where as the winter solstice in 2182 BCE occurred on Krishnachaturthi. Thus a unique date of 3067 BCE for the date of the war emerges.Here is the author's sky map on 22nd Nov 3067 BCE showing the conjunction of Saturn and Aldebaran  Also here is a sky map of the same day (but possibly of a different time), I got from Stellarium (a planetarium software) looking in the West direction:   Even if these indications does not necessarily means that Mahabharata actually took place, they still give the state-of-art knowledge of astronomy at that time (or at least the time of the storyline settings). Further this particular year is consistent with many other Vedic sources as well as the Buddhist literature. What I have talked about is essentially a dating of the events, but then why should such consistent astronomical evidence would be present unless things have actually occurred? ",

            "answer_text": "From my answer: How correct am I in believing that (Hindu) mythology is actually just philosophical fiction? If so, is it logical to worship it? The Ramayan and The Mahabharat a myth? Even the most vociferous opponent of our mythology - Romila Thapar - does not argue that they are based on fact. There are way too many detailed descriptions of topography, kingdoms and lineages, corroborative mentions in other contemporary sources, astronomical events, geographical descriptions and peoples, number of participating characters for these to be mythical or fictional in nature. The cross-referenced mentions in the Vedas and other holy books pretty much rules that out. The detailed and accurate desrciptions of the land and the kingdoms also have corroborative evidences. The timeline - which was thought impossible until now, as the first settlements in India were thought to be from 2000 BC or so - are also now within acceptable paramters, given that it has now been proven that India was settled with town dwellers as far back as 7300BC.  The point is that first of all, the Hindu books are simply far too detailed for them to be fictional; there are way too many detailed descriptions of real places and people; there are way too many corroborative mentions in other texts - Upanishads, Vedas, Greek mentions etc; there are way too many complexities and characters; there are way too many precise descriptions of events; there are way too many uncannily accurate descriptions of geography and topography spread over 3000 kilometres for them to be entirely fictional. It beggars belief that anyone can create such a massively complex, detailed and vivid descriptions that are so bloody accurate. The hindu books in fact even give a chronology of kings extending 150 generations; this cant all be fiction - esp as we know that a few in the lists are real It is a critical mistake to assume that we know all; only 10 years ago, Saraswati was thought mythical. Surprise, surprise: it was found p-r-e-c-i-s-e-l-y where our so-called fictional books said it would be found. Similarly, the mythical Dwarka. Again, surprise, surprise, we found a city in Gujarat almost precisely tallying with descriptions of Dwarka.  Read the description of Kalyug as written in our books... it tallies with scary, uncanny accuracy with modern life as it exists today. And remember - this written thousands of years ago! Fiction? Unlikely, mate There are w-a-a-a-a-y too many corroborations and tallying circumstances for it to be fiction.  And, if we accept the timeline as accurate - 5000 - 3000 BC, then things begin to click into place. First of all, the evidence of the Saraswati River gives a powerful proof: it is now a known scientific fact that it dried up around 1900 BC, with reduced flows from around 3000-2500BC. The Mahabharat makes specific mention of the Saraswati as a grand and mighty river. It can only have taken place before 2500BC. Furthermore, each and every site stated in the Mahabharat is now known to be true, including Indraprastha. And finding corroborative archeological evidence from so long back is going to be damn tough. And the clincher: by that yardstick adopted, nearly 90 % of history will be myth. Even Ashok was considered mythical until proof was found - his name only occurred in a few books of those times.  Furthermore, the degree of worship and faith in them is way beyond belief; especially considering that it is an essentially non-violent practice with no dogmas and no official heads of religion. It beggard belief that something grounded in fiction can have such a wide and blind following given that it is a non-aggressive religion. The footprint extended is way too large for it to be based on fiction.  You may reject the above argument; that is your prerogative. As regards archeological proof - there is precious little except Dwarka. But there is the evidence of the Saraswati and Dwarka, And as regards antiquity of Krishna and Ram etc; the books themselves are the only proofs - not just the main books - but the other corroborative books as well.  Just remember: 20 years ago, both Saraswati and Dwarka were mythical; The Indus Saraswati was thought to be the Indus civilization from 2000 BC (now thought to be 7000+ BC). Now that you have proof, more and more people are dropping \"mythical\" term with reference to both. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this first let's start from the question that what exactly are the Ramayana and Mahabharat? They are epics from the Puranas. What are the Puranas? These are tales or stories (a collection of 108 of them ) which were written 2000 years ago to embody the learnings of the vedas which in turn were oral teachings of another 2000 years back. So in a summary the Mahabharat, the Ramayana and many other such epics were actually a way of communicating the rich knowledge of the vedas in a format which was non oral and more importantly could be understood and propagated by the common man. Now coming to the original question of whether these stories were true. In my view they were partially true given the historical places depicted in both epics are very accurate. Also a lot of the astronomical evidences suggested in Mahabharata have been found to have solid ground. Probably there was a king whose wife was abducted and he fought a war to bring her back. But did the villain have a flying chariot? Probably no. Maybe there was a war fought between cousins to inherit the greatest kingdom of the times, but did Gandhari mother 100 children? Probably no again. So u see the gist is that what's important isn't the authenticity of the story but what you learn from it. The Puranas were written to make people understand their responsibilities to a Grihasth jeewan, (a householders life) and in that respect both the epics throw ample light on the subject. I frankly don't believe any one individual can actually imbibe every learning from even one of the epics, forget the other 107 purani stories. Even today when we have discussions on Mahabharata we talk of the altruistic nature of Karna or the arrogance of a Duryodhan, guess the Puranas are still doing their job 2000 years later :-) ",

            "answer_text": "There are 2 issues involved in the question. 1.  Whether Ramayana really happened? 2. If so, what is the age of Ramayana and what are the archaeological evidences for the same? In replying to these questions, it can be argued in either way - It did happen (or) it did not happen.  And, it can be argued in 3rd way also - it might have happened, but the core story might be somewhat different. a)  If it is accepted based pure belief, which went deep into psyche of the believers, then the question of the archaeological evidences comes up.   If it did happen long back, say some thousands of years back (or) lakhs of years back, it is very difficult to gather the archaeological evidences.   Many evidences might have been covered in the deep layers of the Earth.  And, after the occurrence of Ramayana, if the major civilisation got wiped out, except passing down of the EPIC orally from generation to generation like passing of Vedas, due to some unknown reasons,   it is very difficult convince. b)  If it not accepted in the absence of the archaeological evidences,  a counter question can be posed to the non-believers. Let us assume a situation.   The time is 2500 AD.  All the major countries existing  got involved in a major war that broke out in 2125 AD (present day Chinese ambitious programmes and ISIS threats, etc, can be a cause for the III world war) , might got eliminated and some lesser known countries were left to feed themselves, without having the know how of present day advanced technology. They will be having the books with them to indicate happenings of I World War, II World War and III World War. Can the remaining people belonging to those lesser known countries,    provide archaeological evidences for the happenings of   I World War,   II World War and   III World War, to their next generations?   May not. Does it mean, those incidents might not have happened?  --------------------------- Arguments apart,  let us consider  an incident that took place during the life time of Shri Shirdi Sai Baba.  I believe Saints, as they will not tell false stories. One devotee of Shri Sai Baba was Shama. Shama was the closest of Sai Baba, and shared a relationship of a closest friend, with Saibaba. Shama would speak with Sai Baba, as a closest friend speaks, quite knowing the stature of Sai Baba. Once the following incident took place. Shama asked Sai Baba,   \"Deva (Shama always use to address Sai Baba by Deva, meaning God) it is written in Ramayana that Lord Rama got a bridge built by 1 crore (10 million) monkeys. This bridge (is called Setu) spanned the sea, so Lord Rama and his troops could cross the sea and reach Lanka. There He waged war with Ravana and vanquished him. Deva, is this true.\" Sai Baba replied, \"Yes this is true. The sea is real and Lord Rama was really there.\" Shama inquired, \"Deva, where did so many monkeys sit? And how did they sit? Sai Baba replied, \"They sat on the trees and clung to the branches. They looked like myriads of ants.\" Then Shama asked Sai Baba, which perhaps only he could lovingly dare, \"Did You see this with your own eyes?\" Sai Baba replied, \"Yes, yes I saw them with my own eyes. Alright Shama.\" Shama again said what only he could lovingly dare, \"When I first saw You, You hardly had a stubble of mustache (a popular way in India to suggest youngsters). Then how and when did You go to see 'Vanar Sena(troops of monkeys) Re.' \" Sai Baba replied, \" Shamyaa (as He lovingly called Shama) you and I have been together for many generations. I remember them but you do not.\" In wonders Shama asked, \"How old were You then?\" Sai Baba, \"Just as you see me now.\" Shama could not grasp the immensity of this spiritual fact or truth. He persisted, \"Is this really true?\" Sai Baba as always, \"Have I ever lied sitting here in the Dwarkamai? What I say is true. I swear by you.\" ",

            "answer_text": "I don't want to answer this question directly, but would like to add a perspective. Why does it matter whether Mahabharata happened or not. Why do we want to know? What human purpose does it solve? None, according to me.  Let's ask a different questions - Is Mahabharata true? To this, my answer is yes.  In ancient Indian culture, the idea of \"truth\" is not subject to \"historicity\". It is related to sincerity of the narrator and vividness of the content. Mahabharata is a beautifully complex epic poem telling diverse tales, interwoven as dialogues within dialogues, adding up to a hundred thousand verses. Tradition also says that only the twenty-four thousand of these verses were written by the original author. The remaining were added by sages and bards while they roamed the countryside singing the tales of Mahabharata. So our wise ancestors passed on, added, altered, and kept alive the tale which became so big - that it, in a way characterizes our civilization's values. This alive tradition made it so vivid, that everyone can find a character to relate to - or a situation to learn from - or a song to cry to. The main priority of the singers of Mahabharata, was to pass on the human learning - not to be historically accurate. And we should accept it as such, and judge the truthfulness of it by the truthfulness of its characters, situations and stories. This truth is much more profound, and useful, and valuable than the lame historicity of events. Before the British came to India, mythology was the primary means of passing the knowledge of our ancestors. \"History\" as we know it today was useless and hence in some ways frowned upon. British with their then narrow and barbaric mindset imposed this singular view that History is the ONLY way of knowing the past. This was primarily because they had a long tradition of writing histories glorifying their past rulers - and showing other nations down. The primary purpose of History was to arise Nationalism or allegiance to the Monarch. We were a much more freer and open civilization, and did not have a concept of \"Nation State\". For us, India was, and still is a civilization much more than a Nation. And hence, did not need to fall to narrow and inconclusive science of History. So, in my opinion - to ask the question of \"historicity\" of Mahabharata is, in a way, losing the point and demeaning it to western standards. Instead read the Mahabharata and it's thousand adaptations - and immerse yourself in the joy of ancient wisdom! ",

            "answer_text": "There are many technical answers here to prove if these epics are real/fictional. All this debate is good as it would help Indian mythology to spread around the world. As an admirer and follower of Indian mythology, I would not like to give a definite yes or no. But we can safely assume that the attributed authors of these two epics are heavily inspired from real life characters and incidents in their life time. For example, Ved Vyas, the author of Mahabaharata is himself one of the characters in the epic. It is said that the rivalry between Pandavas and Kauravas is inspired from the real life rivalry of his Grand-Children. Also, it is believed that the kuru-kshetra war is inspired from a real war fought among nomadic herdsmen in the north of modern Delhi, which is now the town of Kuru-kshetra in the state of Haryana. Also, there are many geographical evidences in the present world which are described in these epics. The most known evidence we know about Ramayana is the Ram-setu (The bridge made of floating stones by the vanara army between Kanyakumari and lanka). There are many evidences in Sri lanka present today regarding Ravana and his great empire. The ancient Hindu scriptures, Vedas, are considered as whispers of God, they gave the world meaning and life a purpose. It is believed that the Vedic hymns are first heard by seven sages (known as saptarishi) and on the basis of what the veda revealed, they created the Hindu society consisting of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. Later Vyasa classified these hymns and created four collections - Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva - which are known as Vedas. The language of ancient Vedas is Sanskrit and only few people in ancient India had direct access to these. Through Ramayana and Mahabharata the Vedas reached the simplest of men to the farthest corners of the world. These tales painted with loads of adventures and intriguing characters moved from one story teller to another and spreading more and more across regions through various art forms, gaining immense popularity, all the while preserving the main essence of the vedas. Both the epics convey the most abstract of Vedic truths to common people in the most concrete of forms. In midst of all this debate it is only fair to understand the essence behind these epics, which will help an individual state of living. ",

Similarly this sub continent became Hindustan and we, Hindu. Secondly there is no such thing as religion existing in India from ancient time. We call it Dharma. A close translation of Dharma is Righteousness. There is no single right way of living. What our ancestors followed and is today known as Hinduism is a practice of one right way which is very much suitable for people living in this climatic environment. Ex. Applying termaric to main entrance door of house was to prevent the door from getting spoiled by insects which they did in the name of goddess Lakshmi as it will prevent the loss due to repair work. Now everyone questions why it should be done? Do you believe goddess Lakshmi resides there? Now about our epics, Ramayana and Mahabharatha comes under classification of Itihasa which means history as it happened and other stories of gods come under classification Purana which means legendary stories, it consists of ancient history, geography, astrology, astronomical observations and many more. It can be called as an encyclopedia. Over a period of time there could be little variations in stories depending on the audience that the author is targeting. When British entered India, they considered these events could never have happened as it sounds more like a story than history and they classified them into Mythology which ment the stories are myth. Just imagine if the people did not witness man stepping on moon and believed the pictures were photoshoped, then what can happen? The next generation will stop believing and start questioning and some day Neal Armstrong will be part of Mythology and not history. This is exactly what happened to our culture, rituals and stories. For an atheist I would not say anything as they view all religions from the same lens. But for Hindus who don\u2019t have pride in being Hindu, I wish to say the following. Questioning for knowing is what one should do and not questioning with an intent of mocking or disbelief. We are the only people who are not tied to any religion, we follow Dharma. Every religion has their way which they feel is right and we have got ours. There is no such thing as conversion. There may be initiations for new paths which is not the same as conversion. There is no better secular than a true Hindu. Forget political meanings, they are just for caste certificate. Also there is no such thing as caste, there is division of labor based on their abilities. Anyone can be Brahmin if he has a way to reach Brahma using his brain and Conciousness. Anyone can be Kshatriya if he finds god in protecting society. Anyone can be Vaishya if he is working on economical sectors. One who is not talented enough to contribute in these 3 sectors found a way to contribute to the society by helping these 3 sects and he is a proud Shudra. Understand where and how your own caste and religion started and take pride in it if you feel it is something worthy to know and be part of it and follow. Do not criticize others for they have their own ways and reasons. See the bigger picture. ",

The time of birth, marriage, wars, journeys, pattabhishekam etc were described with the help of positions of heavenly objects. And when reconstructed using NASA's software they are in chronological order with matching ages and geographical positions. 3. Kings, place names, cultural differences have been described which match with reality. 4. Names of 100s of ancestors of many kings are given. If it was just literature, those names would have been lost to time as they don't add any value to literature. 5. Ramayana is famous all over the eastern side of the world, unless there was a real person so ideal, so loved, so great, the stories wouldn't have continued for millenniums. 6. India has been a living civilisation for more than 5000 years so you can't just dig up places to find proofs now - that too after mughals, Portuguese and British have destroyed and taken so many artefacts. 7. Shiploads of gold, precious gems and diamonds and sculptures were carted off. Documents were destroyed. Buildings were razed to ground. Universities were destroyed. Cottage industries replaced by western goods... Traditions have got lost - now it is difficult to trace to so long in the past - no proof found will enough!!! 8. Findings of Dwaraka and Ram Sethu 9. Description of Arjuna visiting all places of Ramayana including the Rama's bridge - there are descriptions of regular use of the bridge even till 1000 AD, after that maybe some event happened and destroyed it. 10. The British called it mythology - we used to call it Itihaasa - History !!! Irony is that even the word myth has Sanskrit origin 'mithya'. So please don't call Ramayana and Mahabharata as mythologies. Call it history 11. Will write more if I remember. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe there was once a great family that ruled Northern parts of India. I believe there was a conflict for succession which resulted from polygamy (Shantanu) and illegitimate children. I believe there was a warrior who was a Suryavanshi and had a strong claim to the throne (Karna) but was discarded because of being an illegitimate child. I believe the riches of these kings attracted a lot of people to join them in war (Kings of Drupad & Gandhar). I believe a wise sage who also happened to be a great strategist (Krishna) got involved in the politics and helped the weaker party (Pandavas) to the throne because he believed them to be better rulers.  I believe the Kurukshetra war happened, but not the Mahabharata war.  The Mahabharata is both true and not true at the same time. It keeps happening over and over, when Chanakya helps Chandragupta Maurya to the throne, when Bairam Khan helps Akbar to the throne, when MK Gandhi helps JL Nehru become prime minister, when Amit Shah helps Narendra Modi claim the top job and any number of other such instances.  Mahabharata is not the story of a war, it's the story of family feud, good Vs evil, politics and the end result of all these events.  Believe it or not, good vs. evil still remains the most used theme in science fiction and fantasy. George RR Martin's SoIaF is a notable exception where there is no clear good or evil and the war involves more than two parties.  Epic fantasies are still written, complexity in fantasy novels has been ever increasing. Be it Steve Erikson's Malazan series, GRRM's SoIaF, Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy or many other such great works. The very existence of extreme complexity in the story hints at it being fiction. Because if characters are real, then each and every character's life cannot be known to the author in such great detail. ",

            "answer_text": "Before analysing whether Ramayana or Mahabharata are historical works are not, we have to define history in the first place. The modern notion of what constitutes history, which is supposed to be \u201c scientific and objective \u201c in nature, is an Enlightenment concept of history developed during the 18th century . This is an European concept , which believes in using objective sources ( coins, inscriptions, texts, archaeology ) to critically analyse the evidence and reach conclusions based on \u201c reason and logic \u201c. Due to colonialism and capitalism, the western notion of life has come to constitute a kind of \u201c global modernity \u201c for non western people. So, the objectivist or positivist notion of history developed in Europe became accepted as the dominant notion of history accross the world. This notion of history dubbed other ways of looking at the past \u2014 tribal geneologies, gods and goddesses, animals \u2014 as myths and superstitions which are fit to be discarded for \u201c civilizing \u201c the \u201c Savage, barbarian \u201c natives. Mahabharata and Ramayana fit into this discredited category of \u201c Oriental superstitions \u201c. Since they do not conform to dominant notion of Western History, they are myths. What we tend to forget is that there are \u201c different ways \u201c of looking at the past across different cultures in this diverse world. Romila Thapar, the Indian historian, categories historical consciousness into two types \u2014 externalized history ( the western concept ) and embedded history ( where stories serve as vehicles for conveying images of the past ). Thus, Ramayana and Mahabharata do reflect a \u201c historical consciousness \u201c, as, it clearly has a concept of \u201c looking back at the past \u201c. The supernatural elements are most probably metaphors or allegories used to describe complex phenomenon, thought or philosophy. The ancients were not fools to include these for making us laugh , they did it with an educative purpose. So, Ramayana and Mahabharata cannot be strictly termed as \u201c history \u201c according to the modern sense of the term, but neither it is a myth ( I have serious reservations with the usage of this term ). They are , what we can say, \u201c embedded history \u201c. ",

            "answer_text": "Any and all religious \"myths\" that exist are created rather smartly. They all contain 3 vital pieces:1) The hint of existence of GOD(s) and heavenly figures and why they should be prayed to/worshiped and not be angered.2) A rather emotional and righteous story about a savior of mankind, usually a son or a reincarnation of god or, only in Hindu myths, the god himself.3) Factual data alloying the story and its characters. If one is to think \"logically\" and \"rationally\", none of the 3 pieces has anything to do with each other.eg 1. In hanuman chalisa, a verse depicts kid hanuman reaching out for the sun. The interesting part is that it almost correctly predicts the distance between sun and earth. What it implies: Ancient Indian society, during or before the verse was written, might have had knowledge about the distance between sun and earth. What it DOES NOT imply: An actual monkey-human hybrid kid existed that flew all the way to sun to eat it. eg. 2 From the answer by Gopal Coimbatore down below, Mahabharat contains the story of twin solar eclipses marking the birth of krishna/ kurukshetra war, etc and the chronological data of astronomers and the priests match. What it implies: A twin solar eclipse taking place at kurukshetra around 5100BC was recorded and maybe a war took place in kurukshetra. What it DOES NOT imply: A miraculous baby/reincarnation of god was born or a war was fought between gods with use of missile arrow and pegasus-chariots. The myths are similar to the present day movies except they were written in a period when anyone would believe anything if it suited them.Suppose 5000 years from now someone was to watch the movie avengers. What would it look like? A bunch of wannabes with consumes and superpowers saving a city of NY. A cult begins to form which treats them as real. Their argument? The city of NY really did exist and there were buildings and phones and cars and because these all existed, there must also exists a inter-dimensional wormhole and airbike-clad jotun warriors and a big metal snake along with S.H.I.E.L.D, iron man, everything else.

            "answer_text": "Yes , Ramayana and Mahabharata are real . My this answer will be restricted to Lord Rama and Ramayana , I will write about Mahabharat some other time . In this article i will be refuting the answers of Awdhesh Singh (\u0905\u0935\u0927\u0947\u0936 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939) , Akand Sitra , Ishita Roy , Vivek Nagarajan , Sreeraj , Vijay Raj , Asheesh Gupta , Abhi R , Suresh Kumar Thirukoti , and all who think that Lord Rama is a myth Ramayanaa\u2019 is attributed to be composed by Valmiki during 6th millennium B.C. The original book contains about 7 books or \u2018Kandas\u2019 that portrays different legs of the life of Lord Rama and his biography in detail. Now let\u2019s see few Evidences regarding Historicity of Ramayana #1 Cobra Hood cave, Sri Lanka Located in Sigiriya, Sri Lanka; this cave is tested by Archaeologists to be hundred percent natural and also that its mysterious shape cannot be carved by human hands.  As per traditional folklore, this is where Sita was held captive by the Asuras, and one can still see Cave paintings depicting the same in here. This cave is shaped like a \u201cgiant Cobra\u201d and is referred to as Cobra Hood cave by the natives.  It\u2019s also proven that the paintings date back to pre-Christian era which stands by one of the scant testament that, Ramayana did happen in and around the same time as quoted in Valmiki text. #2 Man-made bridge \u2018Ram Sethu\u2019 between India and Sri Lanka. NASA shuttle has released an image of the mysterious ancient bridge that once existed between Indian and Sri Lanka. This is the most recently discovered bridge and is said to be, 30 km long.  The bridge\u2019s angled curvature and composition that has stood against the test of nature proves that it is indeed man-made.  #3) Mystery of Floating stones. Ramayana states that the stones were made to float in water by Lord Rama to make it easy for his parade to build the bridge between India & Sri Lanka. Post so many centuries, this phenomenon is still alive in Rameshwaram.  #4) Sanjeevani Mountain, Dronagiri The Sanjeevani Mountain which is said to be threshold with the presence of exotic herbs and plants stands the same even today in Dronagiri, Himalayas as mentioned in Ramayana.  #5) Existence of Hot-wells of Kanniya. It\u2019s mentioned in Ramayana that Ravana built hot-wells in Kanniya in and around the Sri-Lanka temples and the same exist even now. This is a perennial source of hot water for the Sri Lankans.  #6) Proof of Hanuman setting fire Legend states that Hanuman set fire to Ravana\u2019s kingdom & the soil here is seen to be soot-black even now. The soil here is unusually black in contrast to that of the neighboring states & the below pic is from Ussangoda, Sri Lanka.  There are numerous places that are indicated as the locations where various events happened in reference to Ramayana.There are quite less archeological evidence as an effort has not been made with systematic excavations. To doubt the existence of Rama is to doubt all literature. There is little archaeological or epigraphic evidence for either Jesus or Muhammad who are known only from the scriptures. Does it mean they did not exist? If Rama performs miracles such as liberating Ahalya, the Biblical story of Jesus walking on water or the Koranic tale of Muhammad flying to heaven on a horse are equally miraculous. The Ramayana is geographically very correct. Every site on Rama's route is still identifiable & has continuing traditions to commemorate Rama's visit. Around 1000 BC or earlier,no writer had the means to travel around the country inventing a story, fitting it into local folklore for greater credibility. Rama was born in Ayodhya and married in Mithila, now in Nepal. Not far from Mithila is Sitamarhi, where Sita was found in a furrow, still revered as the Janaki kund constructed by her father Janaka. Rama and Sita left Mithila for Ayodhya via Lumbini. In 249 BC, Ashoka erected a pillar in Lumbini with an inscription referring to the visits by both Rama and Buddha to Lumbini. Ashoka was much nearer in time to Rama and would be much aware of facts. Rama, Lakshmana and Sita left Ayodhya and went to Sringaverapura - modern Sringverpur in Uttar Pradesh - where they crossed the River Ganga. They lived on Chitrakoot hill where Bharata and Shatrughna met them and the brothers performed the last rites for their father. Shringaverapur (Soraon, UP) was mentioned in Ramayana as the city of the famous Nishada king Guha. He offered unparalleled hospitality and forded Lord Rama across Ganga. The place is named after Rishi Shringa. There is also a temple dedicated to him There are people who dismiss Ramayana as fabrication in its entirety. But the fact is that excavations have unearthed ancient cities at most of the sites described by Ramayana. And what they found at Shringaverapura was truly mind-blowing Excavations here have unearthed a monumental reservoir built for rainwater harvesting and distillation. A marvel of Hydraulic comprises three percolation-cum-storage tanks, fed by an 11 m wide and 5 m deep canal that used to skim the floodwaters off the monsoon-swollen Ganga. Water from the canal first entered a silting chamber where the dirt settled. This relatively clean water was then directed to the first brick-lined tank (Tank A), then on to Tank B through a stepped inlet (which cleaned the water further). This tank constituted the primary source of water supply. Next, the water passed to a circular Tank C, which had an elaborate staircase. An elaborate waste weir, consisting of seven spill channels, a crest, and a final exit, ensured that the excess water flowed back into the Ganga. Its capacity was 2 million litres. it was probably the world's largest reservoir of its time. Shringaverapura marks easternmost extent of Ochre Colored Pottery dated to atleast 11th century BC. Ship networks forded passengers across Ganges, as did Guha in Ramayana.  Thereafter, the three wandered through Dandakaranya in Central India, described as a land of Rakshasas, obviously tribes inimical to the brothers' habitation of their land. Tribals are still found in these forests. The trio reached Nasik,on the Godavari,which throbs with sites& events of Rama's sojourn, such as Tapovan where they lived, Ramkund where Rama & Sita used to bathe, Lakshmankund, Lakshmana's bathing area & several caves in the area associated with their lives in the forest. Rama then moved to Panchavati where Ravana abducted Sita.The dying Jatayu told them of the abduction,so they left in search of Sita.Kishkindha, near Hampi, where Rama first met Sugriva and Hanuman, is a major Ramayana site, where every rock and river is associated with Rama. Anjanadri, near Hospet, was the birthplace of Hanuman (Anjaneya); Sugriva lived in Rishyamukha on the banks of the Pampa (Tungabhadra); Shabari probably also lived in a hermitage there. Rama with Vanara army left Kishkinda to reach Rameshwaram, where the they built a bridge from Dhanushkodi on Rameshwaram Island to Talaimannar.NASA's satellite has photographed an underwater man-made bridge of shoals in the Palk Straits,connecting Dhanushkodi & Talaimannar. On his return from Sri Lanka, Rama worshiped Shiva at Rameshwaram, where Sita prepared a Linga out of sand. It is still one of the most sacred sites of Hindus. Sri Lanka also has relics of the Ramayana. There are several caves, such as Ravana Ella Falls, where Ravana is believed to have hidden Sita.The Sitai Amman Temple at Numara Eliya is situated near the ashokavana where Ravana once kept her prisoner. In describing the places in Sri Lanka that are associated with Lord Rama and the Ramayana, \"Sri Lankan folklore and religious scholars have identified more than 30 places on the island which are associated with the Ramayana.\u201d \u201cinterestingly enough, people in these places have a strong sense of history & lore, & a strong sense of possession. They are proud of their association with the Hindu epic,\" (Ref:S. Kalaiselvan, director general Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority). Ravana brought Sita to Sri Lanka by a vehicle called 'Pushpaka Vimanam\u2019 as per Hindus & 'Dandu Monara Yanthraya' as per Sinhalese Buddhists. As per scriptures this vehicle landed at Werangatota,about 10 km from Mahiyangana, east of the hill station of Nuwara Eliya. Sita was then taken to Goorulupota, now known as Sitakotuwa, where Ravana's wife, Mandodari, lived. Seetakotuwa is about 10 km from Mahiyangana on the road to Kandy. Sita was housed in a cave at Sita Eliya, on the Colombo-Nuwara Eliya road. There is Amma temple dedicated to her. She is believed to have bathed in the mountain stream flowing beside the temple. North of Nuwara Eliya, in Matale district, is Yudhaganapitiya, where the Rama-Ravana battle took place. According to a Sinhalese legend,Dunuwila is the place from where Rama shot the 'Bramshira' arrow that killed Ravana.The Sri Lankan king was chalking out his battle plans in a place called Lakgala when the killer arrow struck him. Lakgala is a rock from the top of which Ravana could see north Sri Lanka clearly. It served as a watchtower. Ravana's body was placed on the rock at Yahangala for his subjects to pay their last respects. Since Ravana was a Brahmin, it was considered a sin to kill him, even in battle. To wash off the sin, Rama performed puja at the Munneswaram temple in Chilaw, 80 km north of Colombo. At Manaweri, north of Chilaw, there is a temple gifted by Rama. According to another legend from the southern part of Sri Lanka, Sita was actually detained in the mountainous forest area of Rumassala near Galle.When she fell ill, Hanuman wanted to bring some medicinal plants from the Dronagiri mountain in the Himalayan chain to cure her. Since he could not find the plants, he brought the whole mountain and dropped it at Unawatuna, which is near the present Galle harbour. Unawatuna means 'here it fell'. Indeed, the area is known for its medicinal plants. At Ramboda,known for its massive waterfalls,a temple for Hanuman has now sprung up as the belief is that he had visited Sita who was incarcerated there.Legend has it that the Koneswaram temple,in the eastern district of Trincomalee,was gifted by Lord Shiva to Ravana. In the famous Buddha Vihara at Kelani,near Colombo,there is a representation of Rama handing over captured Sri Lanka to Ravana's brother,Vibheeshana.All the places visited by Rama still retain memories of his visit, as if it happened yesterday. Time, in India, is relative. Some places have commemorative temples; others commemorate the visit in local folklore. But all agree that Rama was going from or to Ayodhya. Why doubt connections when literature, archaeology and local tradition meet? Why doubt the connection between Rama Setu & Rama,when nobody else in Indian history has claimed its construction? Why doubt that Rama traveled through Dandakaranya or Kishkinda,where local tribes still narrate tales of Rama? Why doubt that he was born in & ruled over Ayodhya? Rama's memory lives on because of his extraordinary life & reign,which was obviously a period of great peace & prosperity,making Ramarajya a benchmark.People only remember the very good or the very bad. Leftist have chosen to rubbish archaeology,literature & local tradition. Nobody believed that Homer's Iliad was a true story till Troy was discovered after extensive archaeology.Unfortunately,the sites of the Ramayana & Mahabharata have now been built over many times & it may never be possible to excavate extensively either at Ayodhya or Mathura. Lack of archaeological evidence is no excuse for denying the existence of history. If the buildings of that time over 7000 years ago do not exist today, can we just infer that civilizations and personalities of that time also did not exist? In literature,we have the Ramayana and other texts such as the Puranas which also relate and verify the history and existence of Lord Rama. People from many other regions of the world have also accepted the Ramayana as worthy of attention, devotion, and historical evidence. For example, we can see the affects of the Ramayana tradition in many countries who have adapted their own form of the Ramayana and worship of Lord Rama, especially in the countries of Southeast Asia. These include Burma,Cambodia (Capuchia),Thailand,Indonesia, Malaysia,Philippines & Vietnam. Other areas can also be found where the influence of the history of Lord Rama is in affect,such as the continent of Africa was once known as Kushadvipa for having been ruled by Kush. The other fact is that many millions of people feel the reciprocation from Lord Rama whenever they engage in devotion to him or read the Ramayana, or hear the Ramayana in a katha, or watch a television show or movie about him or go to one of the temples dedicated to him. This cannot be denied or neglected.Just because we have insensitive politicians who cannot perceive this reciprocation does not mean that we all are so spiritually undeveloped. This dedication and reciprocation has spread throughout the world. There have also been astronomers who have identified the approximate time of the Ramayana by the descriptions of the stars and constellations as given in the Ramayana, or even in the Bhagavata Purana and other texts. Valmiki, who wrote the Ramayana, was a contemporary of Rama. While narrating the events of the epic, he has mentioned the position of the planets at several places. By using recent planetary software, it has been possible to verify that these planetary positions actually took place precisely as specified in the Ramayana. These were not just stray events, but the entire sequence of the planetary positions as described by Valmiki at various stages of Rama\u2019s life can be verified today as having taken place. This information is significant, since these configurations do not repeat for lakhs of years. The inference that one can draw is that someone was present there to witness the actual happening of these configurations, which got recorded in the story of Rama. Rama was born on the Navami tithi of Shukla Paksha of Chaitra masa. At that time,the nakshatra was Punarvasu & Sun,Mars,Saturn, Jupiter & Venus were in Aries,Capricorn,Libra,Cancer & Pisces respectively.Lagna was Cancer.Jupiter & Moon were shining together.-Ramayana 1.18.8,9 The conditions can be summarized as: 1 Sun in Aries2 Saturn in Libra3 Jupiter in Cancer4 Venus in Pisces5 Mars in Capricorn6 Lunar month of Chaitra7 9th day after New Moon8 Moon near Punarvasu Nakshatra9 Cancer as Lagna 10. Jupiter above the horizon According to the Planetarium software,it provides the following date: Rama Navami - 10th January 5114 BCE , Observation at 12.30 p.m.Moving forward,after 25 years of the birth of Lord Ram, the position of planets in the sky tallies with their description in Ramayana. Again, on the amavasya of the 10th month of the 13th year of exile the solar eclipse had indeed occurred and the particular arrangement of planets in the sky was visible. ( Date comes to 7th October, 5077 BC). Even the occurrence of subsequent two eclipses also tally with the respective description in Valmiki Ramayana. (Date of Hanuman\u2019s meeting Sita at Lanka was 12th September, 5076 BC). In this manner the entire sequence of the planetary positions gets verified. Some people feel that the appearance of Lord Rama took place many millions of years earlier, in the Treta-yuga. For eg, the Bhagavata Purana clearly states that Lord Rama became king during Treta yuga (Bhag. 9.10.51). We have been in Kali-yuga for 5000 years. Before this was Dvapara-yuga which lasts 864,000 years. Before that was Treta-yuga, which lasts over 1,200,000 years. Thus, according to this, the existence of Lord Rama had to have been many thousands of years ago. Thus, according to this,the existence of Lord Rama had to have been many thousands of years ago. And if Lord Rama appeared in one of the previous Treta-yugas,it would certainly indicate that Lord Rama appeared several million years ago. This is exactly what is corroborated in the Vayu Purana.Vayu Purana(70.47-48) describes the length of Ravana\u2019s life. It explains that when Ravana\u2019s merit of penance began to decline, he met Lord Rama, the son of Dasarath, in a battle. wherein Ravana and his followers.And was killed in the 24th Treta-yuga. The Roman transliteration of the verse is: tretayuge chaturvinshe ravanastapasah kshayatramam dasharathim prapya saganah kshayamiyavan The same Ramayana that gives the planetary descriptions also tells that Lord Rama came in Treta-yuga. The Matsya Purana (47/240,243-246) is another source that also gives more detail of various avataras and says Bhagawan Rama appeared at the end of the 24th Treta-yuga. There are 1000 Treta-yugas in one day of Brahma, & it is calculated that we are presently in the 28th cycle of the four yugas of Vaivasvata Manu, who is the seventh Manu in the series of 14 Manu rulers who exist in one kalpa or day of Brahma. Each Manu is considered to live for 71 such divya-yuga cycles. So, without getting too complicated about things,from the 24th Treta-yuga to the present age of this 28th cycle of Kali-yuga,there is obviously a diff of millions of years when Lord Rama manifested here on earth. This gives the period of Lord Rama approximately 18 million years ago. Furthermore, the planetary positions mentioned in the Ramayana would also have occurred multiple times in history prior to the calculated date. Of course, few people may believe this unless they are already familiar with the vast lengths of time that the Vedic literature deals with. Nonetheless, maybe there is further reason why we should accept that Lord Rama appeared millions of years ago. In the Valmiki Ramayana, Sundara-Kanda explains that when Hanuman first approached Ravana\u2019s palace,he saw the doorways surrounded by horses & chariots,palanquins & aerial cars, beautiful horses & elephants,nay, with four-tusked elephants decked with jewels. Elsewhere in the Valmiki Ramayana, Sundara-Kanda an ogress named Trijata has a dream of Lord Rama,which she describes to the other demoniac ogresses upon awakening. In that dream she sees Rama, scion of Raghu, united again with Sita. Sri Rama was mounted on a huge elephant, closely resembling a hill, with four tusks. The question is how could there be a mention of the elephants with four tusks unless Valmiki and the people of his era were familiar with such creatures? A quick search on the Encarta Encyclopedia will let us know that these four-tusked elephants were known as Mastodontoidea,which are said to have evolved around 38 million years ago & became extinct about 15 million years ago when the shaggy & two tusked Mastodons increased. Now there\u2019s something to think about, eh? So this would mean that the specific planetary configuration that is described in the Ramayana, and is verified by Pushkar Bhatnagar, may have indeed happened, but at a time millions of years prior to merely 10,000 years ago. In this way,as we go through the evidence,we can see how Lord Rama was an actual historic personality,as described in the Ramayana and in other Puranic texts. Nonetheless, there will always be those for whom no matter what you present for verification, it will not be enough. Some just won't believe it. Some will, some won't, so what, let's move on. But many in the world already accept the authority of the Ramayana and other Vedic texts for the verification of the existence of Lord Rama. JAI SHRI RAMA ",

            "answer_text": "No they are not. They are fictitious stories based on real events much like literary works are. The final proof in history is archaeology which is above all evidence and if we are talking about an event at a particular point of time like war or construction of a city then its archaeological evidence must be shown. The basic fact is that if we are talking about major wars in a period between 5000BC and 1000BC do we have archaeological evidence for it. The only known archaeological record in this period is remains of Indus Valley civiization which show: No account of warNo usage of horses or chariotsNo description of figures even close to Rama or Krishna or any other historic character mentioned in both the epics.We do have however the following historical proofs: Evidence of floods and dislocation in Hastinapur area around 800\u2013850BCMention of Krishna Vasudeva as a disciple king of Ghora Angirasa who has been dated to Upanishdic age of 800\u2013850BCEvidence of a Sumerian king Rim Sin (Meaning Rim the Moon King) who united the Elamite empire around 1800BC including Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and Indus valley which is later indus periodEvidence of Rim Sins sister being kidnapped and his efforts to rescue her over 15 yearsEvidence of his arrival in IVC areas to look for allies to fight his enemies to rescue his sisterEvidence of close confederacy between Sumerians and Indus Valley people and Indus valley, Sumeria and Iran having same culture called Elamite cultureEvidence of concept of Trinity and Avatara in earliest Sumerian religion around 2500BC which influenced Indus valley People and close correspondence between Trinity in hinduism and Trinity in Elamite religionMention of Rama in Rig Veda which is dated to 1200BC (due to Mittani inscriptions of 1400BC) and equivalent Ramses in Egyptian recordsAll this leads to conclusion that Ramayana was a popular folklore which was pre aryan and dating back to pre 1500BC in IVC about a powerful Sumerian king Rim Sin. The incoming Aryans made this popular folklore their own and appropriated the trinity concept of pre aryan Elamite religion prevalent in IVC and Iran/Sumeria.During the buddhist age around 1st century BC when monastims became popular and was weakening the state, the priestly class converted the folk story of Rim Sim into a full blown epic except this time the scene of action was not IVC/Afghanistan/Sumeria but all those locations which were part of major trade routes around 1st century BC including Lanka/South India/Ganges belt and were particularly in sway of buddhism.The Mahabharata was most certainly a minor civil war in Kuru Aryan Kingdom around 800BC which much like Rim Sins story became popular folklore and converted to an epic by the same period 1st century BC.Thus both Ramayana and Mahabharata were mythical stories written based on real events around 1st century BC to counteract the spread of Buddhism and its impact on state power .It is also not surprising that 1st century BC is also period when Pusyamitra Sunga came to power after overthrowing Mauryas and was a staunch believer in Hinduism and opposed monasticism of Buddhism. Clearly History is as much political as it is scientific. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, it does not matter that whether the incidents of Ramayana and Mahabharata actually took place or not. I enjoy reading them on the basis of faith and faith requires neither any proving nor disproving. When I place them in history, my rationality takes the better of me and pushes me into questions like: How could Hanuman fly? How could monkeys talk? How could Gandhari produce 100 sons? How could Ravana had ten heads? How could Sita enter fire and still remain unburnt? How could Krishna show such a magnificent Virat Roop that transcended over time and space? How could Arjuna go to heaven? Where heaven exists? Does it exist? And there are plenty of such questions which await our opinion if we place the epics in history. In such cases, we get suspended between real and unreal, proofs and theories. This further distracts us from the bhaavaarth, the essence of the epics. Maybe it's my retreating nature from such questions and my inability to answer them rationally that I consider Ramayana and Mahabharata as tales of wisdom, not necessarily real. Yet I say the Ramayana and Mahabharata are cyclical. They happen in every Yuga. They happen on my scale of faith. When that happens, I don't ask myself how can Hanuman fly? I ask why Hanuman flies? What makes him so devoted to Ram that he outgrows the animal within? How Krishna expanded himself doesn't bother me but why he expanded him does. I cannot answer how Hanuman teared apart his chest to show the presence of Sita Ram but I can answer why, what made Hanuman do it?  In the world of my belief and faith, they do happen. How? I don't know. Is knowing everything necessary? They just happen. Why? To give me a spiritual uplift at times, to allow me ponder over the wisdom encapsulated within their actions and to discover the voice of soul within. People may find it contradictory but that is how things are with most of the devotees. Absolute reality, that whether things really happened or not, does not bothers them. Through their faith, they make Ram and Krishna timeless by not restricting them with time and geography. Yet the epic happens for them, at a place rooted in their beliefs, which requires no rational or scientific explanation. So this word \u2018real\u2019 is very subjective to me. I believe that the epics happened. My belief has nothing to do with the absolute reality of the epic. Faith is powerful. It transforms a stone into a deity. It forms the very basis of our living. It's the faith that makes us feel that we will be alive tomorrow. That's all I am able to write at the moment. :-) ",

All the events and wars that are real and were exactly the same. There might be different books written by different people but the stories are same and context is same. Hindus and sanathan dharmi people think logically unlike foreigners who blindly depend on their experiments and eyes. That\u2019s because we have practiced yoga and meditation. Now we could see what researchers claim about yoga and meditation. The logic is in ancient times people had written what they had seen and what had really happened. And that is why we could see each and every weapons description clearly and all the events were mentioned so clearly. And now tell me all over the world who wrote big and lengthy events just for entertainment, you could pick no one. So, places are real and people were real and supernatural powers existed. It is also said that, in each and every yuga men and women will be loosing their power and energy. So, according to me in those days all the Brahmins and Kshatriyas might have some or the other super power and that was common in those times. (this is just for explanation) Let\u2019s say we have another yuga which is worse than kaliyug, then those people might say \u201cthat how people in those days used to see, with out these gadgets\u201d, gadgets that 5 yug people have invented as they were not able to see anything with their naked. Our sages brain power was immense, this was claimed by foreign researchers and they have not written stories and how could people say that these events are fake. According to me Albert Einstein and all the other scientists were nothing infront of them\u2026. ",

The concept of god itself is imaginary, may be they have scripts interrelated, may be they are agreed and followed by many, that doesn't mean that really present in past or future.Pushpak vimana, in Hindus we have caste system where knowledge flows from ancestors within families, if we consider some engineer or that builder or pushpak vimana have lived once upon a time, he/she would have passed knowledge and Lanka (now Sri Lanka) would have been supplying several Boeings.I don't see any Kangaroo, or Polar bear, or some foreign animal being vehicle to gods other than white elephant, why gods don't believe in foreign animals or are they not qualified?If Vanarasena have built a real bridge which vanished in time, the building blocks floating stone will be floating somewhere in the Indian ocean or others, in ADs we have found no stones of such kind. Ya there is a chance, may be those days Lanka was like Greenland and Rama built a bridge made of Ice bergs, ohhh.. I started writing a new one.If Ramayana is really why wouldn't Hanuman (Chiranjeevi) or Ashwathama (cursed by Krishna) come and tell all the atheists and others religions this what happened on this land many years ago? I believe my Constitution and Mythology does the same purpose, en-light, even if don't completely know or understand it I follow, we made rules for ourselves, responsibilities and rights for ourselves. we also made some changes for it, same works with myths.Those books are well framed stories. they are not really happened. Simply they don't have to be real to serve there purpose. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to treat them as \u201chistory\u201d, then they must be subjected to the Historical method, which tells us that historical claims must be independently verifiable. In that sense, events described in the Mahabharata or Ramayana - of talking rivers, magic, demons, lifting mountains on a finger\u2026 cannot be called \u201chistory\u201d  Having said that, I am intrigued. Should we therefore say that Ramayana and Mahabharata are not \u201creal\u201d? What is real, anyway? I don\u2019t want to say that these stories are not \u201creal\u201d, because they have a profound effect on the Indian culture. A dictionary says that real things are those which are not imagined or proposed. Things that \u201cactually\u201d happened or those that \u201cactually\u201d existed, in the physical world. But, to me, that is incomplete. I will gladly call the Mahabharata and the Ramayana \u201creal\u201d, because they have a profound impact on us. In my view, every attempt to say that these stories are real or not are made by people who really just want to thwart the message of these epics. Here is the situation - these epics are a part of India, and they are here to stay. How we deal with them is up to us. We can accept and admire these epics in all their divinity and misogyny, war and peace, love and hatred, jealousy and compassion. It\u2019s all a part of these epics, and we can choose to talk about these and learn. Or, proving that all of this is \u201cnot real\u201d, we can choose to ignore everything about the story. We can say that Krishna didn\u2019t exist because there is no historical evidence. While that is still acceptable, some people choose to extend this logic to say that, therefore, these epics are a sham and should be rejected in their entirety.  The sad thing is that we are split between two groups - those who want to reject everything about these stories, and those who want to accept and blindly follow everything. Each group relies on \u201cscientific and historical accuracy\u201d to support their claim. But, sadly, each group is missing the point! Whether or not these stories are \u201creal\u201d does not matter. And that\u2019s the point. The beauty of Mahabharata is in learning from the story, in reading it and getting to know so much about human nature and desires and actions. It\u2019s the story which is beautiful, profound and a work of perfection! If you admire and respect the story, you don\u2019t need any proof. And if you don\u2019t admire and respect it, a thousand proofs won\u2019t work for you! In that sense, I say this question is futile. And it is important that we stop trying to prove something. For example, you will see a random \u2018news channel\u2019 telecasting on an afternoon, \u201cthis is the place Lord Ram washed his feet!\u201d as if we are to worship every such place. Why does it matter? We need to grow up and get our priorities sorted out. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. I believe the Ramayana and Mahabharata are based on real events, but then later retellings embellished the epics greatly and added to them. Heroes in the epics were later made larger-than-life with the passage of time, an example being Krishna, who was transformed from a master strategist to a God after many retellings. For more on this, see Seshadri Kumar's answer to What was the sole motive of Krishna behind the Kurukshetra war? The Mahabharata, based on version history and the references within, is deduced to have happened around the 10th or 9th century BC. (see van Buitenen for more on this). The original poem Jaya written to commemorate this had 25,000 verses; over time, this was expanded more and more by subsequent authors, until it came to 100,000 verses. van Buitenen gives a beautiful explanation of how the layers in the Mahabharata were added,which makes perfect sense...you should read it if you haven't yet. Look for his book on amazon - he translated three volumes, and you can find this in the Adi Parva that he translated. Your question as to whether this could have been pure fiction is valid. I contend, though, that it was not pure fiction, and I will tell you why. The Mahabharata as it exists today is used as a book on morality and religion. If you wanted to make up a book on morality and religion, you could do better than write the Mahabharata or the Ramayana. The reason is that the main characters in these books are often flawed. For instance, Rama in the Ramayana kills the Vanara king Vaali not in a direct fight, but by hiding somewhere and shooting an arrow at him without being seen. If you are creating a work of fiction, why show your lead character as committing what seems to be a rather ignoble act? They could have instead shown a grand fight between Rama and Vaali in which Rama, being a God, wins. Similarly, in the Mahabharata, the \"virtuous\" Pandavas defeat and kill Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Bhurishravas, and Duryodhana only by unfair means. If you wanted to write a book glorifying the Pandavas and Krishna, why show them doing these underhand things? If you were simply making up stuff, you could add to the glory of Arjuna by saying that he defeated and killed Bhishma, Drona, and Karna in fair and glorious fights.  You may lso like reading this other reply of mine in this connection: Seshadri Kumar's answer to  Mahabharata: How was Krishna justified in advising to kill people like Karna, Drona, Bheeshma, Duryodhana etc. ?) That is why I believe these books were based on actual events involving humans with imperfections. Over the course of time, some of them got elevated to the status of Gods. This should not surprise us. Even in modern history, the nation of Japan regarded its emperor as divine, even though he was eminently mortal, so why should we be surprised that this happened in ancient times in India? ",

The mere differences in Ramayana and Mahabharata make me believe they may be real. Confused. Allow me to clear. 1) In Ramayana, the strength of individual person is way above than in Mahabharata. Which exactly depicts the same way our ancestors were physically stronger. Which proves the one's in Ramayana are ancestors to the ones from Mahabharata. 2) The politics and mental activity is improved in Mahabharata. The war tactics and few weapons as well. Which never was shown in Ramayana. And when Rama was there the forests were much denser with lesser people. In Mahabharata the forests are not mentioned to be as dense.  3) Next in Ramayana the monkeys are a lot. Where as in Mahabharata there are no much of them. What happened evolution.  I know its not that great way to say that these can say its true. But in a way when u see the evolving nature of Mahabharata over Ramayana. You can easily feel Mahabharata is more near to the present than Ramayana. If they were written at almost same time in history how will this evolutionary change happen so soon in the two epics which look like sequels of each other. ",

            "answer_text": "Let us consider a famous book which is based on an imaginary story. It can enjoy it's fame up to 5 or 10 years and then comes another competitor to take its position. It can be considered as the greatest book of the decade, but people cannot read the same book 5\u20136 times. Such books lack something in them which does not make them perennial. Now let us consider Ramayana and Mahabharata. Mahabharata took place thousands of years ago and Ramayana was even long before Mahabharata. The stories still echo in the minds of crores of people amidst natural disasters, invasion of foreign dynasties, destruction of so many works, etc. Every time one reads these books, there's a new perspective and a deeper level of understanding. Sage Valmiki was a contemporary of Rama and Sage Veda Vyasa was a contemporary of Krishna, Pandavas, Kauravas etc. The deeper, detailed description of the characters involved and their existence related to previous stories, is it possible without any controversies to imagine such hundreds of terabytes of information? Let us see few instances: Sage Valmiki asks Narada Muni about the existence of a character with so many qualities. Is it that Narada Muni, who appears in so many stories of Gods, an imaginary character created by Valmiki?Meeting of Rama and Parashurama, in Ramayana. Bhishma and Karna learning under the same Parashurama, in Mahabharata.Jambuvantha, who appears to be existing at the time of churning of the ocean and even during Vamana avatar of Vishnu appears in Ramayana.Instance of Bhima meeting Hanuman and Hanuman's words of supporting Arjuna in the battle by his presence on the flag of chariot.Description of the clan of Ikshvaku, River Ganga's birth, Bhishma being the son of Ganga, etc\u2026So many such instances linked with previous Godly stories and characters. Vyasa Maharishi requests Lord Ganesha to write down Mahabharata while he dictates. Ganesha agrees on the condition that Sage Veda Vyasa should not stop in between. Is it possible to imagine such a huge story with so many sub stories and maintain that continuity in composing 1 lakh shlokas, apart from the grammar and selection of words?? It is the deeper observations of the characters, their actions, and their interaction with them coupled with their unmatchable authority over the language that has enabled two great Sages to write such amazing epics. Only those stories that are for real can prove that it is possible to overcome the day to day difficulties of life by employing the same solutions as that adopted by the characters in it. Unreal stories are more like CGI graphics, they can't be implemented in day to day lives but can only serve as an entertainment. If the characters and their experiences were not real, there was no way that it could have survived for such a long time impacting on the lives of crores and crores of people. I feel that they were very much real and serve in providing solutions for most (or almost all) of the problems (individual/ family/ relationships/ business/ politics and so on). ",

            "answer_text": "Is it really necessary to know, weather its true or not? Other than its teachings and morals!!! Ask yourself what u get if you know the answer... lets see the possibilities.. Assume its true. Will u followIf you follow you get eternal knowledge and know how to live. You get to know what is right and wrong.. What is good and bad.. You will follow DHARMA.. There is nothing greater than dharma... not even God..If its not true, will u ignore it.?If so U just don't get anything.When u questioning something ask yourself... Why I want to know?Tell me something.. Do you believe in god? If you believe, did u see god ever? Absolutely not... for me its a belief, god is in nature, god is in animals, god is in kids, god is in human...Like belief in god, believ Ramayana and Mahabharat actually happened... you'll have positive vibes.. Most importantly you'll get to know the morality.. Take good, leave bad.. From anything, anyone.. In both the stories the common point is dharma... Ramayan: Ravana is evil, as he abducted mata sita devi.But dont forget He Did so for his sister.Ravana is half brahman and half asura. A great devotee to Lord shiva and did Shiva tandav with his intestines. He's a good king. His 10heads represent his knowledge. He's the most knowledgeable person at that time.While ravana in his last moments, even lord Sree Ram asked to share his knowledge, as he not wanted the great knowledge die with him..His powers made him evil, actually his qualities are bad, evil... this is just a glimpse in great story.. There's so much to explore..Mahabharata : Mahabharat is set of stories.. Every character teaches us something.. Mostly when anyone hear the word \u2018mahabharat\u2019 remembers karna... His selfless friendship, valour nature, charities and so many makes everyone astonish and become his fan.. Thats y he called as \u201cdana veera sura karna\u201d . But he's on kauravas side... Once lord Sri Krishna asked to come on pandavas side so he can live and offered the earth to rule. But karna refused to leave his friend duryodhan. He said, he would rather die in war.Once lord Indra dev came as someone else and asked karna to donate his armer, though karna knows that he is Lord indra still he gave his armer that much great he is.From these both epics one can learn what is dharma.. Nothing is greater than dharma. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A..Good Question..why not let you in on what some of the professionals in the field think? I will basically here present the observations of the famed and best-selling Belgian Indologist,Dr. Koenraad Elst.  The Puranas are basically the history of India and the Gods as the Indians of first millenium AD saw it...They are heavily laced with mythology and supernatural events (but no more than the writings of the ancient Greek historians. Do refer Dr.Arvind Sharma on this).. But they do provide a comprehensive genealogy of Indian kings and priestly lineage right upto around 4000BCE (probably the time when the first Rig Vedic hymns were being composed)..The Puranas assert again and again that 1015 or 1050 years passed between birth of Parikshit (grandson of Arjuna) and the ascension of Mahapadma Nanda (historically dated to either 378BCE or 382BCE)..Given that Parikshit was born within a year of the Kurukshetra war, this would put the battle somewhere between 1432BCE-1393BCE.  Here I am quoting Dr. Koenraad Elst \" The central event of the MBh is a chariot battle. Now, chariot battles were popular in a very specific window of history, viz. the bronze age when metallurgy was already sophisticated enough for strong and light chariot wheels; and before the rise of cavalry made chariots redundant. The first chariot found by archaeology dates to 2200 BC (Sintashta, Asian Russia). Its high tide in warfare was in the later 2nd and the early 1st millennium BC: many wars of that period were fought with chariots, e.g. the Trojan war of ca. 1200 BC. That is why the scriptural reference dating Pandava Arjuna's grandson Parikshit 1050 years before the coronation of Mahapadma Nanda (ca. 380 BC), i.e. in the 15th century BC, may well be right. The classical date, 32nd century BCE, is extremely unlikely to have seen chariot warfare, and for Oak's date of the mid-6th millennium BCE, this is simply impossible.\" The date of the chariot battle of Kadesh between the Hittites and the Egyptians roundabout 1274BCE also supports this claim. Now Indians generally tend to date the Mahbharata war to around 3139BCE..But this is a flaw as Dr. Koenraad Elst again points out: \"Indians say that the war described in the Mahabharata took place in 3139 BCE. This is based on the length of the Four Ages given in the Puranas, a type of mythohistorical literature from the first millennium CE. The doctrine of Four Ages is very ancient, attested also in Greek and Germanic mythology, but their quantification is apparently linked with the precession of the equinoxes, discovered by Hipparchos ca. 150 BCE and introduced in India only in subsequent centuries. There are no pre-Hellenistic mentions of the fourth age starting in the 32th century BCE, 37 years after the Mahabharata war, as Hindus traditionally (i.e. Puranically) believe. The astronomical evidence of the Mahabharata itself, however, points to well after 2300 BC.  \" And to draw your attention to one more important thing: Krishna WAS NOT seen as a divine being or as an avatara of Vishnu by his compatriots in the Pandava or Kaurava camp. It was only in later interpolations that he was raised to the status of avatara of Vishnu. The Bhagavad Gita is seen as a later development of may be some historical core message of Krishna..which was basically an awesome prep talk to a soldier before war...(Why to fear death when you will be reborn again and again?.If you win war you win glory on earth, if you lose and die you gain glory in heaven)...it was only later that may be some of the main philosophical points touched upon by Krishna was developed into the Bhagavad Gita...may be the orginal message was only 40-50 verses long instead of the 700 verses we have now....and the Mahabharata itself claims that the present 100,000 verse Mahabharata stems from the 24,000 verse Bharata which in turn stems from the 8,800 verse core Jaya text..we can be pretty sure that the core Jaya text was glorifying historical events. Dr. Koenraad Elst had this to say about the very ordinary human nature of Krishna in the epic: \"even in the epic itself he is a down-to-earth war consultant and womanizer suffering an all too human fate, with most of the Bharata clan killed in the fraternal war in which he guides them, all his own relatives killing each other while drunk, and he himself dying in a silly hunting accident. It is only in later interpolations like the Bhagavad Gita that he gets deified.\" There is of course ample extra-Mahabharatical contemporary evidence for the historicity of Krishna. The Chandogya Upanishad refers to Krishna,Devakiputra or son of Devaki, and speaks of him as the pupil of Ghora Angirasa who is a priest of the sun according to Kausitaki Brahmana (refer to Dr. S. Radhahkrishnan's The Bhagavad Gita page 28) . After interpreting the meaning of sacrifice  and making out that the true payment for the priests is in the practice of vartues of charity and austerity, uprightness, non-violence and truthfulness, the Upanishad continues \"When Ghora Angirasa explained this to Krishna,the son of Devaki, he also said, that, in the final hour , one should take refuge in these three throughts. \"Thou art the indestructible (aksita), thou art the immovable (acyuta), thou art the very essence of life (prana)\" There is great similarity between the teachings of Ghora Angirasa in the Upanishads and Krishna in the Gita...It's basically a derivation of the above three teachings that Krishna used to fashion Arjuna into a brave war commander...and then these teachings in turn developed into the Bhagavad Gita...The Principal Upanishads are generally dated between 1400BCE-500BCE...Niraj Mohanka pushes the dates quite convincingly back to 1900BCE. One More thing to remember that in the time of Mahbharata the Sraswati has already dried up..so this puts its in the post-1900BCE range  about Krishna becoming the defacto God/avatara of Vishnu/Supreme Deity/One of the Supreme Deities, Dr. Koenraad Elst had this to say: \"The trouble already started with the Bhagavad Gita. I have it on good Hindu authority, but I have also seen it for myself, that the Gita is a work of \u201csynthesis\u201d. Then already, Hindus were enamoured of synthesis. Thus, this is where we first find the notion of an equality between three disciplines: karma yoga, \u201cthe discipline of action\u201d (then meaning Vedic sacrifice, now moralistically interpreted as good works), j\u00f1ana yoga, \u201cthe discipline of knowledge\u201d (meaning Upanishadic knowledge of the Self, i.e. yoga proper), and bhakti yoga, \u201cthe discipline of devotion\u201d. In fact, when Yaj\u00f1avalkya introduces the notion of the Self, he pits its knowledge against the Vedic rituals. The ancient Vedas and esp. the Brahmanas (the technical manuals of ritual) are centred on karmakanda, \u201cthe (ritual) action half\u201d, while the Upanishads are centred on j\u00f1anakanda, \u201cthe knowledge half\u201d. While yogis would simply choose the latter, the Gita proposes a synthesis, viz. the third pole, bhakti. The book discusses a number of then-popular Hindu philosophies, but interjects in every chapter one sentence that does not follow from these philosophies at all, namely that all this shall be given to you if you are but devoted to Me, Krishna. You can read Pata\u00f1jali\u2019s Yoga Sutra, but you will not find Krishna there. You can read the Buddha\u2019s teachings on meditation, but Krishna is not there. Yoga can perfectly exist without Krishna. Modern bhakti Hindus project their own bhakti beliefs on the whole of Hindu history. They deny the reality of change (both progress and degeneration) in Hindu history. In fact, it is they who realize the Westerners\u2019 fond image of Hinduism as frozen in time, unchangeable. So, they rewrite the theory of yoga as dealing with God. In fact, the more God, the less yoga, and the more yoga, the less God.\" I will also provide some essential readings regarding the subject of dating Mahabharata. Whether the supernatural stuffs in the story are true or not, let it be left to the imagination..More important is the message of Dharma ..I have done less research on the historicity of Ramayana but I will leave you with some excellent works on Indian chronology by other people upto 4000BCE and beyond A Nation Without a History by Niraj MohankaThe Royal Chronology of India some essential wiritings of Dr. Koenraad Elst regarding dating Mahabharata The Arundhati omenAstronomical evidence and the UpanishadsPage on koenraadelst.blogspot.de The ever quotable Dr. Koenraad Elst had this to say on the Dharmic concept of Just War or Dharma Yuddha \"The battle rages for eighteen days. The change it has wrought, is best realized by Krishna\u2019s brother Balarama, who has missed the battle. He has gone on pilgrimage along the Saraswati river (already dried up in its lower course) and returns just at the end of the hostilities. He is amazed and indignant at the size of the destruction and the decline into non-Dharmic behaviour. But that is how war goes: at the start, as in 1914, you march off with a flower in your gun, singing songs of victory, you even play football with the enemy soldiers during breaks; but as soon as you have seen some of your comrades die, you get angry and eager for revenge by any means, so war becomes more cruel the longer it lasts. The epic is by no means a children\u2019s story in black and white, or a hagiography for a saintly Krishna. The bad guys always have a decent motive or a legitimate excuse for their conduct (for instance, Duryodhana has welcomed the illegitimate son Karna after the latter was spurned by the Pandavas), and the good guys have their own past to blame for the misfortunes that befall them. They are all far from perfect, and the dharma yuddha is an ideal which they try to uphold as long as the going is good, but which they betray more and more as the battle gets grimmer.   The concept of Dharma Yuddha is akin to the later European concept of Just War. The Just War theory is linked with names like Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas Aquinas and Hugo Grotius. It lays down that war should only be started in self-defence, after attempts at a peaceful solution, and with a real chance of victory. During the war, the means used should be commensurate with the aim, non-combatants should be spared, and peace overtures from the other side should be answered. The same principles are already articulated briefly in the Dhanurveda and the Mahabharata.\" Furtherv reading of Dr. Koenraad Elst Atheism in Indian philosophyhttp://Koenraad Elst/2013/10/atheism-in-indian-philosophy.html ",

            "answer_text": "Lord Rama myth or truth Rama - The Role ModelRecently issue of Ramsetu is in vogue. Government filed an affadavit before supreme court stating that Rama has never existed on this earth. However, on strong opposition by other political parties and Hindu activist they withdrew the affadavit. Hindu organization like Vishwa Hindu Parishad etc claim that question relating to existence of Rama cannot be simply resolved by scientific or historical findings.  Existence of Rama is basically a question of faith for millions of people. Therefore no Government can deny existence of Rama. But these greatest advocate of Hindusim did not show guts to take on Government/Karunanidhi and proved that Rama is as historical fact and not a myth.  Neverthless , they got support from unexpected quarter i.e Hurriyat conference from Kashmir. Hurriayat also claimed that scientific or historical evidence are not yardstick to judge various issues related to religion.  Hence, whether Rama existed or not cannot be decided on base of scientific or historical findings. This is basically associated with religious sentiments of millions of people therefore government interference is unwanted.  In the mean time some of the scientists, based on astronomical data, have propounded that Rama existed around 5044 BC. In such a perplexing situation it becomes very difficult for common masses to arrive at any conclusive view regarding the existence of Rama. Hence, before deriving any conlusions we have to first analyse various facts regarding Rama and his epic Ramayana.  This article will put forth various facts which will help in resolving the issue of Rama\u2018s existence and will strongly conclude that Rama was an historical Mahanayaka and not any mythological character.  WHO WAS RAMA:-  Maharishi Valmiki wanted to write an historical epic which can act as guiding principle for future generation. He was in dilemma over this issue. When he consulted Narada Muni. Narada Muni then suggested Valmiki to write about Rama, son of Dasratha who was born in the clan of Raghu. Here one should remember that Valmiki wrote Ramayana long after the period of Rama . This facts goes contrary to the prevalent legend that Valmiki wrote Ramayana before Rama was born. This fact has been very well stated in Valmiki\u2018s Ramayana.  Similarly Mahakavi Kalidas wrote Raghuvansham. This books throws light on lineage of Raghu and also states various kings who ruled after Rama. So, now the point of argument is that if Rama was a mythological character than how Valmiki could provide history of forefathers of Rama ?  Whereas in Raghuvansham how Kalidasa has provided details of forefathers of Rama and his various Santatis(successor) who ruled after him. In present times various books dealing with stories of Rama are prevalent in India and around the world. We will throw light on this issue in the latter part of this article.    WHEN WAS RAMA BORN:-(based on Valmiki\u2018s Ramayana)  The burning topic in present times is, when was Rama born ?  Before dwelling on this point, first of all we have to understand that our great Maharishies has systematically divided period of shristi in Manvantars. Each Manvantar is furthur divided into chaturyugis. Each chaturyugis consist of Krita(satyuga), traita, dwapar and kaliyuga. Present Manvantar is Vaivast Manvantar. Already 27 chaturyugies of this Manvantar have passed. This is the 28th chaturyugi and first charan(period) of this chaturyugi is in continuation.  It is well known fact that Rama was born during the latter part of traita. Hence, if we assume that Rama was born in the present chaturyugi then it means he was born at least 10,00,000 years ago. The period of his birth may be more then this.  However, Vayu purana provide us the correct chronological period of Ramayana. If we take Vayu purana period into consideration then period of Rama goes to atleast 1,80,00,000 years back. Hence we can easily conclude that period of Rama is atleast 10,00,000 years to 1,80,00,000 years(this issue will be resolved in another topic \u201cBlunders of Indian History\u201d) .  This view is also supported by the fact that when Hanuman went to Lanka in search of Sita, there he saw elephants having four teeth . Hence this is now for archeiologist/biologist to ascertain when did such elephants existed on earth ? (The calculations of chaturyugies will be dealt in another topic \u201cAge of present shristi\u201d.  Whereas difficulties encountered in establishing chronological correctness of historical events for period before Christ will be dealt in \u201cblunders of history\u201d ). Another interesting fact that has been mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana is that the paternal home of Bharat and Shatrughan was in a country where mode of transportation was vehicle being carried by dogs or deer. When both the brothers returned to Ayodhya from their maternal home they crossed many places covered by snow and were wearing wollen clothes. Which place does this episode points to has to be ascertained.  By our logic it is Russia, as phonetically Russia sounds like misnomer of Rishi (this has been established in our article blunder of Indian/World history) Above mentioned facts clearly give us an insight into the period when was Rama born. So those who claim that Rama is only a mythological character we are providing them some more proofs which will establish that before the advent of Christinity and Islam Rama was revered throught out the world as an international cult figure.  LEGENDS OF RAMAYANA IN VARIOUS PARTS OF GLOBE  1)      RAMAYANA IN RUSSIA AND MANGOLIA:-   The Deccan Herald, dtd 15 dec 1972, at its front page gave a news which state that in Elista, capital of Kalmyk in Russia, story relating to Ramayana had been published. The news furthur state that various legends of Ramayana are popular among people of Kalmyk. Various version of Ramayana are already stored at libraries in Kalmyk. The news clearly state that legends of Ramayana are very popular since time immemorial. Domodin Suren, a Russian writer, has compiled various legends popular among Mongolian and Kalmyk peoples. Prof C F Glostunky\u2018s manuscript \u2018Academy of sciences\u2019 is stored at Siberian Branch of erstwhile U S S R. That book deals with various legends popular along the coast of Volga river. This manuscript is in Kalmyk language. In Leningrad also various books dealing with stories of Ramayana in Russian and Mangolian languages are preserved.  2)      RAMAYANA IN CHINA:-   In china, collection of Jatak stories relating various events of Ramayana, belonging to 251 AD. were complied by KANG_SENG_HUA . Another book, of 742 AD, relating story of plight of Dasratha after Rama was ordered to go for Vanvasa is still found in China. Similarly in 1600 AD, His-Yii-Chii wrote a novel with title Kapi (monkey) dwelling on the stories of Ramayana, predominantly that of Hanuman.  3)      RAMAYANA IN SRILANKA:-   Naresh Kumar Dhatusena alias Kumardasa, who ruled Srilanka in 617 AD wrote \u2018Janakiharan\u2019. This is the oldest Sanskrit literature available in Srilanka. In Modern times C Don Bostean and Jhon d\u2018silva have written stories based on Ramayana. Till today majority of population adore and revere Rama and Sita.  4)      RAMAYANA IN COMBODIA(KAMPUCHIA):-   Various rock inscription belonging to 700 AD are found in Khmer region of Combodia. These rock inscription are based on stories of Ramayana. Various temples constructed during the reign of Khmer dynasty depicts the story of Ramayana on their wall. The temples of Ankor are very famous for the stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These temples belong to the earlier part of 400 AD to 700 AD. One astonishing fact in these engraved pictures is that Hanuman and rest other Vanars are not shown with tail as against the popular belief of masses. (Wether Hanuman etc are monkeys, this issue will be dealt latter)  5)      RAMAYANA IN INDONESIA:-   According to De Casperis, there was temple named \u2018Chandi loro jongrong\u2019 which have stories of Ramayana engraved on its wall. This temple was of 9th century AD. In Indonesia another version of stories of Ramayana named Kakavin is very popular. This story was bit different from that of Prambanan . Besides that various other version of Ramayana stories were very in early centuries after christ which itself proves that Ramayana was very popular among Indonesian people before advent of Islam. It is also an astonishing fact that first international convention on Ramayana was organized in Indonesia few years back.  6)      RAMAYANA IN LAOS:-   Local people when pronounce Loas in their language it phonetically sounds like the name of one of the son Rama. Besides temple of Vat- she-fum and Vat-pa-Kev remains depicts the story of Ramayana on their walls. Whereas temples of Vat-pra-kev and Vat-sisket are having books containing epic of Ramayana. Lafont, French traveler translated story of \u2018Pa laka-Pa lama\u2019 in his book named P\u2018ommachak in french. This book also deals with story of Ramayana popular among masses of Laos.  7)      RAMAYANA IN THAILAND:-   Stories of Ramayana are still very popular among masses. In early centuries after Christ many kings has Rama as either prefix or suffix in their name ruled this country. Just like as in India we organize play of Ramayana, similarly various dramatic version or Ramayana are oraganised in Thailand till today. Similar dramatic version of Ramayana are still organized in various sout east asian countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Combodia etc.  8)      RAMAYANA IN MALAYSIA:-   In Malaysia till today plays are oraganised based on the stories of \u2018HIKAYAT SERI RAMA\u2019 ,written in 14 century AD,. Dalang society organize nearly 200-300 plays relating to Ramayana. Before commencement of the play people conduct various prayers and abulations revering RAMA and SITA.  9)      RAMAYANA IN BURMA:- King Kayanjhitha who reigned during 1084 \u2013 1112 AD; regarded himself as desecendant of clan of Rama. Various books relating to the stories of Ramayana as earlier as 15 century AD are still found in Burma. Books like \u2018Kavyadarsh\u2019 , \u2018Subhasit Ratanidhi\u2019 are based on the stories of Ramayana. Zhang-Zhungpa, commentary of Ramayana was written by Taranath, which is not available in modern times. In Burma also various form of plays are conducted based on the stories of Ramayana.  10)    RAMAYANA IN NEPAL:-   Oldest version of Ramayana, belonging ot 1075 AD is still found in Nepal.  11)    RAMAYANA IN PHILIPINES:-   Effect of stories of Ramayana can easily felt in the customs, traditions and legends of majority of masses. Prof Juon R Francisco found that in Marineo Muslims, legend based on Ramayana is popular, in which Rama has been depicted as Incarnation of God. Similarly among Magindanao or Sulu folk Muslims also various legends based on the stories of Ramayana are popular.  12)    RAMAYANA IN IRAN:   In Hyderabad city, capital of Andhra Pradesh, there is museum name Salarjung. There one portrait which is depicting a burly monkey having a very big stone in its hand. This portrait reminds one of Hanuman holding Dronagiri. Similarly Marco Polo in his book (translated by Sir Henry Yule in English) wrote at page no 302, vol II about a peculiar belief among Muslims, spread from Afganistan to Morocco and Algeria. These Muslims believed that members of imperial house of Trebizond were endowed with short tails while mediavel continentals had like stories about Englishmen as- Mathew Paris relates\u2026. ; .  We are of the belief that if one seriously start investigating various legends prevalent, before advent of Islam and Christianity, in Arabic countries and European countries than existence of Ramayana and Mahabharta can be proved. Due to barbaric and dogmatic acts of these peoples wide range of literature and buildings of historical importance has been wiped out.  13)    RAMAYANA IN EUROPE:   In Italy, when excavation were carried out in the remains of Astrocon civilization, then various houses were found having peculiar type of paintings on their wall. These paintaings, on closure investigation, seems to be based on the stories of Ramayana. Some of the paintings shows peculiar persons having tails along with two men bearing bows and arrow on their shoulders, while a lady is standing besides them. These paintings are of 7 century BC. It should be remembered that once Astrocon civilization was spread over 75 pct of Italy.  Sir Henry Yule in his translation of works of Marcopolo has refered to the belief prevalent among Medival Europeans that there Ancestors were having small tails. The same fact has been referred by Maharishi Dayanand in his magnum opus \u2018Satyarth Prakash\u2019. There Swamiji state that people of Europe were called as Vanaras (monkeys) ,due to their appreance in our epic like Mahabharta, Valmiki Ramayana etc. If we a analyse this statement in present context, then how we are going to define various statements like kangaroos(Australian team) meet men in blue(Indian team) at Calcutta.  Similar sort of epithets were used during World war to describe armies of different countries or else we see that we have helicopters named cheetah etc. As these words(epithets) are just a way to describe different set of people, arms etc, similarly world like Rakshas, Vanaras etc were used in our legends. These facts clearly indicates that legends of Ramayana are not work of fiction and were very popular around the world .  14)    RAMAYANA IN AFRICA(CONTINENT):   People of Ethiopia call themselves as descendents of Cushites. This word Cush is basically phonectic misnomer of Kush, the son of Rama. This fact is verly established by Satpath Brahamans, commentary on Vedas. These Brahamans while explaining various mantras of Vedas uses many histrorical events to elucidate the topic.  Astonishingly in Satpath Brahaman we find reference regarding the rule of King Bharata (predecessor of Kaurav and Pandavs) in Rhodesia .  Besides many inconsistent legends inspired by epic of Ramayana are prevalent in African Communities and they basically refers to various activities of vanars.  Egypt basically derives its name from Ajpati which is one of the name of forefather of Rama. If analyse various legends prevalent in Egypt there we will found references of Dasratha(father of Rama). These facts can be very well established from various historical refernces of Brahamans.(for the proof of it see our article Blunders of Indian/World history)  15)    RAMAYANA IN NORTH AMERICAN AND SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENTS:   Before Columbus discovered North American continent European people were not knowing about it. However A DE QNATREFAGES in his book, THE HUMAN SPECIES, categorically says that Chinese people were aware about the American continent and the use to have trade relations with them America was referred as Fad-Sang. Similarly in Japanese people it was known as Fad-See. Similarly, if we refer to various historical reference in Mahabharata, Valmiki Ramayana etc we will find that American continent has been reffered as Patal Desh(Patal means below foot). If we geographically see then we will find that American continent is just below the Indian Subcontinent. We will throw greater light on this issue in our topic, BLUNDERS OF INDIAN HISTORY/WORLD HISTORY.  But for your reference we are providing you some prevalent legends.  a)   beautiful girl in Mexican tribal area till today are called as Ulopy. If we see in Mahabharata we find reference of Arjuna marrying girl named Ulopy who was daughter of King of Patal Desh.  b)   W H Prescott in his book , \u2018 History of conquest of Mexico\u2019, provides various reference which prove that earlier civilization of American subcontinent have major similarities with that of Indian (Aryan) civilization.   However here we are providing you one reference which clearly state that Ramayana is not mythological epic but it bears historical testimony. According to writer of the book there is popular legend in Aztec community which state that a beautiful person named Quevtsal Katal came there from east and taught them various aspects of advanced civilization as a result his period was treated as golden era. He then went back to his original homeland because of persecution by some divine creature. This legends surprisingly does not throw light on the reasons why he returned.  Another interesting fact that has been stated by Prescott is that this legend is available in documented form. Now, none except Indian tradition can claim that they bear root to this legend. The same story has been narrated in Valmiki Ramayana, in uttarkand where it is mentioned that Salkantak Rakshas who dwelled in Lanka were persecuted by Vishnu. Due to this persecution they left Lanka and went to Patal Desh. The leader of this group was Sumali. According to Ramayana they lived in Patal Desh for long time. When they found condition congenial they returned to their homeland.  It is for readers to decide when such conclusive proof are there to  establish that epic of Ramayana is not mythological legend but it is  historical evidence which bears testimony to various legends  prevalent around the world. Till today play named Ramasitotav is  played in various communities of Mexico. T  o our amazement Rama has been mentioned in Bible, new testament, Mathew ch 2/18, where it is mentioned \u201c his voices was heard in RAMA\u201d. Rama is proper noun there, now it is for biblical society to define who was Rama and why he has been mentioned in Bible.  Even the name of Dasratha and Ayodhya are there in Bible. We will be referring to these facts in Blunders of Indian/world History.  Now we would pose some tickling questions to the historians:  1)   Why month of fasting among muslims is called Ramadhan ?  2)   Why place in Gazastrip is called Ramallaha ?  3)   Why place in London is named as Ramsgate ?  4)   Why capital of Italy is known as Rome(misnomer of Rama)   We can provide various examples where word Rama has been used as suffix or prefix with the names of various historical places/persons or misnomer of Rama has been used as name for historical places/persons. None of the historical evidence provides conclusive answer to these facts unless we take Indian historical evidences into account.  In our article \u2018 Blunders of Indian/World history \u2018 we will provide proof for it. We also believe that if barabaric religion like Christinity and Islam have not gained popularity than we would have more datas to prove our point conclusively. These two semetic religion have inflicted unparrelled havoc on historical datas and buildings. They destroyed all the libraries/monuments of historical importance which does not confer their beliefs.  Still we have lot with us and we can recreate correct chronological data of world history. It is widely accepted that the King Alexander invaded India. It really sounds ironical that we are accepting this theory without any historical evidence, on the other hand we go on to deny existence of Rama despite various historical evidences are there to prove that he was not mythical but a historical Mahanayak.  These historians inorder to defy Rama\u2018s existence are ridiculously harping the same old tone of theory of evolution which does not have any scientific proof.(why and how theory of evolution gained importance will be dealt in our article How the universe is created. The only thing of significance regarding theory of evolution, we want to state here is that it was a tool which was invented to challenge the anarchaic/draconian supremacy of church. The church use to claim that this world was created by God out of nothing and the age of this Univerese is not more than 10000 years. By the help of evolutionary theory scientific world challenged the supremacy of churh and overcame the clergy.)  This is for readers to decide by themselves how they are going to treat Rama. We think that we have provided lot of food for thought. Those who are illogically biased may still refute the existence of Rama while those who are logical and believe that mythological character can never gain such world wide respect/reverence will start looking upon Rama from wider historical evidences.  Here we want to clarify following points:  1)   Rama was not an incarnation of God but he was Mahanayak, a legendary person who lived a pristine life and is an example to be emulated till today.  2)   Ramasetu, on which lot of controversy is being created, might not be built by Rama as the period of Rama is at least 10,00,000 years. During this time geographical conditions has changed drastically.  3)   Valmiki Ramayana is not fiction but an epic based on historical evidence. We can analyze the issue of Ramasetu only on the basis of environmental/economical viability.   For those who are questioning existence of Rama, let them first justify wether their forefathers ever existed, by using the same yardstick which they are using for existence of Rama ",

            "answer_text": "YES, Of course ! !I will tell you about Mahabharata!  Mahabharata :   The Mahabharata, that is, the great Bharata, is one of the two most important ancient epics of India, the other being the Ramayana. The Mahabharata was compiled in Ancient India. One of the Indian sages (rishi) named Vyasa is believed to have composed the work. The legend states that god Ganesh wrote the Mahabharata while Vyasa dictated the same. It is possibly one of the longest work of its kind in the World. The epic contain about 110,000 couplets in eighteen sections.  The Bhagavadgita, a dialogue between Shri Krishna  and Arjuna, is a part of the Mahabharata. Here are some of the arguments supporting this  1.Archaeological Research  Archaeological research is though going on only in a moderate phase to unveil the material evidences of Mahabharata, there are some convincing evidences emerging out because of these efforts. In Kurukshetra, the scene of the great Mahabharata war, Iron arrows and spearheads have been excavated and dated by thermoluminence to 2,800B.C.E., the approximate date of the war given within the Mahabharata itself. 2.  City Dwarka  Marine archaeology has also been utilized in India off the coast of the ancient port city of Dwaraka in Gujarat, uncovering further evidence in support of statements in the Vedic scriptures. An entire submerged city at Dwaraka, the ancient port city of Lord Krishna with its massive fort walls, piers,warfs and jetty has been found in the ocean as described in the Mahabharata and other Vedic literature. 3. Ancient cities described in the Mahabharatha  More than thirty-five sites in North India have yielded archaeological evidence and have been identified as ancient cities described in the Mahabharatha. Copper utensils, iron, seals, gold & silver ornaments, terracotta discs and painted grey ware pottery have all been found in these sites. Scientific dating of these artifacts corresponds to the non-aryan-invasion model of Indian antiquity. 4. Similarity between Ramayana and Mahabharata    The dynasties recorded in the Ramayan and the Mahabharat concur without a difference. Even the relations between different kings and their dynasties in both the great \"epics\"match with each other. If both were mere \"epics\" written by two entirely different at two different times, why would everything match even up to minor details? Mahabharata is of a later date than the Ramayan. Why would the author of the Mahabharata borrow the same ideas and characters as those of the author of Ramayana? 6. Lineage of Shri Krishna  The Greek historian Megasthenes has stated that Chandragupta Maurya was the 138 King in the lineage of Shri Krishna. This means that Shri Krishna did exist in the bygone era and that Mahabharata did really occur. 7. Present cities from Mahbaharata  All places mentioned in Mahabharata are real places, all are identified as real places. For instance, Hastinapur is in UP. Indraprastha is the present day Delhi. Dwarka is located in Gujarat coast. Moreover, Mahabharata cities are not limited to present day India because Mahabharata referred Indian subcontinent as Bharata. For example, Gandhar could be present day Kandhar. 8.Perfect narration of the planetary positions  Krishna left Hastinapura with Karna, on the day when the moon was yet to reach the asterism Uttara Phalguni. Karna accompanied Him to some distance to see Him off and he then described to the Lord the positions of planets in the sky and expressed his apprehension that such a planetary configuration stood for very bad omen: such as large scale loss of life and drenching of blood. Vyasa narrated all these planetary positions in as many as sixteen verses as if someone was describing it after visualizing them in the sky. 9.Bharat Varsh  The country is named Bhaarat after the king Bharat (son of Dushyant & Shakuntala). What country would be named after the hero of a novel! 10. Mahabharata is written in verses  It is ridiculous to say that these texts are fiction, because of its poetic nature. It was a custom to write everything (even Mathematical formula) in poetic form. Hope I have made a good sense and answered your question!! Source : Speaking Tree and other web-sites  ",

            "answer_text": "If you are referring to all the \"magic\" in the Ramayan, then there is absolutely no proof any of that is real. Could those have been mere metaphors for real-life incidents? Certainly. Were kings Dashrath and Janak real? Did they really have such noble kids who became great rulers themselves? Its certainly possible, likely even. But typically you'd need other contemporary and independent historical accounts to corroborate such things, at least partially. I don't believe such accounts have been found yet. Unfortunately recording history was never a priority in ancient India. Its unlikely that the Ramayan was ever meant to be a historical manuscript. It is an amazing piece of literature and speaks volumes for the cultural accomplishments of ancient India. Isn't that enough? ",

Errors typically accumulate in the retellings or as many studies have shown, people have a intentional or unintentional knack for embellishing messages (stories) when they repeat it, so the statement announced by the last player differs significantly, and often amusingly, from the one uttered by the first. Reasons for changes include anxiousness or impatience, erroneous corrections, and that some players may deliberately alter what is being said to guarantee a changed message by the end of the line.CHANGE IS THE LAW OF NATURE1.These epics were held centuries ago.2.They were recorded centuries ago.3.These recordings passed through a lot of people through the centuries.4.They spoke about it to lot of people with a personal touch.5. They were re-recorded with a personal touch.6.People worshiped these stories.7.To make these stories sustain the test of time, they were written in some sort of fictional sense, where there were massive wars, flying chariots, a person with ten heads. This was done to make it grand.8. People discussed them like kids and so these stories stayed with them for long.9. Languages changed so interpretation changed.10.  THIS IS A CHINESE WHISPER EFFECT THAT STARTED AND HAS NOT ENDED YET. But unlike the Chinese whisper, the message they want to give to the generations to come stayed true to its real core that lies inside this multitude of interpretations. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely. Ramayan and Mahabharat are described in the scriptures as itihasa. Iti- thus, asa- happening. Itihasa literally means \u201cthus it happened,\u201d and is more commonly translated as history. Not mythology. There is much physical and logical evidence that these events did actually occur. I have addressed some of this evidence in a couple of other answers- Vipluv Shetty's answer to Do you guys believe in Mahabharath? Vipluv Shetty's answer to Are the Hindu Gods believed just as mythology or as if they really did exist? Beyond all of this, though, the truth value of the itihasas can be seen by their effectiveness and power to bring about change. Five thousand years after Lord Krishna spoke it on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, the Bhagavad Gita is still the most widely studied spiritual book in the world. It has been translated and analyzed by people all over the world, printed in hundreds of languages, and has helped people of all religions become closer to God and understand Him better. It has helped millions of people tangibly improve their life and become better, more responsible human beings. What work of fiction can have so much power? The itihasas were written with the express purpose of bringing less intelligent people like us, who prefer drama and intrigue to philosophy and lecturing, back towards our relationship with God. By telling us about His wonderful, incredible, and absolutely real activities. And that is what they are doing even today. ",

            "answer_text": "Well this is a very difficult thing to prove, but consider this - If today, something happens that destroys present human civilization and only few humans remain. Most technologies discovered will be lost, Our Industrial installation that give us metals, hydrocarbon oil, etc. will be destroyed, and humans will be basically back to stone age. Now one of those left decides to write a book describing World War 2, so that future generations will know. How will he describe?For eg. \"Tanks: huge metal moving carts, that fired metal balls which would explode, destroying whatever comes their path.\"His/ Her story is going to end like - \"Then Americans, dropped one bomb each on two cities, that killed all living in a second....\" and so on.Future generations, reading this book will have not seen a city, or these technologies.Over couple of generations, this story will become a myth. If they don't discover Hydrocarbon, or Nuclear technology, most of our current technology will be just stories for them. What I mean is, our scriptures can be just stories, or they may be real, just because we do not have discovered the technology is no reason to dis-believe.What we can do is, either believe it to be true and try to discover the technologies from the hints mentioned in these epics (original ones) Or believe it to be a myth and try to understand the moral of these stories.Either way is a win-win.

            "answer_text": "The Ramayana is one of two epics, the other being the Mahabharata, which have had a crucial influence in shaping the nature of Indian civilization. The Ramayana existed in the oral tradition perhaps as far back as 1,500 BCE, but the fourth century BCE is generally accepted as the date of its composition in Sanskrit by Sage Valmiki. Many historians claim that Ramayana actually happened and is not a mythological folklore. Here are a few evidences that make a compelling case\u2026 Cobra Hood cave, Sri Lanka: The tradition states that Sita was held in confinement in the Cobra Hood cave. There are many pre-historic drawings on its ceiling. An inscription in the cave that reads, \u2018Parumaka naguliya lene\u2019 further establishes a distinct link between Sita and the Cobra Hood cave. The Demons who guarded Sita while she was Ravana\u2019s prisoner called her her Naguliya \u2013 one who was born off the ploughshare. Existence of Hanuman Garhi: Lord Hanuman is one of the most important characters of Ramayana and an ardent devotee of Lord Rama. Hanuman Garhi, now a temple is a place in Ayodhya, where Hanuman was waiting patiently for Lord Rama who was in exile. Hanuman Garhi temple is also famous for its strategic location. It is situated at such a height and at such a site, from where the sunrises and sunsets are artistically visible. Foot Prints of Lord Hanuman: When Hanuman reached Ashok Vatika, he is said to have come in the form of a giant. There are giant imprints on one side of the lake there which are said to be Hanuman's footprints, formed when he landed. Ram Sethu: It is estimated that 'Rama's Bridge' is constructed in around 5000 B.C, with the use of wood and stones. This supports the claim of Ramayana being Historical. It is also backed by the construction method used to build the bridge is mentioned in the Valmiki's text. Sync between time history and ages: Archaeological studies reveal that the first human inhabitation happened in Sri Lanka around 1,750,000 years ago and it\u2019s been proved that the bridge\u2019s age dates back to the same equivalent. To top it, the dates mentioned in the text of Valmiki matches with that of primitive age as well. Mystery of Floating stones: In Ramayan it is mentioned that the Ram Setu was built by Stones and these stone starts Floating on water by touch of Nala & Neel. Some such stones were scattered at Rameswaram during the Tsunami, these stones still float on water. Many Geologist says RAMA Setu is built by natural process but failed to Provide enough proofs. Apart from Ramayana there are several facts which say Rama Setu is Man-made Structure. Sanjeevani Mountain, Dunagiri: Lord Hanumana carried the entire mountain that had Sanjeevani Booti when Lakshmana lost his conscious during the Lanka war. This mountain was named as Dunagiri. In most re-tellings of Ramayana, after the medicines were used, Hanuman flies again to replace the mountain in its rightful place. There lies a scar on the side of Dunagiri where Hanumana sliced off a big chunk of mythological real estate, a scar which \u201cbleeds\u201d in the afternoon sun. Himalayan Herbs in Sri Lanka: Exotic alpine Himalayan species are found suddenly amidst tropical Sri Lankan vegetation, the legacy of Hanuman\u2019s heroic voyage carrying a mountain with life-restoring herbs called Sanjeevani. Ashok Vatika, Sri Lanka: It was the location where Sita was held captive by Ravana after her abduction, because she refused to stay in Ravana's palace, and preferred to stay under the Ashoka tree, hence the name. Much of the Ashoka Vatika was destroyed by Hanuman, when he first visited Lanka, searching for Sita. Its present location is believed to be the Hakgala Botanical Garden, the area is known as Seetha Eliya. Existence of Lepakshi, Andhra Pradesh: When Sita was abducted by Raavan, they bumped into Jatayu, a demi-god in vulture form, who tried his best to stop Raavan. Lepakshi, in Andhra Pradesh, is said to be the place where Jatayu fell. Ram, accompanied by Hanuman, met the dying Jatayu. Ram helped him attain moksha by uttering the words \"Le Pakshi\", which is Telugu for \"Rise, bird\". There's also a large footprint in that area which is said to be that of Hanumana's. Four-tusked elephants: Sundar Kanda [4.27.12] states that Hanuman, on entering Lanka, sees Four-Tusked elephants guarding the palaces of Ravana. These elephants are tall and imposing and have been trained to protect Lanka from invaders. Well, fossil remains show that there were many steps in the evolution of the 'Modern Elephant' and there did exist four-tusked ancestors of elephants in various shapes and sizes such as Trilophodon, Tetralophodon, Gomphotherium etc around 20 million years ago! Existence of Konda Kattu Gala, Ishtreepura: This was one of the places to which King Ravana shifted Sita as a precautionary measure which he was forced to take by Lord Hanuman's advent. There are lots of intruding tunnels and caves in this area. This seems to be a part of a great ingenious network of paths, which is interconnected to all the major areas of King Ravana's city. Ravana\u2019s palace: These tunnels prove beyond doubt the architectural brilliance of King Ravana. These tunnels served as a quick means of transport through the hills and also as a secret passage and networked all the important cities, airports and dairy farms. A .close look at these tunnels indicates that they are man-made and not natural formations. This Buddhist shrine at Kalutara was where once King Ravana's palace and a tunnel existed. Kalaniya: After King Ravana\u2019s death, Vibeeshana was coroneted as King of Lanka by Lakshmana at Kelaniya. There are murals enshrined outside the Buddhist temple depicting the crowning of Vibeeshana. The Kelani River is mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana and Vibeeshana palace was said to be on the banks of this river. Proof of Lord Hanuman setting fire to Ravana\u2019s kingdom: The color of the soil of the ancient battlefield is still red today, and is still surrounded by lighter colored earth. One of the airports of Ravana, torched by Hanuman when he came looking for Sita, still has a scorched-earth look. A patch of darker soil surrounded by brown earth. Divurumpola, Sri Lanka: After Ram rescued Sita from Lanka, he made her go through Agni Pariksha to test her purity. The place where this is said to have happened is Divurumpola in Sri Lanka. There is a tree in that exact spot and even today, local disputes are settled through debates and discussions under that tree. Ramalingam: Since Rama felt guilty of killing a Brahmin (Brahmahasthi Dosham), he decided to take penance at Munneswaram, 80 km from present Colombo. This is the place where lord Rama prayed to lord Shiva and lord Shiva answered his prayer by asking him to install four lingams. Out of this four, one of the linga was made of sand by sita and other brought by lord hanuman from Kailas Mountain. Lingams at Rameshwaram and Manavari temple was built by lord Rama himself and so, is known as Ramalingam. Source: Irrefutable proofs that indicate Ramayana actually happened! ",

For me they are real..I worship Adikavi Valmiki and Veda Vyasa..So for me what they said is fact\u2026.I consider Sriram of Treatayuga real..I believe Mahabharata war happened\u2026truly.. When I went to Sri Saliam to worship Mallikharjun Mahadev..I witnessed Shiv lingas established by Sita ..and five Pandavas..and I am thrilled. I believe Nar Narayan worshipped Kedareswar Jyotirling and lived in Badarinadh.  I visited Bhadrachalam where I came across Parnasala..hermitage.where Ram and Sita lived during their Exile. I saw Sita\u2019s pond and Rama\u2019s feet marks\u2026.and I believed. When I went to Indra kiladri at Vijayawada,to worship Durga maa I was told the city was named after Vijaya,Arjuna who did penance there may be during his pilgrimage. It was Vijaya vatika before but gradually became Vijayawada\u2026Vijaya established Shivling there\u2026and I instantly connected with the tale.  I didn\u2019t visit Kurukshetra yet but will soon go there to feel the Epic war..and to reach the tree where Gita discourse happened..Not to forget,I desperately wish to see the pond created by Arjun to quench the thirst of Bhishma. My cousin who studied there told me water never dries up and the taste is Devine. Precisely I admit Ramayana and Mahabharata are real for people like me who never inclined to think rationally or demand proof for everything..I respect the views of others but I hold my belief in the two Epics intact.They are real for me..

            "answer_text": "Historians, over the years have tried to date the two epics by looking into various factors. For example, one of the factors taken into account was the commencement of KAL YUG upon the culmination of war in the Mahabharata. But this year, as perhaps calculated by Aryabhata, was found out be 3102 BC. This was believed to be too early for the kind of war described in Mahabharata. Another event, that is the flooding of Hastinapur, when correlated with archeological evidences, dated the war to 900 BC. But this too is not agreed upon by everyone. The poetic fantasies and exaggerations, combined with several Brahamanical accretions have made it very difficult for the historians to agree on a small range of time for both the epics. In general, it is agreed that both the epics, in it\u2019s current versions, can be dated to the period between mid first millennium BC and mid first millennium AD.What is interesting, however, is that most of the historians agree that Ramayana, at least in it\u2019s final form, was later than Mahabharata. This is contrary to traditional Hindu believes. Some of the arguments given for this assertion includes the geographical exploration of the two epics. The Mahabharata mainly centers around Hastinapur, which is westward to where Ramayana is centered around, the Ganga plains. Also, Ramayana extends south to Sri Lanka, whereas, the Mahabharata fails to explore beyond the Doab region. Although, some historians also believed that the war in Sri Lanka was an exaggeration of a war with a southern kingdom. But, even they believe that southward and eastward geographical exploration of the Ramayana does support the argument of Ramayana being written later than Mahabharata. Another argument to support this assertion is the social ambience of the two epics. The Mahabharata is a story of a clan based society (Yadavas, Pandavs, Kuru etc ), whereas, the Ramayana is the story of a Kingdom based society. This too suggests that Ramayana came later.As for the authors, the Mahabharata is traditionally attributed to Ved Vayas. But, it is widely accepted amongst historians that it has been subject of many accretions. Thus the epic in it\u2019s present form cannot be attributed to just one person. Originally, it may have been just the story of the war. But, it has now seen the addition of many episodes, including the Bhagavadgita. It is believed by the historians that the narrative section is definitely older that the didactic section, which was added later. The original version of Ramayana is attributed to Valmiki. The war between Ram and Ravan is believed to depict the cultural gap between the North and the South at that time. The Kingdom of Kosala( Ram\u2019 Kingdom) is presented as sophisticated and civilized. The southerners are depicted as uncivilized and barbaric, and refered to as Rakshashas, or demons. It is also believd that the original war may have taken place in the southern part of India, and was later transferred to Sri Lanka by editors later on.

            "answer_text": "I believe three things could have happened. These books are a mix of truth and fiction- May be the writers of these  books were good novelists. They prepared a nice blend of truth and fiction to make their books the \"bestsellers\". People also realized,though much later, to make movies,shows and plays out of them. Some interpreted them and wrote their own version. Some translated to their mother tongue. Later, some translated the translated version. May be some things were added and deleted based on their imagination and interpretation. Well , this is unimportant here but few layers of imagination might have crept in, in the original text. Anyways, our take away is- the original writers had great marketing sense.They are pure fiction- May be the writers were better novelist. They were great seers. They doubted that the truth might die out but a fiction would prevail many thousand years later. Very shrewd bunch of writers. Great imagination though to describe such grandeur and colossal events.They represent truth- Maybe the writers had stick to the notion of Satyamev Jayate. They knew that the truth will triumph.Many people will pose a hypothetical question of what if a copy of Harry Potter is found out 1000 years later and people believe it to be true? I don't think a work of fiction could survive that long. What scriptures have survived are as truthful as you and me. Fiction has long died out. If there is any we know them as parables and anecdotes of the form of Panchtantra,etc. These are the building blocks of our religion because they show a way to life. If the society doesn't function according to them, it is because we have misinterpreted them and attached various superstitions. Lord Ram and Lord Krishna were indeed heroes in any sense of the word. I don't mind you being agnostic and challenging the authority of the holy scriptures. It is your right to discover what is true and what is not. At least you are far better than thousand others who follow something blindly. I would like to ask you a personal question.Does these works,without the labels of truth or fiction, offers anything less what they are supposed to do?  As humans the onus is on us to separate the facts from the fancy. What you'll get here is just opinions. I'd put forth mine. Read the scriptures and decide for yourself. May your conscience be your guide. ",

You will not only will come to know that India has 17,000 years of scientifically documented HISTORY, he can also give you accurate date about when it happened, with scientific proof. If you still have some courage listen to his talk about Surya Siddhanta. You will realise how scripts were stolen (you can not steal knowledge you know) and mistranslated and misrepresented. Dating of the Ramayana and Mahabharata of the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Dr. Nilesh Oak** Ramayana and Mahabharata are not just well written, they are epitom of literature work ever composed on the face of this earth, the real HISTORY of BHARAT. And these are written by greatest SAGES (Scientists are a spek of dust in front of our Sages, by the way I am a scientist by profession, PhD is Chemistry from one of the prestigious central Institutions in the world, IISC, which itself was a result of three great legends of India, Swami Vivekananda, Jamsetji Tata and Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV) of this world. Invaders knew this and they did not wanted Indians to read this as they stole (you they stole sanskrit scriptures and the evidence is an open book, if you have any doubt about stealing nature of west just visit British Museum just to give you an example) most of the work. Sanatana Dharma is not based on a single written book. It is a culture of vibration, culture of LIBRARY. DHARMA is the basis of our existance even after 1000 years of genocide. No one can erase it. Sanatana DHARMA here to stay, as long as SUN and MOON are there. RAMAYANA happened at least 12,000 years ago and Mahabharata happened at least 6500 years ago. It is time that young INDIA read the real HISTORY. **\u201cHistory is important. If you don't know history it is as if you were born yesterday. And if you were born yesterday, anybody up there in a position of power can tell you anything, and you have no way of checking up on it.\u201d ** \u2015 Howard Zinn  ",

            "answer_text": "They are real for sure but their scale is something left to our perceptions. How can one say that?Let's first understand What exactly fiction is. Fiction:It is the merging of little little information on different topics into a beautiful sequence which did/can not happen in reality. So you are right there isn't something called as a meaningless story.There is some information which you may know or not,There isn't something called as imagination or more precisely the word is wrongly interpreted . Nothing can be born from Nothing.I know it doesn't make sense at first glance.but when you keep a blind man on an evacuated island with no sources of information,would he be able to discern something like color and sky and anything out of his reach?..no he can't understand the concept of color nor the concept of sky unless someone say's it to them by making them learn a language.Just like that stories can't come out of nothing. So indeed these epics and many more myths happened,but not on a scale we think,but maybe on a small scale.The thing that is easily combined in a human brain are two pictures and Hindu gods mostly have these type of features,Like Narasimha-where the head of a lion is merged with a human body,can't even a kid merge a lion face with a human body?More examples:Raining arrows/fire arrows..etc,this is also simple merging of natural phenomenon like rain and fire with the very old human weapons,this is apparent because there was no mention of science but only weapons,if they hid the science they wouldn't keep god's for rain and fire.(Arrows.You don't want arrows try your hand as a source then). So by that we can say epics had happened for sure,But what is the amount of fiction in it?that's the question. So of course one can say explosions existed in their times as an explosion can't be a multiple but it is a basic element like fire/water/earth..etc in those times,and bombs were described as being used in the Hindu epics but in what form exactly,probably we lost the book which described that in time and many such books .So one should read the verses and interpret for themselves as in other religions where the follower reads their own book and understand for themselves,but we believe in other story interpretations which make near infinite atheists be born in our culture.True atheist understand religion and not discriminate them  or extract info of history from them.

            "answer_text": " Read on to discover the true essence of Ramayan: Ramayan is the mythological story that depicts the win of good over evil- essentially depicted by Shri Ram killing Raavan. Now what if we tell you there was no Raavan when Shri Ram existed? Think about it, Shri Ram and Shri Sita are deities. In their praise it is sung, \"solah kala sampooran, ahimsha parmodharam...\" which means these are 16 celestial degree complete deities whose religion is non -violence! So how can they commit violence!? Secondly, how can a 10 headed monster like Ravan exist in the same land as pure and divine human beings or deities like Shri Ram? This definitely means that the Ramayan holds a deeper spiritual significance and is of a different time period than what is perceived. What is that? Actually speaking, Ramayan speaks about the inner struggle of every human soul today with its own weaknesses- which is symbolised by the bow and the arrow of Shri Ram  Forgetting our true identity as a soul, today we are all trapped in the jail of Raavan or the consciousness of the body- that is responsible for our suffering. The symptoms of this consciousness of the body is the presence of the five of lust, anger, attachment, ego and greed - both in man and woman- that is depicted by the 10 heads of Ravan. It is only when God, the Supreme Soul, Shiv, descends on Earth, and gives our true introduction to us, that we are able to kill the Raavan within and gain complete sovereignty over ourselves.\u2763\ufe0f So this time, celebrate Dusshera by killing the vices or Ravan within and connecting to God, the Supreme Soul!

            "answer_text": "Did they happen exactly as in the epics? Not likely. Flying vimanas, nuclear weapons fired from bows, magic, etc. require strong evidence, and none at all are available. However, it is likely that the Mahabharata at least is based on a real war.  There is a  Battle of the Ten Kings (dasarajna) mentioned in the Rig Veda, which resulted in the Bharata clan settling in the Kurukshetra area. Did this provide the core for the Mahabharata? Unlikely, but it's an interesting thought. The Kuru Kingdom  is a historical one, and kings like Janamejaya and Parikhsit are mentioned in other Vedic texts. The Mahabharata sets its own first narration at a sacrifice performed by  Janamejaya, so presumably he was an influential king who had something to do with the creation of the epic. One can speculate that he funded the creation of the epic in some form to glorify himself and his ancestors, who feature prominently in it. Given that Vaisampayana appears as the first narrator, it's possible that he and his students may have been the authors. Attribution to Veda Vyasa, his guru, may have been done for reasons of increased prestige.  Creation of the epic itself is multi-layered. Vyasa is mentioned as the initial author, then Vaisampayana narrates it at Janamejaya's sacrifice, and this entire story is then narrated by Ugrasrava Srauti at a much later sacrifice by Rishi Saunaka. From this, one can speculate that the text went through multiple revisions and expansions, and what we have may not be the original version. There are traditions of earlier versions called Jaya (8000 verses) and Bharata (24000) verses before the current version called Mahabharata came into being.  To my knowledge, no archaeological evidence for the war that formed the core of the epic exists. ",

            "answer_text": "No. One thing all the believers agree on is that Ramayana happened during the Tretha Yuga. Let\u2019s take their word for it. Again, according to them, tretha yuga is about 1.2 million years long followed by Dwapara Yuga which is close to 860,000 years long. Now even if you assume that Rama was born during the last 100 years of the tretha yuga, it would mean that he was born almost 2 million years ago. Humans did not evolve then. So yeah Ramayana and the Mahabharatha that followed are works of fiction. Having said that, they are very mediocre works of fiction too because from a pure storytelling point they have a ton of plot holes and character loopholes. They probably became viral because there was not much \u201centertainment\u201d in those days. maybe there was a really a king names Rama not too long ago that commissioned a poet to extoll him and made the poet write about him? It is totally possible. We have archeological evidence of kings doing this throughout the world. TL;DR: Ramayana and Mahabharatha are a works of fiction. ",

            "answer_text": "When I read them years ago I saw materials which were ancient and had at the same time an appearance of being prophetic while at the same time appeared historic. To me that suggested that the materials had suffered from tampering or transcriptional alterations. After all the period of time is so great that and that there was no printing presses to make perfect replicas was a probable factor.  If they are prophetic then supporting information is available to people who focus their dreams and visions on that content. The events portrayed if prophetic have not yet occurred. The concern therefore still exists and must be dealt with in a manner which allows the preemption of such horrific actions. That will not be possible unless there's a change in governance to one of using the Mandate of Heaven (a term used in several eastern Asian nations where the inspiration of leader's dreams factored in the creation of policies and programs). That it is prophetic is a higher probability than it being historic seeing no evidence exists to support the historic aspects. If it is historic then those who know the geography and have the means to test for atomic residues can prove (or disprove) the likelihood of it being history. ",

By that I mean that an open-minded person might conclude that some events described in the Mahabharata epic are fact-based.Now that the earliest evidence for the Indus Valley civilization has been corrected to 7380 BC (see the article 'Indus Valley civilization 2,000 years older than previously thought') we can allow that the civilization described in the Mahabharata epic is a fanciful depiction of the Indus Valley civilization, especially since the languages of that culture proved to be Sanskrit and Prakrit, since the 2010 decipherment of Indus script as shown in my book 'Indus Script Dictionary.'Here's the sign list:  Here are some results:  From right to left, this seal impression reads 'a-sur-sh-yama,' (A surasama, 'Shiva is equal to the gods.')   On a fragment of a bangle bracelet, the sign 'dasha,' which can mean either slave, servant or ten.   From right to left, the seal impression reads 'ti-ti-ra,' which means bird or flying animal in Sanskrit. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it is an epic, and the best part about any epic is, it always tries to prove that it's history even though in reality it's mythology. Why am I saying this? Let me sight you some examples and then repeatation of same behavior across all epics in the world which are related to many religions. When you read any epic, which obviously dates way down in the history and there are no evidences of the same to be brought upon as all the eye witnesses have already gone past the cycle of life, how do you say it is what happened in reality? So the thing is human beings are mortal, and they will be forgotten and unbelieved if we talk about only the human beings alone, to make them immortal we associate them either with places or events in history, we anchor them to the things which are immortal and then the magic happens, suddenly everyone starts believing the reality behind the story of human beings mentioned as there are evidences to alibi the truth. When we talk about Ramayana, we know Ayodhya exists, Nasik exists, Srilanka exists and to make us fall in, even the Ram Sethu exists. Well after all these solid evidences we can never say there was no Ramayana, it has to be there in the pages of history. No one can challenge the mere existence of the epic. Now come to Mahabharata, we know Kurukshetra exists, Mathura exists, Vrindavan exists; we don't know or care if really there was a war fought on the soil of Kurukshetra but we believe it cause Kurukshetra exists. If you check out the list of religious epics, you will find same pattern everywhere. It is the belief in these epics which makes the foundation of religion strong, so the evidences have to be strong enough to support it. As I believe, and this is totally my opinion, these epics are written by avid travelers who were best storytellers of their times and thus they included the places they visited during their journeys into their stories to make them more lively and interesting. I hope this answers your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Both are as true as can be, or based on actual events and personalities who lived, going by the widespread and long standing cultural, geographical, pre-historical, scriptural,  and even astronomical evidence. The Ramayana seems to have occurred around 7000 years ago and the Mahabharata around 5000 years ago. (Google Astronomical Dating) Both are narrations by contemporaries, Not accounts or story telling in hindsight. Valmiki, author of Ramayana, lived during Rama's time (Sita brought up her children in his ashram) and Vyasa, author of Mahabharata, was an elder in the Kuru dynasty. Both the dynasties have a long lineage, before and after the epic events, which are recorded in great detail in other scriptures. (Every king's name is given!) Both have character appearances of people who appeared to have lived independent, otherwise unconnected lives, commonly known in mythology and pre-history (scriptural history) The entire subcontinent of India is peppered with places where various instances of the two epics were played out. It is marked by still standing archeological evidence, temples and folklore. The route of Rama from Ayodhya, during his exile, and then in search of Sita to the South, and then on to Lanka is quite clearly delineated and there are markers right down the route. His journey is quite eventful, and every event has its place still identified today. In fact it has been, traditionally, and still is a pilgrimage route. We can still see the land bridge built by his 'monkey army' in satellite photos.[This of course can be questioned by skeptics as a natural formation under the sea that is being touted as Rama's bridge!] This folklore exists even in Sri Lanka (where Ravana lived, where Sita was imprisoned and the war took place to free her) and is the motivation for much tourism in that country. The routes of the Pandavas during their exile and Arjuna during his 'punishment' is also delineated and can be identified even today. Both are corroborated by equally ancient scriptures and folklore from other places in the subcontinent, even when thousands of miles away. For instance there is mention of the a king from an earlier Pandya kingdom who took part in the war on the side of the Pandavas in ancient Tamil literature. Whatever the evidence, it is an exercise in appeasement of intellectual curiosity. The reality is that, as works of 'epic' proportions both are unparalleled in their scope and canvas and content in every which way. And this is an understatement! ",

            "answer_text": "Most great novels like war and peace are based on actual events but it has also the creative element of the writer. Similarly, stories of both Ramayana and Mahabharat must have been based on some real events. However, both the books shouldn't be construed as historical documents. The main plot must have had a basis in real life, many sub plots and characters must have been filled in by the creative faculties of the writers. Why I say writers is that the stories were not created by one rather it was built around by several different authors independent weaving stories around then sin plots and also expanding and contracting the main plot and sub plots. Having said this, I would like to point out that it is not important bto know whether the stories are real or imagined what is important to know is what it teaches us. The stories among other things teaches us that life is not one fairy tale where everyone lived happily ever after. Rather it is a constant struggle between good and bad. You have annihilated the bad does not mean that you will have a wonderful life afterwards. Soon after Shri Ram came back to Ayodhya after years of struggle in the forests culminating in the battle against one of the strongest army of that time, could not live a happy life ever after. He had to forsake the company of Debi Sita . He fought his loneliness and sorrow by immersing himself in the service of his people. But as an individual he had to give up on personal happiness. Similarly, for the five Pandavas life was a constant struggle. Both the grand stories also help us build psychological immunity. When children learn these stories they understand that life is not about living happily ever after it is about struggle, sacrifice, and service to humanity. ",

It is true. No,it's not completely true, yes it may be true but literature world says that it was just genius literature work where writer makes co-incidental perfection approach with half a truth to make believe the half lie. I mean may be the Stone bridge was there already and after that some great writer wrote a story about some ideal man named Ram showing all the good qualities as to make people aware of what to do in which situation, like how should a small brother should behave to elder or how brahmins(brilliant minds) should be treated, co-incidentally he placed a stone bridge in between the story very brilliantly that makes the other half Raavan and Hanuman the truth.  In other words if today a apolocalypse happens and all the videos and audio go burnt and destroyed. all that left is some humans and other species without any technology and higher knowledge. They would be unable to understand as to how to regenrate whole era they just lived. Several thousand years later there will be new life form with different abilities. and they will found Panchatantra lying somewhere 10 km below soil. What they will think through carbon dating and scripture understanding that elephant used to speak in Hindi 5000 year ago. How they lost this ability, scientist still don't know about it.  Note: I am not comparing the two writers Chetan and Vyas. I am just giving reference from books that I had in mind. ",

            "answer_text": "Ramayana and Mahabharata are such huge epics that it would be highly improbable that human minds could have made up.The very belief that they have actually happened pervades all across India , places are identified where such events were beleived to have taken place and geographical descriptions contained in these epics also provide some corroborative evidence. It will be very difficult for a rational mind to beleive many of those events and a doubt arises that whether these epics really happened? Particularly things like aeroplanes and weapons of mass destruction( astras) , monkey men who can converse, huge birds, demons with huge powers who defy age and have different shapes of body, the miracles performed by these avatars etc. Is it George Bernard Shaw who said about Mahabharata that \u2018 it is wonderful if it really happened and still more wonderful if it was imagined\u2019 , or something near to that effect? There may be some exaggerations while telling and reselling a story which can not be ruled out but the basic story line seems to be too strong that it will be difficult to imagine that it could be fabricated. As Ramayana is placed in very ancient period, two yugaas apart, historical and archeological evidences will be hard to find. In fact recorded history at universal level was not even available in those days. As far as Mahabharata is concerned which was only one yuga apart, some evidences are found, being found and may be found later. If we do not agree that Ramayana itself is a history recorded by Valmiki and Mahabharata itself is the recorded history since they are not recorded in the way the present historians record and since there was s no corroborative evidence, there is no authentic Indian history before the events that have passed on before BC 326 when Alexander invaded India. But India was there since centuries and it would surely have had generations of kings who ruled different parts of country. If one can beleive that the epics happened as they were described in these works the same can not be disproved and no purpose would be served by that. If one can beleive a part of the story, it is still fine. If it pleases one to beleive the story minus mystical part , it is fine too. Whatever, these are great works of India\u2019s ancient times and one should be proud of these. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes the Ramayana and Mahabharata are historical accounts! Even the epics Iliad and Odyssey (The Trojan war) were considered mythological until that Schliemann guy discovered the real city. But still errors got introduced in them over time like: 1. Hanuman ( The whole vanara race), Jambuvant and Jatayu, even the Naga clan were not actually animals, or part beast-part human. They were fully human except they dressed like animals. The american indian tribes do that, the Ancient Egyptians did that.  2. Ravana didn't have ten heads simultaneously. He is said to have cut his head ten times while worshipping Brahma, each time a new one grew. Apparently he(& some other asuras) seem to have mastered some high level of cloning (probably used genes from animals like hydra or starfish due to their regenarative capabilities).3. The stones used in Ram Setu didn't float because they had Ram written over them. Even if Ravana was inscribed on them they still would have floated, cause apparently they were some sort of coral stones. (Oh & i'm gonna ridicule you if you're gonna say Ram setu is a natural structure).  4. Gandhari did create Kauravas in the natural way. She gave birth to a piece of flesh. Vyasa found out that 101 cells were still alive, so he nurtured them artificially outside the womb. 5. Pandavas were not sons of gods. They were just sons of kunti. They were created just from her egg by stimulating it with different forms of energy, which were called different 'Gods'  ( For eg: Surya dev means the egg got stimulated with electromagnetic waves, Vayu dev probably means Microwaves, & the twins were created using opposite poles, electrodes). I'm not making up this 'birth from a single parent' stuff, google it if you will. Some animals like frogs exhibit this.You can tell me if you know more like these.  Oh! & just so you know I'm not a maniac. ",

            "answer_text": "Untold purana-history of Lord Rama the World HeroRama, A Hero Of The Medians And Iranians  As the Ramayana shows, there cannot be any doubt about Rama's presence in Haryana, Punjab, Sindh and Afghanistan but due to the difficulty of deciphering Indus writing Rama\u2019s presence in the Indus area remains unknown. However, that Rama was far from a mere \u2018tribal hero\u2019 as described by Basham and Thapar can be seen from many ancient documents. The famous Orientalist I. M. Diakonoff gave the significant clue that names of ancient Medians often included the affix Rama, [xiv] in preference to common deities like Mitra, Ahura Mazda etc.. T. Cuyler Young, an eminent Iranologist who has written on the history and archaeology of early Iran in the Cambridge Ancient History and the encyclopedia Britannica, writes [xv] that one can look for early Hindu and Sanskrit connection outside of the sub-continent. `Ram' was a sacred name in pre-Islamic Iran; Arya Ram-anna was an early ancestor of Darius-I whose gold tablet is an early document in Old Persian; Ram is an important name in the Zoroastrian calendar; the Ram Yast is devoted to Rama and Vayu, possibly an echo of Hanuman; many Rama-names occur in Persepolis tablets. Ram Bazrang is the name of a Kurdish tribe of Fars. Frye lists [xvi] many Sasanian cities with Ram-names: Ram Ardashir, Ram Hormuzd, Ram Peroz, Rema and Rumagam. Ram-Sahristan was the famed capital of the Surens. Ram-alla is a town on the Euphrates and also in Palestine.  Rama and Bharata in the Highly Authentic Sumerian King-List  Fortunately, a study of Sumerian history provides a fairly vivid flesh-and-blood picture of Rama. The highly authentic Sumerian King-list appear such hallowed names as Bharat (Warad) Sin and Rim Sin. Sin was the Moon god Chandra and as the cuneiform symbol for \u2018Rim\u2019 can also be read as \u2018Ram\u2019, Rim Sin is the same as Rama Chandra. In the Sumerian texts Ram-Sin is said to be from Elam which links him to Indo-Iran. Rama was the longest reigning monarch of Mesopotamia who ruled for 60 years. Bharat Sin ruled for 12 years (1834-1822 BC), exactly as stated in the Dasaratha Jataka. The Jataka statement, \"Years sixty times hundred, and ten thousand more, all told, / Reigned strong-armed Rama\", only means that Rama reigned for sixty years which agrees exactly with the data of Assyriologists. Ayodhya may be Agade the capital of Sargon which has not yet been identified. It is possible that Agade was near Der or the Heart near Harayu or Sarayu. Learned scholars like D. P. Mishra were aware that Rama could be from the Herat area. The noted linguist Sukumar Sen also noted that Rama is a sacred name in the Avesta where he is mentioned together with Vayu. Rama is called Rama Margaveya in some texts from which Dr. Sen concluded that he hailed from Margiana. The Cambridge Ancient History contains priceless information relevant to Indian ancient history. The Sumerian records furnish the first date of the Indus era - the war with Ravana took place in 1794 BC. The significance of the fact Ram-Sin's reign (60 years) was the longest in Sumerian history has been lost on most writers. There are two Ram-Sins in Sumerian history. Raghupati Rama in the Old Testament of the Bible  Although, according to historians like R. Thapar, the Bible is irrelevant in Indian history, a careful study of it provides invaluable information about Raghupati Rama (Laghumal) that help in unraveling the 'dark backward and abysm of time'. A Genesis story in the Old Testament runs as follows: \"At that time  Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goyim went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). \" Amraphel is interpreted by most scholars as a contraction of Hammurabi-ilu but the names of Arioch king of Larsa and Kedorlaomer king of Elam need careful study. The name seems to correspond to Kudur-lahgumal  which occurs in three late Babylonian legends, one of which is in poetical form. Besides Kudur-lahgumal, two of these tablets also mention Eri-Aku, son of Durmah-ilani, and one of them refers to Tudhul(a) or Tidal which prove the veracity of the Biblical tradition. The name Durmah is an echo of Dharma and cannot but be related to Indian history.  Durmah-ilani Of The Babylonian Texts Was Dasaratha, Father of Rama  Kudur Mabuk is frequently described in the literature as a tribal Shaikh which is sadly inappropriate. The term Shaikh should more appropriately be replaced by Saka which links him to the Indo-Iranians or Indo-Aryans. This is related to the fact that Gotama Buddha was called a Shakya. This must be the reason why the Buddhists considered Rama as their hero although scholars like Sir Harold Bailey have ascribed this to pure opportunism. The term Mabuk also appears to be related to the epithet Mahabhaga. It may be mentioned that Gotama was called a Bhagava which corresponds to the Babylonian title of Bagapa. This sheds light on the significance of the name Durmah-ilani. The name Tusratta of some later Mitannian kings appears to be an echo of Dasaratha. Margaret S. Drower translates Tusratta's name 'owner of terrible chariots' but it may in fact be 'Owner of Ten Chariots' or 'Ten-fold Chariots', echoing Dasratha's name. Dasaratha may have led a confederacy of ten kings. The name has echoes in the later names like Aryaratha. A Ram-Chapel at UR  One of the major triumphs of modern archaeology was the hair-raising discoveries of Sir Leonard Woolley at Ur. Amidst the ruins of Ur, he unearthed a Ram-Chapel but totally missed its import in world history. This crucial finding not only bridges the wide gaps between Indian tradition and archaeology but also unfolds the historic bonds that once united ancient India, Iran and Mesopotamia. Ram-Sin of Larsa to whose memory this chapel was dedicated must have been Rama of Valmiki. Rama's memory in Egypt:   The name \u201cEgypt\u201d comes from the Sanskrit word Ajap, short for Ajapati, signifying Lord Rama as the secion of the clan of Aja; Aja was Lord Rama\u2019s grandfather.  The Egyptian pharaohs had names like Ramses I, Ramses II, etc. because Rama was universally accepted as an ideal ruler. Ramses is also another name for Lord Rama, and the word has also become synonymous with God, as India\u2019s Lord Rama was considered an Enlightened Incarnation. In following Ancient India\u2019s tradition, the Egyptians considered their rulers to be incarnations of God. The Egyptian tradition of dividing society into different castes, such as priestly/elite caste, warrior caste, traders, merchants, laborers, agriculturists, etc, originated in India with Manu, the man who invented the caste system. Even the religious symbols on both the shores of the Indian Ganges River and Egypt\u2019s Nile River are identical:  The Ancient Indian Scripture Mahabharata explains that Lord Parashurama killed all the ruling kings in India who were cruel, dishonest, and corrupt; those who were against the Vedic culture.  kings and warriors who had migrated from India due to their fear of Lord Parashurama.  Once they settled in Egypt, Through many generations they started their own some little memorized  way of India's Vedic culture. It was also known that the ancient Egyptians believed that their entire civilization originated \u201cacross the sea in a land to the East.\u201d Other Research For Lord Rama Lord Rama ::: israel in hebrew existed way before abraham's departure from Ur city to go west w his semitic followers. Lord Rama might have lived in what we call the city of rama-allah or city of ramah in ancient palestinian/upper egypt/isreal regions before lord Rama's wife Sitaji was kidnapped by Ravana and taken over to srilanka portion  RAMSEY I, II and III were all followers of Lord Rama, who spoke Hebrew and Aramaic languages in Upper Egypt regions. Some of their court helpers were Telugu/Tamil speaking people, who had names ending in \"neni\" anyhow, Because of their location and skin color, they were majorly known as dravids or Druids in English. Druids became Dravidians in that region.(Esau's followers in Bible) were Shivites in Sanskrit lang, but Hvites in Hebrew lang who later became to be racially profied as dravidians or natives of a country. Because Bharata moved his kingdom from Mesopotemian region to south east side amd to form a continent under his name, people fail to see the connections. It is there in BIBLE OT, and also noted in MORMON bible. ",

            "answer_text": "There are stories in every era to remember something essential or important. There are rituals to live better life. Unfortunately we forget the real reason behind every story. In old ages there were no technology to pass information. So information were passed through stories, poems. When I say old it means 3500 year old. So when you pass information from one person to another person. There are 100% chances that view can be changed. It become his view and my view. This is how polytheistic religion evolves. There is a problem here that there is no absolute view or universal. Absolute view is something like velocity of light or you can say Plank\u2019s constant. Universal constant in Physics can be considered as Universal views. There are exceptions in Physics also which clearly tells that there is no universal constant exist in this world. Bhagavad Gita was narrated and written by many writers. Nobody knows the original context of Bhagwat Gita except Lord Krishna. Even the first person who narrated Bhagwad Gita was Sanjaya. He was charioteer of Dhritarashtra and must have his own view while telling live Mahabharata war events to Dhritarashtra. There is Vyadha Gita - Wikipedia which is written by a butcher. So butcher wrote and imparted his view of Mahabharata and Gita. Similar thing may be true for Ramayana. To avoid large scale war Lord Krishna shown his theophany Vishvarupa to many person. One of them was Duryodhana. How he interpreted it? He thought it is something black magic. Same theophany Vishvarupa shown to Drishrashtra, how he interpreted it? ignorance!!! How Arjuna interpreted it? As a moral teaching. So it depends how you view things. Before Physics there was meta physics. And before metaphysics there was philosophy. Newtons theories fails in certain situation when Eisenstein discovered theory of relativity. So short answer is Ramayana and Mahabharata may happen but may be there original view/context do not exist now. What exist is multiple views. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there is enough proof to prove that both are 100% real stories but Just think on this theory. Mahabharata and Ramayana stories are true but they over the years the stories are changed slightly according to convenience while passing from one generation to another. Adding the parts like Shree Krishna was the god, He might be the godlike person, good war strategist in that time but later generation gave him the title as god because of his heroics in the war and his karma. If we exclude the all the magic and god related part from these stories we may find a story which is believable and might have happened. see some of the parts in stories might be as twisted as follow (we can only imagine) Mahabharata There is a royal family like mentioned 5 Pandavas and many Kauravas (100 may be twisted later because they might be too many). War between them may be the biggest of that time, like world war now.(remember people don\u2019t know about earth as a whole. from millions years from now there may be the war between the galaxies. for now earth is the biggest as we can think of world. at that time we may tell stories like Americans were gods and they stopped Asuras Germans) Another point is many people are concerned about amount of army in story is unbelievable, I think the number may be modified later by each generation while telling the story. The main point was the army was biggest of that time. During the war, Jayadratha killing event Lord Krishna might have used the mechanics of eclipse to trick the enemy or the event may not have ever happened at all and may have added later to add more spice into the story.(predicting exact time of eclipse was not possible at that time ) Another fact is that remember history writes good things only about winners of the war. In the war if you win you are right, good people. If you read Mahabharata with open mind you will find that pandavas aren't exactly ideally perfect peoples. there are some facts in the story that says they were also human beings , just not highlighted They also did some wrong things like Playing gamble with kauravas and baiting your kingdom and wife. Even Kauravas may have won by cheating that doesn't mean it is the good thing to gamble. Pandavas also didn't follow the rules exactly in the war, like killing Karna while he was unarmed, killing Jayadrath using tricks. While there were also some good things about kauravas also, like helping Karna also there were some good people in kauravas camps also like Bhisma and Dronacharya. Also I read in another answer that in story human nature is defined in detail very well. If you see you would realize that it has very accurate reactions of people to various situations. like Karana about his whole life , Droupati reaction to not tie her hairs, Bheema pledges to revenge of all five brothers. Drutrastras helplessness, greatest of all Bhagvat Geeta from lord Kishna. It will be unbelievable if somebody has only imagined and written the story so well detailed about the reactions of human in every case. If you look much deeper and filter out the facts that may have happened you would find a unbelievably well balanced story which is so hard to imagine and write . Again I want to say that there are some evidence but not solid enough to say that it is 100% true but, I think is that Mahabharata is the story of biggest war at that time but got twisted in some extend over the time.

            "answer_text": "Whether or not the Ramayana actually happened as described by Valmiki, with cleverly articulated facts, stories, anecdotes, is immaterial. The objective of the epic of Ramayana cannot be found in it\u2019s historical, factual accuracy. The objective of this beautiful epic is philosophical, cultural, moral, and spiritual enquiry. It is written in such a thoughtful and engaging manner that the problems faced by the protagonists and the antagonists, are still relatable and hold relevance to our present. It has been written with the objective of uplifting our limited consciousness. What matters is whether or not the saga of the Ramayana is a living reality for you. R_A_M_A_Y_A_N_A \u2018Ra\u2019 means light, \u2018Ma\u2019 means within me, in my heart. So, Rama means the Light within Me. Rama was born to Dasharath & Kousalya. Dasharath means \u201810 Chariots\u2019. The ten chariots symbolize the 5 sense organs (Gnanendriya) & 5 organs of action (Karmendriya). Kousalya means \u2018Skill\u2019. Hence, the skillful rider of the 10 chariots can give birth to Rama. When the 10 chariots are used skillfully, Radiance is born within. Rama was born in Ayodhya. Ayodhya literally translates to \u2018a place where no war occurs\u2019. Thus, when there is no conflict in our mind, then the radiance can dawn. The Ramayana is not just a story which happened long ago. It has philosophical, spiritual significance embedded deep within, the gems of which are available to those who delve into its depths and have the clarity of the mind, purity of the heart and synergy of the soul to access it. It is said that the Ramayana is happening in our own body. Our Soul is Rama, Our Mind is Sita, Our Breath or Life-Force (Prana) is Hanuman, Our Awareness is Laxmana and Our Ego is Ravana. When the Mind (Sita), is stolen/hijacked by the Ego (Ravana), then the Soul (Rama) gets restless. Now the Soul (Rama) cannot reach the Mind (Sita) on its own. It has to take the help of the Breath \u2013 the Prana (Hanuman) by being in Awareness (Laxmana). With the help of the Prana (Hanuman), and Awareness(Laxmana), the Mind (Sita) reunites with The Soul (Rama) and The Ego (Ravana) is vanquished. In reality, Ramayana is an eternal phenomenon happening all the time, in our own existence, in our own cosmos, in our own experiential reality. It\u2019s just that we are not sensitive enough to grasp it. We are a judgmental generation; which places far too much importance on intellect and little to no importance on our consciousness. So we dismiss such an epic because it contains irrational elements that do not appeal to our finely tuned scientific senses. When we finally understand that the epic, regardless of whether or not it actually occurred, we\u2019d know that the true purpose of this epic is to understand the human dilemma and find ways to uplift ourselves.

But we all should learn something from there lives. Now coming to the asnwer (These are my opinions). Both ramayan and mahabharat are true incidents. They really happened. The story of ram has even spread up to Indonesia. These can't be just stories. But there is a health warning. Our culture was an oral culture. It hasn't been many days since these epics are written. But previously 5 men told 5 things. Things were added up and subtracted. Just like a boy does something good and tells his mother a better version of what he did adding and subtractng some events. This is how there are some events that are exaggerated events in ramayan and mahabharta. So though thet are history they come with some health warning. This is my view of these events. And whenever there comes any good people we try to consider them as avatars. But they were actual men who lead life with great peace of mind. Thats why we call them God. For example the people of kiskindha were called vanaras. Vanaras refers to people living in forest (van=forest, nara=man) . So hanuman may be a great warrior. But people thought hanuman to be a monkey. I am also proud to be a part of indian culture. There was evidence of scientific mindset. Up to this it's ok. But when you try to proof that there were technologies then it becomes a serious problem. So there maybe some research about nuclear weapons at that time. But actually there was no technologies. (Again this is my claim.) But we all should learn from the teachings or lord rama and lord krishna. Lord rama is said to be peaceful even in so much trouble and lord krishna never had hate for anyone even after they had bad qualities in them. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll answer this in different ways: Historically: 50\u201350Archaeologically: yes its realScientifically: don't be mad, its not.Literature wise: This is interesting and unbelievable. Literature wise, Mahabharata happened before Ramayana ( becoz the text, literature, social system, language and script of mahabharata seems more raw and old as compared to ramayana, which has a more refined and comparatively modern text).This fact contradicts too much with mythology and the story line of the two epics. The reason is that Mahabharata has references of Ramayana as something which has already happened and Ramayana had no mentions of Mahabharata.Mythologically: \u2018mythology\u2019 is made from the words \u2018myth\u2019 and \u2018logy\u2019, which means untrue and logic respectively. I hope u can make it out.Anthropologically: yes ( some can say no though)Religiously: of course it isBiologically: well\u2026. U can't have 100 children out of a pot, neither can u reproduce by eating \u201ckheer\u201d. Though its my favorite dessert, but still it doesn't possesses magical qualities.MOREOVER: LAW OF ATTRACTION, if u know about it, then u may definitely take them to be real.",

            "answer_text": "Is Mahatma Gandhi for real? Did there actually exist a man clad in just a loin cloth who overthrew the mighty British empire without raising a finger? A man who could draw millions towards him and towards the non-violent freedom movement. The answer to all these questions is yes because we have read this story of the Indian freedom struggle in our history books. But lets say a 1000 years from now when people hear about such a man, they will obviously wonder whether he really ever existed. The same goes for Ramayana and Mahabharata. These are stories of princes and kingdoms that have a historical background. Ayodhya, the birth place of Lord Ram still exists. There are scattered pieces of historical evidence of a lot many anecdotes that take place in the Ramayana. Scattered because these events took place thousands of years ago. There are evidences not just in India but also in Sri Lanka where the demon King Ravana ruled. Similarly the kingdom of Pandavas or Indraprastha is the present day Delhi. There are evidences of the existence of Dwarka, the kingdom of Lord Krishna. The battlefield of Kurukshetra also exists close to Delhi. Both these mythological epics depict stories that are larger than life, with miracles and magic, with massive twists and turns, with events that sound totally out of some sci-fi Hollywood movie which make them at times hard to believe. For instance super humans falling in the battlefield and then miraculously re-emerging from their own drops of blood. All these incidents could be something like DNA cloning where people could re-appear in various forms from their own blood. The king Dhritrashtra watching the battle of Mahabharata live in his palace could be some sort of a live streaming like we have today. The palace of Pandavas, the ruins of which still exist in Delhi is described as an architectural marvel where land looked like water and water could be mistaken as land. We should remember that the land of \u2018Aryavarat\u2019 as India was then known was scientifically and technologically very advanced, far more advanced than today. It was perhaps this technological advancement that had the capacity to alter and interfere the course of nature that led to the end of epoch or era in both these cases, Dwapar Yug for Mahabharata and Treta Yug for Ramayana.

Sita was rescued and Ram along with his trusted comrades took his wife back to his kingdom, Ayodhya. 21 days later, he returned to Ayodhya, and his return is why Diwali is celebrated with lights as it first was done by the natives of Ayodhya, to celebrate the defeat of darkness by light!

            "answer_text": "I am a writer. I know how stories/novels are written. Writers meet people and observe them carefully. They listen to conversations about people\u2019s relationship. Based on that, if a character inspires a writer, the writer writes about him/her, keeping the basic idea intact but adding his/her own imagination to make the story more interesting and relatable. My guess - repeat, guess - is that the Ramayana and Mahabharata have happened, but not exactly the way they are written. And they were not written by one writer. There was a basic version written by Valimiki/Vyas and in almost every century, other writers wrote their own versions, adding their own creativity and imagination. There are people who vouch for their authenticity and there are people who pooh-pooh them. My view is based on my experience - when I write stories, I have a basic idea which I keep intact and change names and incidents to hide the identities of real persons. Writing is a very difficult and energy-draining task. All world-famous writers from all countries and all languages have accepted that writing does not come easily. That\u2019s why it is difficult for me to believe that Vyas composed and recited the Mahabharata while Ganesh wrote it down. Frankly speaking, the number of characters, relationships, incidents are so complicated that it is impossible for anyone - even the genius of genii - to write it all in one flow. It must have taken decades from beginning to completion. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to strike up a debate between faith and reality. For those who believe the Ramayana and the Mahabharata happened exactly as they are written, I don\u2019t want to debate. I\u2019d rather spend my time doing something useful. ",

            "answer_text": "If you ask any Hindu about the Authenticity of Mahabharata and Ramayana he will certainly say yes. Because the existence of Hindu culture, ethics, lifestyle is derived from these two epics. For me yes these both epics and mentioned incidents in it are for real though the narration of them might be exaggerated but to neglect it totally seems unfit now. (This video does compile information about the proof of Mahabharata)  Mahabharata & Ramayana both explains a long dynasty of Kings with their ruling land which meets the cities of present India. to provide so much information with this much accuracy can\u2019t be work of fiction.ASI has excavated some sites belonging to the Period of Mahabharata and the findings and dating does collaborate with the timings and location mentioned in Mahabharata.Astronomical calculation has been done by various people as per their knowledge and with little differences based on stars and moon and nakshtras, they have concluded the dates for the different events of both epics.Finding of Dwaraka is another proof which has made our belief about these epics much more stronger that the epics which are the lifeline of Hindus are not mere work of fiction but a piece of our rich and great History. Mahabharata clearly mentions that after the demise of Lord krishna, Dwaraka submerges under the sea and finding of dwaraka confirms that these epics are the History which was forgotten or were made to forget by outsiders in order to rule it.Mahabharata war happened at Kurukshetra and this place have places like Brahma Sarovar where Duryodhna tried to hide himself, Bhishma Kund at Naraktari: The place where Arjuna shot an arrow towards the earth to quench Bhishma Pitamah's thirst. The kund believed to be created by Arjun's arrow to quench the thirst of Bheeshma while he lay on the bed of arrows. This is the place where Bhishma was lying on bed of arrows. This place is about 3 km before the Jyotisar. and many more things are there which are considered related to mahabharata war.  Ramayan clearly mentions that in order to attack Ravana who resided in Sri lanka Rama had his Vanaras Nal & Neel to construct a Bridge over a sea to accomodate full army to Lanka. Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka.It was reportedly passable on foot up to the 15th century utill it was destroyed by a cyclone. The Ramayana attributes the building of this bridge to Rama in verse 2-22-76, naming it as Setubandhanam, a name that persists until today. Just because Britishers named it Adam bridge can\u2019t take away the truth. People are beginning to believe in our rich culture and history and thanks to the ASI and other similar organisations who ahave believed in the truth of our scriptures and have tried and are trying their best to unfold the truth.

            "answer_text": "There are numerous opinions as there are billions of people putting their faiths on these gigantic epics. There are some thoughts regarding there epics- 1. Ramayana could be a poetic representation of legendary prince Ram, It is believed by many scholars of anthropology and archeology, that the main story of Ramayana was much popular folklore across northern India even during Vedic period. Poet Valmiki eventually collected most parts and pieces of this story scattered in popular culture and translated it in Sanskrit. There are hardly any archeological and anthropological evidences to support the theory that Ramayana was real. Supporters of this theory includes renowned Indologiest Padma-Bhushan Dr.Camille Bulcke (Ramkatha: Utpatti Aur Vikas (The Tale of Rama: Origin and Development), Allahabad, 1950.) & Padma-Bhushan Dr.Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia, Father of Indian archeology (Ramayana: Myth or Reality? New Delhi, People's Publishing House. (1973) & The Ramayana in Historical Perspective, Macmillan India, (1982)) 2.Mahabharata seems to based on real events, dynasties and situations of that time, but there are many exaggerations and is a inseparable mixture of mythology & philosophy in real life situations. Original Mahabharata which was a story of a clan fighting over property, later extended with lot of magical appendix stories. So part of it can be considered as real but some part can not. ",

            "answer_text": "Well here are few points to ponder.1. The technology is advanced now, we have youtube, skype, and other things. But everything is being improved so much that all these present technologies may seem to be alien. 2. the future generation will not be knowing what a radio is or they will not believe if there was  black and white Tv that used to be so big.  3. There are so many animals that are being extict, so many civilizations that have got lost and so many things that human is not aware of but did exist. But that does not prove that, the Black and white Tv was not present, or the civilizations where not there. 4.We believe in Indus vally civilization, because we have found the remains. But we fail/ remain ignorant to believe Mahabharatha to have happened. Y? 5. The epic war was fought in around 5000-6000 BC. People are getting evolved in every generation. people are getting stronger and sharper from the older generation. The BIG channels are having even shows on these so called \"super humans\" if this is the case, there could have been people who were evolved during that time also. 6.There has not been research done on this topic extensively because the western world has not shown its inclination. 7. There are so many things that the man kind does not know. There are changes happening every moment which even science cannot prove. ",

That's what I tell my scripture students, archaeologists are showing some evidences, which seems legit. You can learn about those evidences and take own decision on whether they are stories or histories, But remember one thing whether they are history or just a story, it was made or written long ago, for now all we need to think is what is in it. what do we get from reading/learning them.We watched 8 Harry potter movies, endless fast and furious movies, series of super hero movies and we are fan of them, we love them, worship them and try to do what they did or wear what they wore etc., are those characters real? When we know why do we follow them so much,because we find something in them which suits to mentality/personality or we like the good they do, courage they show. If we can follow modern, 100% made up heroes,what's wrong in following heroes from age old texts, what's wrong in following age old wisdom, where no one can really prove that they are made up, all are just arguments that says they are not real or even they are real.Instead of arguing about whether they are real or not, why don't we just focus on the good things they are teaching us, why don't we just grab the morals from it and leave those unnecessary arguments, proofs which make those great texts into just stories to people like Wendy Doniger.

I believe that the reality lies somewhere in between. It is quite possible that great kings with the names of Rama or Krishna existed in reality. However, what we read about them in Ramayana and Mahabharatha are highly exaggerated and appears to be a work of fiction. For example, I don\u2019t believe that: Rama had weapons that could perched the seaRavana had Pushpaka Vimana or Airplane that was used to bring Ram and Sita from Lanka to AyodhyaHanumana lifted the mountain and flew for Sanjeevani bootiLord Krishna lifted the mountain as a child to protect the people of VrindavanaLord Krishna gave the sermon of Gita in the battle field which was heard by Sanjay sitting in the palace of DhritrastraWe don\u2019t know how much of the stories are true and how much are false. However, millions of Hindus believe these stories and follow the ideals shown by Lord Rama. Such a belief has created common Indian values which are keeping the society united. ",

            "answer_text": "This reminds me of something which I read a while ago. Jawaharlal Nehru, imprisoned in Ahmednagar Fort, contemplating the past and future of the then young yet very old and mythical idea of India wrote a very enlightened passage on this very topic. I am neither as articulate nor qualified enough to interpret Nehru\u2019s musings. So, I will reproduce that passage here and it is for you to decide whether the question of these old and powerful stories is real, warrants an answer. \u201cIf people believed in the factual content of these stories, the whole thing was absurd and ridiculous. But as soon as one ceased believing in them, they appeared in a new light, a new beauty, a wonderful flowering of a richly endowed imagination, full of human lessons. No one believes now in the stories of Greek gods and goddesses and so, without any difficulty, we can admire them and they become part of our mental heritage. But if we had to believe in them, what a burden it would be, and how, oppressed by this weight of belief, we would often miss their beauty. Indian mythology is richer, vaster, very beautiful, and full of meaning. I have often wondered what manner of men and women they were who gave shape to these bright dreams and lovely fancies, and out of what gold mine of thought and imagination they dug them. Looking at scripture then as a product of the human mind, we have to remember the age in which it was written, the environment and mental climate in which it grew, the vast distance in time and thought and experience that separates it from us. We have to forget the trappings of ritual and religious usage in which it is wrapped, and remember the social background in which it expanded. Many of the problems of human life have a permanence and a touch of eternity about them, and hence the abiding interest in these ancient books. But they dealt with other problems also, limited to their particular age, which have no living interest for us now.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Prologue:The atheists want to believe that they are only stories, so they will tell what they believe. Theists believe they existed, and will tell you that they are real. Both try to convince others by trying to provide some 'evidence' or its absence. There are third kind of people who are partly theistic and partly atheistic. This is because they might have a religious background in their family and they have had enough modern education, which is mostly secular in nature. So, they will give a 'hanging in the air' response. I would like to take the essence of this question as from a person who has not yet decided which side to take. The premise for my response: I believe that Ramayana and Mahabharata to be actual happenings on earth. Response:Case1: Both epics are actual eventsIf you will be motivated to read them, only if those are accounts of historical events, then let me tell you, there are some evidences that these days that people are collecting from the drowned city of dwaraka (found / confirmed by NASA as remains of some huge city wall, etc are found within Arabian Sea, at approximately the same location as Dwaraka was described to be in scriptures). But, believe me, no one will come out openly on this. There are people who will say, this is trash. Lately, there is a new largest Harappan archaeological site at Rakhigarhi, Haryana, (Deccan College, Pune is also involved in this project), something that is bigger than Mohenjadaro site in Pakistan. The evidences being found are lot more convincing. More and more evidences will show up in the coming future. Google for Rakhigarhi. Coming to Sethusamudram (bridge built by vanara's of Ramayana's time) - The entire discussion again came to light in 20th and 21st centuries,only after NASA called it \"Adam's Bridge\". Please mind that NASA called it a 'bridge', meaning they came across a very old, not natural but built structure between India and Sri Lanka. I don't want to tell you whether this is built by vanaras of Ramayana's time. It is upto you to figure out and believe, what that 'BRIDGE' could be.Does this motivate you enough to read? Case 2: Both are thoughts by some really intelligent sages. No truth in them.Will this motivate you not to read them? The very people who are telling you that this is 'NOT HISTORY' are telling you that these are 'HIGHLY INTELLIGENT' works. Why don't you read them? See, if there is enough intelligence in them. You know what? Once you start reading these things, you can observe in yourself that your analytical, logical skills are going up. Your patience will grow. You will yourself start looking at and understanding things from different perspectives in work or life. You will be far better in your career. Any management principle that someone will be giving you, will be mostly something that you already read from these books. Your attitude towards your parents, colleagues, friends, YOURSELF, kids, Wife, etc etc will change to a high positive. You will be able to distinguish RIGHT from WRONG. The good thing is that, others will see this change in you and come to for suggestions. And, you will be able to suggest them the right thing. I am very sure of this. Do not just read some random (only) translation. Try also to read the original text (mulam). Initially it may be difficult, but as you proceed, your speed goes up. It is a very great learning experience, that no course or set of courses can probably give you as on date, at any university, in the world. Kindly, do not have a bias while you read. Do not be with the impression that Rama  is GOD, or Dhritarashtra is a bad chap, while you are reading and understanding them. Share your experiences with others. Epilogue:I would like to bring something to your light. We know about the eminent Mathematician 'Srinivasa Ramanujam'. During his last days, Ramanujam wrote to his Prof. at London, where he quoted some random mathematical functions, saying that in one of his dreams 'GODDESS NAMAGIRI' gave him those. This is way back in 1920. Recently, in 2012-2013 scientists could prove them to be true. Present day scientists have learnt them, where they can apply those functions in. Now, consider this. What would have happened, in case those functions are given to 'Atheist' scientists (who look for proof for everything) in our country. Will they consider working on them to study for 90+ years, just to see what they are? What will their comments be, when told that GODDESS NAMAGIRI gave those equations? They will definitely say, this is a case of 'Chemical Locha', as in Munnabhai. Well, 'Chemical Locha' may create a munnabhai, but definitely not a 'Srinivasa Ramanujam'. Mathematician's Century-Old Secrets Unlocked It is better to read the scriptures, whether historical/archaeological evidences exist or otherwise. And, final piece of advice, in case one don't mind. Please do not discuss whether those are REAL. It is a waste of time on both sides. ",

Note : you will come across some YouTube channel and websites claiming to discovered some evidence. None of them fits to the definition of proofs. It's all a part of propaganda.If we find Dwaraka city underwater, doesn't mean Mahabharata is true. It is like saying, if after 5000 years archaeological studies find out that London existed, implies that Harry Potter was real.Also people with point out that if Ramayana and Mahabharata are not true, so is the story of Alexander. Unfortunately, a little study can take this misconception out. Alexander the Great, Jesus: A Simpleton's Approach to HistoryIs there a possibility Alexander the Great didn't exist? Also, people will point out the complexity of the story and claim that to be a evidence. People like this should read HP, LOTR, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you say something is real or not? Astronomy and archaeology can only take you a little ahead. Even if there is no archaeological evidence for an event, it can't be dismissed as false. How many events in history are backed by such evidence? How can royal inscriptions or books said to have been written during their period be authentic? What is the basis of our belief in history then? Why do we believe in Asoka or Alexander or Napolean ? It is a matter of faith. At any point of time, you have to trust someone. If you do not wish to put faith in anything, then you end up believing in nothing. Regarding our epics, they might have undergone many changes but they have not lost their character. To say that they are merely fictitious writings is challenging the existence of one of the most cultured, powerful, progressive and chivalrous races of the earth - Aryans. A fictitious writing cannot survive so many generations and cannot give such power to its characters. It cannot influence the lives of millions of people for so long. It teachings cannot be so fresh and timeless, relevant at all times to all people. The bottom line is beyond astronomy, archaeology and topology, the very nature of epics makes them real. ",

This debate has been going on for ages and I am pretty sure it will continue for a long time in the future also. What I do know is that both of them are wonderful stories which deserve to be read and understood in the right sense by everybody. The writers have dealt with every human emotion possible, giving us a reflection of what it is like to be a human - glorious and despicable at the same time. These stories are a treasure of knowledge which deserve to be mined as much as possible. So, to answer your question, I don\u2019t know if they are myths or history but I don\u2019t care either. To me, what is most important is the message that thses stories give through their numerous fasconating characters and understanding that and applying it in my life is what I always focus on. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you mean to ask whether the epics narrate historical events accurately. I would reply - Not at all. The epics were not intended to convey historical events, but rather to partly convey certain philosophical points of view and to serve as a model for other classical sanskrit literature. There will be a large number of (mostly ignorant) people who will claim (based on astrology etc) that the epics are from before 3000 BCE. But anybody who has read the epics in the original sanskrit themselves and understood what they are trying to say, will not accept these 3000 BCE stories. Let us see traditional references to the epics. The earliest authorities to mention the epics were P\u0101\u0146ini and Kau\u0163ilya (both of whom lived in the 4th century BCE). There is significant proof that the earliest form of both epics are from the 4th century BCE. That was at the end of the vedic period just about one century after the oldest upanishads (Ch\u0101ndogya & B\u0157had\u0101ra\u0146yaka) were composed. The main stories described in the epics never took place at any point of time. However some of the people and places that they mention are not entirely fake so the epics are not completely false.. for example the Buddha did exist (just one century before the epics), and he is mentioned in both epics. The epics mention existence of the janapadas (kingdoms) such as kurus, pa\u00f1c\u0101las, madra, ko\u015bala, videha, k\u0101\u015bi, avanti etc.. which were real. But to know what is true and whatis not true in the epics, one should study them seriously and not repeat what the ignorant people say based on fake astronomical data. V\u0101lm\u012bki and Vy\u0101sa had no intention to write down a factual report of their historical knowledge, that was not their purpose. Their intention was to compose a k\u0101vya that could serve certain scholarly and ethical purposes for future generations of Indians. That is the purpose which they have served anyways. ",

            "answer_text": "No. For many reasons. 1. Stories like The Rabbit and the Turtle, and many more like it, are short stories. Indian kids (of course in the past) must have been super intelligent to be taught using \"novels\" and \"100,000 verses\" long 'story books'. That too, whith unmatched philosophy as the contents with LOADS of human values - which seemingly are impossible for even a well grown brain to fathom! Or may be, Ved Vyasa and Valmiki and Tulsidaas were such great masters at writing, but foolish as 'teachers' to understand the level of human brain.  2. If at all these 'stories' are (only) meant to teach people, why the 'characters' are treated as Gods and worshiped by building temples? Is it somewhere in these books that a temple should be made of the characters and they worshiped like Gods - and only then the teachings could be followed? 3. Why different (existing) \"places\" (cities/villages/jungles/mountains/rivers etc) co-related with the incidents/characters? 4. The writers of these stories must have traveled across the length and breadth of the Indian Subcontinent in times when the mode of travel was horses or bullock carts and there were huge rivers and mountains along with dense forests to cross while moving from one part to another. Ved Vyasa DID it by himself - all alone - just to write a book? They even had crossed the seas and the oceans as well! From Ayodhya to Sri Lanka. And Mathura to Dwarka and Kandhar and Assam and where not?The writers must have been super humans to remember the places and take note of the places and various people, to 'make up' such long stories.  They also must have known about each other so well that they were able to preserve the timeline and the characters found in each other's writings. Well, a mention of Hanuman and Jambwant etc.. in Ramayana is there in Mahabharata as well. How strange that WE (as Hindus) are so thoughtless to 'preserve' these myths since the times immemorial! God only can help us! ",

But other aspects you can relate with through your real life. Isn't it ? And don't we enjoy good science fiction from foreign authors. Then, why do you demand realism from Mahabharata and its Author. Can't you enjoy a good fiction and learn important lessons of life from it ? Or just enjoy it for the heck of it ? Why create problems or want approval of it to be real ?? ",

Since none of the incarnation stories is real, there is no way that any of these epics could be a reality though, the stories might be very loosely based on some real events and were taken completely out of context.

Original magabharatham was written in Tamil and it was a true happening near South india.Many will not accept it suddenly but thats the truth if u investigate.Only that actual Tamil epic had true values and concepts of dharma and adharma but  Aryan invasion adulterated the magabharatham and made it to a version wer people will enjoy commercially and more fake concepts and events wer immersed( like gods had more wives,ganesha was made of parvati's dirt etc ).Lord Krishna was never married he was a saint ,Lord Ganesha is not a real God it's a symbol of aseevagam (elephant )attached to merchant symbol (chettiar doll with big stomach) collectively .merchant of ancient south India spread their concept of aseevagam(ancient Tamil religious concept) along with a symbol of elephant merchant that is vinayaka that's y in India ter are no vinayaka temple dated more than 500 yrs ull find only Shiva and vishnu temple dated before 3000 yrs or more but one and only temple of vinayaka dated 2000 yr is present in karaikudi which is nothing but ancient merchant land wer tey worshipped ganesh as part of merchant community.thats y ganesh worshipped in all Eastern countries like burma,vietnam,japan indonesia etc coz Tamil merchants did business in these lands and wer commanding enough to force traditions in such countries at that time.Also elephant was portrayed as wisdom animal by ancient Tamil(aseevagam). Coming to point,So according to Sanskrit  magabharatham the story was written by Lord Ganesha himself,who is none but a merchant symbol .so that is fake. So Lord Siva was a Tamil yogic saint ,muruga was a Tamil sidda saint, Lord vittinu(Vishnu) was a Tamil astrologer,astronomer saint like vice all Tamil gods wer real ppl who are worshipped as gods after mortal death. These Aryan invasion adulterated culture, language etc according to their wish and made ppl believe that tey wer real .But hide all aseevagam concepts and real God values and also tried to hide yoga and sidda medicine as they wer created by aseevagam saints.all of magabharatham and even Sanskrit language is fake. Now u may ask how Sanskrit s fake. As per language ligustic formation ,etymology of every word must have a meaning and collective split meaning must have a word sense too relating to the main word. In that case if u split all Sanskrit words it doesn't have split meanings at all, rather all split meaning will relate to Tamil. Eg:very first word in Sanskrit is namaskaram(welcome,hello) : etymology namam +s+karam.  namam in Tamil means beginning,title etc and karam means hands .together meaning: \"beginning with hands \"but Sanskrit doesnt give this split meaning. This says these words are derived from Tamil. \"S\" is just a conjuct phrase use to joing or make words appear differently. In english tey used S in front of many words and made a new word Eg.s + panchu(cotton in Tamil) is sponge,s + peachu(speaking in Tamil) is speech s + pinnu(weave in Tamil) is spin Sanskrit word anekantavada . etymology in tamil anai+ kanda+vadam means elephant + seen +concept or idea  means concept driven from aseevagam( elephant symbol of aseevagam) the old religion of Tamil but in sankrit etymology it doesn't have a  split meaning at all. All Sanskrit words are like this,they don't have a split meaning & root meaning and all root meaning relate to Tamil.if the language itself is fake how abt the literature, sanskrit mahabharata is fake too. For more related research  on ancient Tamil and aseevagam how aryan faked all concepts pls chk YouTube channel \"Tamil chinntanaiyalar \"in youtube. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "Alash!!! OoO my god 119 merged questions. Also hell lots of people following also. I don't know why people are asking such ruthless questions? After knowing true or false no one even going to read it out. I can bet that 10% of overall population of India, you can add them those who are already passed away, has never been really read it completely. When you can question oneself about these Epic Real Manuscripts, all they can figure out the characters were played in Ramanand Sagar's historic TV serieses. Apart from that, from this generation, if 1% even watched that series is also a matter for cheers. Those guys, who believes and insanely watching the series or movies like Transformer, GoT, 50 SoG etc. Still they are asking this type of question just to create the debate only. Fun part is that after watching them they are buying these books and read them curiously. If you ask them about the author of those fictional serieses they can answer correctly with out any mistake of punctuation marks, that our foreign authors are having in their names. But the answer for the author of Ramayana is \u201cwait! Let me Google it.\u201d But really a few buys our holi books and a little among those a few follows them religiously. Our culture is not a thousands of years. We mentioned about COLOMBO before Columbus.We mentioned about KAILASH before mount K2.We mentioned about Akhand Bharat before India.All I want to say that instead of finding the authenticity of our holi books do some research about the characters were described in them and follow them effectively which will add a lot of values in your life or personalities which can further help to build a better society for us. Thanks Edit:- I want to thank all those writers, who answered after a lot of research and collection of datas about our soul of culture. Jai Sri Ram ",

            "answer_text": "It is fiction if you choose to believe it that way. However, here are a few evidences I dug up: Krishna is mentioned in the Chandogya Upanisad. Other names occurring elsewhere include Vicitravirya, Santanu, Dhrtarastra, Janamejaya, and Pariksit.The Adi parva elucidates the genealogical history of the Puranic kings and some of the main events, such as :Generation 45, Bhagiratha, Ganga changes course; Generation 65, Rama Dasarathi, Dvapara begins; Generation 94, Mahabharata War. If this was an act of fiction, then describing the entire lineage would have been next to impossible.Places mentioned in the Mahabharata are real. For eg. Hastinapur is in U.P, Indraprasth is the present day Delhi, Ghandhar is a part of the present day Pakistan (which was part of the Indian subcontinent) , Kurukshetra is now in Haryana etc.The Buddhist Jataka tales, written during the times of Mauryan dynasty, speaks ill of Draupadi for cohabiting multiple husbands.The Kali yuga that started with the death of Krishna, 35 years after the war has a beginning of 3102 BC, which means the Mahabharata war happened in 3137 BC. The Kali yuga is also beleived to have begun with a grand planetary conjunction. The Gregorian Calendar vouches for the Kurukshetra War, as it states the beginning of Kali Yuga.Ramesh Panchwagh is writing a book called, \u201cAstronomical Proof of the Mahabharata War and Sri Krishna.\u201d This book will include the original Shlokas, their translation, detailed computer maps of each event, and the Indian astronomical positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and comets. I recommend you to read this archeoastrological excerpt of the book : Astronomical Proof of the Mahabharata War and Shri Krishna: Part IThe Adi Parva in the Mahabharata gives us the numerical denomination of the armies which were divided into Akshouhinis. Each Akshouhini consisted of:21,870 Chariots 21,870 Elephants 65,610 Cavalry 109,350 Infantry Ratio: 1 chariot : 1 elephant : 3 cavalry : 5 infantry soldiers Interesting trivia: If you add the add the digits of each division of the army, it adds upto 18 (example 65,610 Cavalry = 6+5+6+1 equals 18) . It is physically impossible to bring in random magic numbers if this was a work of fiction. 8. Underwater excavations by marine archeologists have revealed the submerged city of Dwarka, large door socket, bastion from the fort wall, natural harbour, two rock-cut slipways of different width and sizes extending from the beach to the intertidal zone, numerous old stone ship anchors, a three-headed motif on a sea-conch shell etc. This links Krishna\u2019s Dwarka City to Mahabharata. There are many such evidences that archeologists are researching and have researched. Due to time constraints and limited understanding of the astroarcheological events, I\u2019m unable to articulate them effectively. You could go through the links I\u2019ve given in the references. References http://www.ece.lsu.edu/kak/MahabharataII.pdf15 facts that prove Mahabharata happened for real!Did Mahabharata Really Happen? - Part II - The Proof of The Deadly WarAstronomical Proof of the Mahabharata War and Shri Krishna: Part IP.S. I would love to hear from Smrithi Rekha Adinarayanan on this. She can paint a much better picture. ",

With our cataract defect eyes we can't measure things. Let's get our cataract removed before commenting on historical events that occurred millions of years ago.

Ram succeeded. Mahabharata is the history of fulfilling desire of Krishna, who was driven out by Jarasandh to the extreme corner of the country, to control North India. He chosen spineless/personalityless but great warriors Pandavas to fulfil his desire. Hutches conspirecy and eliminated great kings one by one and finally the war. Kurukhetra war was between two group of kings.. one group who were accepted the control of Krishna\u2026other group who didn\u2019t. However, the bigger group lost the battle by various nasty tricks by Dwarkadish Krishna. This is all about Ramayana & Mahabharata in a nutsel. However, over the years various stories added to glorify the winning side and projecting loosers as villans or demons. This happens throuout the World History. After all, History always written by the winning side. ",

But what is a proof that anything that happened before 1900, what we learn in History, is real. There are documents telling the story, but they can be faked or easily made up. Still you believe them to be true because they are taught under History. Similarly the story of Ramayana and Mahabharata is available in text form. Why should that be considered as fake or fiction? Finally, even today the history we are taught in schools is manipulated, altered for convenience. Sometimes it is miss-interpreted. That is why it is the choice each individual what they want to believe in. If you ask me, every story that is told till date (no matter how fictional) is myth or real and has actually happened. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they happened. Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism acknowledge that. However, they have different versions of story. According to me, the most authentic and logical version is of Jainism. Jainism version don't say that Hanuman was monkey and having tail and that he was son of air. It doesn't say that Ravana was rakshasha. It doesn't say that Kunti gave birth to all her sons by praying demigods. Can ever air can make human female pregnant and that woman give birth to half men half monkey? It doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Hanuman was called Pawan putra because his father's name was Pawan. He waa not literally air. He, his family and people of his clans were called vanaras because they were residing on an island named Vanar dweep. Ravana and his family were called rakshasha because his ancestors were residing on an Island named Rakshasha dhweep. They were not literally Rakshasha. Do Rakshasha ever marry human woman? There are 4 kinds of heavenly deities: Vaimanik devas, Jyotish devas, Bhawanvasi devas, and Vyantar devas. The Rakshashas are one of the category of Vyantar devas. It means they are kind of heavenly deities. Heavenly deities never marry humans or have any kind of physical relation with one. Ravan was not as bad as people think. He was good person and very intelligent, knowledgeable, and religious. He was dedicated towards Jain religion and so were Ram, Lakshman, and Sita. But he just made one mistake of kidnapping Sita as he was attracted to Sita due to the influence of past birth attachment and past bad karma. He will be one of the 24 Teerthankar in future in next utsarpini kaal. Also, children of kunti including karna were children of Pandu himself. They weren't children of demigods (heavenly deities). If you want to read about interesting and logical Jain version of Ramayan, please read Padmapuran scripture. You can Google it and download pdf version of it. If you want to read about Jain Mahabharata, please read Pandav Puran scripture. However, before reading those scripture, I suggest you to learn basics of Jainism. Then first read 24 Teerthankar Mahapuran, then shalaka purush part 1 and 2 and then read Padmapuran and Pandavpuran. ",

If we will consider it as magic, it will always be myth, but it should be considered as Magic but as Science. The thing related to every action of this story is Science. If we consider this  This is a natural path from Rameshwaram to Lanka. The interesting fact that shocked scientist is that the soil below the small islands is older but the soil above it is very much newer. A layer deposit\u2019s over it, but this was not natural. How was this path made. The soil was as old as the time of Ramayana, this path was made by Vanar Sena, under their chief engineer Nal and Nil. People asks how a Bridge could be made on floating water, we usually say that The sea God helped them, aren\u2019t we connecting them with Magic. If we see scientifically it\u2019s actually a rock that contains air gaps between them which allows the rock to float over water. Another question arises about Kauravs, 100 born at same time with dead piece of flesh. When Gandhari gave birth to a piece of flesh, people were very sad, but a Rishi plotted them and made 100 seeds out of that flesh. Soon the seed broke and a baby was born out of it. When we ask how, every single one says Magic. But actually it is Science. 100 babies born out of a piece of flesh, it sounds awkward, but now a days it is known as cloning. 100 clones were made out of that flesh, it is called cloning.

            "answer_text": "I would keep my answer for Ramayan as Mahabharata has been well analysed by Ajit Narayana in his answer here, Why was Dhristadyumna made the supreme commander for Pandavas given the availability of Arjuna? Is there a reason they don't want Arjuna to lead the troops? Lets dig down on psychology.  Thinking or reasoning is classified in two distinct types; Propositional and Narrative. Propositional argument would be to defend or disprove a certain proposition. It builds on logic, describe the events in rational order and is objective. Physics, chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, most of our science fields fall in this reasoning concept. More details here: Descriptive knowledge , Propositional attitude  Whereas, Narrative builds on emotional part of our brain. It builds on our experiences, experience of feelings, not time or years. Narrative is set of events and characters woven to make the audience feel the desired emotions. In common metaphor language, proposition is food for our logical brain and narrative is for our hearts. More on Narrative: Narrative paradigm , Narrative preaching   Both, propositional and narrative methods are used for teaching, preaching and transform humans for a desired outcome. In most of scientific studies, Narrative has been found to be much more effective. More details of studies are here: The Place of Story in the Study of Teaching and Teacher Education , Narrative and Propositional Reasoning in an Instructional Context  Now, keep in mind, Ramayan is a narrative, not a proposition. Listening to Ramayan is expected to make audience feel a certain emotion. Ask yourself, what you felt when you first heard the story? Leave aside the curiosity and amazement. These emotions are to catch the audience's attention, preparing or grooming us for final delivery or assault.  In the narrative, sequence of events goes like this: Fortunate human born as prince, peaceful kingdom, happy prince, politics unfold, loses his Home, depressed prince, wander in forest, helped by unknowns, loses wife, almost broken, help a stranger, human bonding, get new friends, make a gang, attack another gang, kills opponent king, get his wife back, returns Home...Victorious, become a king.... ...Happy king and queen, politics unfold, queen loses Home, move to forest, helped by ascetics, goes through labor, delivers twins, kids grow up, confront their father, short fight, mother and kids return to claim their right, mother is humiliated again, dies, kids get their right, King is depressed and dies. First part have 'Contamination' coding sequence, followed by a slight 'Redemption' sequence. In contamination sequences, things may go from very good to bad or from barely acceptable to worse. In a redemption sequence, a demonstrably \"bad\" or emotionally negative event or circumstance leads to a demonstrably \"good\" or emotionally positive outcome. The second part is extension of initial 'Contamination' sequence. It is an emotionally intense story of suffering.  The resulting outcome in audience brain is 'Empathy' for the storyteller. Storyteller become focus of empathy from the audience.  The emotion which I felt; \"Help the Stranger\". As humans, most of the times, we go through these emotions, feeling lost, depressed and broken. The force of these emotions is very strong. It rams in to our little brain and like a rammed bus, we lose control, we lose awareness or consciousness or mindfulness. In Pali (language of Ganges and surrounding plains in 8-4th century BC), word for awareness, consciousness, mindfulness is Sati. Refer dictionary here: The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary   Situations may force us to lose our Sati. When we have lost Sati, we should help each other. This is part of human bonding. We should be open to welcoming strangers, make them friends. With a little help from friends, we can get our Sati back.  Here, it gets interesting. Words themselves tell the story. I was looking for root words, old meaning, etymology of character names used in Ramayan. Sita or Sati was easy. Same word is used in multiple narratives [Dead Sati and mad Shankara, odd couple though strong philosophy]. We still use Sati in our common language; \"Mati maari gayi thee\". Finding \"Ram\" was also not so difficult. In English, we still use \"Ram\" multiple times; ram the door, rammed in a bus, Ram the male goat. In English, it means, force, forceful, strong-head. In Arabi, \"Ram\" is used in \"Ramadan\". \"Ram\" their means \"very hot, red hot\". In Avestan, (Zorastrian scripture language) which is as much ancient as Sanskrit, it means \"peace (lit.)\" [Avestan Dictionary]. Inference of these would be, \"Ram\" denotes 'force of our strong emotions' or 'being peace with our emotions'. \"Lanka\" is generic for 'hilly place'. Refer to the usage in Buddhist stories on 7-10th century AD. One story of Lakshminkara says that the princess was married to prince of 'Lankapuri'; Chhinnamasta . Here, note that by 8th century India, locals were classified as tribal or lower caste. The class system had turned and had changed completely from 200 BC. Lakshminkara is now worshiped as 'Chamunda'; 82nd Mahasiddhi. Similarly, 'Ravan' is not meant 'man with loud voice', it meant 'soul'.  One possible interpretation can be: \"A distressed person, in emotionally charged state, killed soul when he lost his awareness. He regained it, to lose it again forever.\" Note that Indian ancient philosophies had a concept of 'Anata', 'there is no I or self'. Soul represents 'I'. There was no concept of 'soul' in Indian tradition. Soul entered in theology only around 5-7 century AD.  If you find this interesting, you can search for different variation for Ramayana, across different communities in India. One Gond community, in fact, worship 'Ravan' as their 'dharmaguru'. Omar Rashid on Ravan worship . Older version of Ramayan also didn't depict Ram as god or Ravan as Devil. Both were shown as humans stuck in difficult situations. Here, note few oddities with Ramayan. Ramayan writer was Valmiki. He was not a Brahmin by birth, however, an outcast or tribal. In some stories, he is also portrayed as a short-time robber, living in forest. Point is that the Ramayan originated outside Brahminic tradition and later absorbed in. It is quite odd that the sect known for their claim to superiority, let this oddity continue. Next odd part is that as per Indian tradition, storytelling was not Brahman's profession. Brahmans were administrators, thinkers, strategist, however, not storyteller or writer/artist. Storytelling work was considered lower class, Charak, at least till 5th century. What forced Brahman's to become storyteller, we don't know. Another odd part is Ravan was Brahman (claimed as per his father side), whereas, Ram was not. It can be interpreted as debacle of a Brahman king by an outsider!!  Great stories have life of their own. They evolve, transform, take multiple shape in the hands of skilled storytellers. Ramayan is such a great story. As a narrative, it has been used by many great storytellers to make people accept new strangers in their fold, as well as, please their sponsor. Even debating on what was original version is fruitless exercise. Here, I would refer to a similar pursuit by christian folks on existence of Jesus Christ. Das Leben Jesu'  written by David Strauss in 1846 concluded at the end,\"It doesn't matter if Jesus was real or not. It is still real though, how many lives he has impacted, how many people he has helped, how many human bridges he has made.\"  \"Ram se bada Ram ka naam\" ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they are real because of the following reasons :- 1). Many of the characters in both epics have birth date which corresponds to position of stars, Moon and the Sun in specify location in the constellation. Matter a fact, every Hindu boys and girls have similar record of birth. The Earth rotates in a large circle around the Milky way for about 26,000 years so by using mathematical calculations we can trace back the birth date of not only characters like Sri Rama and Sri Krishna, but also time frame of important events as well. 2). There are recorded lineage that leads to Sri Rama\u2019s birth and Sri krishna\u2019s birth. 52 generation before and 32 generation after Sri Rama (leading to birth of Sri Krishna) was recorded. If Ramayana and Mahabratha was merely stories told to kids, why do they need such long and detailed records of people who had no direct involvement in the story (like those who came before and after Sri Rama and Sri Krishna)? 3). Some of the events described in the Mahabratha cannot be known to people living in modern times (for the past 2,000 years) such as the disappearance of Saraswati River that last flowed before the Ice Age 10,000 years ago. 4). Some of the sites in India corresponds to the epic and can still be found today. Two of these are the Rama Setu (which was recorded to be used for ages until a freak story around 1700s) made it unpassable. And ancient city of Dwarka which lies under the ocean 20 miles off the coast of Goa. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me answer this from an Islamic perspective. As per Quran there were messengers sent to every nation on this earth approximately 124000 but by name only few are mentioned in Quran. And every messenger has brought divine message to its people but it was meant for the people at the time as the humanity was still evolving and was to be followed till the next messenger to come. India is a large nation, definitely there were messengers sent to India as well, However as the name of these prophets are not mentioned in Quran there is uncertainty to declare them as messengers of Almighty in Islam. However Indian history does indicate at least 3 of them could be messengers 1. Shri Ram 2. Shri Krishna and 3. Gautam Bhuddha. However through time there messages or guidance have lost its original form and lot of interpolation got added to these scriptures. Bhagavadgita is the message of dharma given by Shri Krishna to Arjun. If you analyse many of the passages of Bhagavadgita especially the Most important one it resonates what Islam teaches. \u201cYada Yada hidharmasya, Glanir Bhavati Bharata, Abhyudhanam Adharmasya, tadatmanam shrijamyaham, paritradaya Sadhunaam, Vinashaya chatushkritam, dharm sansthapa Narthaya sambhavani yuge yuge\u201d. In a nutshell it Briefly means whenever there is injustice, adharm in this world God will sent a Avatar ( true meaning is Rishi a saintly person or messenger of god) in every age to establish justice and wipe out the evil from the society. Sanatan Dharma which is now called Hinduism in its true form is as monotheistic as Islam. But due to ignorance many of the Metophorical messages and references in the scriptures people started giving them physical forms and started worshipping them. One of the bad practices in Hinduism like many other religions is they give literal meaning sometimes to metaphorical or spiritual passages. Like any religious scriptures even Vedas and Gita have lot of deep messages which can only be understood through context. With time many people started corrupting messages by adding Caste system, paganism, idol worship and some mythological stories which were never a part of original message given to Shri Krishna or G Bhudda. Sanatana Dharma it is also a monotheistic religion. It is mentioned in Chandogya Upanishad Ch-6 sec-2 v-1 \"God is only One, without a second.\" Here is the answer in Shvetashvatara Upanishad ch-4 v:19-20 \"He cannot be seen, neither above, not across, nor in the middle. He is beyond grasp. There is no image that is true to His form. His name is glory itself. His form is not visible. The eyes cannot see him.\" And a common Vedantist believe in the concept of 'Avatar'. And believes that Shri Ram, Shri Krishna etc. were avatars of God. But let me clear you, concept of 'Avatar' is no where in Vedas(most sacred Sanatana scriptures). So vedic scholars say that avatar doesn't mean Almighty God. As it is derived from a Sanskrit word and it means 'a man'. Also, vedas speak about saintly men and Rishis which are sent by God to guide humans. That Almighty God had sent some chosen Avatars to guide other people. The original questioned verse of Bhagavada Gita ch-4 v:7-8 also talks about the birth of Avatars. Almighty do not need to take birth. As it is mentioned further in Bhagavada Gita ch-10, v-3 \"One who knows me as birthless, beginningless and the supreme controller of all the worlds, he being undeluded among mortals is delivered from all sins.\" Finally to summarise, There is only one creator for all the Human kind. The message of Truth was given in every age and every time through prophets. The final message in totality and religion was perfected through Islam. If you read Quran with an unbiased mind and remove this misconception that it is only for Arabs or Muslims you will see that, how clear is the true message from Almighty. Take care everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "The form in which they are presented is definitely not possible. It\u2019s one thing to praise the ancient Indian scholars/poets for mentioning some things like atom in their work. Some of that can be called a hypothesis, other just a great imagination. People also believed that Paras stone existed which can convert Iron into Gold which is not scientifically possible. So its one thing to say Indians mentioned things like atom and its another to say during Mahabharata time India had knowledge of Nuclear weapons. It is mentioned in multiple verses that the warriors speak Mantras for the astra to appear. Putting just an example here. If you believe that a Mantra can create a Nuclear weapon from thin air, I don\u2019t want to argue with you. Karna Parva: Section 90  The number of warriors used is also highly debated. An Akshauhini is 218,700 warriors. And there were 18 Akshauhini warriors participating overall which means 3,936,600 warriors on both sides. If you look back at any recorded battle in pre history, no battles even crossed half a million warriors. Even Alexander the great didn\u2019t have 100,000 warriors in his side. While Kaurava army comprised of many kingdoms was a total of 2.5 million and pandavas about 1.5 million which is 25 and 15 times more than Alexander\u2019s at least. And if we consider the stories are true, this was at least 500 years earlier than Alexander if not more. No such armies existed in those times.  Then there are the issues about the age of the main characters. Bheeshma was 141 years old, Karna was 107 years old, Yudhisthira was 91 years old, while the great hero of the war Arjuna was 88 years old. His wife Subhadra had a son Abhimanyu, who was just 16 years old. This is more absurd than the characters from Indian soap opera who just refuse to die. And this is just Mahabharata. If you count Ramayana, there are Mayavi Rakshas who live in Lanka (present day Srilanka). Rama has an army of Vanaras (monkey). Ravan must be thousands of years old. Hanuman is flying in the air, and lifting mountains. Vali is fighting a man in Pig\u2019s form who is bigger in size than Godzilla. These are just a few things which are hard to believe. If anyone believes that a living being can lift a mountain, I can\u2019t argue with them. Both Ramayana and Mahabharata are excellent epics. They are in story form so the story tellers have taken artistic liberty in description. But to take the stories literally will be disbelieving everything we understand about working of the world. I accept that some parts of Ramayana and Mahabharata might have happened, or maybe the entire story is just a piece of art. But the main purpose of these epics aside from entertainment is to teach about Dharma in India. So, instead of proving its wrong, I will try to understand the things discussed by the narrators. ",

Ravana didn't exist , neither did Rama or Hanumana, but as symbolic representatives of cultures they are of course real. They are not real persons but mythic characters.

            "answer_text": "We are caught between two extreme views. Some people dismiss everything from India\u2019s past as myth. Others take all ancient texts literally. What are the Ramayana and Mahabharata supposed to be? Let me give an interesting analogy to help understand this. Let us say that we are in the year 4000 A.D., roughly 2,000 years in the future. Due to various disruptions, historical documents from the 20th century have been destroyed. You, as a historian, living in 4000 A.D. want to understand what was happening in India in the late 20th century. The only historical artefact you are able to find is the VCD of an ancient movie! Somehow, you are able to use the technology of your day and play the movie, and somehow you are able to understand the ancient language used. This movie from 2,000 years back has a tall, lanky hero, named Vijay. This honest dude suffers because of the many corrupt people that he encounters. His family undergoes a lot of trouble. Eventually, Vijay gets so angry that he fights the system. Without any support from anyone, using just his strong fists, he kills an evil policeman, a greedy businessman and a corrupt politician. Of course, he also sings some romantic songs to a heroine in the middle of the movie! As a historian living in 4000 A.D., how should you interpret this \u2018historical\u2019 evidence? Here are your options: Vijay existed exactly as portrayed. There really was such a singing superman in the 20th century who could fight all kinds of strong and evil enemies, and destroy them on his own.This is all nonsense. How can such a superman exist? How can he also sing songs? Ignore the VCD entirely as evidence. We can learn nothing from it.Don\u2019t worry whether Vijay really existed exactly as portrayed. Understand the nature of society and try to apply those lessons to today\u2019s times to make a better future. For example: Corruption can be a huge problem. The system needs to be supportive of those who wish to fight the evils of society. Only a free and democratic society would have allowed such movies to be made where the powerful were being shown as evil and were getting defeated by a common man.The fair and reasonable approach is the third one. Apply the same to the Ramayana and Mahabharata. In fact, as per Indian tradition, that is what we are supposed to do. These Epics (and many other texts) are called \u2018Smriti\u2019 texts. They are subject to change based on prevailing societal norms. The purpose of these texts is to help society for all times. Taking such texts literally doesn\u2019t do justice to the immense value in them. Ignoring them, or brushing them off, is intellectual arrogance of the small mind. ",

Same is also possibly true of Ramayana.We find Jathak kathas almost having same characters and bit a different story .Which is a evidence that Jathak kathas were improvised and clubbed with other Jataka tales. At later times both the epics were connected by inserting new chapters. So if the Jataka stories are based on reality ,one can vouch for the reality of both the epics.

            "answer_text": "Ramayana amd Mahabharata are considered a myth by many scholars and historians by criticising its supernatural structure of story telling, If that is the case, The Holy Bible (with all due respect to the holy scripture) includes mythological characters from many cultures like Noah [Gilgamesh myth from Mesopotamia], Story of the superhuman Samuel, Prophet Yona, etc. should cause similar problem to the Holy Bible . These myths are explained as symbolic charcters to show and explain God's power and love.A similar approach should be shown when considering the authenticity of ancient Indian scriptures....Many recent studies show results that are beyond logical comprehension and would be astonishingly unbelievable. Proofs for Mahabharata being a nuclear warfare is the strongest of them all, a nuclear activity similar to the Hiroshima incident was reported from what is now the Thar desert and nearby places (ancientl Cities of Indus). This single incident would be enough to remove a whole civilization (over hal ff a million people or more) forever Ramayana and Mahabharata should be read as scripture of great kingdoms with extra Masala added to make people aware of the need to consider God as their creator and to understand his love just as we see in The Bible. A means of educating people about God.The nuclear impact could have easily erased many archeological remains but the skeletons and the remains noww available clearly proves the existence of the incidents (Not the story as described) recorded in ancient books to be true.

The name means \"Glory of Rama\". It adapts the Hindu ideas to Buddhist beliefs and shows the balance of good and evil in the worldIndonesia Kakawin Ramayana is a Javanese rendering of the Ramayana. The Javanese Ramayana differs markedly from the original . The first half of this Ramayana is similar to the original Sanskrit version, while the latter half is divergent to the point of being unrecognizable. One of the many major changes is the inclusion of the all-powerful Javanese indigenous deity dhayana Guardian God of Java Semar (in Balinese literature known as Twalen) and his misshapen sons, Gareng, Petruk, and Bagong who make up the numerically significant four Punokawan or \"clown servants\"There are also versions of Ramayana in Laos, Nepal, Malaysia, Philippines Thailand and Tibet Info Source :Versions of Ramayana The story of the Ramayana is so powerful that so many retellings and interpretationsSymbolical references to the Human nature in Ramayana  (Image Source: Bing Search from Quora) There was a king Dasaratha who was terribly attached to all things worldly. He represents the blind worldly attachment . He had three queens, The eldest Kaushalya symbolises competency. The second wife is Kaikeyi, who represents Jealousy and The third wife Sumati represents Equanimity. When attachment is tinged with jealousy, results are not good Rama represents the Intellect and the divinity within usBharata represents ValuesLakshmana Represents CommitmentShatrugna represents DedicationSita represents empathyEmpathy along with intellect leads to happiness\u2026 irrespective of the environmentCommitment without intellect is of no valueDedication without Values is worthlessSo when Jealousy dominated attachment, intellect along with Commitment and Empathy was banished. Luckily we can sustain temporarily based on values and dedication   (Image Source: Bing Search from Quora) The Crisis is caused my the Many headed demon of Desires , called ravana in the ramayana. The first thing that gets kidnapped by our strong obsessive desires is empathy. So when the intellect seeks solutions, the support of Hope is needed, therein Hanuman enters the Ramayana. To locate empathy, he has to cross the ocean of pathos to get to the golden island of greed, Lanka. The multi headed desires rule the Island of greed and empathy is held hostage. Once with the help of hope, we see the faint glimpse of empathy, we are ready to cross the sea of pathos and self pity with the help of the Hope, we can go ahead and destroy desires and greed and rediscover our empathy and Humanity.  (Image Source: Bing Search from Quora) Once Divinity and empathy rule us with hope and devotion on the side, Happiness and peace prevails on the Kingdom within and it becomes Ayodhya\u2026 the unconquerable !!!  Mahabharata The Mahabharata is the longest known epic poem and is \"the longest poem ever written\". Its longest version consists of over 100,000 shloka or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), and long prose passages. About 1.8 million words in totalMahabharata is the analogical equivalent of a human being. We as a human are always fighting the war within between Good and Evil.

If we don't realise our inherent divinity the kaurava in us, the blind ambition , unfettered Ego, the selfishness will determine the will and will win. If we realiste the goodness in us and given the right direction by the intellect, we can leverage our positivity to be happy and pandavas will win. So Krishna the divinity is there in all\u2026 but will you choose him ?  Thus the Ramayana and Mahabharata are epics that have a lot of analogic symbolism understanding which will help us on our path of being a better human beings !!! ",

            "answer_text": "We don't have any unequivocal proof to assert that the epics actually happened. But these points suggest the possibility of them being a work of creative writer:1. Dwarka recently uncovered in 2001 excavations of Gulf of Khambhat, gives some  rational insight into the Mahabharata epic , as dwarka is the only evidence we have today , for whether the story is true or not.-The NIOT team found the city below 100 meters water level , which makes the city 20000 years old , considering 5mm rise in water level per year. But carbon dating of excavation dates the city circa.7500BCE .- City was beautiful in it's ambience and architectural means , as mentioned in Puranas and Mahabharata , the excavation substantiates it. But it could have been developed by Hadappans who lived in that era. A beautiful , abnormal thing always feels like divine , thus stimulates a writer's mind. Vishwkarama a divine architect-but why would God(Krishana) need him to create the city , thus making him better than God himself - highly exaggerated.-Great scholars like Aryabhat dates the story to be written in 3102BCE.-The details of stories came in Puranas , which actually came into existence after 3 century BCE. This is like modifying a story.Same thing comes with Uttar kand of Ramayana , it was never a part of original Ramayana , later excluded by Tulsidas in Ramachritmanas.Valmiki new it whole time - considered he actually received through devine knowledge - even told the story to Luve and kush , who still fought with Rama as if they didn't know , even knowing the whole story told by valmiki. 2. Ram setu or Adam' s bridge is said to have been built by Rama army.-The bridge is 3.5km(width) by 35km(length) which is  impractical to build, even unthinkable , gives total area of bridge to be 112500 sqt KM , enough to accommodate army of more than 100 million at a time . So why such a huge bridge? I am sure army could not have been that huge for any empire(Indian) .Considering the accumulation in the years doesn't justify size of the bridge.So it is just a rock , like an Atoll. I have believed in the story my whole , but unable to ao now. My sincere apology if I sound mocking the religion. I do not intend so.It's just a rational thought ",

            "answer_text": "No they are not. There is no archaeological proof that any such thing happened. Moreover these books were written between the time of the Mauryan and the Gupta empires when Puranic classical Hinduism as we know today emerged. There is no mention of Ramayana and Mahabharata during the time of the Buddha or the Mauryan empire or in the Vedas or Upanishads. Why did Buddha never speak of Rama or Krishna? Why is there no ancient Hanuman temples or mentions of Rama or Krishna during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya? Very simple because these stories had not been composed by then. These mythical books spread by word of mouth and became very popular after around 200 AD which is when the Bhagavad Gita was composed. These books are as real as the mythicals stories of the Bible or the Quran or the Illiad. Remember all religions are stupid fantasies and are complete myths. However Hinduism and Buddhism are definitely better religions than the Abrahamic faiths but that does not make the religions true. ",

            "answer_text": "This really is question which can't be answered either in affirmation or in negation. If someone answers in affirmation then that is surely a religious point of view. If in negation then reasons ought to be given to prove that. I would be dealing with Ramayan only . For me it is a story very well composed, framed and compiled by Sage Valmiki. Valmiki himself exclaimed to Ram that Ram is the male protagonist of his Rachna. Not only this but there were many instances which proves it to be a play only.The way battle happened between Rakshaksh and Vanar Sena shows it all-Ram-Lakshan in one go killed the powerful and world famous Rakchasas as if these rakshasas were useless in front of them.The way Indrajeet fought and made Ram-Lakshman near to death shows that Ram-Lakshman had option for their survival while Rakshas died as soon as they were hurt.Survival of Lakshaman for whole night by Sanjeevani Booti shows that Valmiki gave preference to his favourite side and no doubt the side having positive instinct.If Brahmastra, Vishnuastra, Shivastra could not hurt Lakshman then how far this was relevant with talent of Meghnath. \u2026 and many more.Kumbhakaran was so powerful that he could have mashed all other warriors from Ram's side but the way he left all shows that Valmiki wanted his main characters survival.Lakshan was so devoted to his brother that he even didn't sleep for 14 years just to protect his brother and sister in law while on the other hand it was Vibishan who did maximum damage to Lanka as most importantly Ravan.Helper for Sita i.e. in Ashok Vatika always gave her positive vibes and confidence just to give actress a positive feelHence, instances are many to prove yet from the point of view and being a devotee of Lord Ram, i too consider it real keeping all my other instincts on other side.Kindly ignore my rationale if it hurts someone's sentiments, its just a point of view of writer. Think on it by keeping religion aside. Thank You . \ud83d\ude4f\u2026 Jay Ram Ji.. \ud83d\ude4f",

            "answer_text": "Why one more date based on the astronomical evidence quoted from the Mahabharata? I have made this effort for the following reasons: All the previous dates by various scholars are from misunderstood quotes, incorrect translations and incorrect conversions between the Gregorian calendar and the Indian astronomical calendar. These scholars here spent a lot of effort to come up with theses dates, and must be commended. However, these dates, if they do not match with all of the original quotes, cannot be accepted.Mahabharata & Krishna have been declared as mythology by the Western Indologists from the 19th Century until now. Some Indian scholars and leaders also believe the same. Therefore, I decided to investigate further. I believe in the saying, \u201cinvestigate before castigate,\u201d and Ronald Regan\u2019s famous quote, \u201ctrust but verify.\u201dWithout relying on the stories and myths, I wanted to investigate purely on astronomical and scientific facts and phenomena like the conjunctions, eclipses, earthquakes, meteor showers and comet sightings. Since the powerful PCs with very accurate astronomical programs like Planetarium have become available, it is possible to construct the sky map of any day and time in the past and review the positions of the planets and other astronomical events. A whole new science called \u201cArchaeoastronomy\u201d has now evolved. Eclipses have become very predictable and accurate now, and are a great tool to date the past events. There may be no written or archeological evidence of the ancient past, but the sun, moon and stars are still the same and move per the same natural rules. Therefore, I decided to research the past astronomical phenomena and verify if the epic is history or fiction.Mahabharata is the closest epic to our time and is replete with many references to the astronomical phenomena. Krishna\u2019s Bhagvat Gita is the most unique philosophical gem; but it would be interesting to see if it came from a real person and time.My research took me about 2 years of continuous study of the original critical Sanskrit Mahabharata (published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Studies Institute in Pune after 60 years of research).I used 4-5 different computer programs to compare the accuracy before I finalized on the latest Cyber Sky Planetarium program based on JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) ephemeris 404, with an accuracy of \u00bd to 1 arc seconds for the periods 3000 BCE and older, and the Delta T value of less than 23 hours.The full results of my research will be published in a forthcoming book entitled Astronomical Proof of the Mahabharata War and Sri Krishna. The book will include the original Shlokas (stanzas) with translation, detailed computer maps of each event, and its Panchang (Indian astronomical ephemeris) positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and comets.This current article is a summary of the salient features in the book. I wish to take the readers on the same journey I took while researching.The first item of the task was to find the century of the Mahabharata War. The Mahabharata epic is full of the time references right up to the war that Dwapar Yuga (the 3rd part of the 4 Yuga system) is ongoing and the Kaliyuga (the 4th part) would be coming soon. The Surya Sidhanta, a very ancient treatise on the Indian astronomy, mentions that when a new Yuga starts, all 7 planets will line up along the ecliptic (the Earth\u2019s annual path) in the constellation Pisces, just before Aries on a Phalguni Amavasya day (the last day of the year).There could be a solar eclipse on that day. The Prajapati Smriti and the Matsya Puran provides the same prediction. Western translators of these scriptures doubted this; because it does not make sense that so many planets moving in their own orbits millions of miles apart at high speeds, can line up in one sign on the ecliptic line on a specific day and time.The Gregorian calendar date for this event is February 18, 3102 BCE at 2:27:30 AM. Anybody with a good astronomy software can verify that this event if did indeed occur. Now, the eastern as well as the western astronomers have all accepted this date for the start of the Kaliyuga. A map on the last page will verify this. It does not show the North Node (Rahu), but both Rahu and Ketu (the south node) were in the same line 180 degrees apart.This event has not happened for thousands of years before or thereafter. The closest recorded grand conjunction recorded, was in China in 1953 BCE, of 5 planets. With the establishment of the accepted Kaliyuga start date, the dates for Mahabharata War which were after 3102 BCE, are not applicable.These include Professor N. Achar (3067 BCE), Dr. Balkrishna (2559 BCE), Dr. K.S Raghvan and Dr. Iyengar (3067 BCE), R. Vaidya (2789 BCE). Only scholars Dr. P.V. Vartak (5561 BCE) and Dr. P.V. Holay (3143 BCE) had dates earlier. Out of the two, Dr. Vartak\u2019s date is almost 2500 years earlier and so may not be acceptable. Now, shlokas (stanzas) in the Vishnu Puran, 38th chapter (5.38.8), Bhagvat Puran (1.18.6) and Brahma Puran (212.8), all state that the Kaliyuga started the moment Sri Krishna died.In Mahabharata Stri Parva, Queen Gandhari, mother of Kauravas had cursed Sri Krishna that in spite of being cable to prevent it, he watched the terrible slaughter of all of her sons and relatives, Therefore, Krishna would die in similar circumstances with his kith and kin, alone, wandering in a deserted place from a very frivolous weapon in 36 years.The Kaliyuga start date of 2-18-3102 BCE did also have a solar eclipse and a back to back lunar eclipse in two weeks similar to the Mahabharata War. There were earthquakes with meteor showers on both dates, and on the lunar eclipse day, a giant tsunami drowned the Dwarka city, which Krishna had advised to vacate.With Krishna\u2019s death also established now on 2-18-3102 BCE, his birth dates by scholars Dr. Vartak (5626 BCE), n. Achar, Sampath Ayengar and Sheshgiri (3112 BCE), are no more applicable.Now we will proceed to place the Mahabharata War start\u2019s month and day. Again, as written in Mahabharata, Bhishma, the grandfather of both the Kauravas and Pandavas, passed away on a winter solstice day at midnight, when the moon was in Rohini (Alderberan) star.Bhishma declares that it has been 68 nights since the war started, and 58 nights, since he was lying on the bed of arrows. As the Sun has turned to go north, he is ready to die. The winter solstice was on January 14 in that time period. The day was Magh month (bright half, eight\u2019th day per the Indian calendar).Counting backwards, 7 nights of Magh month, plus 30 days of Pousha month plus 30 days of Margashirsha month, the 68 night and the war start day would be the Kartik month Amavasya (new moon day).This would be on November 6th.It is well known from the Mahabharata quote in which Krishna gives the message to Karna, that the month of Margashirsha was very suitable and so the war should start on a Shakra Amavasya day (the day when the moon would be in Indra\u2019s star of either Vishakha or Jyeshtha). The night before the war, Sage Vyas, who made several astronomical observations, mentions that he has seen the Lunation periods 14, 15, 16 days apart but never 13 days apart (tithis to be exact.A day is not a tithi, since a tithi is based on the lunar phase at the sunrise and when the difference between the Sun and the Moon is 12 degrees). He also mentions it to be an Amavasya with an unseen solar eclipse, followed by a lunar eclipse in 13 tithis.Like all scholars, I also took 36 years per the Gandhari\u2019s curse, added to 3102 BCE to find the eclipses around November, from the program, \u201cLunar Phases and Eclipses\u201d. However, there were no back to back November eclipses found in years from 3102 to 3140.The only year which met all the eclipses criteria was year 3126 BCE, when there was Amavasya on 5th and 6th November (Amavasya and solar eclipse started at 8:37 PM on 5th) and the following full moon in 13 tithis (not days) on November 19-20, both days. The earlier lunation also had occurred 13 tithis before on October 21-22 (Kartik Purnima).Since all these events matched except the 36th year, I revisited the original verse, and found out that there were two different letters used in the Sanskrit word for 36th. One which all scholars had accepted was \u201cshati trimshe\u201d (in the 36th year). But the Bhandarker critical edition gave the word \u201cshati trymshe,\u201d meaning in the part of 36 years. (When people write down words recited by rote memory for generations such mistakes are normal). So the curse did have finite circumstances but not the finite time. Thus our war start date of November 6th, 3126 BCE matched of all the quotes and criteria. In those days, large number of years was grouped as Tapas or 12 years. 36 years represented the maximum 3 Tapas time, which actually happened in 2 Tapas or 24 years or 2/3rd part of 36 years.theI proceeded further to check the dates of all associated events for a match with computer generated sky maps, planet by planet. They all did match including two surprise observations about Neptune and Uranus! There would be more interesting information about the Rohini Shakat Bheda (piercing the star Alderberan Cart) by Saturn, which is indicative of terrible manslaughter.I will present the summary of this information in the next article to follow. I will provide more information about why the western scholars, as well as Indian scholars, missed these dates and how Archaeoastronomy in this computer age, works (when the times are converted properly).Kaliyuga map with alignment of 7 planets along Earth\u2019s ecliptic (the Earth\u2019s annual path) in the constellation Pisces This article is not my creation.

            "answer_text": "No Of-course not. Anybody says otherwise is either mistaken or simply being ignorant.  Now, I am not saying there is no truth to Ramayana or Mahabharata. There is obviously a kernel of truth to things from where the stories started. There might have been a King at one point who was well respected by his subjects and ruled fairly. He became an inspiration for Ram. Similarly there might have been a family feud that inspired Mahabharata. But, there is just no way, ABSOLUTELY NO WAY, for these stores to be true. They are folklore and that\u2019s all they are. There are no Gods, there are no flying men, no monkey men and most certainly no talking birds. And also, they CANNOT be true, because there are just too many versions of each story that most of them contradict each other. The stories of Ramayana, I grew up listening is really different from the version of the cartoon Ramayan that came later. And similar for Mahabharata. The stories are absolutely amazing. There is no doubt about that. A lot of effort has been put into creating these stories, but that\u2019s all they are .. STORIES. Nothing more. Believing these stories are real is just silly and plain wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me start in this way, We are living in an era in which everything has to be correct on the basis of our logics . If something is not fitting into our small window of logics(which varies person to person by the way) we say it's myth or incorrect. So if everything (which does not fit into our logic) is myth , what would you say about Magic ? I remember a story when in 1913, Srinivasa Ramanujan, a 23-year old shipping clerk from Madras, India, wrote to Hardy (and other academics at Cambridge), claiming, among other things, to have devised a formula that calculated the number of primes up to a hundred million with generally no error. The self-taught and obsessive Ramanujan had managed to prove all of Riemann\u2019s results and more with almost no knowledge of developments in the Western world and no formal tuition. He claimed that most of his ideas came to him in dreams. Now in this also if I put my logic to explain the last line that the ideas came to Ramanujan in dream, I won't be able to expain it. Does it mean that it was a myth ? No!! The content of one Ramayana may be different from the other but the existence of Ram, Sita and Ravan is consistent. That's the truth. I might not know anything about my great great grandfather but I can't deny his existence for lack of evidence or how else would I be here? Similarly Rama's existence need not be proved by historical procedure. What benefit are you going to get if you deny the existence of Rama? Why do you want to try to prove he is not there? Therefore our epics and itihasas including Ramayana and Mahabharata should be treated as historical sources. ",

            "answer_text": "By Answering this question, I really don\u2019t want to hurt anyone sentiments and their believes. But if we check the facts of evolution of human race and places where people claimed the part of Ramayana you can also claim the same. So starting with my first statement would be that back then \u201cPEOPLE WERE REALLY INTELLIGENT\u201d. I said these because it was true. Now coming to fact check- Homo Sapiens- if we check the human evolution history then human sapiens were evolved 35000 years ago in AFRICA and after that 20000 years ago they started shifting to different place. And the first place they formed after Africa was Europe..Not even Asia and also not even India. nnNow according to people, Ramayan is not that old which means it was not even possible to wear good clothes back then to cover their body as they used to wear animal skin. 2. India Discovery- this is just an one line answer which states that \u201cInida was discovered in 1498 common era and Ramayana took place in 5th BCE\u201d LIKE HOW????? 3. SO Called Indian Caste System- so the literature was bought to India By Aryans and Ramayana is way older than that so how someone can write book if they don\u2019t even know how to know write. if we dig up more then we can conclude that Ramayana era people belongs to tribal community was basically cave men not who can walk miles to fight. 4.Ram Setu- so this is most common evidence of the Ramayana and its a proved by NASA that the stones found between India and Lanka are much older then the sand on them which is not scientifically possible. so I personally belief is that bridge was formed by nature only when India and Lanka was spitted. There are other points also but there is no need to argue more as according to me they wrote Ramayana just to save humanity in human. As in Ramayana they depict Rama as \u201cMaryadha Purshottam\u201d which means he was man who only belongs to one woman and should not look to other woman except his own wife. So basically they just want to depict these kind of morals through the fiction book! ",

Having said that,with full conviction I say that as a rational thinker one should not take much pain in researching the existence ,instead enjoy and experience its benefits. It is not necessary to search or discover the origin of a river,instead if we spend our time and energy in harnessing the benefits, mankind will be benefited.Both the epics are treasures of the world which are unparalleled and which offers us lessons for every situation in life.Let us assume that it is a myth or even fiction,but one must realize that it is not so easy to produce such masterpieces with so much of finesse and perfection. The idea of searching the origin is fine but in my opinion it is wise to devote the same time in understanding the nuances and lessons what it teaches to us.Moreover, I can strongly say that it is impossible to understand or master these to epics as it can be interpreted in several ways.That is the reasons why there are several versions and why many great scholars like Shankaracharya,Madhwacharya have presented their views which are not identical. The greatness of Indians is that they were pioneers in research but with a different attitude. Yes,Indians had the habit of surrendering first and searching later. Many of today's generation have a perception that our ancestors were just blind believers in God and Idols but it is a totally wrong and insane one.Our great ancestors appeared to be \u201cBlind Believers\u201d but in reality they were great researchers who were seeking answers for the most toughest questions which modern science is now struggling to solve.Unfortunately India is perhaps the only country in the world which fail to give value and importance to its own achievements which are truly unique.

            "answer_text": "Let's start with History word. Originated in Greece it was an English translation of \u201cItihas\u201d (\u0907\u0924\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0938); which means meant to be or bound to happen. It was always the same as happened in Greek and Indian mythology. Some points: Devas vs Acura and Celtic vs Fomorian In Hindu mythology, the constant fight is between good and evil - the good represented by the devas (the gods) and the evil represented by the asuras (the demons). The asuras are the chief tormentors of the devas.  Similarly, Greek mythology is all about the Celtic gods of life and light, who wage a constant struggle against the Fomorians, ancient gods of death and darkness. In the Greek myth of the Titanomachy, the Olympian gods defeat the Titans, an older and more primitive divine race, to establish cosmic order. The Gods of Mount Olympus represents good while their antitheses are the Titans, representing evi. Rishi Kashyap and Kronos An interesting fact is that in both these mythologies, both good and evil are fathered by the same person. In Hinduism, the Devas and the Asuras are both supposed to have been fathered by Rishi Kashyap.  Krishna, Kanss and Kronos, Zeus In Hindu mythology, King Kanss of Mathura is foretold that the eighth son of his sister Devaki will kill him, hearing which, King Kanss not only imprisons both Devaki and her husband Vasudeva, he also goes about systematically killing all new babies born to his sister, till the eighth - Bhagwan Krishna - is born. Devaki and Vasudeva help each the baby to safety. A grown-up Krishna comes back to kill his uncle Kanss .  In similar fashion, Kronos becomes aware of a prophecy that he will be overthrown by one of his children. In order to avert this fate, he begins to swallow each one of his children as soon as they are born. When the sixth child Zeus is born, Rhea (Kronos' wife) devises a plan to save the baby with the help of Kronos' mother Gaia. Rhea secretly gives birth to Zeus and arranges for him to be brought up in exile. Later, a grown-up Zeus comes back to take care of Kronos. There are numerous examples, but how come all this has so much similarities. If you believe in History then you should believe in it too. But it is easier to discard it as Mythology.  Fact vs Fiction. Fact - Universal Truth and Fiction - literature in the form of prose, especially novels, that describes imaginary events and people. In between comes Mythology. Myth is a believe, a widely held but false belief, but it is someone's Truth. So the cycle is FACT>>MYTH>>FICTION. Maybe it's not your truth, but it was someone's. This doesn't means it never happened but in due course of time it was forgotten but not lost. Maybe a 1000 year later people might call it Fiction and put it in the same shelf as Game of Throne. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is based on the books that I have read on ancient history and mythology. Every author writing a book on this domain do touch upon this subject. And all of them concur broadly that Ramayana and Mahabharata are folk tales from ancient India. The stories of family dispute over property (Mahabharata) and the righteousness of a perfect leader of a tribe (Ramayana) were narrated by traveling bards across the different parts of northern India. These oral tales were retold and spread widely by many people. Each of them added new elements and exaggerated some based on their own fantasy. The dates and places will be still relevant as these stories were created here only. Even the most recent Ramayana by Devdutt Pattnaik looks at the epic from a more analytical lens and we are still adding more interpretations of the story. Now people are also impressed by the fact that these mythologies also contained some futuristic elements of science. We had flying chariot (aeroplanes), Sanjay witnessing the war from far away in the palace (television) and even lord Ganesha\u2019s head replacement was mentioned in one of the Puranas (surgery). But people from ancient India were pioneers in science and medicine. Aryabhatta laid foundations of maths/astronomy and Sushruta is considered to be the father of surgery. So it is quite likely that if you go back few centuries even further than these scientists then traces of these elements can exist in the imaginations of people and be a part of their stories. Having said that, the goal of mythology is to guide people on how to lead a good life. Doesn\u2019t matter whether its real or fiction; we can always find learnings from these epics on how to be a better human being. ",

            "answer_text": "To be frank what I believe that these are stories written by our ancients monks in order to make the human life smoother. These stories tell us about what actually the Dharma is? As it was written by the ancient monks and as we know that they used more than 60% of their brain, so it\u2019s not at all surprising that their story telling still remains unbeatable in terms of popular epics ever since they are written. For example if a general human being like GRR Martin can write a story involving six kingdoms i.e Game Of Thrones with co-relating the stories of each major characters then think about our ancient rishis and sages. May be 1000 years later these stories would be treated as real or authentic. And if let\u2019s assume that these are real incidents then what about other countries. In every country there exists these types of mythological epics. In Greece, they have their own stories and in Egypt, they have their traditional folks. For example Saptarshi Mandala, these Seven Rishis are the great seers, caretakers, mind born sons of Bramha. In a similar way, in Greek version, Greeks too had seven wise men namely Cleobulos, Periandros, Bias, Pittacos, Chilon, Solon. Now how is it possible? Whose stories are real. It only shows that mythologies around the globe do have parallel connections. In India there are more than 500 versions of Ramayana exists and the original version (written by Balmiki) exists no where. We don\u2019t have any proof regarding Maharshi Vyas rachit Mahabharat or Balmiki written Ramayana. Now it\u2019s up to you, what do you think. If I can provide 50 examples on why these things are not real then someone more clever than me would come and give 100 reasons to prove it as real. This is an ever lasting debate and it will take another hundred years for researchers to prove it. ",

            "answer_text": "It comes down to a question of belief doesn't it. If you just believe it on the face of it, then there's no issue, but the events described in the epics took place more than 5000 years ago, what proof would satisfy you? In today's age of photoshop and cynicism when everything is doubted, even if there was proof it'd be hard to accept.  For eg. people have all sorts of issues regarding Jesus Christ,  about his existence, his powers, his death and so on, and that was 2000 years ago. So it comes down to a question of belief. Forget Jesus Christ, people have conflicting accounts of Subhas Chandra Bose's death, and M.K. Gandhi's influence on our freedom struggle. Again, basically a question of what you believe.  Personally speaking, I believe it to be true, because in that case, I have a whole host of incredible human beings to look up to and use as role models. If I treat it as literature only, then it's just the imagination of someone, so it doesn't quite have the same effect. ",

Logically speaking,  similar sort of events would have happened in some era and a glorified version of it would have been scripted, i do not believe in the fantasies or inexplicable prowess that the authors bestow on the heroes of the epic but hey 100 years back who would have though that man can fly  or a robot can function as a man, things like artificial intelligence were absolutely unknowns terms to humanity so try to imagine of a civilization much more technically developed than us, imagine Dronacharya as a top nuclear scientist, Krishna as a master of disguise, Bheema as a top wrestler etc.  so it is possible that these events actually took place may be not exactly the same way but in a similar manner.

            "answer_text": "Let me answer from a literature standpoint. These epics were NOT written with a historical perspective. The writing style is not such. For  example, Ramayana starts with a build-up for Rama as someone who is  ever virtuous, following dharma, and so on. This is a plot device.In Mahabharata war, Bheema throws some 200 conches at once and Arjuna fires some 1000 arrows at once. These are plain exaggerations. We can reasonably call these works historical fiction, like Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, or Julius Caesar: Based on some true events but exaggerated with poetic liberties.  This  is not a fringe opinion, it's very much mainstream. It seems even  authors back in time looked at them NOT as historical manuscripts, but  as poetry. One such literary evidence is that future adaptations  (I don't want to call them translations) of these epics in other  languages like Andhra Mahabharatam (Telugu), Molla Ramayanam (Telugu),  etc., changed certain events in the story, added new events and removed  certain existing ones for character development, drama, and as per  poets' ideological point of view. Authors/poets don't do this when they think the work is supposed to be a historical document and that they are translating it.  If  someone writes one's own creative version of Indian freedom struggle,  for eg., something like \"Salt rained from the heavens after Gandhi  finished his march to Dandi with a deep desire to liberate India from  oppression and guide towards independence\", that would be an exaggerated  poetic description of the Salt satyagraha, not a historical one.

            "answer_text": "Shortest Answers: First-off both Ramayana and Mahabharata are not stories, they are itihasa, or history!!. They are both true, as much true as the existence of Sun, Moon, and Earth. The veracity of Ramayana and Mahabharata is as true as one's great-grandparents, which most have not seen, but still true. Long Answer follows, if you have time and are interested!!! According to Merriam-Websters the meanings of the following words are ideal: of, relating to, or embodying an ideal: conforming exactly to an ideal, law, or standard : role-model: a person whose behavior in a particular role is imitated by others purusha: an individual soul of an infinite number of like, discrete, and eternal souls law: a binding custom or practice of a community: a rule of conduct or action prescribed belief: a state or habit of mind in which trust or confidence is placed in some person or thing With the above definitions of words from the popular Merriam-Websters dictionary, we can start the discussions and try to answer the question. What is the main difference between humans and the rest of the animals? To the best of my knowledge, humans have the largest brain to body mass ratio and can think, remember. Apart from that, they have thumbs, that allows them to build tools etc. This is the biology, geography lesson, quite boring to many and not really relevant to the present discussion as one may point out. Not quite, it is the fundamental reason for all the discussions. On a side-note, does any animal, bird tree etc., really care and think why they are born, what their life goal is and what will happen after death. Such questions or thought does not arise because, well, they are animals!! Why do humans have such questions, why do we feel pain when we see someone dear to us demise, we feel sorrow, we feel pain. All this has to do with the mind. As we can see, the human brain and its capacity has actually made the human race the most dominating ones and we (humans) are ruling the world. Not animals, insects or trees, though they outnumber all the humans in leaps and bounds. In jest, if we had a democratic system, that included ants, spiders, rats, monkeys etc., along with humans, whom do you think will govern us. It will the insects as they are numerically the most populous!! Most of us already know how animals live and die. For example, the routine of a typical animal is to wake up when the sun rises in the locality (no access to clocks or smartwatches to keep an alarm!!), straight-off go to search for food (no washing or personal hygiene necessities), drink water, rest, and start settling for the day when the sun goes down, sleep and repeat the same when the sun rises. Procreate (in the mating season), raise their young, teach them how to search for food (hunt in case of predators) and be safe. Life goes on. No television, no internet, no smartphones, no twitter, no WhatsApp. Pretty mundane and boring actually. Many a time, humans who do not do much or having a very low IQ are termed dwipada-pashu (a bipedal-animal) in a derogatory sense. The root cause of all inventions, discoveries, enjoyments is the human mind. Even Charles Darwin and his followers Darwinians have been trying to understand how the human race developed such a superior intellect. History channels\u2019 \u201cancient aliens\u201d tries and fails by a long-shot telling that humans were hybrid offsprings of primates and extraterrestrial aliens (sometimes the \u201cancient aliens\u201d show depict Hindu Gods as extraterrestrial aliens as an oversimplification). We are not here to criticize any television show, but here to understand the veracity of Ramayana and Mahabharatha. There are always mutations and deviations in the society of animals or even humans for that matter. For example, if we assume that the entire human race to follow the statistical normal (Gaussian) distribution, we can easily find out what is the mean, mode and standard deviations of the entire human race. Once there is a standard deviation, we can pretty much see there are some amongst us, who are not normal (near the mean), yet we accept such aberrations, as they are within the statistically acceptable deviation (standard deviation). However, small this deviant population is, they can wreak havoc to the society by their devious acts. This is where we need Rules, Regulations, Law and Law-enforcement. Any religion, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and others, have the notion of one-god (monotheism) or pantheon of Gods (polytheism). Only the above are listed as they are the ones popularly followed in the India sub-continent. Hindus being the numerically the largest in our country, we restrict our attention to Hinduism in the further discussion. As mentioned earlier, whenever an individual becomes deviant and performs devious acts against other individuals or the public at large, what is the remedy or who should punish the deviant and end the menace? Even before accusing and punishing, we should have a clear definition of what is normal, socially accepted and what is not. What is the definition of deviant and what are the punishments. Here comes the word \u201cbelief\u201d handy. Nobody including many eminent scientists and researchers can clearly tell us why the earth was formed and why we have human life only on earth!! This is a Noble prize winning research problem. Advanced countries are pouring in billions of dollars into researching these questions. Till humankind finds an answer, let us live peacefully in a civilized manner without harming each other in the lawful state. That is the reason for belief, that there is an omnipotent force, that created this entire universe, including earth, all forms both living and nonliving things on this planet. What do you want to name him, GOD, of course? Why is GOD a male, asks our women, is it misogynist or chauvinism. Neither, do not forget the meaning of \u201cbelief\u201d, it is a belief and that\u2019s it. Without belief, there is no GOD, no religion, no law and order, no civility and civilized living. We believe, \u201cPurusha\u201d created three gunas together and is believed they coexist at all times from the beginning to eternity. These Gunas are \u201cSatvika\u201d,\u201cRajasa\u201d and\u201cTamasa\u201d.Embodiment of the above three are \u201cChaturanana- Brahma\u201d (satvika),\u201cMadhu\u201d (rajasa) and\u201cKaitaba\u201d (tamasa).Madhu-Kaitaba duo did not want to obey the rules and ways directed by Purusha, and hence, were appropriately punished by the Hayagreeva form of the Purusha. Well, this is a catch 22, did Hayagreeva really exist? Is Purusha really there, is there a place called Vaikunta, is there a Chaturanana-Brahma!! these questions are endless. Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavata, Vedas, Upanishads etc., all have the root here in the Hayagreeva avatara of the Purusha. After slaying the Madhu-Kaitaba duo, Hayagreeva bestows the power of creation to Chaturanana and initiated him with the \u201cChatushloki-Bhagavata\u201d. Then it is accepted that Chaturanana did penance for a duration of Brahma\u2019s 50 years (prathama-para-ardha). We are all in dwitiya-para-ardha now (if you really understand what we recite every day during bathing and praying). After the great penance, Brahma started the creation or shrusti-karya according to the principles directed by the Purusha. Life goes on \u2026 end of story!! Well if it were that simple, we did not need many explanations at all. As noted earlier, it is the will of the GOD that three gunas coexist all the time, namely, satvika, rajasa and tamasa. Conflict between the three exists all the time and according to the belief, only satvika guna wins and reaches Vaikunta or Moksha, while Tamasa will always lose and reach Tamas (or hell). Rajasa in the middle, is ambivalent and keeps trying both satvika and tamsika activities and keep going on in the rebirth cycle endlessly, until the end of Brahma-Kalpa. What is all this relevant to the question regarding the veracity of Ramayana and Mahabharata?? The relevance is very simple. If we one some of us had derived E=mc^2, before 18 March 1879 (Birth of Albert Einstein) we would have been the persons of the millineum!! Many of us, inculding myself, do not completely understand the general relativity theory and do not quite well know how to use it in day-to-day engineering calculations and design. When we are unable to understand a human invention and derivation, how is it possible to completely understand the \u201cChatushloki-Bhagavata\u201d narrated by Hayagreeva to Chaturanana at the beginning of the First-Chaturana\u2019s birth (maybe gazillion or at best infinite number of years ago). As mere mortals with lack of understanding and very small attention span, we need more explanations, analogies, descriptions and a lot of practice and very high intelligence-quotient to digest the Chatushloki-Bhagavata. In order to elaborate and explain his ideas, Purusha himself incarnated many times over, took up ideal forms and became a role-model and exacted the laws and rules that he once prescribed, which many have forgotten and/or are not followed. Purusha is also the executor and in order to uphold the law he takes up incarnations from time to time and upholds the law and protects the satvikas. This style of management is called \u201cmanagement by exceptions\u201d, which is in contrast to \u201cmicromanagement\u201d. God does not do micromanagement, but only management by exceptions. That is what I believe is the meaning of \u201cyada yadahi dharmasya\u2026\u201d in Bhagavadgita. If and when you recite Purusha-sukta we believe the existence of the Purusha (see the Merriam-Websters meaning at the beginning of the answer). Then his incarnations, his statements are all true. and hence the occurrence of Ramayana and Mahabharata. As Puranadara-dasa in one of his kirtanas says \u201cYama-nelli kana-nendu hela-beda, Yamane Shree-Ramanu Sandeha beda\u2026\u201d which literally means, do not question where the Lord of death (Yama) is, he is undoubtedly none other Shree-Rama himself. If you believe in Purusha, he is Shree-Rama, if you disbelieve him, he is Yama, as seen: Prahlada-Hiranyakashipu,Vibhishana-Ravana,Sugreeva-Vali etc.,",

If you meant are they historical records of actual events, well\u2026 let me put it this way\u2026 they are as real as the 10 commandments that God dictated to Moses on the mountaintop. The belief that people share in the principles that are given are real though, and much needed in today\u2019s world IMHO. Let\u2019s take the good lessons and thoughts from them and learn through them just as AESOP\u2019s fables taught us many a thing when we were children. ",

The stories definitely seem to geographically situated in India and the surrounding lands but is that enough evidence?Maybe the Gods (if they exist) did descend on earth to teach us. Maybe they were just real people raised to the stature of Gods by those who spoke of their tales. But is that the most important thing?What I think is more important is the 'bhaav' - the crux of the stories. The whole thing is like a wrapped candy. The story is just the embellishment - the shiny wrapper. What's more important is the candy inside - the principle, the idea that needs to be understood. In short - people have been arguing both ways on this issue. I personally don't know and don't care either. I would rather be interested in what message the story tries to convey. ",

            "answer_text": "Well that's a tricky one . I'll make it clear that neither am I a historian nor an archaeologist who has proofs or something called written documents but a mere child who has just completed intercalation . however I'll try to be as precise as I can be. When we have to decide authenticity of a particular document we need to look at piece of other contemporary works . so that we can decide something. The texts suggest their creation time to be in treta and dwapar respectively for ramayan and Mahabharata. According to this dating of Hindu tradition we assume that treta was 1296000 years long and dwapar 869000 years long. And kaliyug has had around 5000 years . well that's a long time to interpret the time so let's overlook that.since at that period of time the source of modern history , romans were not born. Majority of history comes from there description. Even if the dates are true as per Hinduism , we cannot have Aa intelligent as modern people to record something . further earth's erosional activity is always at work. On western shores of India , we find relics of a submegerd city named dwarika . some stone Seels have a particular shot of design depicting three headed antelope and this was to be carried by people of dwarka ( not the antelope) as suggested by harivansh pu. Source : YouTube >dharma view>scientific explanation of vedic life. There are also lot of cities mentioned in both epics true. Historians claim that there was a personality named Krishna around 5000 years ago . so most likely characters of Mahabharata were also in existence. On southern shore of India , athere is LA gaest man made bridge connecting India and Lanka . this bridge is ram setu considered to be constructed by Ram himself . scientists believe it to be an engineering marvel. This structure has an important place in ramayan. So archaeological evidences of structures named in both scriptures do exist but historians still have to figure about the authenticity of events. Hope that works . Nama ska am ",

            "answer_text": "For both the epics there are more then enough evidence.  The question of weather was never asked till 200 years ago, when invaders started  distort our history.  For Ramayana, the monumental proof is Sri Rama setu. Second proof, is all the places which are mentioned in Ramayana are tracable and they still exist. Third ISRO has developed a method to fixate and find a date in past, if you have provide planetary positions, as we do in kundali. In the epic Ramayana, all the important dates are mentioned in the form of titi and other hindu terminologies. When these dates mentioned in Ramayana are fed into the software to figure out weather a date in history existed or not, they have come up with clear evidence that they did exist. Fourth, a person Named Ramavatar sharma, from India  has traced the path followed by Sri Ram Ayodha till Lanka, which was mentioned Valmiki Ramayana. Along with that he has collected and published all relevant proofs and data to support his journey in book. Similarly, a foreign author and reports named Johana blank, did the same and published his findings in his named- `the arrow of the blue skinned god'. In valmiki Ramayana, many local Fruits, plants, flora and funna has been mentioned, where ever Sri Ram has traveled. A group of Indian scientists have did research  followed the path,and found that those plant and fruits exists till date. Like this there are numerous proofs.  For Mahabharatha, there is nothing much to say if you have read all the 18 volumes.  I know it will be a heavy read but it would be best think to read for a long holiday and these books them self provide many evidence themselves. If you a concise version, then you have to read the book named 'When did the mahabharatha war happen?'  by Nilesh Nilkanth oak. ",

If time itself didnt exist before the big bang what the hell caused the cosmic egg to explode, then? To me, the big bang theory sounds more made up than Mahabharata itself.  1. Where is the cosmic egg? Have you seen it? oh I forgot, it exploded.  2. You were there to see the explosion then? Oh I forgot humans werent born yet. 3. Did you see the after effects atleast?  All I see is that you are looking at the current state of the universe and guessing what might have happened. Until such time as I get a satisfactory answer, I will blindly believe in a god and in Mahabharata.  To me, the very fact that we were born on planet earth, which is just the right distance from the sun, which has an atmosphere with just the right chemical composition, which has the right conditions to support intelligent life is plenty evidence of intelligent design, aka. god. To top this off, I have experienced events in my life which definitely cannot be attributed to luck or chance, so please keep your snide comments to yourself. ",

We see so many super heroes like Marvel's Superman, Spiderman, AntMan, etc but do we worship them?? No, but we worship Lord Rama and Lord Krishna. Why u celebrate Diwali or Holi?? If it's just a myth. There is no festival we celebrate without the name of God yet we say God doesn't exist. Stop asking such foolish questions on Quora, ofcourse these things happened and that's why it's written thousands of years ago. Even Science and Researchers r getting clues and prooves that such things actually happened but not may b exactly stated in Ramayana or Mahabharata. Read Shiv Purana and Bhavishya Purana, u will get the answers, everything is mentioned there clearly. Don't listen to Internet Addicts who only dwells on internet for solutions to everything. Internet will not going to tell u the reality but create confusion in ur mind but it's not myths for sure. Thanks ",

On the other side , if this is piece of fiction \u2026no matter if it is written by Vyasa alone or it evolved over a period of 1000s. Then what is important to notice is , what made human mind or collective mind to reflect on such possibility of life , events and characters which eventually manifest in the form that we all consume now. Doesn't it tell something about life itself ? doesn't it become mechanism to imagine what was life 1000s of years and hence what it would after 1000s of years from now ? The epic triggers imagination and provokes questions like these , this is the reason I believe they are surviving for 1000s of years and finding expression in all modern art forms. What I have given is very simplified perspective , but when compared to depth , complexity and beauty of these epics \u2026question of if these are fiction or history becomes insignificant. We have to move beyond these rudimentary dimensions. ",

            "answer_text": "It is said that \"Beauty Lies in the Eyes of the Beholder\". There are many answers by many different viewpoints (not by different people but by different viewpoints). The Classics : Do you know what makes a Classic different from a run-of-the-mill book?As you grow,the book grows with you. When you read it as a child it has a different meaning, as a teenager another, as middle-aged yet another, as an old person even more so.It takes on a broader and deeper meaning into life itself (of your life and others around you). Evolution : How is this possible? The words in the book are not changing they remain the same. What is changing is You. Your viewpoint is expanding with experience. Things that confuse you, anger you, cause all kinds of problems in your life. The wish for a pleasant life, the ability to deal with all the problems with ease. The What, How and Why of your life. To see beyond the obvious, the invisible ever-changing forces underlying an ever expanding circle. Of course there are many people who do not evolve much nor seek out much more than just survival. But that is because survival is the biggest problem they are striving against. As they overcome more and more obstacles, their wishes and consequent obstacles increase. Whom do they turn to for advice? Who has the equanimity to advice them when everything else has failed? Who has the experience and the wisdom to look beyond the confusion? Words, Context and Meaning: They say there are at least 3 messages in the Vedas etc.1) The literal meaning of the words (for people who don't want more)2) A deeper meaning of symbols (for people wanting to know more on Life)3) Deepest meaning of energy (for people wanting to know more about the Universe, their life and how it's all inextricably connected) These epics are described as 'Itihaas' loosely translated as 'So-It-Was'. So whatever the viewpoints of the \"modern\" reader or serial-viewer, the ancient authors themselves are clear about where they stand. Not Just Classic Literature : Ramayana and MahaBharata are Not Just Classic books, they are the classics of man's journey of spiritual evolution into something finer and subtler. What happens on the journey is supposed to cause a small cascade of changes of viewpoint that snowballs into the ultimate transformation. They are a means for all 3 types of people to get the message of the Vedas in an expanded and elaborated form. \"Seek and you will find\". Just be carefully aware of WHAT (and WHY) it is that you are seeking, because you'll find it.  Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev answers the question :  ",

Paved steps,pottery,weapons,ornaments,planned streets were found underwater by Indian Archeology dept. Near Present day Kurukshetra during a dig full planned city has been found which dated back to harappan era!Ram Setu can be man made or can be natural but our ancestors knew about it 5000 years ago! so according to me yes these great battles must have happened but it was so old we dont have proofs! To add to this point first documented Humans first appeared 60,000 years ago but documentation of humanity just started about 6000 years ago,So we dont know 90% of human history which is a great mystery..

While some people cite examples of Ram Setu and the presence of Himalayan herbs in Sri Lanka(because Hanuman carried the Sanjeevani) to prove that these epics are history but then arises the question what else? where is the Pushpak Vimaan? As Awdhesh Sir also pointed out, when everything got destroyed how could only Ramayana and Mahabharata survive? Imagine had there also been an instruction manual to make a Pushpak Vimaan the Wright brothers wouldn't have been famous today. We all may be flying to Mars for holidays today! Some people suggest because these epics were popular in musical verses before getting written down but then again the same question why not anything else from that era? These epics are neither myth nor history, the best term for these would be-MYSTERY ",

People became soft and developed reluctance to war. Centuries passed. Our sub continent has become very rich. Till Asoka Empire and shathavahana Dynasty's our sub continent was protected by warrior Kings from other conquerers. Due to deep intrusion of BUDDHISM this continent became weak. Invading this sub continent started with Moguls, Mongols & Persians. They started destroying our historical records. Sub sequentially British rulers also followed the same to claim their culture as oldest. What ever be evidences also they destroyed. Now, we don't have recorded evidence to claim our Mahabharata as History. Where as across this continent so many places are still evident to prove RAMAYANA & MAHABHARATA as our history. they are truth not myth. ",

Problem is that people western countries have accepted existence of Ramayana and Mahabharat but some idiots in India itself constantly question the existence of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Most amazing fact is that this idiots include most of the intellactual hindus which are highly educated and hold higher degrees of reputed institutions. The spirituality of India is based on Puranas, Vedas written by Rishi Munis, ancient science and arts still survive, research of Ayurveda was done by Rishi Munis in ancient times, Aryabhatta's invention of Zero during the time of Gupta empire. Technology of Aeroplane was first introduced in Pushpak Viman, First constitution was formed by Kautilya Chanakya and it is called Chanakya Neeti today. But the sad demise of India is that today we have become so much modern that even after having such a rich culture and glorious history we question our own religion, our own gods, our own glorious history.

            "answer_text": "The answer is an emphatic no for the following reasons:  Evidences from Srilanka corroborate the fact that Ramayana is not a fabricated story. The logic behind Ravana's ten heads was that he had ten crowns on his head, one for each kingdom. Sri lanka was the great nation of four clans- Naga, Devas, Yaksha and Gandharva, who worshipped sun god and were unified together as \u2018Sivhala\u2019 by king Ravana. Since Ravana was the great devotee of lord shiva, he might have chosen the name Sivhala meaning \u201cDevotees of lord Shiva\u201d. Over the time, Sivhala became Sinhala.The Koneswaram temple in Triconamalee stands as an exampleThe existence of Rama setu, a bridge built by Rama and his army in the present day Palk Strait can't be ignored. Ravana had six airports in the Sri Lanka which became a land of many Vimanas that recently  attracted many western ancient-archeologists to this country to unearth facts about Ramayana.Apart from the Pushpaka Vimana, Ravana owned many other Vimana too. Ravana probably used these Vimana to travel to different parts of Lanka as well as outside Lanka.This is also borne out by the following sloka in the Valmiki Ramayana.Rama tells Lakshmana, as they fly over Lanka after defeatingRavanaI will keep updating this answer periodically ",

            "answer_text": "This question may require a diplomatic answer. If asked for my opinion, then in short, yes. Both Ramayana and Mahabharata happened. Now the question arises as to why a person may not believe these historic events (they are called itihasa which mean history in the Sanskrit Language). One of the reasons is due to the fact that the evidences supporting their occurrence are not too many compared to stories of epics which date back to some 1000 years ago or maybe for 1500 years . Considering the fact that India was subject to a lot of foreign invasions along with the fact that the mindset of colonizers would first be to try to influence the natives and one of such methods is to destroy the \u2018Knowledge\u2019 and \u2018Beliefs\u2019 of the natives, it definitely isn\u2019t a surprise when the occurrence of events contained in those texts are questioned.Certain feats performed by the people covered in the historic texts may seem superhuman or rather insane to our generation.What would make a person believe that the historic events occurred? Many of the places mentioned in the historic texts have survived the natural calamities and change in the temperature.The composers of the historic texts have recorded astrological events and the month and timing of events which can be retraced.The texts tell us about people having both good and bad morals and the effects and repercussions that follow. Every They help people understand how a man ought to be and what a man can truly is.Most of the later poets, historians, writers, etc offer respect and credit not only the people covered in the historic texts, but also to the composers, maybe for their excellent grammatical skills, usage of words, messages they are trying to convey, etc.What would be my stand here? I would call the texts as historic texts and not as a fiction or a story. I quite appreciate the content that Sanskrit texts have to offer and most of them, if not all, seem very scientific to me.Since the time gap is humongous, and many of the Sanskrit texts have survived through ages, I can appreciate and inculcate the ideals of the people who lived back then and try to learn how to be of value to humanity and handle myself in all the situations of my life, happiness or adversity alike since learning is a never ending process.Thanks!

The Knowledge about these two aspects(i.e. Dharma and Adharma) of human life is of great importance, and thus it is wise to understand properly and imbibe that precious knowledge from them(i.e. Ramayana and Mahabharata), and try to apply some of it in our daily lives, rather than wasting our time in making a fuss about the feasibility of such events.

In those books you can clearly observe how people change their attitude with change in time and how to find such type of people and avoid them is also given in the books. My friend when you read all these books and understood the theme of these epics I am sure you will come and delete your question from Quora. Your mind and heart will be filled with a spiritual boosting which gives you a confidence that you can do anything with what you have. If you ask whether these storied really happen then your question internally again questions the existence of God. Remember one thing we are in our mothers womb how we got air to inhale, when we came into this world who taught us to breath, to cry. All these question cannot be answerd untill we use the name God to explain. So I think I gave you a detailed clarification for your question. ",

Second there are so many amazing things god does in Hinduism that can\u2019t be explained but that\u2019s why he is god. He doesn\u2019t perform myricles by turning water into wine but by killing demons and removing adharma from earth so mankind can live on the path of righteousness. Now there is still social infrastructure structure that exists to prove what is in our scripture actually existed. It\u2019s easy to make an argument that it\u2019s just a story but the same thing can be said about Jesus or Mohammed or Buddha etc\u2026. So it\u2019s a personal choice. Think about it this way, even with all the technology we still don\u2019t know 99 percent of things that happened last night. Who was really part of 911? We just don\u2019t know and we can\u2019t know everything. The rishis who wrote these down were in deep meditation and they had the ability to see the past, present and future. So they were the most authentic. Yoga and meditation can do some amazing things. You will rarely hear science matching anything with what\u2019s in the bible or Quran. But there are things in hindu scriptures that can match with science of today and future. There are some real beautiful things written in hindu scriptures. Indians and Hindus are blessed to have such great knowledge available to them but it\u2019s sad the people are always looking to the west for a better way. Idiots, morons and dumbasses.

            "answer_text": "yada yada hi dharmasya\u2026  Mahabharat and Ramayan Some of the Greatest Epics given to the people to understand what is DHARMA. What is KARMA. What are the consequences when Dharma is not Upholded by the people. How Entire Empire that Spanned Over Continents is LOST because Dharma was not followed. It doesn't teach people HOW TO FOLLOW HINDUISM. IT TEACHES PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. Wherever you are whatever you do try to follow the Principle of Righteousness. Yes it is true that History is often manipulated to suite the Victors but what does that manipulation bring. WHAT IS TRUTH IS TRUTH AND SHALL BE TRUTH. DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED. Yes we can go into examples such as Ram Satu being man made structure  or the presence of Kandahar(known as Gandhaar in Mahabharat) or the presence of HINDU KUSH and LAHORE named after LOVE and KUSH of Ramayana and all that to prove that that Mahabharat and Ramayana Really Happened. BUT THEN AGAIN, ITS NOT TO PROVE WEATHER RAM OR KRISHNA EXISTED OR NOT. ITS INTENTION IS TO TEACH THE PRINCIPLES OF DHARMA. Not to promote the religion but to promote what is RIGHT. It doesn't matter what race religion caste creed one belongs to as long as they do the Right thing in life. Yes some one compared the RAMAYAN and MAHABHRAT to Harry Potter, with sound logic i might add BUT then again even we wont be known to our own Coming Generations 10 Generations down the line. How many of us can trace back their ancestry 1000 years back. Most of us wont be able to do so. And to the best of our knowledge, KRISHNAS DWARKA EXISTED 12000 - 36000 BC i.e. FOUNDED IN 36000 BC AND DESTROYED IN 12000 BC. ",

Besides that if it were just a book, there should have been many variants or at least some info should have been missing as its centuries old. But it doesn't seem to be the case.   IMO it's difficult to write anything of this magnitude Ramayana and Mahabharata. Hence I am left with one option it is to believe it happened! ",

You'll say, it's science so must be real. Right? Not quite yet. The purpose of believing something to be true is actually the reason behind finding the absolute truth later. In case of Epics like Mahabharata and Ramayan, their historical accuracy is pretty impressive. Even if they were myths you can't say that they depict ancient India wrongly. These books have been around for thousands of years which makes it even more difficult to test their historical evidences. Nevertheless, these 2 books have been a source of literary treasure and have shaped the modern India in a way that you can't even imagine. It doesn't matter if they are just stories for children or actual historical accounts as long as they serve the purpose of imparting knowledge because that, is what we strive for. ",

            "answer_text": "Both the epics were not written with the purpose of proving the fact that the events actually took place. It's pointless to discuss whether it actually happened or not.When we read the story of the race between the \"hare and the tortoise\", we don't go around asking whether the race actually took place or not. We learnt the moral of the story that \"slow and steady wins the race\".Same way, the Ramayana was the story of a Great king, there is evidence that he existed, but we should focus not on whether he actually existed or not but instead learn a lesson from all the mistakes made by different characters in the story. Ravana taught us not to touch something that doesn't belong to us. Hanuman Taught us the meaning of Loyalty. Characters like jataayu may have existed, it's not unknown for humans to befriend animals. Ravana was the ruler of 10 kingdoms, this maybe a reason why he was known to have \"10 heads\" which was actually \"10 different crowns\". So the story is full of metaphors.The mahabharata is a guide to life, and just like the ramayana, many of the things mentioned in the story should not be taken at face value, they may or may not have existed. We will not gain anything by proving whether the events actually happened or not :)But our job is to understand the meaning behind each story, learn the lessons, and apply them in real life. ",

It could be the story of an ideal king and a man (maryada purushottam) who travelled across the country and reached as far as Lanka where ruled a bad king called Ravana who had abducted his wife. Or it could be a work of fiction written by a man called Valmiki who wanted to teach morality and ethics through a king called Rama. If we consider it reality, then it has been modified over the ages and magical elements have been added to it. The usual stuff that happens when a story passes from one ear to another. There has been no proof whatsoever that a king named Lord Ram existed in reality. This has been due to numerous excavations that have taken place at Ayodhya which don't confirm his existence. However, it has been such a long period of time, that it is quite possible that it is not possible to find a proof even if such a man ever existed. Our only evidence is a story that has been told and retold to the generation of Indians for thousands of years and which finds its various versions in as far as Indonesia. The opinion is divided on the reality of Lord Ram and thus it's a myth, that it may or may not be true. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, that\u2019s real history and Rama and Krishna were as real as you and me are. With the great grace of Ved Vyasa, I have been able to accomplish an irrefutable FULL & FINAL discovery of these periods. Why should there be a reason to doubt it when it is clearly stated by Ved Vyasa himself that these epics are the Itihasa? But of course, the blown up dates, dating the Mahabharata and Ramayana to 5000 BCE/3100 BCE / 7000 BCE without any conformance to either the Archaeology or the Genealogy need not be taken seriously. These false claims only massage the wounded self-pride of most Indians who have been in slavery for last few hundred years and who always want to be the No. 1 in everything, even in history. Ramayana was composed by sage Valmiki few years after 1299 BCE, the coronation year of Rama. The core story of Mahabharata was written by sage Veda Vyasa in 3 years (826\u2013824 BCE) following the Mahabharata war in 827 BCE (Dec 10\u201327), the additional non-core stories from the Puranas, known as the Akhyanas, were added in the Mahabharata few years later by disciples of Veda Vyasa. The Sanskrit shlokas that mention the Yugas are being misinterpreted: Consider the following verse from Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata wherein the phrase \u201c\u0926\u0936 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937 \u0938\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f\u201d is traditionally interpreted as 10,000 years making the verse appear highly doubtful. With the correct translation however, the real sensible meaning comes to light:  Understanding this much (that Sahasrani=10, Shatani=1), when you now read the Puranas, the correct meaning is rendered: \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0903 \u0938\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924\u0902 \u092f\u0941\u0917\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0923\u093f \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0938\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0924\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0924\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0917\u092e\u093f\u0939\u094b\u091a\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947\u0964 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0938\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0930\u0947 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092a\u0930\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0923\u0924\u0903\u0964 \u0938\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0947\u0915\u0902 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u0903 \u0915\u0932\u093f\u092f\u0941\u0917\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u092e\u0943\u0924\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u090f\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0938\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0939\u094b \u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092e\u092e\u0941\u0926\u093e\u0939\u0943\u0924\u092e\u094d\u0964 40 (4*10) are said to be years of Krita-Yuga, 30 years are in Treta-Yuga, it is said. And 20 years, of Dwapara-Yuga is the time span, 10 years is Kali-Yuga remembered to be. A 1000 of this (120 year cycle) is known as Brahma\u2019s day. Of course, this is without the Sandhis. Add 20% to all of them: 48 years, 36 years, 24 years, 12 years Most of Sanskrit verses now will give the correct meaning instead of absurd ones:  Both the epics are discussed in great detail in my book (The Science of Time and Timeline of World History) that can also be downloaded freely (Download Link). These are some relevant images from the book:       The entire Mahabharata is explained in Chapter 3 and the Ramayana in Chapter 4. If you have any doubts or queries, first download and read the book. I may not be available to answer each and every question here. By the time you finish through the book, I am sure your most doubts would be cleared automatically.  ",

WWhich was fought for British throne as game of thrones was for Iron Throne. So, it is clear that real life events give rise to epic fantasies, therefore in past Of India, it is possible that there was a huge battle due to abduction of a queen of a king who went on to protect his wife with help of tribes. Similarly, for Mahabharat in past maybe a large set piece balle between different houses happened. You might now ask about Demons and gods and and magic in Ramayan and Mahabharat. So do you know that Game of thrones has dragons, but war of roses didn't involved dragons. Now again fantasy comes to play. I think you may like my answer, for any discussion, use comments.

Astronomical dating as pointed mainly by hindu nationalists is not scientific evidence. Till date there is no archaeological evidence to demonstrate a big battle  in kurukshetra. Moreover Mahabharat mentioned that 4 million soldiers took part in the battle from both sides which is impossible as India's entire population then was about 20-50 million. Also Mahabharata if it took place in 3000 or 5000 BC shows use of iron which was not known to inhabitants of india at that time as evidenced by excavations at Indus valley site which is dated at 2500BC which shows no chariots, iron weapons and even horses. So overall science does not support a mahabharata battle. ",

Hence they are based on belief and faith of the people. In the puranic framework also, the ramayana and the mahabharata are part of the Ithihasa literature.

If you want to believe that they are just cooked up stories, they are just cooked up stories. If you want evidences for those two epics happening, we don't have any convincing one. Be it Rama sethu, or a few archaeological sites in sri lanka, remnants of Dwaraka etc are some evidences which we have now, but are they really a testimony that these two epics happened? Nobody knows. There might have been a city where remnants of Dwaraka were found, maybe it had flourished during its time, maybe the dates mentioned in the epics match with the estimates of carbon dating, but what is the guarantee that a war actually happened? What is the guarantee that a man named Krishna lived there? Instead of all this, I think that adopting the values mentioned in those epics in our lives is much more important than thinking about whether they really happened or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Ramayan and Mahabharat are way too far from merely stories... I will say they can be looked in two perspectives : 1)- they are life incidences of Ram and Pandavas along with their wife sita and draupadi , respectively.. And ofcourse they occured actually but the writers (Valmiki of Ramayan and Vedvyas of Mahabharat) perceptions are so deep in both these Kavya(\u0915\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f) that we in this modern era cannot believe them to be true . I mean each incidents have been explained from all the logical perspectives that may not be very clear to a Reader who is a Layman, but yes a Reader having Higher realms of understanding can easily decode these different perspectives that the writers are trying to explain. 2)- the different incidences in Both (ramayan & mahabharat) are secretly woven in such a manner so that the Reader while enjoying through the stories also creates deep understanding about very complex life phenomenon and how to emerge out of any heartbreaking situations in life.. In my view, Logically, Ramayan creates an understanding about choosing between \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092f\u0938 (preferrable) and \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092f\u0938 (desirable) by narrating the life incidents of Ram. (ofcourse \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092f\u0938 should be always best choice). while Mahabharat is telling us more complex facts of \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e (righteousness)since \" dharma \" is way too complex. so by following the paths chosen by \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092a\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u092f\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093f\u0930 (yuddhishtir) one can create a deeper understanding about \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e (dharma). I will suggest to have a thorough reading of these kavya(\u0915\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f) just like you read any other book of your choice and think over it .. :) this will fetch many interesting facts to your mind itself ..

Google contains all favourable and unfavourable answers on any topic; epic or anything one wants. I have some knowledge of Ramayana and Mahabharat as I have been hearing stories from my daadi from my childhood and watching serials if time permits. My experience says it matters nothing Wether all are real or not or whether both were written first or happened first. Now I visualise both way. Mostly all the good bad characters of both epics are seen in quantity at present with said qualities. What the main message both writers Sage Valmiki and sage Vedvyasji wants to convey to its entire generation is that THE WHOLE PLAY BETWEEN FIRST AND LAST BREATH OF LIFE IS OF THOUGHTS AND MEAL. One acquires lo\u2026ts of knowldge from parents teachers home school colleges to knowledge acquiring stuff on net but when he or she applies that knowledge in its practical life and if that application gives peace and contentment then we are on rightpath but if not or creats confusion and anger jealosy lust dishonesty type feelings resulting in negative results then we are just wasting the entire knowledge acquired via any source. Both epics highlights MANN as cause andresult of any good or bad deed. So one has to first control or balance our OWN MANN via YOG and YOGA for physical and mental balncing of this precious life.

The reasons being, that most of the places (their names) cited in these works are no longer found to be existent owing to a series of subsequent invasions from different cultures int the last 3000 years. My father is an exponent(self made though) in Sanskrit & English and I spent considerable time with him discussing and challenging these subjects. One has to isolate fact and fiction from these literary works to get a realistic opinion of as to what might have happened. One pointer to someone who wants to look into them; whoever composed them has the full knowledge of the geography and the ecosystem of the entire sub continent. Also we have under the sea discoveries made near Dwaraka (Gujarat) with material evidence resembling such references in Mahabharata. It calls for an elaborate discussion and I cannot put all my opinions here but references made in these works about the solar eclipses, earthquakes, rivers drying up and other natural catastrophes, do point to a possibility of them being poetic exaggerations of certain true events.

Both these historical books consists of lakh of characters to have lived in different period at different states. So many characters cannot be invented, unless such personalities did exist.These books give minute details of events, specificity pronounced and details enumerated.All the places mentioned in these books are identified and existing more or less with the same names. Naimisharanya, Janakpuri, Pataliputhra, Kashi, dandakaranya, Ayodhya etc., are few examples.The rulers are given in linear order, in both the books. Their governance, their battle victories, social conditions, etc., are vividly explained.Even now Hindus firmly believe that Sri Rama and Sri Krishna are born in Ayodhya and Mathura respectively. This has been passed on to the successive generation. The belief cannot be so strong even after 5000 years unless it is true.There are many legends and folklores which extol the characters in these books. If they are not true people will not repeat them or even shun them.Though there are some exaggeration regarding the wars of Ramayana and Mahabharatha, one thing which is common is the battle is between evil vs good. Because of armaments used are primitive in Ramayana , it took place earlier to Mahabharath. Even the Rama Sethu constructed between Rameshwaram to Sri Lanka are traced under the sea.When we consider these it is felt these two events actually happened. ",

Further exploration revealed how politics had played a part in it and hence the authorities were shying away from talking about it. It also showcased how astronomical references in Mahabharata have been verified and proven to be exactly correct using modern astronomical softwares. It was also argued that the explanations of nuclear energy, lasers, vimanas (flying chariots) in the book were to accurate to be fiction.  Here is the link to that documentary.  ",

Let me ask you a question, do you think a single person or even humans (or many people at different period) would have written Mahabharatha (if you read Mahabharatha you will understand this question well)? If you think human have the ability to write Mahabharata kind of stories why we are still left with one Mahabharatha? ",

Digging into numbers and evidence/proof may lead to conflict as the historians gave us the rough estimates of how long they were dated back and they rarely wrote something to gain validation from it, unlike west. As our mind needs rational/ logic answers, we are so conditioned to think that, we only accept rational or scientific truths by rejecting the others as myths/ falsehood. But suprisingly we have  few of these evidences even until today, so here we go.. 1. For Mahabharata : The sunken city of Dwaraka on the western coast in the state of Gujarat, India.( recently discovered)  2. For Ramayan : the Adam bridge (Rama setu) connecting link between Sri Lanka and India  We are so conditioned to think, if anything that is endorsed by Harwood or Cambridge is accepted by world. Unfortunatly they were built just 100 years old where as these ancient Indian scriptures were written few thousands of years ago for humanity. In my view, when these were written ? Wheather these epics were real or not is not important for me. All that matters is, can I make this life little more easy by learning, assimilating the ideas behind these epics and each mythical character by nature.  ",

Gorakh nath ji asked Kabir Sahib Ji-Since when are you a recluse- Sanyasi Kabte Bhaye Bairagi Kabir Ji, Kabte Bhaye Bairagi.Satguru Kabir replied; Nath Ji Hum Jabse Bhaye Vairagi, Meri Adi Ant Sudhi Lagi.Dhudhukar Adi Ko Mela, Nahin Guru Nahin Chela.Jabka To Hum Yog Upasa, Tabka Phiron Akela.Sahib Said from the time that when there was no Guru or Disciples, I was Sanyasi. Now the question arises is that what his age was. He said- Jo Bujhe So Bavara, Kya Umar Hamari.Asankhya Yug Parlaye Gai, Tabke Brahmachari.Koti Niranjan Ho Gaye, Parlok Sidhari.Hum To Sada Mehboob Hain, Soham Brahmachari.Dash Koti Brahma Bhaye, Nau Koti Kanhaiya.Sat Koti Shambhu Bhaye, Mori Ek Palaiyaa.Kotin Narad Ho Gaye, Muhammadse Chari.Devtan I Ginti Nahin, Kya Shrishti Bichari.Nahin Budha Nahin Balak, Nahin Bhat Bhikhari.Kahai Kabir Sun Gorakh, Yeh Umar Hamari.Sahibji said, \u201cWhat can I say about my age? There has been dissolution infinite number of times and since that very time I have been wandering as a Brahmachari (unmarried). Crores of Niranjans have expired and 10 crore Brahmas, 9 crore Krishnas and 7 crore Shiv jis have also come and gone and the time taken during all this process is just a moment for me. O Gorakh! Crores of Narads have come and gone; many Mohammads have also met with the same fate; there can be no count of the gods and in such case what can we say about this poor universe. I am neither old nor young and this is all that I can say about my age. In other words, I have been here since time immemorial and nothing can be said about my age. [VEDA VYASA ON KARMA OF GODS- DEVI PURAN; O king! Everybody, even Brahm\u00e2, Vishnu and Mahesha all under the influence of this Karma! And they experience pleasure, pain, old age, disease and death, joy and sorrow, lust, anger, greed and other bodily qualities, out of the effects of this Karma, which we call ordinarily Fate.] Bhagvad Gita 4.5. Many births of Mine have passed, as well as of thine, O Arjuna! I know them all but thou knowest not, O Parantapa! All events are relative reality, it is happening outside us and inside our Mind Projection of mind- Cosmic Consciousness, Mind over matter. However, Soul is free from their impact. Satguru Kabir Sahib is essence of eternal Truth, he appears in India in every yoga with different Names, Just as the Avatars. ",

Consider the example of Lord of the rings . It is a fictional buy it draws strong parallels with WW2 which had far more scary weapons than lord of the rings . So my opinion is to not exclude them as mere myth. There can be hidden facts and real historical events attached . Like recently dwarka was found out . Archaeological evidences of saraswati is found out . So it might have happened. Whether krishna was a tremendous king with great knowledge or a God is up to question but as more evidences are found out things can turn out to be true which maybe different to your imagination. Vimanas cam be flying chariots or it can be real aircrafts of ancient world . Brahmastra, brahmandstra these are all Sanskrit meanings of atomic weapons . Brahma is creator . Ashtra is weapon . What is the basic unit of creation in modern science Atom . So even if these are embellished there can be hidden truths which makes it far more mystical in human evolution. To even think of such parallels is an enormous feat as well ",

            "answer_text": "Talking about the RAMAYANA and THE MAHABHARAT, we actually have no scientific discoveries that shows that these two stories actually happend. The most attractive and peculiar thing about these two epics is that these are written so beautifully that each incident happening in these stories have a previous planning behind them. Here is an example of a story of LAXMAN\u2019s death in RAMAYANA with the reason why Laxman should die first before RAM: After Sita was consumed by Mother Earth, Ram knew that his duties on Earth were over and he decided to return back to Vaikunth, but that couldn\u2019t be accomplished as Hanuman won\u2019t allow Yam, the God of Death to meet Ram. To distract Hanuman, Ram threw his ring in the underworld (Paatal) and asked Hanuman to procure it. Ram then invited Yam, but he put forth a condition that the conversation between them must remain unrevealed and if anyone intercepts the conversation, Ram would kill the person. Ram asked Laxman to guard the gate to ensure no one came in to intercept the meeting of Lord Ram and Yam. In the meantime, angry sage Durvasa came in to meet Ram only to be halted by Laxman. Angry Durvasa warned that he would curse Ayodhya if not allowed to meet Lord Ram. Seeing the situation, Laxman decided to go and talk to Ram and hence intercepted the meeting. After this incident, to fulfil his brother\u2019s promise, Laxman went to Saryu and gave up his life. Laxman\u2019s death before Ram\u2019s was necessary as the Shesh-Naag (the seat of Vishnu) that was Laxman had to return first, before Vishnu returned to Vaikunth. Vishnu here was Lord Ram. HERE IS ANOTHER STORY THAT LINKS BOTH THE EPICS BEAUTIFULLY: Bali, the elder brother of Sugreev, known for his strength, had a boon that whosoever engaged in a combat with him would lose half of his strength to Bali. Invincible Bali was challenged once by Ravan for a combat. Enraged Bali, grabbed Ravan by his head and took him round the world, making Ravan accept his defeat. Bali, when took over Sugreev\u2019s wife and the kingdom of Kishkinda forcefully, Sugreev fled the kingdom and met Hanuman in the woods for help. In the interim, Ram killed a demon named Kadambh in the forest while searching for Sita and a curse-free Kadambh now asked Ram to meet Sugreev to help him from Bali. Ram decided to execute Bali after meeting Sugreev. Ram shot Bali from behind the tree, and Bali alleged that Ram had betrayed him as he didn\u2019t challenge Bali for a combat. To this, Ram explained that if a man ill-behaves a woman, it is the duty of a righteous man to punish him. Ram then promised Bali that in his next life, he would become the reason of Vishnu\u2019s death and thus take revenge of this incident. Bali was later reborn as Jara, the hunter, who was the reason of Krishna\u2019s death in the Dwapar Yug! There are many stories you can find like this one in both the epics. This is the beauty of the two epics. All the incidents, all the actions taken by any character in the story have reasons behind them or have another story behind them. This beauty and accuracy of both the epics makes us believe in them. THIS IS MY POINT OF VIEW FOR BOTH THE EPICS. OTHERS MAY HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THE EPICS AND I RESPECT ALL. ",

As with everything else, history will, over time, morph into mythology because at the end of the day, it is a meme and as with any other meme, it will mutate over time.  The above image and its subsequent claims do not correlate. The bridge is merely a build up of sedimentary excess and was most certainly not built by an army of monkeys and humans working together. Any student of history must learn to separate fact from fiction in order to glean scientifically accurate data. In the instances of the Indian mythologies, there is a lot that needs to be weeded before we even begin to go through claims of authenticity. The supernatural aspects all need to go completely. Over and above that, concepts like Tretha yuga have no place in modern archeology. Finally, these claims need to be cross verified with independent sources, which is pretty tall order, given how insular India was back then. So to conclude,while these mythologies might contain shards and wisps of historically accurate information, they are for most part, just stories and myths and nothing more. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is as much that of self-belief as that of the doubt that underpins it. If we do not regard the life and times of Jesus or any other god (or godman) as untrue, who gives us the right to declare Ramayana and Mahabharata as but mythology? This is, aptly, the one-line answer to your question. Now for facts. The rocks that form the Ram-Setu are older than the sand on top of which they rest. This only affirms the truth called Ramayana. Sadly, we have only managed to pass on this truth as mere telltale through generations. And, I do not wish to demean the efforts that we have taken to disbelieve our heritage and history as but myths and lore. This cloud has a silver lining. I am glad to see the question pop-up on Quora. People wish to speak about it. People wish to know more. The more they wish to know, speak, and share, the more they will wish to question. It is this questioning that forms the cornerstone of the Sanatana Dharma. Kindly do not wrongly transliterate the word \u201cDharma\u201d as religion. \u201cDharma\u201d is your virtue; the way you implement morality, ethics, experience, and upbringing through your deeds. Thank you, once again, for the question. ",

We have many evidence of Ramayana and mahabarath incidents in many states across our country and also in few other Asian countries. Im from tamilnadu and i can quote significant evidence of Ramayana. Most of the people knows historical Rama-Sethu bridge in Dhanuskodi (Near to Rameswaram) which connected India and srilanka. It is still believed that Lord Rama created it with the assistance of many Vanara's (Lord Hanuman &troops). Central Government took a project ten years back near to that bridge to increase the sea depth and to ease the ship transport. They tried to break the part of bridge but failed in all the attempts.Finally they can able to break only few stones. Amazing thing is that those stones are floating in water and local people maintaining those stones sacredly. This is one of the stone they kept in local temples.  ",

Well, I would say that additions, deletions were made later on mainly because: These were passed on by word of mouth so some changes were inevitableEach narrator/ author would have his/ her own skew to add and that cumulated over the years to result in some drastic skews overallDeliberate misrepresentations by authors to promote their personal views also ended up messing with the originalLet me just point out a couple of things. Before we saw satellite images of Adam\u2019s bridge, we thought \u201cOh how can anyone build a bridge from India to Sri lanka?\u201d. We thought \u201cHow can there by floating stone?. Both these are very much facts and cane be seen with our own eyes now. ",

            "answer_text": "Ancient scriptures of almost all cultures across the world describe of an extinction level event of floods in the distant past (possibly due to heavy tectonic/volcanic activity followed up with extensive ice-melt across the globe around 10000 BCE, towards the end of ice age), with very few survivors. Was it the same floods that initially inundated the coastal city of Dwaraka, and later over next few millennia, obliterated all traces of earlier civilisation? According to Indian scriptures called Matsya Purana, our ancestors used to live towards far South and escaped from great floods or Pralay, and settled later in the northwest parts... Could it be possible that we\u2019re actually the descendants of such a small community of survivors, who eventually established agrarian civilisations at Indus valley, Mesopotamia, Egypt etc, and then migrated around the globe? Could it be that Ramayan and Mahabharat are the legacy of a highly advanced civilisation before Pralay? Maybe most of the original pre-historic records, scriptures and archeological evidences were lost during this cataclysmic event\u2026 Any references to the agrarian way of life or locations, could have been part of what got introduced into the fragmentary remnants of these scriptures, while sages like Valmiki and Vyasa, reconstructed them as epics, few millennia after Pralay.

            "answer_text": "First of all, Mahabharata that we've today is a miniature of the whole epic. Around 6 to 10% is all which remains as text. The original one was so beautiful and epic, that it got stolen by the Gods. So, what we've today is what Vaisampayana (a pupil of Vyasa) remembers. And Sanskrit is the only language wherein each letter has got a meaning. And so, one who reads it can interpret it in so many ways and thus cannot be 100% translated into any other language without sacrificing the original meaning and/or message. Because of this only we've too many unique social problems and criticisms that is unique to India and Hindu. Mahabharata is a dynamic story and has a frame-tale structure where stories are present inside stories. There are thousands of characters and every character has been described in detail from their birth till death. Except for a handful of them, every character's previous life(s) is also mentioned. Some characters even decide where to be born, when to be born, for whom to be born and how to die in their previous life itself. So, one can spend whole lifetime exploring without understanding many words or phrases mean because of the sheer vastness of epic and limited experience of life. Ramayana is a part of Mahabharata, Sage Valmiki covers the previous life of Lord Krishna. Coming to my verdict, Mahabharata is not which happened in the past, but which keeps on happening in one's life as long as Humanity is there on the planet (any planet). How we relate it to ourselves and how we liberate is all left to us. ",

The various versions, the various interpolations, the people responsible for each version and the people responsible for the interpolations can convey a lot about their place in history and the historical development recorded in them. But that can only happen if we take away the heavy veil of religiosity attached to them that makes them untouchable and immune from criticism.  Myths and legends convey a different reality that is more metaphorical and symbolic and we should not consider them too literally and expect them to be literally historical evidence. ",

But, further when I read more about the investigations and old civilizations, somewhere I want to believe that this was truth.  Though not at the level how it was portrayed in the stories. Like flying arrows, magic tricks and many unbelievable things. Because you know, 'Fiction' is a thing people love reading. Even if you are serving true stories, added masala would make it more interesting and easy to make it famous. ",

For Indians, Mahabharata is Itihasa - history.For outsiders, it is mythology.If you ask a Christian, was Jesus a real person, he would say \"Yes\". Have you wondered why? Probably because they have a written history. However Indians do not have a written history, unless you have foreign visitors, making notes of the places they visited in their travel books.In India, history was passed orally through sages, teachers, bards and general people.By the advent of the British Raj in India, the tradition broke. The taunts and ridiculous comments by the foreigners, made the Indians shy away from the stories and legends of their ancestors.History eventually turned into legends and legends into mythology. ",

William Darlymple in his book 'City of Djinns' makes a mention about Mahabharata, that there is a different line of thought which says that the kurukshetra battle was inspired by a bitter territorial battle between two brothers who headed rival tribes.

As sacred stories, myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests and closely linked to religion. In the society in which it is told, a myth is usually regarded as a true account of the remote past.In fact, many societies have two categories of traditional narrative\u2014(1) \"true stories\" or myths, and(2) \"false stories\" or fables. Myths generally take place in a primordial age, when the world had not yet achieved its current form. They explain how the world gained its current form and how customs, institutions, and taboos were established. The Mahabharta and Ramayana are the seed book for Hindus following the \"Sanatan Dharma\" . This dispute of true and fiction shall ever remain till we have some material proof. After all this is a scientific age.Everything has to undergo proof and measurements ordeal in today's world. PS: No doubt mahabharat was written by Ved vyaas but it under went several modifications century by century by some great writers of that time. Everyone added the best of their imagination because we can't remember the everything so minutely of the past and if we do then its not real.And what we got?An exaggerated tale of fight between to set of families of the same ancestoral origin and the fight must have been ocer a small place and of very feeble intensity.But the exaggeration of facts decade by decade, century by century gave rise to the Greatest epic tale of that time \"the mahabharata.\"Otherwise  how can you imagine thousands of elephants, janapadas, people involved in such a small battle ground of kurukshetra.thanks for A2A.

Don't believe some vested interests who want to wean you away without allowing you to read them. Some people when they can't write a good entrance exam discourage you also from writing, because if you read and pass the entrance exam, they will be shown in poor light. They can't tolerate their failure. So, they discourage you by telling all negative points about the exam. Don't believe them. THEY ARE NOT TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. RAMAYANA & MAHABHARATA, BHAGAVAD GITA are all 100% correct. Hari om. Hari om. ",

Upon the recommendation of Sage Vashishta, King Dasharatha of Ayodhya performed the Putrakameshti Yagya under the supervision of Rishi Shringya(Shringi Rishi) who was the son of Rishi Vibhandak and celestial Nymph Urvashi, and was an expert in Yajurveda, which has the guidelines for this prayer. After its successful completion, the Lord of Fire, Agnidev appeared and gave a bowl of sweet to the King of Ayodhya, which was provided to his three queens in order to promulgate his sons Sri Ram, Lakshman, Bharat and Shatrughna. Shring Rishi was married to Lord Ram's elder sister Shanta.

Those who have referred to fiction stories and ruled out the existence of Mahabharata should contradict with some reasonable facts than bluntly opposing things. Taking Harry Potter as a pristine source to contradict seem stupid because Harry Potter itself reflect ideas borrowed from past. Consider the following-Flying broom sticks ( purely the idea/view of flying should have been borrowed from somewhere where did it come from?)    Russia vs US conflicts over Syrian regime where both are using cutting edge technology of missiles, would this be a joke when someone hears it/learns it from books after 200 or more years later? ",

Why I believe? Both Mahabharata and Ramayana were written in different time line by different authors, still lot of characters are common. For example: vishvamithra who is teacher to Lord Rama ,is father of shakuntala who gives birth to king Bharatha. Parashurama, hanuman etcBe it birthdate of Lord Rama or krishna or certain events like solar eclipse during kurukshetra war are not some dummy date picked to write a story. But those were actual dates which fits timeline.The places, location s mentioned when there were no vehicles to travel , from Kandahar (Ghandara) to Sri Lanka is so accurate and real.Archeological survey which has recorded lot of evidence be it mathura which is submerged in water, or Rama sethu to Lanka .Lastly, as I told earlier , there is lot to learn in these two epics and personally for me that is what is important. If I don't believe, I can't learn anything. I can just brush that away as some story. But only if I respect and believe those great characters , I can learn.P.S: since the question is Why \u201cI\u201d believe, I have told my opinion and my perceptions about these two epics. Still there is lot to learn, at every age u relate to different characters and understand. For many years, I was angry for rama leaving seetha, but later I realized that they both were in love, that distance was not a matter. The way Rama loved and respected seetha is evident when he cries for her with golden statue of seetha. So I reread the stories to see the problem from that age, time and characters point of view. ",

Some of the later additions and translations of these epics are highly exaggerated and those at the best can be considered as myth additions. It is interesting that you call these tales history, because that is the original value of the content. History is for current generations to study and learn from it. Similarly if you study both the tales, there is a major theme that emerges out of them. In Ramayana, you saw the life of a man who dedicated his life to the society and he changed himself to please the society which brought him immense pain and difficulties. In Mahabharata you see that every character had his own agenda, they tried shaping the circumstance according to their thinking which brought about a great war and destruction to the whole of human kind and the technological progress made till then. The learning for us is very simple, that both the extremes will not work. It is for us to balance our lives and thinking, and lead a holistic life. ",

The tale of the Mahabharata is said to have become after the charioteers of the war became peace time singers and poets and travelled to various parts of the country for livelihood ( a known mode of occupation at that time ) . However the Mahabharata account has undergone multiple revisions since the first time it was written . The Bhagwat Gita itself was inserted into it much later . In its present version it simultaneously a record of practices in that age , a critique of those practices, a treatise on morality , society and philosophy as well as a prescription for society to maintain harmony and stability . Thus nothing save fragments of historicity survive . Even the figure of Krishna is based on multiple \u201cheroic\u201d figures of that era but amalgamated from multiple sources . For example his role as the cowherder comes from the tales of a historical-legendary hero figure of a tribe in western India which was famous for its expertise in cattle rearing .Some of the places mentioned in the tale are known historical places \u2014 Gandhara from where Shakuni and Gandhari came extends between Pakistan and Afghanisthan , Magadha is a known powerful prinipality of Ancient India and so on .

The author is quite daring in sense that he used democracy's tolerance for dissent to his advantage in portraying his derision towards Hinduism in an 'intellectual' and 'interesting' way. He just removed the word \"Muslim\" from Muslim invasion from the West, British colonization of India and attributed all their misdeeds to imaginary Aryans (Devas). While Ravan's portrayal as a \"Dravidian Asura\" and the author's description of Dravidian's glory and Aryan cunningness might instill a sense of pride in the minds of so-called Dravidians, it will also add to the conformational bias of Tamils dark complexioned people in equating Brahmans with the embodiment of 'Aryans' and tends to justify their contempt towards the former. In essence there is not an iota of truth in the work. Though much research has been done in writing the story, all the research is fitted into the author's predetermined mindset. It is easy to garner attention by writing/ speaking cheap of Hindu Gods.PS While I know it is fatal to the author to fabricate an alternate history of Islam, I wouldn't refrain from asking: 1. Would the author dare to create such a work on Mohamed? 2.Would the secular brigade, stand by the author's view point and ask Muslims to calm down in case they issue death threats? ",

Ayodhya the current city which Lord Ram ruled years ago still exists. 2. Parna shala can be viewed even today where Lord Ram, Sita, Laxman lived during their exile. 3. Ram sethu, a way connecting India and Sri Lanka which was built by Vanar Sena is a supernatural construction. 4. Existence of Kurukshetra where Mahabharat battle took place. 5.

In my opinion, what should be given importance is what is the object, but what is the subject. The essence of the text needs to be given importance. The events described in the epics should not be taken literally, but they should be taken in the form of symbols or metaphors. One should try to look beyond the words and try to read between the lines. When it comes to testing the authenticity of the events, one should read a piece of work titled \u201cVaimanika Shastra\u201d, a Sanskrit text on aerospace technology that claims that the aerial vehicles described in the Puranic texts are real. Of course, this is one of the many texts out there that support the actual occurrence of the events. ",

These epics, especially Ramayana, has many versions iterated over in many cultures like Indian, Thai etc. These versions themselves are loaded with many projections (extra additions) across regions and cultures. Other civilizations also have matching stories. For example Helan of Troy, similarities between Hercules and Parashurama and Balarama stories. But these lead to speculations only by way of analysis. Almost no concrete archaeological evidences exists. Although there are lots of scope exists. Archaeological Society of India is doing almost nothing in this direction. We need to inspire more future Indian historians and archaeologists and fund them to work in this direction. In sum, there is nothing concrete exists. ",

Here is how Valmiki the author of Ramayana describes the birth detail of Sri Ram: Sri Rama was born on the ninth lunar day of the bright fortnight of Chaitra, when the star Punarvasu was in the ascendant. The five planets (Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn) were in their respective exaltation positions. The Sun in the 10th degree of Aries, the Moon in the 3rd degree of Taurus, Mars in the 28th degree of Capricorn, Jupiter in the 5th degree of Cancer, Venus in the 27th degree of Pisces, Saturn in the 20th degree of Libra. Jupiter and Moon in conjunction in Cancer. Based on these facts the earliest date is s 4th December 7323. Similarly the date of commencement of Mahabharath war is 16th October 5561 B.C.

None of the major Ramayana sites have been clearly identified. That is not the case with the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata is much more real than the Ramayana. And, therefore, much more fascinating. Every conceivable human emotion figures in it, which is the reason why it is possible to identify with it even today. The text itself states that what is not found in the Mahabharata, will not be found anywhere else. Unlike the Ramayana, India is littered with real places that have identifications with the Mahabharata.(Ayodhya or Lanka or Chitrakuta are identifications that are less certain.) Kurukshetra, Hastinapura, Indraprastha, Karnal, Mathura, Dvaraka, Gurgaon, Girivraja are real places: the list is endless. In all kinds of unlikely places, one comes across temples erected by the Pandavas when they were exiled to the forest. In some of these places, archaeological excavations have substantiated the stories. The Mahabharata critical edition Introduction by Bibek DebRoy ",

Like most stories, it uses artistic liberties to produce a condensed sense of enlightenment  The place I have seen it most sadly in real life is breast cancer and sometimes uterine. When the woman undergoes a mastectomy, the husband sees it as stealing away her sexuality so ignores or leaves her. She then withers and burns inside till death. ",

By quoting this I wanted to say that we need to learn the moral of the story instead of questioning its existence.I personally feel that these didnt really happen. ",

            "answer_text": "Hinduism has got a galaxy of literature ranging from \u2018Sruti\u2019 (like the vedas,upnishads, Gita etc) to \u2018Smitri\u2019 ( like Mahabharata, Ramayana Puranas etc) trying to understand and explain the Hindu Philosophy. Sruti and Smitri are the result of meditative musings and the memories of saints respectively. They are so old that their chronology can be established. However, Ramayana & Mahabharata come from smriti, so it is less authoritative. They have been compiled during Gupta phase. Like all other sacred texts they also attempts to explain Hindu philosophy but in layman language with personification of the nitty-gritty of it so that it reaches the common man. Based on the then available findings and the knowledge of Hinduism, Valmiki would have connected the dots. The same goes for the Mahabharata as well. Talking about Ramayana, its roots can be traced in various mythological tales like the one below : Once there was a mighty demon named Jalandhar called shivansh ( part of Shiva). His strength and prowess emanated from his wife Vrida( today worshipped as Tulsi) who was a chaste. It is so called that her chastity was protecting the life of her husband. The only way to overpower and kill Jalandhar was to destroy the chastity of his wife. Lord Vishnu descended from Vaikuntha and took the form of Jalandhar and went on to live in Vrinda while Jalandhar was in the battle field. Unable to recognise Vishnu, she lost her chastity. Later on when the real identity of Vishnu was revealed to her; enraged she set herself on fire and cursed Vishnu that like her husband would torment after losing her, one day his wife would meet the same fate. Hence to pay for the vices Vinshu and Lakshmi took birth as Ram & Sita respectively in the following birth. (This is also the philosophy of Karamic balance in Hinduism and prepares the ground of the epic Ramayana.) The saint Valmiki might have taken the story forward; who knows ? The Ramayana like the above tale takes up another aspect of Hinduism i.e Dhama or Duty. Here you will find a righteous Son, a brother, a father, a wife and even the vicious demon Ravana has some virtues. In conclusion I believe all this is philosophy encompassing the various truths and facets of life. Not to be taken literally but figuratively. If you merely run after the debate of whether it\u2019s fictitious or real, you will make the mistake of not driving home the larger message hidden therein. ",

Since the story has been passed down the generations verbally for many centuries and later written down there was always scope for exxagerating facts. So I think Ramayan and Mahabharat, very much happened in India and were powerful enough to set the roots in the minds of people so much that they influenced our culture and helped India become the centre of power in Asia and the whole world for many centuries.

In Mahabarata, Krishna is said to hide the sun so that Arjun kills Jaydrath. Consider this event as a solar eclipse. Now some indian scientists had calculated the time of mahabarata war by using solar eclipse as reference. This solar eclipse coincides with many date references in mahabarata. also, the archeological excavations are dwarka, indraprasth, kurukshetra, they all indicate that there was population at these locations. Ramayana has many locations till date which have survived. Rama's bridge to Sri Lanka, Many locations all over India which have  legends saying Rama had travelled during exile all indicate that Mahabarata and Ramayana are our historical epics. Not mythological. ",

So this can be established that the Age of Rama had already concluded and was considered a fact in history of that time, Because Sages were considered chroniclers of that time. So if Mahabharata existed then Rama was Historical figure of that time and facts from his life were used to derive example. In Short If Mahabharata existed the by logic Ramayana also existed. The proof that Mahabharata existed and the Great Bharata War happened is actually there in our sky. The proof is astronomical/mathametical in nature in nature. This video is 45 mins long.

Which of the recent hundred years of events is known fully and is fully verifiable that one would expect matters of remote past to be verifiable? On what basis does such expectation come from? It needs to be understood that Ramayana and Mahabharata are not claims of historic truth but pedagogic texts. The least important aspect of their content is the historicity. Of course, there are verifiable matters, especially the astronomical events symbolically stated in the epics. That helps their dating too. What is found is that the astronomical evens of the epics belong to multiple timelines and that indicates they are compilations that accumulated knowledge in multiple phases. Archaeological evidence is unlikely to establish anything, because a single finding can be explained in multiple ways and no single narrative can be a convincing verification. ",

If you dont believe me just think about it yourself both of the epics might have happened maybe not in the way it is described now. All those years of being passed down from one generation to another it is obvious that many people added a lot more extra information to it. They mix the original versions with their local history or folk tales. The ramayana and the mahabharata are epics which are epic. Truth is never interesting without a little bit of mythology to it. That is why many people added their imagination to it. Hope this helped:):):) ",

Such correspondence will be the proof we seek. I know of at least one person who has followed Shri Rama\u2019s journeys all through India. His name is Dr. Ramavatar Sharma. He has written at least one delightful book, which I bought earlier. It comes with a DVD of his travels through the places associated with Shri Rama\u2019s journey. Here is his website.

Events in history has been narrated by Valmiki and Veda Vyasa as experience of different characters, with a larger intention that through such \u2018Itihasas\u2019, that people who find the Vedas and Upanisads difficult can understand the messages of Vedas and explanation of Vedic mantras in Upanisads through reading of the Ituhaaas.

This is explained in brief by Sri Rama. Veda Vyasa inspired by the Ramayana narrates how adharmic practices are done by people under the notion that they are correct, with the result, masses suffer. So to emphasise and elaborate, there may have been fictional characters or fictional events, introduced. For us living in these times, the two great Itihasas can be read, evaluated and decide on the right practices that can be applied to the modern days. Understanding the vedic concepts of sathyam, dharma, law and order, justice, right action and coming to a conclusion the right living, we can apply, modify the practices and live a peaceful life. ",

No one or no amount of evidence will be able to prove this to be true if you do not believe it, you will always find something contradictory to prove otherwise or vice-versa . There is not enough scientific explanation behind any of the miracles that occured It's just your faith and belief . Basically these stories had been written to guide people in various spheres of life. If you ask my view, I choose to believe the stories to be true. It gives me a feeling of being guarded by a supreme force. A force that is capable of creating miracles like Krishna in Mahabharata or Rama in Ramayana. It gives me a assurance that all the good done by me is being watched by someone, a feeling that however difficult be the situation that I confront there is an all powerful force standing by me helping me out. Whatever these texts might be reality or just stories, there is a lot to learn from them. Even if one considers them to be just stories, a little bit of good advice does no harm. ",

Some reasons why they cannot be pure myths are:- Geographical locations are so accurate that it's impossible to be work of pure fiction. Even timelines of events match. E.g. Timeline for Lord Rama to reach Lanka.scientific study has shown the exact path followed by Lord Rama based on plants mentioned in epic.Mahabharata mentions position of constellations. Almost impossible for Ved Vyas to conjure such a work of fiction in an era when fiction writing was non existent.The epics might predate Aryan arrival as Aryans were agricultural warrior society, while these epics indicate a highly developed society.The no of characters, their complete family trees, the minutest details of their lives indicate that such a narration is possible for actual events and is never seen in fiction.Factually accurate narration of events of the two epics without an iota of exaggeration if ever done would be a massively wonderful thing ",

Again Jaimini Maharshi also wrote an astrological work called Jaiminiya Sutropanishad in which he records the exact date of expounding the sutra. Because it is very fundamental duty of any astrologer to keep track of time of everything. So in his opening three sutras he codified that instance which is verified to be prior to the birth of Yuddhisthara and it is on 3242 BCE as I proved in the corresponding playlist:About Jaimini Maharshi: About Jaimini Maharshi - YouTube Not only that, he even coded as when in future (from 3242BCE) the process of recording in written form is going to take place which is 2542 BCE or 2400 BCE if taken from beginning of Kali era. This date of future events are foreseen by Maharshi because he knows very much about the 900 yrs of drought to be happening due to drying up of river saraswati. This long drought is also visioned by many seers, which is evident from Srimad Bhagavatam where many seers assemble at naimisharanya to perform 1000 year sacrifice. He even records many such events in his Sutropanishad in very coded form. There are many such scriptures and it is not right for being an Indian to negate them without studying them properly.

But that does not make it any less real. My answer to a similar question here : Deepak Prabhakar's answer to Mythology: How correct am I in believing that (Hindu) mythology is actually just philosophical fiction? If so, is it logical to worship it? ",

The rama setu that was built was rama amry (which in dhanushkodi,near rameshwaram) gives a evidential fact that Ramayana had occured. Similarly there are few places in many parts of India and as well as Srilanka, that has evidental fact of Rama's existence in this planet.Coming to Mahabharat, there are few evidences in northern part of India which proves that great battle of kurukshetra had ocuured. There are many temples that were built by pandavas still exist and are still worshipped. One good example would be kedarnath nath temple, which pandavas had built to worship shiva in their exile.",

In my opinion the knowledge of Mahabharata, Ramayana etc was revived in this period (pre-aryan/Aryan civilization) and this was way too long after it actually happened. I think it is a mystery but nevertheless the truth when I say that Mahabharata happened during a period when according to current data human existence was absent on Earth. I am sure time will prove the above statements beyond doubt. It definitely remains that some big discoveries are yet to be made. ",

Ramayana, for instance, is the story  of a fight between the earthly incarnations of Vishnu and two of  Vishnu's _dwarapalakas_ (door keepers). Vishnu and his three doormen had  been cursed by some sages to be born on earth. The two who were born as  Ravana and Kumbhakarna had chosen a quick way to finish their sentences  by accepting Vishnu's offer to be his enemies in their human  incarnations, whereas the third (born as Vibheeshana) chose to be borne  innumerable times on earth for singing Vishnu's praises.  Therefore, the  fight between Rama and Ravana was NOT really one of good against evil,  but only part of completing the punishment given to them by the sages ",

Remember such events are extremely rare. He showed that during the last 5000 years, the number of such eclipsesq were indeed very very few and one of the event indeed matched with the date in Mahabharta. Another thing is the location of the moon in Pushya constellation during the eclipse (which is mentioned in Ramayana as well as Buddhacharita). Although these are not direct evidences.

Yes indeed, I do the same!The Mahabharata and Ramayana were meant to teach life lessons to common people in the form of palatable stories instead of heavy philosophical stuff.  The Ramayana and Mahabharata weren't written in a day or two, they were stories of localised conflicts which were later on expanded and added over centuries. They underwent many revisions, and became the epics that are now.  \"If yes,then why are they the building blocks of whole religious structure of India,and are followed so rigorously?\"Because, the texts are supposed to be a part of Hinduism. Rama and Krishna being the avatars of Vishnu himself, people would naturally worship them. And given the nature of the books, they (might've) became quickly popular. ",
