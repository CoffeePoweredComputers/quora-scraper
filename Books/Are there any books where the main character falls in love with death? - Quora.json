            "answer_text": "Well, there's \u201cDeath Takes A Holiday\u201d, which has had two movies made from the source 1924 Italian play script, one in 1934, and \u201cMeet Joe Black\u201d in 1998. It also was a Broadway play in 1929, and they did a TV version in 1971 AND tried a musical version on Broadway in 2011. In my opinion, both the original black and white movie and the 1998 were excellent, though the story tweaked a little bit between versions. Can't speak about the play versions, though, since I never got to see those. ",
