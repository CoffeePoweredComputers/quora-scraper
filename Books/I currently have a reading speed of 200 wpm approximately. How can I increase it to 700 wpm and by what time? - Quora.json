            "answer_text": "I only have 2 minutes to answer so I will add more to this answer (soon when I get time) on actual reading speed However I feel the most important and least known recent development in speed reading is in audio books You wont quite get 700 WPM with this, but it is the method I use most regularly. If you open an Audible account (Google Audio books) and buy a book you can speed up the speed the author reads at x 3 times the design reading speed. At this speed depending on the clarity and stucato voice quality of the reader you can listen to upto 50% of books you buy. At 2.5 times the speed you can listen to 90\u201395% of books with very little practice. As the average reading speed of an audiobook is between 150\u2013180PM this should get you to 375\u2013540 WPM within a week and the good thing is this is long term gain with very little effort i.e. you can listen to a whole book at this speed even if you loose concentration The hardest this I found with improving actual speed reading capabilities with your eyes, is maintaining concentration i.e. you will hit 700WPM for periods then you get a leg cramp and adjust your seating position, loose concentration and you are back to reading at 400WPM to be continued\u2026 ",
