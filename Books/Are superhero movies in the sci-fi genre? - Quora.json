            "answer_text": "Sometimes. We view superheroes through the lens of our time. When the golden age of comics began, in the late 1930s, magic and mysticism were the most common sources for superpowers. In the late 1950s - 1960s, the silver age of comics, the world was becoming fascinated with the atomic age and the space age. Science offered a bold and exciting future, so the superheroes had their origins retold using science as the source. But using science as an explanation doesn\u2019t make a story science fiction. Science fiction is fiction based upon an extrapolation. The writer looks at the world of science and extrapolates where that science may lead. They then ask how that would affect the lives and world of the story\u2019s characters. Genre is defined as - \u201ca category of artistic, musical, or literary composition characterized by a particular style, form, or content.\u201d A film can use the characteristics of multiple genre. Frankenstein is considered the first science fiction story, but it is also a story of the gothic horror genre. The first Captain America film equally combines the science fiction and period war genres. The second Captain America pulls back on the science fiction and emphasizes the espionage genre. The intent of the story is key to genre determination. Scientific ideas like mutations may be essential to creating a character like Wolverine, but a film like Logan isn\u2019t that interested in examining the effects of science. Logan is not sci-fi, it is a western. The questions the writers want to investigate are investigated using the characteristics of a western. The story of Iron Man is based upon looking at the state of fields like robotics and nanotechnology and extrapolating where they might lead. The writers asked \u201cwhat would it be like if a man could build a mechanical suit? What could they do? How would it change them? How would it change their world?\u201d That is science fiction. The story of Captain America is based upon looking at the state of fields like biochemistry, pharmacology, and kinesiology and extrapolating where they might lead. The writers asked \u201cwhat if we could use medical technology to make the perfect soldier? What could that soldier do? How would it change them?\u201d That is science fiction. The story of Ant-Man is a bit more questionable. The idea of shrinking a person down can be dressed in science fiction like vocabulary and structure, but it isn\u2019t really a straight forward extrapolation of science as we know it. Science fiction allows a couple of leaps of faith that someone will figure out how to do something that seems impossible, today, but if to get to that point isn\u2019t really explainable via science extrapolation, then the story becomes fantasy. Doctor Strange and Thor like to frame their stories using Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s third law- \u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d but they aren\u2019t extrapolations of our science. They are fantasy. Guardians of the Galaxy may be set in space, but contrary to popular belief, having a story set in space doesn\u2019t make it science fiction (I\u2019m looking at you Star Wars). If the extrapolation of our science is what gets our story into space, then science fiction may be an applicable label, but if the technology is all alien, not so much. Spider-Man arose from the science fiction craze of the 1950s in which man messes with nature and creates something new and unexpected. But, although Spider-Man received his powers as a result of science experiments, that isn\u2019t what the story is about. Whether the spider was made in a lab or was a natural mutation or was magic (that\u2019s been addressed in the comics), it doesn\u2019t really change the story. The story is about what happens when a kid gets great power. How he got that power doesn\u2019t matter. ",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. Superhero films are a subgenre of action films. Most superhero films are in the action and adventure genres. But depending on how every superhero got his/her superpowers, superhero films can be either sci-fi or fantasy, or even both. Or further, none of them. However, we must not forget that sci-fi refers to a speculative genre. It doesn\u2019t just refer to one or two scenes or just some tech. Sci-Fi is a genre invested more in the possibilities, discoveries, inventions, impacts of science and concepts like space travel etc. So I don\u2019t think just using science fiction elements actually make these superhero films into science fiction for real unless it\u2019s a major component of them. While fantasy films are normally invested in characters with powers that don\u2019t really need a scientific explanation. Here lies the difference. SF is more inclined towards the world. Fantasy is more inclined towards characters with extraordinary characters. But\u2026 Superhero films fit the best in the definition of action films. Action films feature action sequences, with characters often into physical challenges, especially (not necessarily) pitted against villains they have to fight and overcome the obstacles set by them. Almost every superhero has to fight a villain and his army, something which happens in action films. Just like Batman, for example, fights criminals using his combat skills, John McClane fights the criminals in a similar way with the intention of saving the day too (the only thing is, he kills them).

First, they generally ignore little things like physics, kinetics, etc. Second, the powers usually have a soft explanation for how they work. Iron Man's armor works because that's what the plot requires. Third, the worlds work in ways that are not by any means realistic. From who takes care of collateral damage to how secret identities work. In short; not science fiction. ",
