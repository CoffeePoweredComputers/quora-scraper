            "answer_text": "I am reading books by designers -Guy Nordenson and Charles H. Thornton. Guy Nordenson's book is called \"Patterns and Structure: Selected Writings\". I got the book after Guy Nordensons (Structural engineering professor at Princeton University) visited Cooper Union. The book \"Patterns and Structure\" covers essays written on a range of topics from technical reports on seismic design, to engineering history and architectural literature/criticisms. He does mention his personal life, but the focus is on the writings about engineering, art, architecture and literature. Charles H. Thornton's book is called \"A life of Elegant Solutions\" is about the life of Dr. Charles H. Thornton. Richard Tomasetti and Charles Thornton started the company Thornton Tomassetti (which has recently merged with another famous structural engineering firm called Weidlinger Associates). The book is written in an autobiographical format. The book is segmented into three parts consisting his origins, professional life and goals/innovation to inspire the next generation. It details his personal and professional life in New York, Chicago, Taipei, and Malaysia. His goal of writing the book was to get people excited about joining the field of ACE (Architecture, Engineering and Construction). ",
