            "answer_text": "It's tough with just use of NCERT because Using just NCERT you won't be able to score high so it's good that you refer another reference as well. Through NCERT you can clear your concepts and basic but for more reference is good to refer. If we talk about particular NCERT textbook and NCERT examplr and exercise then it covers almost 70/80% of the exam questions because NCERT is common to book for the preparation so every student refer that book So apart from that you can select 32-year chapter wise questions by MTG for preparation because it's good reference book for the preparation it's good to use this kind of books for three major subjects (Physics, chemistry,Bio) You can also Refer Trueman for different types of objectives and question-answer. It helps a lot for the preparation and you can do well in the exam through these book. With that, you can also refer online videos as well it helps you to clear your doubt very quickly. You have many certain options for that like you have Toppr: the better learning app which provides complete free video tutorial for NEET. I hope my answer helps you. Thank you \ud83d\udc4d All the best!! ",

            "answer_text": "If I talk about this year's NEET question paper of biology you can see that almost 82 or 83 questions came from NCERT textbook. Not every one of them was direct but still were doable by reading the bible properly. I did a huge mistake of neglecting NCERT biology and ended up getting only 289. I missed some of the questions which were directly from the lines of the book. Now your answer- yes! You can score well above 300 by reading only NCERT. But do solve MCQs. Don't get distracted by coaching materials. These contain lot of BS. Only you can read human physiology and genetics portion from them. Best of luck! ~ _ ~ ",
