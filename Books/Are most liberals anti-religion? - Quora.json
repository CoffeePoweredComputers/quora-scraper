            "answer_text": "I usually try and avoid using the figurative broad brush to paint a certain segment of society. If Liberals are not mostly anti-religion then I think it\u2019s safe to point out that a larger proportion of Liberals are more outspoken in their criticism of religion than people that adhere to a more conservative political philosophy. Actually I should clarify that a little. A greater proportion of Liberals are outspoken in their criticism of Judaeo-Christian religious observance and the still visible foot print it has left behind from a time not too long ago where it was as ubiquitous as the a county courthouse or the city jail or the local branch of a Carnegie Library. While Judaeo-Christian institutions, practices, observances, and traditions are on an inexorable decline within the Western world its lineaments are still with us and will likely shape our society for some time to come. It\u2019s likely that Christmas will always be with us, of course depending on how many Liberals your area has and/or people of another faith you might be calling it Winter Solstice or something stupid cringe worthy like that. Earlier I mentioned that many Liberals have problems with Judaeo-Christian religion an more specifically any public observance or symbolism, etc. They strongly believe in the separation of church and state and I\u2019d say that many conservatives are as well, but they tend to take this concept a bit too far sometimes. However, it\u2019s interesting to see how they behave when we\u2019re talking about the Islamic faith. You see for most Liberals, they put race before any other factor. Usually people of the Islamic faith are also from the Near East and parts of Southeast Asia. Yep, they\u2019re minorities in countries like the US, the UK, Germany, etc. This means, \u201cHot Damn!\u201d they\u2019re an oppressed, disaffected, victimized minority group to be added to the Left\u2019s plantation system of victimized minority subgroups!!! You won\u2019t hear a peep out of Liberals over how antithetical Islam is to pretty much everything Liberals stand for from Gay Rights to Women\u2019s Rights. In places like Germany and Sweden where crime has shot up significantly coinciding with the influx of Muslim immigrants the situation is virtually ignored by the government. So I guess in closing, many Liberals may be anti-religion, but they are also rather selective with which religion they like to target lest they meet the same fate as those Danish cartoon artists a few years back.

            "answer_text": "Why do liberals hate religion? First off, let\u2019s clear some things up like the fact that the so-called \u201cliberals\u201d are not liberal at all; they are \u201cLeftists\u201d who are the least tolerant and most controlling of any group and do not support individual liberties at all. Second, the intolerant dictatorial Leftists who attempt to call themselves \u201cliberals\u201d do not \u201chate religion\u201d, they hate Christianity. Leftists are perfectly fine with religions and even share the majority of commonalities with many \u201creligions\u201d. What Leftists hate are Christians who don\u2019t subscribe to \u201creligion\u201d but have a personal relationship with God. Leftists hate those of us who Christians, because we actually practice unity, because the one thing the Leftists simply cannot tolerate is unity, because without peddling hate, discontent, racism, class warfare and so forth, the Leftists ideology would die out. Leftists simple cannot tolerate the Christian doctrine that all individuals are equal regardless of any adjective which can be used to describe the individual. Nope, Leftists cannot allow people to be unified, which is why they always demand that people separated by adjectives. Just take some time and peruse around Quora and see how Christians and Christianity is systematically attacked by the Leftists, yet other religions are either given pass or even defended \u2026 not because the Leftists are showing tolerance, but because they\u2019re perfectly fine with false religions, especially those that have the same core values of peddling hate, discontent, class warfare and other divisionism as the Leftists practice.

We thought, \u201cyou tricked us, we don\u2019t like you anymore.\u201d I\u2019ve seen obvious discrimination by liberals (liberals as an ideology, different from democrats as a party) toward christians. I had a discussion with a lady at work about whether or not we should say Merry Christmas. She said that mentioning Christmas wasn\u2019t inclusive. I pointed out that much of Christmas has been neutered to appeal to a larger audience. interestingly enough she thought it was okay to say happy Hanukkah. \u201cSo you can say one religion\u2019s holiday but not another?\u201d \u201cWell, they\u2019re Christians,\u201d then she scoffed. Given this is anecdotal I don\u2019t project this upon democrats but this does seem to be a leftist ideological tenant. Christians are the whites of religion.

A converse statement, that \u201cthe anti-religion crowd is likely to be liberal,\u201d is more likely true. Today\u2019s Conservative will more likely hold quite fundamentalist views also favored by the fundamentally religious. I doubt that it could honestly be said that \u201cmost liberals\u201d or even \u201cmany liberals\u201d hold anti-religion feelings. I suspect that many liberals, like myself, simply hold little interest in or attention to religion. That\u2019s not the same as holding any animus toward religion. There are LOTS of things that make people happy, and maybe even help them help others and make the world a better place, but that just haven\u2019t sparked MY interest. I know the same holds true with some of my interests holding no value for others. Where I, and liberals, and even conservatives who value consistent beliefs in their lives, where we differ with religiosity \u2014 displays of claimed religious value, actions, and attitudes \u2014 is where the actions of those claimants clearly belie their protestations of faith and belief in religious principles. The mega-\u201dchurches\u201d that ignore biblical teachings against laying up wealth on earth, and instead enrich their pastors tax-free. The \u201cchurches\u201d that trample on the rights of their neighbors by flouting zoning ordinances and restrictions. The \u201cchurches\u201d and politicians who use each other to get ahead. The \u201cchurches\u201d that preach messages of hate. To those who seek to live good, upstanding lives based on ethical and moral principles, whether derived from Jesus Christ or other religious or non-religious teachings, we liberals salute you and wish you all the best.

            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t. We\u2019re perfectly fine with others practicing their faith and pursuing their own freedom of conscience. Freedom from a state religion, and from the coercion of a state in favor of any faith, was one if the many rallying cries of the American Revolution, after all. Pay homage to Jesus, the Buddha, Moses, Allah, Ganesha, the Four Winds, or Baphomet all you want, or don\u2019t. Enjoy being a private citizen as you pursue enlightenment, and exercise that freedom of conscience that so many have died for. What we despise, however, is when the faithful just don\u2019t seem to be able to grasp that concept. In those cases, the pious are offended because their faith is not considered the fairest of them all, and thus not worthy of special protections and exemptions from the state. \u201cClearly, the rest of us must hate God!\u201d, they proclaim while clutching their pearls in shock. It is not very persuasive, by the way, when the faithful are intolerant, belligerent, and obnoxious. (See another answer below from a pastor in training who insists that the Leftists - yes, capitalized - are the intolerant ones. Hoo boy.) Conservative Christians, especially evangelicals, are the ones most offended, it seems. Now, it doesn\u2019t help their cause that most of their messages are completely antithetical to Christ\u2019s actual teachings, and that they usually and sadly confuse status (money, celebrity, and power) with morality. (Jesus really was one of those hippies your grandmother warned you about.) What they really hate is the idea that their faith just.. well, just isn\u2019t that special. Sorry, salvation doesn\u2019t confer any special rights and privileges among the rest of us. Not on Earth, anyway. Being saved doesn\u2019t allow anyone to cut in line, or to upgrade their seats to first class without paying, or to super-size at no cost. And it certainly does not mean that the faithful or their faith\u2019s tenets deserve special treatment from the government - or that denying such unwarranted privileges is \u201cpersecution\u201d. So no, we don\u2019t \u201chate religion\u201d. In fact, we believe that everyone who wants it should have it. But honestly, we do get disgusted whenever the self-proclaimed righteous manage to debase themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "Liberals don\u2019t usually hate religion unless religious people are violating them in some way. There are two reasons for liberals not hating religion. First liberals usually don\u2019t hate. Hate is a conservative emotion, not a liberal one. Second religion can be done in a very liberal way. Parts of the bible for example are rather liberal. Especially the teachings directly attributed to Jesus are liberal, as they focus on the powerless, include outgroups and denounce being judgemental or feelings of superiority. One could say, that Jesus was a liberal Hippy. Note, there is a lot of conservative stuff in the bible as well, but all religions have become very much pick and choose, select your moral high ground. Yet there is a good reason why liberals don\u2019t like religion and why liberal societies shed religion. If you look at this here, Review : Liberals and Conservatives rely on different sets of moral foundations \u2013 1/2 => one finds, that liberalism dislikes purity, ingroup focus and authority. Most religions are based on ingroup focus, authority and purity. Especially some \u201cChristian\u201d evangelical groups and many Islamist movements rely very much on authoritarian, almighty father figures, which shouldn\u2019t be doubted and where sin makes you unclean. Interestingly you can usually only be cleaned if you pledge total loyalty to the ingroup. These religions are very much denounced by liberals. Evident in some of the clearly non liberal answers to this question, the devout religious people feel threatened by this kind of rejection. If you think of your belief system as the only way to be good, any criticism will shake the foundations of your self. But if I consider a religion a pile of smelly brown excrement, I don\u2019t hate it. Sh*t is a part of the natural cosmos. It doesn\u2019t help anybody to hate reality ;-) ",

Among those who haven't had such experiences, it might be a result of peer/familial influence and wanting to exibit a sense of loyalty to the people they hang out with. Also, we have to recognize that some people believe that religious afilliation indicates a lack of intelligence/education. While some religious people might appear to have that problem, there are also many in the anti-religion camp who are not nearly as well-educated as they believe that they are. ",

            "answer_text": "This has been repeatedly explained in great detail, in many different ways, by a great many people, often insiders. The Bible itself is a book about: \u201creligion vs the gospel\u201d (Google image search). In essence religion and God's word, or message, the liberating gospel of grace, are mortal enemies. The protoevangelium or protevangelium announces this, in the form of the first written death sentence against religion. Religion is the reason 86% of American Christians have attitudes and/or actions that are more like the Pharisees than like Jesus (Barna, 2013). Religion is the reason America is the worst of the 21 wealthiest countries surveyed by socio-economic epidemiologists Kate Pickett and Richard G. Wilkinson in their book \u201cSpirit Level\u201d. Religion is the reason why the three best states in America are outside the Bible belt, and the three worst are inside the Bible belt (in the same book). Back to the Bible. Saul is a product of religion. Paul is a product of the un-redacted gospel message. There is nothing religion secretly hates, fears and opposes more than the un-redacted gospel message \u2013 God's only and ultimate solution for all that ails humanity. Religion therefore entrenches dysfunction (sin). The Bible's explicit condemnation of religion begins in Genesis 3:15 and continues through Matthew 23 esp v15, John 8:44, Galatians 3 and Revelation 18. GodHatesReligion .org .au is another resource.

            "answer_text": "To be fair, they DON\u2019T hate Islam. They don\u2019t seem to have a problem with Buddhism or Hinduism either. They hate Christianity and Judaism because, somewhere inside, they suspect these religions might be true. If these religions are true (or substantially true), then their worldview crumbles. Why? Because modern liberalism/leftism has a basic belief in moral relativism. If there is truth in religion, then there exists an objective morality. Actions are good or evil regardless of context. So, they can\u2019t defend BLM riots and attack a white supremacist riot. They would have to acknowledge both are objectively wrong. The Judeo-Christian ethic also has the idea of innate human nature that includes a propensity for evil (Original Sin). This undermines their idea that man is perfectible with enough oversight by experts, governments, social workers etc. An unchanging, fixed human nature also subverts their more bizarre ideas about human malleability; transgenderism for example. They\u2019ll never admit it, but their objection to religion is a disguised objection to Truth. Truth that exists independent of their perception or assessment means they are required to conform to reality, not fashion it. If there is a God, then they are not God\u2026.. ",

He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.\u201d John 8:44. \u201cBut for the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death..\u201d Revelation 21:8.

Jesus wanted people to give their belongings away, possibly to charities. Liberals are like that, too. In this regard, it seems conservatives are anti-Christian.
