            "answer_text": "The Catechism of the Council of Trent, a.k.a. The Roman Catechism, of 1566, (http://www.saintsbooks.net/books/The%20Roman%20Catechism.pdf) is a very good place to start. But it is not the place to conclude. The Catechism of the Catholic Church (Catechism of the Catholic Church) builds upon that foundation and offers an overview of Catholic belief from A to Z. However, it is a challenging read and so a summarized version exists known as the Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church (Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church). There is also a very important magisterial document on divine revelation, Dei Verbum (Dei verbum), which offers the traditional Catholic understanding of Sacred Scripture. Similarly, Sacrosanctum Concilium (Sacrosanctum concilium) offers the Catholic understanding of the Sacred Liturgy. One more thing to add to your reading list: Pope Saint John Paul II\u2019s Fides et Ratio (Fides et Ratio (14 September 1998)) which offers the Church\u2019s perennial understanding of both faith and reason. This 1998 encyclical also gives an important framework for understanding how and why there is a development of doctrine over time\u2014and how new discoveries and realizations about the material world can impact the Church\u2019s understanding of things. I hope this reading list helps! ",

            "answer_text": "It's strange that the most obvious answer is not yet listed: the Catechism. It contains most of Catholic beliefs, doctrine, dogma and morals and is a great reference even to Catholics. A great introduction to it is the \"compendium\". You can find both here: www.vatican.va/archive/ccc/index.htm and also in bookstores. You may find a good deal in sites such as betterworld and abebooks. I think the Catechism is the single most important source on learning about Catholicism.  Also, there are older catechisms, one of them easily read since it takes the form of a FAQ: www.cin.org/users/james/ebooks/master/pius/pindex.htm  If you want a deeper companion, look for Fr. Trese's \"The Faith Explained\" and Pope's himself \"Introduction to Christianity\". I think they are the books that best explain Catholic belief. So, to summarize: - To know what is indeed Catholicism: the catechisms- To know why is Catholicism the way it is: \"The Faith Explained\" and \"Introduction to Christianity\" Hope it helps. ",
