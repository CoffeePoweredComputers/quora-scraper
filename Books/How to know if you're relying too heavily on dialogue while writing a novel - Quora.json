            "answer_text": " I agree that there is no formulaic amount of prose, dialogue, description, etc. that works. One of my favorite authors is Raymond Carver, the King of economy and brevity. I spent years writing short stories, a lined pad, 10 pages, don\u2019t take the pen off the page. It comes out to 3 1/2 pages typed. Carver really helped me write those 50+ short stories and hone my focus on getting to the point, playing out the scene. I read a lot of Henry James in school and will return to Henry James if ever I\u2019m on Death Row because time will seem endless. But he got paid by the word so the left tassel on the hind drape behind grandmother\u2019s teak stand which was once rescued from a fire on a ship that was marooned on a beach which explains the tear in the carpet, was his breadth of constant, expansive language and description of the physical world. Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabelle Allende are good for where that vase is from and who was the sculptor and what was the tale of their lost love. Where description tumbles into a whole story unto itself. Gabo is very good at pulling you back into the story after he\u2019s digressed for ten pages. I of course love Toni Morrison but her dialogue is weighty, meaningful, it\u2019s powerful dialogue. It all means something. Everything means something. The prose is therefore almost a part of the dialogue. My favorite dialogue writer is Edward Albee and Tennessee Williams\u2014-I live for Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? I watch it , read it for a Masters Class in dialogue. Williams in some of the lesser famous plays\u2014-Rose Tattoo, etc had to play with saying what he meant, making his characters both creative and crude in language so I like those. I\u2019m also a big fan of Sophocles. I think you can\u2019t rely too heavily on dialogue, in fact as I think about it, it\u2019s what people mean by having an \u201cear\u201d for dialogue. When people sound real, or at least real to their world. Strong characters and interaction, conflict happens with that mix occurring. I often try to work into Elmore Leonard\u2019s advice\u2014-I re-did an entire 500 page novel, removing He/She said and it made the novel stronger because I had to take out weighty descriptions of how someone said and instead use really good turns and twists of language and timing. I did a word search and it was something like 2000+ saids throughout the document. Now I cringe when I have to use said and I go back to making each character\u2019s diction, syntax, personal enough that the reader can identify them without my having to put descriptors at the end. That\u2019s been fun and challenging. #KylePhoenix #KylePhoenixShow ",

If you have a good story and succeed in communicating it well, you\u2019ve done what you were supposed to do. Share your stuff with some people who will give you honest feedback and see if you did that. ",
