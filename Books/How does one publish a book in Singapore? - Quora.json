            "answer_text": "There are 3 routes you can take. The first route is the traditional way of finding a publisher. The difficulty with this route is that local publishers aren't willing to take risks with first-time authors. It's a business, you see, and if they can't make money from publishing and selling your book, they're not going to risk it. Better to publish books by established authors. From an author\u2019s perspective, you also lose control and rights over the book, in exchange for a measly 10\u201315% royalties. You are still expected to put in the work to sell the book. The great part is that the publisher will handle the distribution to bookstores and some of the marketing. An alternative to this route is to get published internationally, where publishers are more risk-taking. Choose this method if you are an established person in your field and can use your influence over thousands of people to sell books. The second route you can take is to self-publish your book. This method gives you full control over the book, but it also means you do all the work. Some self-publishing companies will provide services such as editing, proofreading and layout design. But you're responsible for almost everything else. With self-publishing, you retain full sales proceeds and have to do all the work yourself. You also pay for everything on your own. Choose this method if you're a relative unknown or if sale of books is not your primary objective for writing a book. The third route is to crowdfund the book. There exist services that allow you to pitch a book first, and crowdfund the cost of publishing the book. This is great because it allows you to see if people will want to buy the book based on a synopsis and maybe 1\u20132 chapters. It allows people to place pre-orders which funds the book. It is like coming up with an MVP for a product. And if you can't raise sufficient funds, it probably means that not enough people will buy the book if you do publish it. Use this method if you're confident the book can sell. This method is for validation. Publishing a book is simply printing it out in a book format. Nothing special to it. If you need an ISBN, get it from National Library Board. ",

Feel free to ask them any and every silly question about publishing that pops in your head. In some ways, the phone conversation is a sales pitch with which they hope you will engage them to print your book but you will work your way out of that, yes? ",
