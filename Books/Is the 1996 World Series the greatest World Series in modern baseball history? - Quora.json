            "answer_text": "No and it\u2019s not even close. The 1996 World Series went only six games, and fter winning the first two in New York, couldn\u2019t score two runs for John Smoltz in game five or four runs for Greg Maddux in game six. Smoltz, Maddux, Andy Pettitte, and Jim Key pitched well enough, and the series was closer than it looks on paper, but it wasn\u2019t the best of that decade or even the best of the Braves Yankees World Series match-ups. The 1957 World Series when Lew (or Lou) Burdette pitched three complete game win over the Yankees - the last on two days rest - was a better series. In the 1957 World Series Burdette became the first pitcher since Christy Mathewson, to toss two shut outs in a World Series, and the first in 37 years to throw three complete games in a World Series and win all three games. In those three games he allowed 21 hits, struck out 13 and walked only 4, one intentionally, while pitching to a 0.67 ERA and 0.926 WHIP, and was named World Series MVP. The 1991 World Series, when Jack Morris pitched ten innings to win game seven 1\u20130, was a better series. The Twins and Braves played to a dead heat after the first six games of the 1991 World Series. Two of the those games went extra innings, with the Braves winning game three in 12 innings and the Twins winning games six in 11 innings. Games seven saw John Smoltz and Jack Morris pitching magnificent baseball through eight innings. Booby Cox removed Smoltz after 7 1/3 innings, but Morris stayed in the game through ten. The 2001 World Series when the Diamondbacks and Yankees went seven games after the 9/11 attack. The Diamondbacks went up 2-1 series lead and lead in the ninth inning of game four, but Tino Martinez took Byung-Hyun Kim deep to tie the game, and Derek Jeter walked it off in the tenth. Game five looked like fame four with Kim in again to protect a 2-0 lead, and he gave up another two-run home run to Scott Brosius evening up the game. It stayed locked up until the home twelfth, Alfonso Soriano singled to drive in the winning run. The Snakes crushed the Yankees 15-2 in game six, forcing a game seven in Phoenix. The Yankees were on top 2\u20131 going into the home ninth with Mariano Rivera on the bump to close it out. Arizona git a start when Mark Grace poked a single to left, and Tony Womack tied it up with a double. Damien Miller reached on an error, Jay bell bunted (badly) and reached on a fielder\u2019s choice caught the the runner at third. Rivera hit Craig Counsell, then Luis Gonzalez dumped bloop single over a drawn in infield and the Diamondback claimed the title. The 2014 World Series when the Giants, behind the pitching of Madison Bumgarner, won in seven games was a better series. The Giants and Royals alternated wins, with Bumgarner starting and winning games one and five. After Ryan Vogelsong imploded early, in game three, the Giants\u2019 bullpen - mostly Yasmiro Petit - kept them in the game while the lineup regained the lead. Games seven looked much like game three. Tim Hudson gave up two runs in 1 2/3 innings, Jeremy Affeldt pitched 2 1/3 shutout innings, and the Giants put a one up in the top of the fourth. Madison Bumgarner came in for the bottom of the fourth and shut the Royals down for five innings. There are more, Phillies Blue Jays 1993, 1967 Cardinals- Tigers and 1968 Cardinals Tigers, to name a few. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on what qualifies as \u201cmodern,\u201d I\u2019d probably go with 2014, the Series where MadBum dragged the San Francisco Giants to the championship over the Kansas City Royals, making their first postseason appearance in 29 years. Bumgarner won Games 1 and 5 of the Series, the latter in the first complete-game shutout pitched in a World Series game in 11 years. This put the Giants one game away from the championship, but the late Yordano Ventura pitched a brilliant Game 6 and KC won the game 10\u20130, tying the Series at three games apiece. The teams went to Game 7 both thin on pitching, but San Francisco took a 3\u20132 lead in the fourth inning and then put in Bumgarner on two days\u2019 rest. He held the Royals off the rest of the game. With two out in the ninth, Alex Gordon tagged a ball into left-center field, which was misplayed by a San Francisco outfielder and allowed Gordon to reach third base. KC third-base coach Mike Jirschele didn\u2019t think Gordon could make it home and held him at third base. Bumgarner faced KC All-Star catcher Salvador Perez, who could tie the game with a single, but got him to pop up. This is the Gordon \u201ctriple.\u201d KC fans still debate whether or not he could have made it home:  I think Jirschele made the right call. Gordon wouldn\u2019t have made it. In the Series, after MadBum dominated Game 1, the Royals won Games 2 and 3, the latter on a gutsy effort by veteran Jeremy Guthrie and the bullpen for a 3\u20132 win. However, the Giants rallied from a 4\u20132 deficit in Game 4 to win 11\u20134 and tie the Series at two games each. Bumgarner\u2019s shutout in Game 5 put them up 3\u20132, but Ventura answered back in Game 6. The Royals redeemed themselves by making it back to the World Series in 2015 and winning it, contended for most of 2016 but missed the playoffs, then went back to being the Royals. The Giants haven\u2019t been any good since this night. As for 1996, that was a six-game World Series won by the Yankees 4\u20132 over the Braves. There were some good games in that series, but I can\u2019t see any six-game series being an all-time great. The only exception might have been the 1986 NLCS, where Astros pitcher and 1986 CYA winner Mike Scott was so dominant that it felt like the Mets had to win Game 6 or else lose Game 7 and the pennant to Scott. But that wasn\u2019t a World Series, and the outstanding LCS series in both leagues that season were overshadowed by the memorable 1986 WS\u2014another good candidate for the best of the modern era if you count it back that far. But with 1996 being the first Yankee championship season in 18 years and the start of a dynasty, I imagine it is memorable to fans of that team. ",
