            "answer_text": "I can answer this from bitter experience in banking. A company which successfully files this form of bankruptcy is protected from its creditors while it (theoretically at least) comes up with a plan to reorganize. There is an automatic stay on creditors\u2019 lawsuits, and the company will often be granted permission to pledge assets like inventory and receivables for new working capital financing, which gets priority over existing debts. So as an existing creditor you can\u2019t sue, and a new creditor gets the company\u2019s current assets as collateral. The company can usually get extensions on filing any sort of plan; the plan, when it is filed, will likely not contain much if any money for unsecured creditors, given that lawyers and accountants (and salaries) continue to be paid and new lenders now have most of the assets. If you are a mortgage lender you keep your collateral but must seek court permission if you want to foreclose. If you lease property to the company, it can cancel the lease. This type of bankruptcy is supposed to be beneficial to the economy in that it allows companies which might otherwise be forced into immediate liquidation to stay in business at least for a while, saving jobs, for example, and perhaps reorganize successfully. This is at the expense of other companies which have loaned them money or provided them with goods and services for which they have not been paid. It also leaves executives who were running the company when it failed in charge for a further period. Mostly a bonanza for high-priced bankruptcy firms and \u201csuperpriority\u201d lenders. As I said, bitter experience. ",
