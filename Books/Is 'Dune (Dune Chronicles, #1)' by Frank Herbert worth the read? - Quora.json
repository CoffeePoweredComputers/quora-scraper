            "answer_text": "It is not an easy read, but it is rewarding. I read it back in high school, in the mid-1970\u2019s, and recommended it to a friend who wasn\u2019t much into science fiction, but studied politics. He loved it. But you don\u2019t have to love politics to enjoy the book. It has phenomenal world-building, relatable, often flawed, characters, intrigue, suspense, romance (well, very little, but some anyway), action, and many other nuances and aspects that can often make you gape in wonder at the scope of Herbert\u2019s imagination. So, in short, yes, very much worth the read. I also read the next two books in the series (trilogy back then), Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. I don\u2019t recommend those. Many do, but I found them truly discouraging, and really not up to the high bar set by the first novel. A number of years later, I saw another of the (by this time, many) Dune books in the grocery store bookshelf, and opened it to the first chapter to see if it grabbed me. An important character from the first book was just emerging from the cloning tanks. Again. I sighed and put the book on the shelf. So I don\u2019t think any of the other books are worth your time either. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! A lot of science fiction written during that time period dates out (everybody smoking on space ships, people talking with 1940\u2019s slang, so much casual misogyny, etc). Herbert bypassed all of that by setting the story more than ten thousand years in the future and providing a narrative reason (Butlerian Jihad) for the lack of super technological advancements. He weaves a complex history, and throws in politics, environmentalism, religion and builds not just one, but several societies and cultures and sets them all in motion. The only knock on him is the claim of something like \u2018genetic memory\u2019, but nobody\u2019s perfect. He gives you a lot to think about and a narrative framework that is fun and engaging. Do not go into the book thinking about the movies. They are totally separate animals. ",
