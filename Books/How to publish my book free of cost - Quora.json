            "answer_text": "People ask me to respond to this question periodically, so I have developed what I hope is a helpful response. \u201cHow do I publish an ebook?\u201d is a pretty broad question. It may sound basic, but you need to write a good book (interesting, well edited) on a topic that people want to read. If you have a special skill and can write a nonfiction how-to book, that would be great. People are always looking for a better way to do something \u2014 cook, learn how to cultivate a successful backyard garden, ask their book for a raise. Many topics. Fiction (what I mostly write) can be harder to find an audience for because there are soooo many books in soooo many genres. If you don\u2019t have a particular genre in mind, do some research about what sells well now. Romance still makes up almost half of the mass-market paperback sales. I write cozy mysteries, which have become especially popular the last 10 years. If you read a lot of one genre, you may find it easier to write a book in that field. The Publishing Process My overall response deals with two broad issues. First where do you do it, second how do you go about it?Companies such as Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Kobo, Google Play, and Smashwords make it possible to publish your ebook \u2014 for free. You need to load honest information about who you are (even if you use a pen name) and how you will pay your taxes on the income. You also need to provide a bank account (or in some cases a Pay Pal account) so you can be paid.You could consider loading only to Amazon and an aggregator. Smashwords is an aggregator and they load your book to a bunch of sites, such as BN, Kobo and more. They save you a lot of work. Another aggregator is Draft2Digital, but I pretty much use Smashwords. Amazon\u2019s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)http://kdp.amazon.com Smashwordswww.smashwords.com Nook Press for Barnes and Noblewww.nookpress.com Kobohttp://www.writinglife.com Google Play Partner Programhttps://play.google.com/books/pu...All of these sites have instructions about how to prepare your book, and how to load it to their site. Study these carefully. How Do You Go about Self-Publishing?I learned how by relying on the Smashwords Style Guide, which is written in an easy-to-understand format. All style guides and instructions are free to download from their respective sites.Smashwords Style Guide, an Ebook by Mark Coker Instructions are largely similar, but there are some differences. For example, Amazon wants you to do the Table of Contents (required for most books) one way, and Smashwords another way. You can list links to your other books, but Smashwords requires that all links go to your own web page or blog. Why? Because the sites to which they publish don\u2019t want you mentioning their competitors\u2019 websites. I get that.I suggest you start with Amazon. It\u2019s easy and you can preview your book immediately. You need to preview to make sure it looks as you expect.I have prepared a (free) short course called Thinking through Self-Publishing.Lifelong Dreams There is a second course (Writing and Publishing When time is Scarce) on the same site with lots of practical how-to info on writing, publishing, and marketing ($29). However, you can learn what you need by studying free info at the sites. You can also go to my blog index, where you will see lots of how-to articles. All those are free!Index Sometimes it will seem like a lot of info to absorb, but you can do it. If you get frustrated by something, take a break and come back to it.One final point. You only get one chance to make a first impression. Do not publish the first draft of your book! Put it in a drawer and come back to it a bit later so you can be a cold reader. Ask others for comments, but do remember, all choices are yours. If you can, pay for an editor. Good luck!! Elaine L. Orr ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve already done that in realizing that paying to publish is not the way that it\u2019s done. I assume that you\u2019ve already written the book. You have two choices:1. Traditional publishing 2. Independent publishing If you choose the first option, first look for an agent (about 1 in 16 are accepted by agents). Next the agent will contact publishers. If they find one expect to see your book in print in 1\u20132 years If you choose the second option you have more choices: pay someone to edit your book or do this yourselfpay someone to produce a cover or do it yourselfpay someone to format your book or do it yourselfproduce ebooks, printed \u2018print-on-demand\u2019 paper books or get conned into using a vanity publisher who will primarily help themselves to your wallet.Timescale for the independent option can be as little as a week (I\u2019ve written a book and published it in ebook and print in a week) Since you want to do everything without paying, you face a steep learning curve. Try reading some of the posts in my blog Author! Author! for help. There are loads of similar author help guides. The bad news is that editing, formatting and publishing may be harder than writing the book. The worse news is that promoting your book is far harder still and you need to get started on that now! ",
