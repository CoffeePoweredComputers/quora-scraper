            "answer_text": "The correct answer is that a chapter is exactly as long as it needs to be. That sounds flippant, even dismissive, but it's true. There is no rule that establishes best practices for chapter length. And books don't even need to have chapters that are of similar length. Establish your goals for a particular chapter, accomplish those goals, then end the chapter. Done. It is what it is. Personally (and my personal experience is not the norm by any means), I like to keep my chapters rather short, from 2000 to 8000 words. I make sure, however, to give the reader a good reason (an unanswered question, an unexpected reveal, a plot twist, etc.) to keep reading at the end of each chapter. Then (I hope) the reader looks at the length of the next chapter, sees that it's rather short, and says, \"Oh, what the heck, I gotta find out what the green star is,\" and reads on instead of turning out the light and going to sleep. And, for me, that's exactly as long as it needs to be. ",

            "answer_text": "I think chapter length is influenced greatly by the larger information culture. In contemporary fiction, chapter length varies immensely.  Authors do what they want for the effect they want.  (Whether they achieve that effect is another matter.)  Most recently chapter length has become quite unpredictable and often quite short reflecting, I believe, the way we consume information in small bundles on the Internet, on television, in podcasts, etc.  Perhaps people's attention spans have, in fact, become shorter (another debate), but for sure authors' styles often reflect how information is disseminated in the larger society. Before modern technology (radio, recording, television, films, and the Internet), people had time to devote to reading and expected to be entertained for, say, and hour or two at a sitting, not 15 seconds.  Most of Dickens's novels were serialized in magazines, and the editors of the magazines expected chapters of at least some heft that kept readers coming back for more.  He happily obliged (as did all novelists in the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of whom published serially as a way to make money, attract devoted readers, and assure decent sales of their novels when they were finally published).
