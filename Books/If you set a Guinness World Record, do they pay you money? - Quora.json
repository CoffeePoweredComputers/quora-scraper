            "answer_text": "Exactly the opposite. If you want to set or break a record, you have to pay them. Although it's possible to apply for free, the application process will give you headache and it'll be slow (3 months to process application and additional 3 months to know if you succeeded). If you want your application processed within 5 working days, you need to pay $800 if you want to break existing record or $1000 if you want to set a new record title. If you want to quickly know (within 5 working days) if you succeeded, you need to pay additional $650. If you want everything immediately, you can pay to get dedicated account manager who will also help you in the application process. The price is revealed on request. There are more paid services.
