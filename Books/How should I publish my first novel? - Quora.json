            "answer_text": "The most important advice I can give you is to finish the book first. Seriously. Life will try to get in the way. After you have finished the book, you need to find a good editor. I don\u2019t mean Mom\u2014 even if she is an English teacher. She will be able to help with grammar and punctuation, but you need someone who is more understanding of the industry and the nuances of when it is and isn\u2019t okay to break the rules of grammar and punctuation for effect. My experience with English teachers are that few are flexible enough in this area to allow for poetic license. Find a good professional editor. There are many kinds of editors, so research this. You may need to hire more than one editor so that you can get developmental editing as well as line editing. Don\u2019t skip this step, no matter what kind of final publishing you think you are going to try for. If you are self-publishing, you need to put forth your best foot. Don\u2019t publish crap. If you are aiming for being published by one of the big 5, you need to put forth your best foot and impress the hell out of them. Don\u2019t send them crap. Find a proofreader, or three. Try to get all the mistakes and typos out. You will never get all of them, but do your best. Remember, every time you touch your manuscript, you\u2019ve probably added a new mistake, so involve proofreaders LAST. All that stuff about editors is important and will cost you money. My advice is to NOT get an editor as part of a packaged deal of \u201cWe\u2019ll design your cover and publish your book for you!\u201d Those are usually scams, and if they\u2019re not, they are usually crap. Find other writers in your area, join the local community, get to know the business, and find editors who are reputable that way. Trust me on this. This is a very expensive lesson for some of us. Make sure you use contracts for EVERYTHING. Even hiring your new best friend as an editor. Even if your new best friend is Stephen King because you just met him and he loves your book and wants to edit it for you. Contracts protect that friendship. Make sure you completely understand every contract you sign. Don\u2019t trust the person/company issuing the contract to explain it to you. You need a disinterested 3rd party to explain them to you. An agent who wants to or is representing you is not a disinterested 3rd party. They make money off of you and what might be best for them in the short term might not be best for you in the long term. Remember, even when self-publishing, clicking on that button when you submit your files to be uploaded is entering a contract with CreateSpace, Ingram, Lulu, or whatever or whoever you are using. Read those EULAs! They can ruin your career if you are not careful and don\u2019t understand what you are getting into. Okay. Now that I have scared you off\u2026 The second most important thing is to not get overexcited. Keep your cool, be ready to be in this for the long haul. Do not jump at the first offer or contract you see. Read it and make sure it is good for you, or you may regret it the rest of your life. Don\u2019t decide you want to self-publish and put the book out as fast as you can. Think on it. Realize you are starting your own business. Make the best cover, get the best editing, have the best marketing strategy you can BEFORE you put the book out there. My personal recommendation is to always shoot for the stars first. Try to publish with one of the big 5 publishers. If that doesn\u2019t work, look into the mid-sized publishers. After that, consider smaller publishers. If you don\u2019t feel they can offer you what you can do yourself by self-publishing (which does happen often), then consider self-publishing. Here is my advice, summed up: Finish your book. This is the hurdle most people cannot make it over. Don\u2019t get overly excited and jump to quick mistakes when you finally finish your book. Take your time and make wise choices. This is a business and you need to learn it, or you will face the unfortunate consequences. Always put your best forward. Don\u2019t get lazy. Always have your stuff edited and proofread before you send it anywhere or to anyone. (Even an editor! The cleaner manuscript you give them, the more they can focus on helping you instead of fixing typos.) Contracts are your best friend and your worst enemy. Everything is a contract. Learn and understand them. Treat them like a loaded weapon\u2014with the utmost respect and importance. Shoot for the moon. You may not hit it, but you may land much higher than you thought you could! Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "FINISH the Book first. Do NOT pay to get it published (Money should always flow towards the Writer.) PUT THE MANUSCRIPT ASIDE for 6 months after it is done. This is your Raw Material. Your feelings towards it will change once you see where things could be tightened up, grammar corrected, etc. EDIT the book (I suggest reading not just \u201cStrunk and White\u201d but \u201cThe 10% Solution\u201d by Ken Rand, which is only $7, short, and will teach you the flow of modern English from and experienced journalist who had to write tight.) starting after month 6. DO NOT be disheartened if you go into it, and discover your priceless jewel is now in some way \u201cCrap\u201d compared to what you see on the shelf. Those books have all had a team of people working on them, and you are now trying to get it to the point where they will take you seriously and invest their man-hours into your project. LEARN basic things such as manuscript format, word count, etc. \u2014 which looks ugly (to me) but in the hands of an experienced published will tell them exactly where it will fall in their line-up once finished. JOIN not just your local writing group (which there may be at your school), but a larger group that specializes in the types of book you write. Think Romance Writers of America, Society of Children\u2019s Book Writers and Illustrators, Science Fiction Writers Association, Horror Writers Association, etc. This is very important as many traditional publishers will not accept un-agented materials, and editors and agents specialize in what they like to read. Editors and agents are approachable at conventions, held in many places, and take this as seriously as your would getting into college or a job interview (which it is). Write a COVER LETTER for your Book and yourself (less than 1 page, since agents and editors are deluged with hundreds if not thousands of hopefuls), starting with a 25-word or less opening hook, then saying why you are qualified to write it (\u201cI wrote a 70-word mystery about a sailor because I always go sailing during the summer with my family in Maine.\u201d and do not lie about your credentials, or go overboard bragging.) Compare your book to other books on the shelf that your have seen which cover similar topics. Write a SUMMARY of the entire Book, going into pertinent details, the shorter the better. (1000 words or less) NETWORK at the conventions, collecting business cards that you can then email people concerned who might be interested. BE POLITE, and write them within 24 hours, but give them 1 MONTH at least to say if they are interested or not in seeing your work. Keep you emails short, to the point, and professional. When/if they write back, DO EXACTLY what they say for submission guidelines. If all they want at first is the first 5 chapters/ 30 pages/ 2000 words, you must OBEY. Then WAIT 3 MONTHS. You are not the only person on their desk, but you are farther than most by having contacted them in person, and they actually requested your work. After 3 months, give a polite email, if they haven\u2019t said \u201csend in the rest\u201d or \u201cnot for me\u201d. Meanwhile, start work on your NEXT BOOK \u2014 assuming you want a part-time career out of this. The reason to go with traditional publishing in my point of view is because they have this wonderful thing call a marketing team. Your job is to write. Marketing sells, and rakes in a bigger piece of the pie for everyone. Make sure that if an EDITOR says \u201cthis is nice, send me what you have\u201d, you get a reputable AGENT at that point. People with agents are taken more seriously in many situations, real agents don\u2019t get paid up front, they take a percentage of the writer\u2019s profits AFTER the sale, and the agent might know other editors who would be interested as well, and you could end up in an ethically arranged bidding war. My two cents, and hope this helps. :^) ",
