            "answer_text": "Childhood obesity has serious health implications: hypertension, osteoarthritis, high cholesterol and triglycerides, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gall bladder disease, respiratory problems, emotional disturbances, and some cancers. Two in three obese children will remain obese as adults and at risk for adult lifestyle diseases. India is projected to become the diabetes capital in the world. According to WHO, childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Proven and simple strategies to prevent obesity include: Increase fruit and vegetable intake.Reduce TV viewing. Eating while watching TV is a major cause of excess food intake. TV commercials lead children toward fast foods.Reduce sugar intake. Sugar is now called the new \u2018tobacco\u2019 and must be limited at all ages. Encourage children to drink water instead of sweetened or carbonated drinks.Encourage physical activity. Due to limited time and academic pressures, physical exercise gets ignored. Parents must facilitate physical activity in young children, and 60 minutes of daily vigorous physical activity in older children.Parents as role models: Children see what parents eat! Healthy eating includes consuming more fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole-grain, and nuts. Eat fresh food. Fast foods are rich in sugar, fats, and salt and should be restricted to special occasions or weekends. Snacking and grazing is a major cause of excess calorie intake. Healthy snack options should be within reach for growing children.Cultivate healthy meal-time habits. Coaxed or coerced feeding often leads to poor self-control and later obesity. Parents need to ensure that children eat when they are hungry, and not when they are bored or tired. Food as a \u2018reward\u2019 is to be discouraged.Awareness and education at the community level are important to tackle obesity. SRCC Children\u2019s Hospital, managed by Narayana Health has now launched a special program for the promotion of healthy lifestyles, prevention, and treatment of childhood obesity \u2013 NH iCAN: Improving Children\u2019s Activity and Nutrition. The goal is to prevent Gen X from becoming Gen XXL!Source: Narayana Health (Childhood Obesity) ",
