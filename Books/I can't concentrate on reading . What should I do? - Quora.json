            "answer_text": "Accept the fact (at first) that you\u2019re finding it difficult to concentrate. I would say that that\u2019s the first step, as opposed to overloading yourself with all these guilt feelings about not being able to focus. Resisting the feeling of being overwhelmed is just going to lead to spinning your wheels in the mud, and, as they say, accepting a negative experience is actually a positive experience, while desiring a positive experience is actually a NEGATIVE experience. So, you can\u2019t concentrate. Now you know what the problem is that you need to solve. And fortunately, there are many decent ways to go about this. I would say that next comes working with your physiology. Sitting slouched over with horrible posture isn\u2019t going to make it easy for your brain to get going. Much in the same way that standing up straight with your shoulders back makes you look and feel more confident, adjusting your reading posture will help you to concentrate. Your mind and your body always work together. Third, and perhaps obviously, you should work to eliminate distractions in your environment. Even if you don\u2019t THINK that what\u2019s going on around you is hampering your concentration, it is. The conscious mind perceives only a small fraction of what makes it into your brain, and if your brain has to work overtime in order to help you focus, you\u2019re not using it to its full capacity. If you came to me for advice, I\u2019d also tell you that perhaps the problem isn\u2019t necessarily with \u201cyou\u201d but rather with your choice of reading material. Read something interesting! If you\u2019re finding it hard to concentrate on reading, pick a different book, something that you can\u2019t wait to read. I know this is easier said than done, since you may or may not have had this specific reading material \u201cthrust\u201d upon you. But to the extent that you can, it\u2019s worth it to align your reading with your REAL interests. Life isn\u2019t long enough to read boring books! In much the same way, you should engage more with your reading, if you are to find it more interesting. That means asking questions while you are reading (reading as if the author were on trial for his life), and taking notes on the important things that jump out at you. I\u2019m on my way to reading 1,000 books before I turn 30, and I have at least a half-page of notes on each book. Sometimes as many as 20 pages of notes! It keeps me focused, and, judging by the inherent fallibility of human memory, it\u2019s the best way to help you remember what you read in perpetuity. You\u2019ll find more answers to questions concerning great books and how to read them faster and more effectively (and more enjoyably) here. All the best, Matt Karamazov ",

            "answer_text": "Barring external disturbances that you \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 control, it is pretty much in your authority to invest interest where you \u2018want\u2019 to. There\u2019ll be a bunch of BS related to doing meditation, breathing yada yada but the point is , focus comes from practice and shutting the most extraneous thoughts that cross your mind. The phrase \u201ccan\u2019t concentrate\u201d simply indicates that, first the subject you are reading fails to grab your attention and second, you are distracted. And this is a deadly concoction detrimental to the effective hours spent on studying. As mentioned above, approach your reading/studying time with single minded focus on the task at hand and set aside all the irrelevant things. It\u2019s not easy and it\u2019s a habit that you\u2019ll have to cultivate, something which comes from repeated efforts and realizing the errors. A simple approach would be, to set aside just 10 minutes daily and in that 10 minute window all you have to do is read something and make sure that the mind doesn\u2019t wander into la-la land. With each successive 10 minute session that you complete you are re-wiring the distracted mind into a more focused one. A one which only has a single task at hand, without any other worldly consideration. Also, since you ask what is to be done? Try, well don\u2019t try. Do. Reduce the length of each study session from it being a grueling 3\u20134 hour torture session into a more pleasurable and manageable 1 hour session, followed by a 15 minute break.(It has already been proved that the attention span is at the peak during the first 45 minutes. SCIENCE!!). And increase the number of such sessions throughout the day, with adequate time for yourself - exercise, music, TV (although, FUCK TV, don\u2019t watch it), time with your family, run in the park etc etc. The point being, don\u2019t force yourself into studying or doing anything out of need, rather make the time you spend studying more productive.
