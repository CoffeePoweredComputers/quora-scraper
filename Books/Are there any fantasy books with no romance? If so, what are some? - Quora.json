            "answer_text": "Are there any fantasy books with no romance? If so, what are some? Waldo and Magic Inc. By Robert A Heinlein. Not actually a novel, two unrelated fantasy novellas in one publication. Waldo is about a genius who suffers from myasthenia gravis and lives in a private orbital space station. He figures out why the beamed-power grid of the world is failing. And yes, despite space stations and power grids, it IS a fantasy. Magic, Inc. happens in a world very much like our own, except that magic works and is a common every-day part of life. A bunch of thugs start selling \u2019protection\u2019 to businessmen who use magic as an integral part of their operation; one fights back. The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle. The last known unicorn sets out to find the other unicorns that have disappeared. Although the Prince does have it bad for Amalthea, it\u2019s not going anywhere. It can\u2019t. It\u2019s one-sided. It\u2019s only \u2018romance\u2019 in that it satirizes romance in fantasy. The first few books of the Garrett, P.I. series by Glen Cook. They are hard-boiled noir detective stories in a fantasy setting, and as such there are relationships between Garrett and women, but they certainly are not romance as it is usually meant. No hearts, no flowers, no longing sighs. ",

            "answer_text": "Most fantasy books I have read do end up with at least a touch of romance (because we authors just can\u2019t help ourselves sometimes) but here are a few I have read/heard of that are on the low end of the romance troupe (These do tend to be for younger readers but are interesting stories nonetheless): The Lord of the Rings/Hobbit The Green Ember Series (HIGHLY RECOMEND. They get better the farther you read.) The Wingfeather Saga Chronicles of Narnia Mistborn Series Renegades Series (Little bit of romance here but nothing over the top) Shadow and Bone Trilogy (Again, a bit of romance and drama here. There is also a related series called Six of Crows that I haven\u2019t read but heard good things about.) Hope you find something you like!! Stay safe everyone \ud83d\ude18 -Charissa ",

For example in The Lord of the Rings Aragorn\u2019s and Arwen\u2019s romance is guessed, but it\u2019s npot shown as Yennefer\u2019s and Geralt\u2019s in The Witcher saga, or the triangle Kitiara-Tanis-Laurana in the Dragonlance Chronicles. In ASOIAF\u2026 there\u2019s not much room for romance. ",
