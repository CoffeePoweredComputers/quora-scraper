            "answer_text": "Most indexes are not generated; they are written. Often they are written by the author, but professional back-of-the-book indexers bring a fresh eye to an index and will often see ways into the book that a user might look for but an author, who is so close to the material, would not see.  While the technology used to tie the index to a file will vary -- and varies a lot a the moment -- the basic process of index writing has changed very little in recent years. When I'm writing an index (I write few these days, but it used to be at least half of my freelance business), here's what I do, and it is much the same for other indexers:  During a first read of the manuscript, I make notes in the manuscript. I highlight key phrases and concepts, write down possible index entries to cover them, and note the extent of the passage.I begin at the beginning again, coding the actual index entries, including subheadings. For most books, I do this in a separate indexing program, but increasingly the terms are coded into the manuscript file, so that ebook indexes will be usable. I will often rethink the entries compared to my original notes, now that I can better see the structure of how the manuscript's parts fit into its whole.Next I read the index itself, looking for any need for better organization (more or fewer subheadings, cross-references, double-posts under different headings, and the like).Finally, I edit my own work for spelling, capitalization, punctuation, structure, alphabetization, numerical order, accidental referral loops, and the like, and I spot-check a representative portion for accuracy.The final result is nothing like what a software program could generate, regardless of whether a human does a final check. A software program alone can generate a concordance or can reproduce the structure of the manuscript. It cannot produce an index that takes into account relationships of ideas or the reader's perspective. ",

On any program capable of making a book, from Word to Quark to InDesign, some key combination defines the current word as index-level, and then a macro creates a page of all those words, alphabetized, with duplicates counted, etc.  You can also scrub that final list through a simple word count macro (listing the most common words.)  Yes, it takes a thorough reading by a human in the end, but that's the gist of it. ",
