While ADHD is characterized by a lack of focus, for a number of folks they also have a sort of \u201chyper-focus.\u201d The can zoom in on something and stay with it in an almost compulsive fashion. I heard a story of someone who was so hyper-focused on a subject that they didn\u2019t acknowledge a fire alarm in their building and the emergency responders had to get them to evacuate. If you find ADHD books that fascinating, then many ADHD people will devour them. I love just about any writing on the brain. I\u2019ve never had a problem reading books on ADHD. ",

I leave the book on my chair, or a shelf, or anyplace I\u2019m likely to see it. Whenever I do, I pick it up and read a few pages. Then I go do something else while I think about it. Having to pick it up and move it in order to sit down actually reminds me to read it. ",
