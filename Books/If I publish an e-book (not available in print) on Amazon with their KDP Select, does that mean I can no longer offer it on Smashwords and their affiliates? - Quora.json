            "answer_text": "Select is Amazon\u2019s author end to Kindle Unlimited, their all you can read subscription service. If you put a book into Select/KU, it must be exclusive to Amazon. This exclusivity is done in blocks of 90 days with an auto-renew which you have to turn off before the book will come out of Select/KU. While in Select/KU, the book can be NOWHERE else. Not on Smashwords, not on any affiliates, not on your own website, not given away through any site, not free anywhere. It has to be EXCLUSIVE to Amazon. If the book is already on Smashwords now, it has to be removed before you put it into Select. It has to be be removed from all affiliates, and any other site where it might be available in any form. The onus is on you to ensure that the removal has happened, before you enter the book into Select/KU. Some sites can take weeks to delete a book. Some require actual contact before they will delete it. Especially some of the more obscure sites in the affiliates list. Amazon take their exclusivity clause seriously. They have bots constantly checking Select/KU titles are not anywhere else. If they find the book in even one place, you will get a nastygram. If the book is in multiple places, you will be ejected from the Select/KU program, and can be banned from it for life. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was still live on there\u201d is not a defense. You are supposed to know exactly where your book is, and the moment you click the Select button, it can\u2019t be anywhere else. You are making a legal commitment by clicking that box. ",

The terms among others say if you click Amazon Kdp to select while publishing ebook or paperback, thereafter, you will not be able to publish the same book anywhere again. This means you should not click Kdp select while publishing your ebook or paperback. Read Amazon Kdp terms and conditions. ",
