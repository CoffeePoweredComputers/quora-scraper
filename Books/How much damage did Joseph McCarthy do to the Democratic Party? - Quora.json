            "answer_text": "McCarthy\u2019s targets were Eisenhower Administration agencies \u2014 Department of the Army, Department of State, for example. Nevertheless, Eisenhower was reelected, despite whatever influence McCarthy might have had. The point is that McCarthy had not done much damage at all to any party. Nixon\u2019s early years had a similar anti-Communist flavor. Ike had come close to dumping Nixon, just as the McCarthy era was coming to a close. If McCarthy\u2019s extreme anti-Communism had won wide spread support, Nixon\u2019s anti-Communism would have produced overwhelming advantage in his campaign for the presidency. It didn\u2019t. Democrat John F. Kennedy won the presidency in 1960, demonstrating McCarthy didn\u2019t damage the Democratic Party to such an extent that it was no longer viable. ",
