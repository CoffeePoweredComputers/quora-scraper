            "answer_text": "It would not be good for to get insanely rich in one month. To clarify. Proverbs 13:11 ESV Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it. So I am a Christian, but you don't need to be a Christian to follow the advice of the book of Proverbs. King Solomon was probably one of the wisest people ever. What the verse means is that any wealth you gain quickly (I would say easily) would most probably not last very long. Why would that be? Most people who wins a jackpot (millions) on the lottery or similar would quit there jobs immediately. When your wealth increase so drastically you kink of think it will never run out which is a problem when it was a once off affair like winning the jackpot. This would result in you going on spending sprees like there is no tomorrow, you would like to make all your dreams come true and probably buy that Ferrari etc. Let's look at the second part of the verse, the gather little by little part. Why would that make you rich? The only basic way to get rich is to spend less than you earn. If you gather little by little, in my opinion it would mean through hard work, you would think twice about spending it on nonsense, especially if you are trying to get rich by means of the spend less than you earn method. This also gives you chance to gradually get used to you New found wealth and understanding the value of it. I you manage to pull off the get insanely rich in a month thing and you can continue the process, then it could probably work for you. I have no idea how you would do that legally and should you find a way to that legally you would probably not have time to enjoy your wealth. Gambling would most probably land you in bigger problems instead of giving you this break through. The only other feasible way to pull this off would probably be to do something illegal, but maintaining this would probably end bad. But there is another way to look at this,another currency and that is time. Everyone gets the same amount per day, spend it wisely. No one on their deathbed ever wished that they spend more time at the office. Remember that. So my advice to you is not to try and get rich in a month. To gather little by little, to spend less than you earn. To let what you save work for you. To appreciate what you have and not to dream ridiculous dreams and I don't mean to stop dreaming at all. Don't be to stingy, help people, make good friends. Learn from people with more experience than you. Budget and plan. Don't invest all your money in a single portfolio, especially if it sounds to good to be true, which it probably is. ",

Follow these steps: Participate in some reality TV-show(prefereably in some retarded and stupid TV show.Now,once you got in,it is very important to BE RETARDED AS FUCK.(get in arguments,say stupid jokes,insult everyone,act like a whore and dress like a whore(if you are girl)\u2026Make sure you do step 2. every day.If you were retarded enough,and win in that reality tv show,if you won hearts of the public by your retarded behaviour,you will be wanted to give interviews,and some smaller movie roles.Use that in your advantage and do not stop acting retarded,and that will lead to more movie roles,and then you will get the big money rolling in\u2026Enjoy your wealth. P.S. this could take more than a month. ",
