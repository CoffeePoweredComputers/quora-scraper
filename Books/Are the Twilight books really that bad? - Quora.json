            "answer_text": "No, they are not. I used to say that they were badly written, like everyone else. But really, it\u2019s a question of taste. It is considered acceptable and even necessary to put down \u201cbad\u201d culture. But the point of books, songs or movies is to teach us things, give us pleasure and help us deal with our emotions. The Twilight books do not follow the rules of what is considered good writing. The sentences are sometimes clumsy. The vocabulary is original and may feel awkward to many. The characters have unrealistic personalities and behaviors. The plot seems incoherent from certain perspectives. But they have brought great pleasure to millions of readers, mostly young women. They have helped them feel many emotions that they wanted to feel. The underlying ideology of the books is certainly toxic, though the books themselves are not misogynistic - they depict a very misogynistic world without denouncing it, and simply show a teenage girl trying to exist within it. But it\u2019s not like Stephenie Meyer is single-handedly teaching teenage girls around the world to be submissive battered wives. If so many women need to read stories of fragile, vulnerable women being in a relationship with dangerous, violent men, maybe there\u2019s a problem in the real world. Twilight is, at worse, a symptom, and at best, an attempt at protecting one\u2019s sense of self-worth when you\u2019re a teenage girl who believes in Prince Charming and other self-objectifying BS.

Now, I don\u2019t mind a first person book - if it\u2019s written well. Unfortunately, these books are not.It\u2019s\u2026.boring. A lot of it is describing Bella\u2019s day to day routines, and they are not only repetitive, but come across as Stephanie Meyers\u2019 vanity.The Breaking Dawn battle. Oh god. The battle. WHAT BATTLE? Literally most of Breaking Dawn was dedicated to the vampires and werewolves negotiating an alliance against the Volturi with a grand plan to protect Renesmee (Who I will get to in a sec). And then, the Volturi arrive and everyone just\u2026\u2026.TALKS. They. Literally. Talk. Things. Out. It was like one giant family therapy session. And everybody survived.The Eclipse battle. Oh, wait. It was told from Bella\u2019s point of view\u2026.where she was hiding in a tent with Jacob, away from the action.The Twilight battle between Edward and James. Oh wait\u2026.Bella got knocked out so we saw nothing.Renesmee. *Vom*. Albus Severus was a better name (Harry Potter reference). The combination of the mothers\u2019 names - Renee and Esme. And Carlie for the middle name (a combination of Charlie and Carlisle). A half-human-vampire hybrid who - conveniently - will be stuck as a 15-year-old-looking girl for eternity when she reaches 7 years of age. And Nessie as a nickname? Really? At least Bella attacked Jacob for that.And while we\u2019re on the subject\u2026has nobody mentioned that Jacob who was in love with Bella is destined to be with Bella\u2019s daughter? That\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s not slightly creepy? But hey, there\u2019s like 90 years between Edward and Bella, what\u2019s like, biological 18 years between Jacob and Renesmee? *Listen up kids, it\u2019s not a sexual predator if it\u2019s attractive*. *FACEDESK*",

Is there something positive I can say about them? Yes.

I think the author did some really cool things to add to the Vampire lore like the Volturi and the fact that it takes three days of burning to basically turn into stone. What critics constantly forget is that this is, at the end of the day, a YA series. I found it enjoyable and most of the people who hate it, I\u2019ve discovered, haven\u2019t actually read it. They\u2019ve only seen memes and base their judgement on that (oy.) Bella is misunderstood because she doesn\u2019t represent masculine strengths. She\u2019s got what have long been seen as feminine strengths. She protects rather than attack but she\u2019s far from the passive wimp she\u2019s accused of being. It is kind of disturbing that we only value masculine violence (Katniss from Hunger Games anyone?) and we devalue anything else. Just read them for yourself and don\u2019t let other people stop you from an enjoyable experience. Check out Victoria Nelson\u2019s lecture on the mythology behind the novels in a youtube called \u201cStephanie Meyer and the 21st Century Vampire Romance\u201d from Claremont University. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It takes up a lot of themes that are present in classical literature, but since Meyer doesn\u2019t write particularly well it falls flat. I never had the stomach to read all of Lolita or Silence of the Lambs, nor the patience to read any of Anne Rice\u2019s novels in full, so I can\u2019t truly compare them\u2026 but if it\u2019s only okay when the writing is good, how is that different from saying abuse (in fiction) is okay as long as the abuser is attractive. Maybe it\u2019s because of my own experiences, but I don\u2019t want to criticize people\u2019s ways of expressing themselves. I think it\u2019s just as gross for people to see something sexual in an explicitly non-sexual connection. If there\u2019s anything creepy about it it\u2019s that the boy wants to be her father. Could have done without that part. Do I think Meyer wrote the books to convey how creepy the concept of soulmates is? I don\u2019t even think I care. That\u2019s what she said whether or not she meant to. ",
