            "answer_text": "I'm writing this answer in bed, at 10 in the night, so apologies in advance if my answer is a bit hard to understand. In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, we are introduced to the wonderful wizarding world, along with our main characters. The power of Lord Voldemort is shown by how witches and wizards, who can perform feats us Muggles consider absolutely fantastical, are so scared of him that they dare not even speak his name. If he scares them that much, the reader is supposed to reason, then he must be really bad. The second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, doesn't do a whole lot that I can remember, but one thing I think it does is discusses Voldemort\u2019s past. The fact that people across the school are getting petrified heightens the stakes (in Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, no one in the school is really in much danger, save for a few selective occasions.) Harry Potter and the Prison of Azkaban focused on Harry's past with Sirius. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire did a better job of depicting the wizarding world as a global society than any of the previous books, and it also heightens the stakes once again by having a character be killed by Voldemort. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix provides a more conventional look at our characters (I may be wrong, but I don't remember romance and relationships featuring so prominently in any of the other books), humanizing them beyond witches and wizards and into \u201cnormal\u201d teenagers. On the other hand, the formation of Dumbledore\u2019a Army shows their growth and willingness to fight without having to be thrown head-first into the situation. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince gives a lot more backstory, and the start of the horcrux-hunting prepares the reader for the next book, which follows a very different format than all those before it. I think it's pretty easy to see where the final, aforementioned movie Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, fits in. It describes the Battle of Hogwarts, not only the climax of that book but arguably the climax of the entire series, and attempts to tie up several loose plot threads. I hope this was helpful! ",
