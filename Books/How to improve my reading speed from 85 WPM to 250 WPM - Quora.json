            "answer_text": "Hm. I'm not the best person to ask, I'm not am expert. I just read fast with above average retention. So I'll tell you how I read quickly, but I'll update this answer after I ask my mom, who is a reading specialist. She went to grad school for education, so I imagine she might know some exercises or something. But here's how I do it. Read a lot. Practice makes perfect, and reading is no exception. I notice I don't have to circle back hardly at all by the end of a dry-spell breaking novel, and I might need to go back every now at then at the start.Don't actually read the words. Your brain doesn't work quick enough to parse each syllable, or even really each word. I know what words look like without actually reading them, so for something like \u201cfascinating\u201d, I only pay attention up until \u201cfasci-\u201d and then I can guess the word. So skimming the rest is kinda a formality, or a way to make sure.Context clues. Fast readers start narrowing down the different ways a sentence will go by the first third. So if I'm reading \u201cGosh, I had a hard day I could really go for a stiff drink.\u201d by \u201ccould\u201d I'm already assuming that something people do to unwind is next. So I've gone from all the infinite possibilities in the world to being fairly certain that what is next is likely gonna be along the lines of a shower and a hot meal, or wine and Netflix, or a good long piss, or one of a certainly finite number of possibilities. Granted, where the author is specifically looking to defy expectations you will slow down and absorb the full sentence. For instance \u201cuse a good slip down a bobsled track while naked.\u201dprobably wasn't on your list of probable endings.Big vocabulary. I know what a lot of words mean. I don't have to guess at what the author is trying to say when the word vociferous or visage is tossed in. I don't have to slow down and really read the rest of the sentence to estimate the meaning of the word. I've already got it, I know the meaning, moving on. So this is kinda like 3a. Don't rely on context clues that slow you down is the broader advice, but bone up on words and phrases you don't know, and take the time to learn them, use them, incorporate them.Read things that come easily to you. If you don't like mystery novels, don't read those. Do you get engrossed with nonfiction? That's where you wanna spend your time. Forcing yourself to read something you don't enjoy will slow you down because you have to devote attention to it rather than it holding your attention.Don't be too hard on yourself. Neurodiversity means that different brains have different strengths. Mine is better at problem solving than communication. I know this, I can and do work around it, but I have to put more effort into it to communicate as effectively as a natural. I used to be really hard on myself when I failed to be extraordinary in that area. Now I accept that it isn't my strength, and that it's no biggie. Don't beat yourself up over not reaching your goal, not seeing progress at the desired rate, or even progress at all.That's about all I have for you, I'll just add to this when I get an answer from my mom. She's so cool. ",
