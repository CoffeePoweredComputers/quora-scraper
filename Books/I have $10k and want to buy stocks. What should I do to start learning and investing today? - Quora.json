            "answer_text": "I would suggest that you go on Amazon and find a textbook probably titled \"investments\" or something very similar. Maybe something published by McGraw hill. It's a book that is used to give finance students their first real exposure to the field. Don't buy the newest edition, buy the edition before it. It will be pretty cheap. Then read the thing from front to back. Don't just read it, make sure you understand each chapter before moving on. This will give you a very solid foundational understanding of the investment environment. It will guide you, and it will teach you the basics in an order that will foster learning. The other great thing about a book like this is that it will teach you great stuff that you don't even know that you should seek out because you don't know that it exists. Once you've done this, or maybe while you're doing this, read the wall street journal, the economist, watch CNBC, etc... Expose yourself to everything finance related and your knowledge will build into something beautiful. Also, don't put too much emphasis on what tv reporter/commentators tell you to do. They really don't know anything more than you or I. What I'm saying is ignore their stock tips! But by watching them it will help you become more familiar with the finance environment, lingo, etc.  ",

            "answer_text": "Kudos to you on your savings and investing goals... Two books that my students have found are gateways into investing are the classic One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch, and if they like that, a longer next level book is Jeremy Siegel's Stocks for the Long Run.... Of course, passive investing is also hard to beat for the average person, so pick up about any book by John Bogle or about index funds.  Start watching a bit of CNBC  and read all the business periodicals in your local library or online....Then you may find in a few months or a year, you may be ready for your first investment.  Best of luck.. ",
