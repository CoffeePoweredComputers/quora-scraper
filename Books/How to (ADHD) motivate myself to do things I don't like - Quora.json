            "answer_text": "You keep doing them until one day you find you don\u2019t completely hate doing the things you don\u2019t like to do. I spent 20 years hating to do laundry. Everything from start to finish. Putting dirty items in hamper, sorting clothing and other washibles in piles. Adjusting water temp, type of wash, how many rinse/spin cycles, blah blah F ing blah. Once it\u2019s done, next comes the sorting of what can go into the dryer and what must be hung or laid flat to dry. When your clothing/bedding/tampons are done drying now you have all this damn clothes to fold, but not before you put in another load to wash. I hated doing laundry. Then I grew up, had a baby and realized I hated changing diapers. Most especially when the poop is neon yellow and has a putrid odor that could temporarily incapacitate anything with a sense of smell. As time passed I realized what I hated the most was not getting enough sleep. For me there is no worse feeling than being on day 5 or 6 of an insomnia run. At this point - I\u2019m aware my attention is beyond rubbish and I am unsafe to be operating any moving vehicle except for maybe an ATV on the sand in which case if I go flying I\u2019ll end up on sand which from experience I can totally handle. I also make cleaning a game where I tell my family I\u2019m setting the timer for 15 minutes and let\u2019s see how much we can get done in that amount of time. I then set the timer for 22 minutes, crank up some music and not tell anyone that the timer went off. When busted I\u2019ll say that I too did not hear the timer (usually I yell this from another room, so no one can see I\u2019m grinning ear to ear). When life gets more complicated laundry does not and sometimes you can take comfort in the ritual. This will come as a complete shock, but I now like doing laundry. It soothes and calms me when my ADHD is off the charts. Go figure. You can also try to motivate yourself with a reward system. When I drank, I would have a couple drinks and make it a multitask of relaxing while cleaning. Or after cleaning I\u2019d enjoy 2\u20133 shower beers. That\u2019s where you take a shower and drink beer at the same time. Mad skills for days. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll have to preface my answer with the usual disclaimer: Every person with ADHD is a little bit different, so I\u2019ll stick to my personal experience. What I describe below may not apply to other people with ADHD - or to a greater or lesser degree. In my case, this is a significant issue. I tend to procrastinate, and those tasks I don\u2019t enjoy are the ones which suffer. It\u2019s as if my very selective attention span automatically latches onto \u201cfun\u201d or interesting tasks and pushes the tasks I urgently need to do, but which are not so appealing onto the back burner (and sometimes out of the kitchen entirely). I find that treating my brain like a small child tends to help here. I tell myself \u201cSure you can do that fun thing. But FIRST, get that other thing out of the way. Then you can have a lolly.\u201d Then I use the fun thing as motivation to basically force myself to do the less fun task. This does require being very strict with oneself, of course. If I am not completely consistent, then my ADHD brain will notice right away and use that against me. The other approach which helps me a great deal is being very, very consistent with task lists. This applies mainly to work. I work for a small company, and we do work for our clients. Sometimes this is a small 1-hour job, and sometimes projects are multi-month tasks. But even with the multi-month tasks, I still need to get the small jobs done and make sure they don\u2019t get forgotten. If I left my brain to handle it, we\u2019d have a lot of annoyed clients waiting for their work. So I use Google Calendar and manage my tasks (with the \u201cTasks\u201d) feature to plan when I\u2019m going to focus on what each day. I set myself hard deadlines. So for instance, I know that today I should get some work done for three clients in the morning. Then I\u2019m teaching for a client over lunch, and when I get back to the office, I have to finish off another project I have promised by end of day today. That should work out exactly right, according to my effort estimate. It\u2019s the same with every day for the next two weeks at least. I\u2019m very strict about this because if I don\u2019t enter a task, it will invariably be forgotten. I have read about others with ADHD here on Quora who also use a similar approach. Write it down or it\u2019s as good as forgotten! I also have a pocket \u201cBoogie Board\u201d which I find terribly helpful for taking notes on short-term stuff. Here\u2019s a picture of the things I have to do before I leave the office to go teach over lunch today:  I strike off what\u2019s done and then I press the button, and it wipes the screen. I also find this terribly useful for taking short notes during phone calls, noting down phone numbers, etc. Always short-term stuff that I would otherwise use tons of note paper (and then promptly lose the note - sigh). I think that we ADHD people benefit hugely from such little technical helpers, as they make it easier to stay on track. Not \u201ceasy\u201d, but \u201ceasier\u201d. Question: How can I (ADHD) motivate myself to do things I don't like? ",

So if there is something I don\u2019t like, say going to faculty meetings where people love to hear themselves talk, I sometimes set it as a task to be excellent at it, the best damn meeting participant there. I dress up (which isn\u2019t necessary), I bring a pad to take notes. I ask questions as soon as there is something significant I can add, I ask for clarifications, I show enough interest in matters hoping to spur the interest of others who are bored and hope to leave saying, \u201cNever has a faculty member done a faculty meeting better.\u201d I also chuckle when I know some people running are thinking, \u201cHey maybe we should get him involved in the leadership here. He seems very interested and conscientious.\u201d ",
