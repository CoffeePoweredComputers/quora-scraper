            "answer_text": "Being absolutely blatant and honest; Chetan Bhagat, Durjoy Dutta and Novoneel Chakraborty are India's top 3 worst writers of all time. They are an utter disgrace to the sacred Art of Authorship and Literature. I recently purchased 5 novel box set of Durjoy from Flipkart; and must say - I have never ever ever ever ever ever in my whole life; i.e. I am 36 now and have perused over 5,000 novels and books and poetry collections thus far; have read such poor, vulgur and pretentiously ostentatiously hilariously poor form of writing. Calling it cringeworthy is a disgrace to the word in English.  Any man or woman who peruses Chetan Bhagat, Durjoy Dutta and Novoneel Chakraborty regularly; I hope I never ever meet such folks in my life. If given a revolver with one bullet versus a Durjoy Dutta or Chetan Bhagat novel by God; I would happily choose death. If these three writers have self-respect, self-dignity, conscience and moral judgement; they would stop writing and maybe sell potatoes on the road or become a bathroom cleaner or something that lets a person earn a living in a dignified manner. They ought to be ashamed of their poor writing and disgrace they bring to the Indian contemporary writers of Fiction. I have given a detailed example of why they suck so bad. Subhasish Ghosh's answer to Why do many people dislike the novels of Chetan Bhagat? Why do they make fun of him most of the time? Vikram Seth, Jhumpa Lahiri, Arundhati Roy and Amitav Ghosh; I feel so offended that these eminent writers were born in the same country as Chetan Bhagat, Durjoy Dutta and Novoneel Chakraborty. Nature's folly, all I can say! I had a combination of diarrhoea and constipation and fever and nausea followed by a week's delirium after perusing Durjoy's box set of 5 novels. An utter disgrace!!!

            "answer_text": "As compared to whom? I personally am not a fan of Durjoy Dutta. Honestly have never read any of his books. I don't prefer the romantic genre as such, which is his speciality predominantly. But one other writer I have read in this field is Nicholas Sparks who is very good in his narratives. So have you read any of his books and someone you want to compare him to? I have never read any good reviews of his book. Plus I think he belongs to the list of authors who believe in becoming too famous too soon. So he applies this very simple way. He knows his population. He writes his romantic novels and they proclaim him for undeserving titles he have. Another issue I have with him and other such writes is that as a result of their writings people have stopped\u200b reading Indian writers. They don't know which ones to believe in. Writers like Amish Tripathi and M.S. Mantreshwar go unnoticed because of them. So I don't mind them writing but I have a problem with them being so popular when they are not even good. ",
