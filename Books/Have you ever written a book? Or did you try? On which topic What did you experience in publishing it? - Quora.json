            "answer_text": "Right from my 14th age, I had a burning desire to publish a book. I would narrate some horror stories to my friends and found that they loved hearing that. However, I got a chance to publish my book only when I was 16. My first book was named as \u2018The hidden museum'. It was a mystery thriller novel. However, it was not a great success. Eventually, I started writing my second book \u2018A devil's longing desire'\u2026 I thought that my second book will not be noted much. However, it was a good time for me!  Now, I'm working with my third book \u2018A curse after generations\u2019\u2026 I'm looking out for a good result. I hope you will read my books and show a support for this author.  Thank you so much for asking this question. Before that i have to say u something\u2026 about the feelings of a newly budding young author. I had often longed for motivation, right from the day I started writing my book. Even my best friends at some cost hurted my feelings whenever I said that i longed to become a writer. Encouragement is really everything. I had often sensed the devoidness in me, whenever I see my unseen first book. I used to encourage people around me at all the times for I know the pain\u2026 My second book helped me a lot. It helped me overcome many hurdles in life. It encouraged me to write more. Now, I know, I can't quit writing till my last breathe\u2026 https://www.amazon.com/gp/f.html?C=Z9SQXHR9LXA4&M=urn:rtn:msg:20190409075209dd397f11004d4248b86e78d7cc90p0na&R=2QHCNKF6TOSC&T=C&U=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fauthor%2Fdharanikannan%3Fref_%3Dpe_1724030_132998060&H=HTTTUEPA9JULLSVHGG38BPJHFQSA&ref_=pe_1724030_132998060 Thank u so much for all the readers who spent their time reading this. Upvote it if u could give me a piece of encouragement, for which I was longing for. ",
