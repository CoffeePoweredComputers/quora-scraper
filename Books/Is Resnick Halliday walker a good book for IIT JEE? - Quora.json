            "answer_text": "Resnick and Haliday (2 vols) is a great book no doubt. If you can do it, that's fantastic. But the fact is you don't need to do it. It requires a lot of effort to read these books and you don't have time to spare in one subject. At least the effort required is more than what is required to read hc verma. If you go through the two books you'll find the difference. But I'll go with HC Verma anyday. My advice would be do HC Verma and Arihant mcq books in physics. You can keep Resnick and Haliday as a reference guide. ",

            "answer_text": "Principles of Physics by Resnick and Halliday For reading theory and strengthening conceptsConceptual Clarity: 10The book has a very different approach when it comes to learning, it talks to you as if you\u2019re attending their lecture which will help you in developing interest towards subject. You won\u2019t even require to go through the book again and again, just read the book once and all your concepts are crystal clear. It feels great when you uncover hidden concepts sprinkled throughout the book. This book covers almost all concepts JEE Advanced requires. For all you physics requirements in JEE, HCV and Resnick Halliday forms a perfect match. You can find out more amazing books for physics in Books used by IITians during their JEE Preparations. ",
