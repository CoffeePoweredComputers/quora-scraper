            "answer_text": "I see Quora still collapses short answers. I\u2019ve read the book in French, English, and Hebrew, and I\u2019ve seen two movies based on it. The Lerner & Loewe musical film didn\u2019t quite work; I understand Frank Sinatra pulled out of the production, and I think he would have made a better stranded pilot than Richard Kiley. Kiley is a wonderful actor and singer, but just a little too hearty. The 2015 animated version does work, at least on its own terms, but it builds a whole big frame story around the book, leaves out too much of the original text, and devotes too much attention to the swoopy-doopy climax that it seems no 3D movie can do without. The Little Prince is a short, short book. If you haven\u2019t read it, you should just read it instead of inquiring about it. ",
