After graduating from the university he decided to go back to his family village Sophyino, in order to work to pay off his father's debts that he made in order to educate his son. But by \u201cwork\u201d I mean he didn't physically work in the fields, because the land had peasants attached to it, according to then existing Serfdom in Russia, (you can read more about it in the following link Serfdom in Russia - Wikipedia), who quite obviously did all the labor. So he mostly managed the finances. This is why even after he was elected a judge of the circuit court of Russia, which made him a frequent visitor of the nearby city and its aristocratic society, where he was known and respected, he had to go back to the village to fulfill his duty before his father.
