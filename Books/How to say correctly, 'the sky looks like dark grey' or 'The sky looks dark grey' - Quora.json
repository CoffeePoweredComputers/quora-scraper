            "answer_text": "The correct choice from those two options is \"the sky looks dark grey\", but that\u2019s not what I would normally say: I would say \"the sky is dark grey\". Actually, I would only use dark grey if I wanted to be precise about the colour, for instance if I wanted to paint a picture where the sky was that exact colour. I would be more likely to say \"the sky is very grey\". The only time I would use \"looks\" in that way would be if I were going to make an inference from the colour. For instance, I might say \"The sky looks very grey; I think it\u2019s going to rain soon\" or \"Her eyes look very red; I think she has been crying.\" ",

            "answer_text": "To look like something means you are comparing it to something else and finding some similarity. So you would perhaps say: The sky looks like a dark grey blanket covering the distant hill. To merely observe the color of the sky as you are perceiving it, you could just say: The sky looks dark gray. Or: They sky looks dark and gray. ",
