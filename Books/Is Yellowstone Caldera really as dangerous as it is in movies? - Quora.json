            "answer_text": "Originally answered 8 May, 2018. I greatly enjoy Jeff Barry\u2018s answer, especially regarding the emphasis upon its greatly destructive power as a (probably) far future event. But I can elaborate as I am asked about this almost daily; my clients come to Yellowstone from all over the world so that many have heard of this and are very concerned. First, a technical distinction. The caldera is not dangerous; it is merely the collapsed, eroded and greatly infilled crater of the gigantic eruption of a chamber of magma below the surface of the earth. The stationary hot spot underneath Yellowstone over which North America drifts in a southwesterly direction ~2 centimetres or more a year, the largest of some 46 hot spots globally (most are under water) is the danger. Calderas do not erupt. \u2122  How does Yellowstone's heat get to the Earth's surface? The most recent eruption 631,000 years ago ejected 1,000 times the volume of ash that Mount Saint Helens did 39 years ago. The Huckleberry Ridge tuff event (Island Park Caldera) of 2.1 MYA was 2,400 times as destructive.  Lesson Guide & Vocabulary: Volcano/Supervolcano Grades 8 & 9 But how imminent is it\u2019s eruption? \u201cOverdue\u201d is the word on the street and on the trail but not among the scientists monitoring it day by day. They say, and the National Park Service says, It has erupted 3 times in 2,100,000 years. That\u2019s an average of every 700,000 years by my calculation, requiring another 69,000 years to be, in fact, \u201coverdue.\u201d Ok, about that: Dr. Robert Smith, author of \u201cWindows Into the Earth: The Geologic Story of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks\u201c and one of the founders of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory says that averaging three events to predict a fourth is akin to watching three rolls of the dice at a Las Vegas craps table to predict the outcome of the fourth. To find a valid statistical average one needs a much larger sampling or body of data. If you consider 13 large caldera forming eruptions in the hot spot\u2019s 16.5 million year track across the Snake River Plain, that averages to one mega eruption every 1,231,000 years. Of course there were more smaller events, I\u2019ll address that. Some say 12 caldera forming eruptions= 1 eruption every 1,333,333 years, I attempt to be generous.  Kiss Your Ash Goodbye: The Yellowstone Supervolcano, Part IV, A Vulcanology Primer By Stephanie Osborn Thus, Smith says, and many concur, that it\u2019s not going to happen in our lifetime. In fact, it probably won\u2019t be considered possible within 10,000 years. Ah, but! So much depends on what you mean by \u201cit.\u201d Most volcanologists admit a smaller event such as a lava flow, a hydrothermal explosion, a release of toxic gases or single vent volcano could well occur in the near future without causing a full, large caldera-forming blowout and collapse. The devil is in the details. Those could only be called \u201csmall\u201d events when compared to how a Yellowstone super eruption will someday impact the entire world\u2019s climate, some say disasterously, even of \u201cbiblical proportions.\u201d  https://www.travelocity.com/West-Thumb-Hotels.d180188.Travel-Guide-Hotels A sign overlooking Yellowstone\u2019s West Thumb Bay says this smallish caldera erupted and collapsed only 125,000 years ago (more recent NPS estimate is 174,000 ya.) It was a \u201csingle vent\u201d volcano. This 6.4 kilometer wide caldera is dwarfed by the dimensions of the 64 x 105 km and 48 x 72 km most recent super eruptions. An eruption that size wouldn\u2019t mean the end of the world by causing something like a nuclear winter nor would it dump centimeters of ash on St. Louis but you can be certain it would be locally quite destructive, shutting down northwest Wyoming and the park at the least! And\u2026playing devil\u2019s advocate here, if we call it a caldera (albeit a small one) would that make 4 events in 2.1 MY to average an eruption every 525,000 years? Then, add the Mary Bay event caldera; One in 420,000. Since the last one was 631,000 years ago...uh, oh\u2026 Ok, I need to go back to the big picture! And stand on the calm reassurances of Smith, et al, (and send them the bill if they\u2019re mistaken!)

            "answer_text": "RE: Is Yellowstone Caldera really as dangerous as it is in movies? Dangerous to whom? Those of us alive today? Probably not. Dangerous to our distant descendants? Yes. We have no real idea about when any volcano will go off, and Yellowstone is a volcano, just a big one. In the \u201crecent\u201d geological past (last 2 million years is \u201crecent\u201d in geology) Yellowstone has had a supervolcano eruption three times about 600,000 years apart, and it\u2019s been about 600,000 years since the last one, so in terms of averages \u201cwe are due\u201d for another supervolcano eruption. Those are averages, tho (and crude averages at that) but geological events like volcanoes and earthquakes pay no attention to averages. BUT our lifespans are so short compared to geological processes that it\u2019s pretty safe to predict that the people alive today will never see an eruption at Yellowstone. But our descendants WILL eventually be subjected to one if we manage not to kill ourselves off before then. How dangerous will it be? That depends on how big the eruption is. Yellowstone also has non-super volcanic eruptions of Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) 7 or less, as do other volcanoes around the world. Some could cause a really big mess, but not nearly anything like a VEI 8 supervolcano eruption. If Yellowstone or any other supervolcano goes all the way to VEI 8 then it would cause gigadeath and worldwide chaos if it came with little warning. If we had, say, 10 years warning we could probably prepare sufficiently to protect the majority of humanity. But if we had little warning before a full VEI 8 eruption then you are talking about a situation which would be far worse than what you see in the movies since no movie can accurately portray such horror. Possible volcanic horror stories less than a VEI 8 in our lifetime could come from the so-called Decade Volcanoes which are big, active volcanic areas near large centers of population. Go look them up if you wish to be worried about volcanoes. Otherwise sleep peacefully because volcanoes (and earthquakes) are something no amount of worrying will prevent. Preparation for likely disasters where we live CAN help us survive and even prosper after disasters, but worrying will not prevent or help anything. ",
