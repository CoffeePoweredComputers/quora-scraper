            "answer_text": "What? Like Sparknotes? Sure, if you wrote the explanation (its not copyright infringement) or unless you live in a country that sensors certain ideas and that your explanation would qualify as inapropriate in this regard. In the US, it\u2019s even permissible to quote substantial portions from the source book for the purpose of supporting your explanation. Regardless, if you have any doubts, check with a local attorney as none of this is legal advice. ",
