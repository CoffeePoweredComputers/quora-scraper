Then I go do something active that keeps me thinking about something else, like practicing for my field hockey team. Then I go for a bike ride. If you don\u2019t live in an area that\u2019s great for biking, you could do core exercises. Basically, just keep your mind off of it and busy yourself with doing something else. Sorry if this isn\u2019t enough help! ",
