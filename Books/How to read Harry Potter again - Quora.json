            "answer_text": "I've had a similar problem, particularly as GoF was my favourite book, it was the first \u201cadult\" book in the series and I sort of grew out of them a little after (I was 13/14 at the time), particularly as I found OotP disappointing wxcepting the Dumbledore/Voldemort duel that I feel should have been longer. I have a similar problem with re-reading them due to this. I have found that it's much easier and more enjoyable to listen to the audiobooks narrated by Stephen Fry (Jim Dale is too jarring due to his US accent and mispronunciation), which I listen to at the gym when doing cardio. This is good as it prevents me getting bored due to an otherwise monotonous task and also allows me to sit back and take in the story without having to exert myself reading something my eyes have already gotten bored of but enjoy the story itself. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Just a thought - try to find a kid to read them with / to.  When I was young I had no interest in reading.  My first grade teacher assumed I was an idiot because I had never been to kindergarten and could not read a word when I walked into first grade.  My mother, being duly informed that she had spawned a dunce set about fix the problem.  She bought me a Hardy Boys mystery - The Case of the Missing Chums.  At night she read it to me a chapter or two at a time.  When we got in the middle of it, she stopped cold and said, \u201cif you want to know what happened you\u2019ll have to finish it yourself.\u201d  It worked - I\u2019ve been reading hard for over 55 years. When the HP books came out it sparked a whole new wave of kids reading books.  For that reason, you might find satisfaction in sharing it with a kids reading group at a local library - reading it and discussing it together.  Helping kids find the nuance would be satisfying and I think you will be surprised the insights they will give you as well. ",
