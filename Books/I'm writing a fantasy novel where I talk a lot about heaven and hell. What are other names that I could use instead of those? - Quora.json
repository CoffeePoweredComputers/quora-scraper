            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a variety of options to choose from. Look at Latin or Greek terms for those words, it\u2019s something commonly used in literature to make their locations sound less generic plus Latin words sound sometimes better e.g \u201cIgnus\u201d becomes \u201cfire\u201d.Look at other languages and their own terms for those words, perhaps you can completely customise your own term for these through using other languages, maybe hell may just mean \u201cThe fire pit\u201d in another language. You can simply just make it a name from another foreign language which simply as meaning, e.g \u201cAmadeus\u201d, as long as it makes sense in context.Another is just go wild, make your own, make something that sounds cool but not too difficult to remember or pronounce which is something a lot of games may do. Something like \u201cRazmus\u201d, \u201cArganshia\u201d (random gibberish from my brain) just something that clicks, goes smooth and will work.It\u2019s not like there\u2019s rules for names, just make them how you like them and it shall be fine.

            "answer_text": "A good idea is to research the names of those places from different cultures. Purgatory and other names can be found in the text, and you can even substitute the Latin names for the different layers. Classical text Dante\u2019s Inferno and others can offer a host of ideas where a descriptor of the place can be substituted. Run a search on Wikipedia and others to find some names. As a writer, I use google translate to help me find some names that may sound strange, but if the reader decides to check, they end up being surprised at what it actually means. Good luck! ",
