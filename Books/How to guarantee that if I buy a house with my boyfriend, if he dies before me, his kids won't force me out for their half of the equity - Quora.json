Otherwise (and per a response you made to another answer) you almost certainly wind up owning half the house, with his kids owning the other half. That\u2019s a difficult situation\u2026 unlikely they could legally force you out, but how would you collect an equitable portion of the cost of maintaining the house? Taxes? Sounds like one battle after another. They could effectively force you to pay all the costs of the housing by simply refusing to pay. Even if you move out you\u2019d have come to an agreement of how to sell it (or a price on them buying from you.) Plenty of ways for this to get ugly, and few ways for it to go well and fairly. So we\u2019re back to: don\u2019t do it. The only way this works as desired is marriage (and that still doesn\u2019t actually accomplish his goal of making sure his kids get an inheritance, which is a very reasonable thing.) If you don\u2019t have a relationship where you are comfortable getting married, then you surely shouldn\u2019t enter into a life altering financial commitment with the guy. Heck, you could very likely run into the same issues of who pays what bills and/or when to sell with the boyfriend, and if you break up you now have to deal with the same issues as above. Thinking out of the box: this isn\u2019t really about equity, it\u2019s about money. He could buy a life insurance policy with at the same time as buying the house with the kids as the beneficiaries. That way the kids get a similar cash payment without the baggage of a house. Or, you could be the beneficiary with the kids getting the house. If you got a check for the full value of the house (plus some, ideally) that would allow you to get a new place, potentially mortgage free. Of course, the beneficiaries or the will can be changed also, so\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "How do I guarantee that if I buy a house with my boyfriend, if he dies before me, his kids won't force me out for their half of the equity? My son is special needs and I don't want to ever have to worry about losing my house or being forced out. What if you die before your boyfriend? What would happen to your child? You see, your situation is more complicated than you think. If you were childless, then I\u2019d suggest you that you and your boyfriend own the house in some form of joint tenancy with a right of survivorship. With that kind of ownership, if one of you died, the other would automatically own the entire house; his kids couldn\u2019t do anything to force you out. BUT you do have a child. If you died first, your boyfriend would get everything and your son would get nothing. So joint ownership with a right of survivorship won\u2019t work. Plus, he probably wants to give his own children his share of the house. The two of you need to talk about what each of you wants, needs, and expects, then learn what options you have under your local laws to achieve those. I suggest you spend a few hundred dollars to discuss your situation with a local lawyer who has experience in your local property and inheritance law. Protecting your son is extremely important. Don\u2019t make the mistake of \u201csaving\u201d money now and losing a lot more later. ",

It was something like title is transferred to \u201cme and her as tenants in joint with the right of survivorship\u201d. Then get a term life insurance policy in the value of half the house with his kids as beneficiaries. That way you would get the house and they would get the value of his half. It seems to me that you both could live a long life yet and if you are working and paying half the mortgage then, particularly with your situation it would be better if you got the house when and if he ever dies. If he is the only one working then a second term life insurance policy that would pay off the house might also be a good idea. This could also likely be included as part of the mortgage but that might be more expensive. ",
