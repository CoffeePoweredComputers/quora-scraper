            "answer_text": "He\u2019s not my favorite author, but I like him a lot. Jeff VanderMeer is the author of the Southern Reach trilogy. They released a movie not too long ago of the first book Annihilation. By the time I got to the second book in that trilogy, Authority, I\u2019d read VanderMeer\u2019s Borne and Annihilation, and The Strange Bird. I liked him well enough. I absolutely despised every second of reading Authority. I forced myself to sludge through it because I wanted to read book three, Acceptance, but the whole time I was reading it was pretty bitter about the whole thing. Couldn\u2019t believe it was his. Like I said, not my favorite author, but I think he\u2019s good. And he writes exactly what I like to read, Sci-Fi with a little horror thrown in. It was the most disappointing thing I\u2019d read that year. But to be honest, if you\u2019re familiar enough with an author, they all have their own voice, and you probably know it well. At no point did I think Authority didn\u2019t feel like VanderMeer, it was just that his storytelling in that book was not up to par. It was a horror of sorts.. but not horrifying. ",

            "answer_text": "Not by a favorite author, no. But The Pelican Brief by John Grisham read like every other chapter was trading off with another author. I found it very annoying. Then there\u2019s James D. Doss\u2019 Charlie Moon series - I thoroughly enjoyed the first 11 books. Then I read book 12 and 13, and quit after that - the writing style drastically changed, became a caricature of its former self. I suspect it was handed off to another author. ",
