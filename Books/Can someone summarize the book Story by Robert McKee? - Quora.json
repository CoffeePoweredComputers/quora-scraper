            "answer_text": "As Kalvin Lyle said, it's difficult to summarize. However, McKee does have his \"10 commandments:\"  Thou shalt not take the crisis or climax out of the PROTAGONIST'S hands. The anti-\"deus ex machina\" commandment.Thou shalt not make life easy for the protagonist. Nothing progresses in a story except through conflict.Thou shalt not use FALSE mystery or cheap surprise. Don't conceal anything important the protagonist knows. Keep us in step with the hero. We know what he or she knows.Thou shalt respect your audience. The anti-hack commandment.Thou shaLT know your world as God knows this one. The pro-research commandment.THOU SHALT NOT COMPLICATE WHEN COMPLEXITY IS BETTER. Don't multiply the complications on one level. Use all three: intrapersonal, interpersonal, extra personal.THOU SHALT SEEK THE END OF THE LINE. The negation of negation, taking characters to the farthest reaches and depth of conflict imaginable within the story's own realm of probability.THOU SHALT NOT WRITE ON THE NOSE. Put a subtext under every text.THOU SHALT NOT GIVE EXPOSITION STRICTLY FOR EXPOSITION'S SAKE. Dramatize it. Convert exposition to ammunition. Use it to turn the ending of a scene, to further the conflict.THOU SHALT REWRITE. (These can be found various places around the web. See, e.g., http://blog.duarte.com/2009/01/10-commandments-of-storytelling/ for a more in-depth summary of these. The book is very useful for writers (many love it, some hate it), but despite McKee's sometimes bombastic style it's not idiocy nor gospel. It will definitely change the way you watch movies. Some of the character and plot devices used are so broad and so laughable -- or the writing simply so poor -- that it makes some movies only cringe-worthy. I'd recommend the book, and also his weekend seminar. It covers almost exactly the same material as the book, but is still highly useful. I'd recommend it even for just his shot-by-shot deconstruction of Casablanca. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a hard book to summarise as it's full of rules and best practises.  the book talks more about the structures f great stories much more than it does about how to write. Writers seem to hate it.  Adaptation the movie was written primarily to prove that a good story could break every single rule that McKee lays out and it did so very successfully I think. It makes you a better critic of story/film. Immediately after I read the book I could spot within 15 minutes a bad film, which lead my first ever walkout of a movie and collection of a refund. Really though you should just read the book.  Every time I pick it up to get a qute to send to a friend or go back to look at just a small part of it I end up reading for an hour or more. ",
