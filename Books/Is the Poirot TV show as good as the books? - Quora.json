            "answer_text": "No. Many of the episodes, especially the earlier ones, stick fairly closely to the original stories, but some of the later ones in particular deviate from them a lot. also, inevitably, given the format, a lot is left out of the ones based on full length novels, characters and incidents are eliminated. A major character is eliminated from the tv version of Murder on the Links for example, which gives the episode an entirely different outcome from the book. Another very enjoyable aspect of the novels is that in the ones which are not narrated by another character, you get to read Poirot\u2019s thoughts, which are often very amusing. There are narrative passages which are very enjoyable which are lost in being translated to TV. And the TV series kept giving Poirot romances, which I found rather tiresome (only a couple of stories touch, very briefly, on Poirot\u2019s romantic interest in the Countess Vera). And in some of the later episodes in particular they made Poirot far too gloomy (he is never really gloomy in the books, not even the more serious ones like Sad Cypress or The Hollow). ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. First of all, I know this is kind of petty, but look at David Suchet, the most famous Poirot.  Now look at his eyes. Brown, right? Poirot\u2019s eyes are green. It\u2019s kind of his thing. It\u2019s the Daniel Radcliffe complaint. Of course, they\u2019re both great for their roles, but it bugs me. Look, the Poirots are good, but they\u2019re not that good. Book to screen is always hard, but ugh. They change the plots, they change the characters, they change the motives, the endings. It drives me crazy. It\u2019s like they didn\u2019t even read the books. ",
