            "answer_text": "There is two sides to this coin. Do you want to become rich because your are reading, or from your reading. From your reading. By this I mean that you earn cash from every page you turn. There are multiple ways you can be doing this e.g. if you become a book critic, a editor or a publisher. If you become a book critic, you write about the books you read for people who like books. Perhaps you make a website where authors ask you to comment on their work. Maybe you earn money by correcting the grammar of other people\u2019s work. Or you publish their works. In all cases, you may not earn money directly from reading, but reading is most certainly a part of the job - otherwise you wouldn\u2019t know what to write, edit or publish.Because I am reading. If this is the case, you want to earn money from what you are reading. That is, if you are reading books on success, money, economics, investing, etc. and transform them into money by applying the principles you learn, and the knowledge you gain. You might be able to sell money, or take the right steps to opening a business. Perhaps you can overcome or completely avoid costly pitfalls, because you know the answers beforehand.So reading books, can help you become rich. I have not yet personally encountered a rich person who did not read a lot (except a few cases of inherited wealth). Hope it helps. ",

            "answer_text": "What the teacher means is that you must be a lifelong learner. You read in order to learn new things. How did inventors create their inventions? What did Steve Jobs do that made Apple successful? Reading biographies tells you a lot about how people created companies that employed people and made money for the founders. You learn skills through reading. What are the latest trends in online business? Do you know how to create a sales funnel? Can you measure conversions? Do you know how rich people really make money and save it in order to make even more? There are magazines that talk about these things. There are books that are how to guides. Do you understand how to manage yourself and your relationships? Do you know what the latest thinking is in how to complete projects in the least amount of time with the highest degree of success? There are scientific studies that explain exactly how to do these things with case studies and examples. How do you know about any of this if you don\u2019t read - and read widely? ",
