            "answer_text": "You say in \u201cthe real world.\u201d ASOIAF isn\u2019t the real world, it\u2019s a fantasy story. And in this fantasy story, one knight can make another knight. The title \u201cknight\u201d in and of itself doesn\u2019t tell you much in the story. Some very powerful, wealthy and/or skillful men were never knighted, and plenty of morons, evildoers and/or urchin types were. You say it\u2019s a risk because \u201cany [guy] could make his own army.\u201d And \u2026 so? If the guy can provision his men and keep them disciplined and recruit skilled fighters, them being knighted or not is moot. And if it\u2019s a rag-tag bunch of sops, them being knighted won\u2019t in and of itself make them more imposing. Knighthood in the story is a social and chivalric courtesy, i.e. a knight can form his own house and has the right to make his own sigil or motto if he chooses. He can enter into service or take on squires and men into his own service. He can purchase land, compete more easily in tournaments and, if his overlord allows, keep a castle. All of this is true even if knights can make other knights (and obviously this doesn\u2019t get too out of check in Westeros or else everyone would be knighted, and they aren\u2019t). ",

            "answer_text": "Just being knighted doesnt give you access to resources or land, the things that make a knight the fearsome force that they are. All being knighted really does by itself is indenture your servitude as a fighter to the power structure that knighted you. You become a bannerman so to speak. But its not the titles of knights that make a person powerful in this world or in a song of ice and fire. Its money and land. The ability to keep your equipment in top shape and support peasants that will grow food for your household and in order to sell for further resources. These are the things that make a person truly powerful. Knights without these things are nothing more then decent fighters, usually with piecemeal equipment, recognized by their lords for whatever services they rendered. They are hedge knights. Ultimately the king or high septon can unknight them just as easily as their lord knighted them if they act against those powers. Knighthood is contingent on loyalty to the power structure. It doesnt mean anything outside that context. Anyone who would have the authority to knight someone in battle, would have the resources to get an army. Knighting a bunch of peasants doesnt create an army. But unless they have a lot of power they wont be able to disrupt the power structure. That requires the accumulated armies of many lesser lords. One despot with an itch to knight some folks isnt going to do it. ",
