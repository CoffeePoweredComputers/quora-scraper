            "answer_text": "U.S. perspective I had to think about this question a bit and do some research because, as is explained below, it raises a subtle issue concerning copyright ownership and derivative works. If the translator is providing the translation with the copyright holder\u2019s permission, there (presumably) will be an agreement that specifies the parties\u2019 respective rights, thus this question will not arise. Accordingly, I will assume that the translator is not translating the work with the copyright holder\u2019s permission. According to 17 USC Section 101[1], a translation of a copyrighted work is a derivative work (emphasis added): A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d. According to 17 USC Section 106[2], the copyright holder\u2019s exclusive rights include the exclusive right: (2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work[.] This is where the subtle issue arises: Does someone who prepares a derivative work without permission hold the copyright to the derivative work subject to an infringement action by the copyright holder, or is there no copyright in the infringing derivative work? I could not find any statutory or case authority that answers this question. However, Copyright Office Circular 14, \u201cCopyright in Derivative Works and Compilations\u201d[3], states the following at page 2 (emphasis added): Only the owner of copyright in a work has the right to prepare, or to authorize someone else to create, an adaptation of that work. The owner of a copyright is generally the author or someone who has obtained the exclusive rights from the author. In any case where a copyrighted work is used without the permission of the copyright owner, copyright protection will not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully. The unauthorized adaption of a work may constitute copyright infringement. I believe that the foregoing is correct. If the copyright holder has the exclusive right to make a derivative work, then, for the purposes of copyright law, any derivative work that is not created pursuant to that exclusive right cannot have a copyright. So, applying the foregoing to this question, the conclusion is that no one holds the copyright to the translation that was made without the permission of the holder of the original work\u2019s copyright.  Addendum based on a comment exchange with Todd Gardiner, below Todd comment: If I follow your logic, then a consequence of your assertion is that the original author can then use the translation that was made without needing the permission of the translator. That doesn\u2019t sound correct to me, not morally, nor legally. Dana reply: Interesting hypothetical, though I am confident that a court would not conclude as you have suggested. Even if there is no copyright in the translated work, there are other bases (especially equitable, such as unjust enrichment) for a U.S. court to decide that the author of the original work does not have an unfettered right to use the translation.

            "answer_text": "A translation is a \u201cderivative work.\u201d In addition, a translation may or may not be a work for hire. Most translations are done by a publishing house, which buys the language rights to a work. Publishing houses usually hire translators to do the translation as a work for hire, meaning copyright vests with the publishing house, not the translator. If a translator does a translation on their own, not as a work for hire, then the copyright vests with the translator. Because a translation is a work for hire, the translator cannot do anything with the translation without permission of the copyright holder of the original work, if the original work is not in the public domain. This is, at any rate, how it is supposed to work in most countries. That said, the reality on the ground may be\u2026complex. An Italian publisher, for instance, has published an unauthorized translation of my book More Than Two. We looked into legal action, but the baroque (and, let\u2019s be honest, highly corrupt) nature of Italian civil law and lawsuits makes it nearly impossible for us to take any meaningful action without shelling out a lot of money we are extremely unlikely to get back. We\u2019ve had two different Italian lawyers tell us that we are clearly in the right, but a lawsuit would almost certainly be a fruitless waste of money. ",
