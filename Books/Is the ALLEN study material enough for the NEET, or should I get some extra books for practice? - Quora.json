            "answer_text": "ALLEN study material is good for biology only because conceptual things of Chemistry and Physics are not given in modules so IF YOU ARE NOT A CLASSROOM STUDENT there then you must do question practice for understanding MCQ and clear your concepts(understanding physics and concepts of DC Pandey) or from any other good book whose solutions are given and it would be better if you can join test series as well and if you are a regular classroom student then solve arihant DC Pandey for JEE MAINS with the chapters covering at classroom it will help you a lot and bulid up your confidence and for chemistry question practice ALLEN RACE and modules have enough good quality question so repeat them to practice again and again at suitable interval of time bcz if you are in 12th or dropper then you don't have much time to mug up new things a lot so just give your time to MCQs and Notes for any query you can comment :) ",
