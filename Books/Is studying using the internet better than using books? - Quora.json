            "answer_text": "Learning anything requires a gross knowledge about the field you're interested into. If you're learning something new: Approach the proffesionals, the pioneers. Stick to books for starters and keep a daily goal of reading certain number of pages. 25 pages a day wouldn't consume more than an hour and you would get ample amount of time to dedicate to your schedule. Secondarily, you could take the help of tech and internet to polish your knowledge since the internet beholds myriad of ideas and various approaches towards the same goal. Make sure you don't drift away to different lanes while surfing the net for what you need to know. Internet could be a little distractive but otherwise, it's another great way to learn. When using internet, know which sites provide you the best knowledge that interests you and fits your needs. Dont go all around searching for various sites landing in the middle of nowhere. Youtube and wikipedia are the best for visual and texual info respectively. When learning something that you knew but got a lil rusted in your brain: Once in a while, you gotta dust off the rust in your head and re-learn different subjects of your intetest. Use the internet in this case since you alteady know quite a bit bout the topic and you just need to brush up. Write down everything that you learn in order to retain the evaporative topics. Make sure you learn something new each day. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Because while studying using the internet , you have to search for each and every thing. When you are downloading a book and reading, it is not comfortable to take hints or to note down any important points. And also you can't continuously read for more than few hours using a computer or any other gadgets because it may affect your eyes and it causes headache. So the better choice is books. ",
