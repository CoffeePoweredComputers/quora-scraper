            "answer_text": "Self-publishing isn\u2019t about the platforms you use to publish your book, but rather it\u2019s about who pays for publishing it. If you are publishing under your own ISBN and have done all the necessary work to publish it, then it\u2019s self-publishing. If you have hired a hybrid or vanity publisher to help you polish the book and it\u2019s being published under their ISBN, because you have paid for the services rendered, it\u2019s still self-publishing (in this case, sometimes referred to as \u201cindie publishing\u201d too). If you submitted your book to a publisher or small press and they took on the risk and expense of publishing your work so that you don\u2019t have to pay for any of the services rendered, then you are no longer self-publishing. If you found a literary agent willing to \u201cshop\u201d your book around to publishers, you are going the \u201ctraditional\u201d publishing route and are definitely not self-publishing. Just a word of caution, though. Hybrid and vanity publishers are not one and the same. Vanity publishers will tell you that your book is the best thing since sliced bread, and they\u2019ll publish it for you as long as you have the funds to pay for it. They provide little guidance or direction as to how to improve the book and once it\u2019s in your hands, they only want to hear from you when you\u2019re ready to order more (over-priced) books from them or to buy one of their marketing packages. A hybrid publisher, on the other hand, partners with you to create the best finished product possible. They provide guidance and direction to you so that you are able to market and sell your book in ways that work for you. Regardless of which publishing model you\u2019re using, all publishers may use Amazon\u2019s KDP to get books on Amazon. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Self-publishing is when you do all the leg work yourself or pay others to do it (that\u2019s what a publisher does, they pay employees to design covers, edit, open the mail, answer the phones). Like self-publish is what happens when you go to a third party who has their own web site but doesn\u2019t put printed books into stores at no cost to you. That is basically the same as self-publishing, except you have no control and make less money. A true publisher prints book at no cost to the author and puts them on the racks and shelves at Barnes & Noble because they have a distribution contract. As a self-publisher you can not get your books into wide distribution without advertising money. The best you can do is a few on consignment locally. Traditional publishers, self-publishers, \u201clike self-publishers\u201d and those who opt for Kindle\u2019s Expanded Distribution all have one thing in common: They all go through Ingram Content for world-wide distributions on a PAID ORDER basis from book stores. A book store has their data base and can order any book from the Dictionary to YOUR self-published book if you opted for Expanded Distribution or went through Ingram Spark. But there has to be a paying customer ordering that book. Then Lightning source will print it and Ingram will send it out with their regular orders to that dealer. ",
