            "answer_text": "Like personally? I would assume so since I have not heard or read anything about his failing health. He is an older male and he did have quite the issue quite a few years back when he was struck by a car? Van? as he was walking down the side of the road. He probably has many aches and pains that come from that incident as it landed him in hospital for quite a while. The older you get the longer it takes to heal. Is he okay mentally? Well he has had his issues with alcohol and drug abuse. But he turned a corner on that one. Unlike many of the characters he has written he did hold the key to his survival and he chose to take it and turn that lock to open the door. Is he okay as a writer? Well I would say so. He certainly seems to appeal to quite a few people, enough fans that Hollywood got interested and he if did not have a direct influence on the movies made out of his books, they definitely put his name into common usage. In what aspect are you trying to imply he is not okay? Because he disagrees with the the current administration and publicly speaks out against things he sees as both unfair and a great violation of human and civil rights? If that is your criteria for okay or not okay then we will either be great friends or bitter enemies. Overall I would say Stephen King is in that time when you can be outspoken, be honest and actually is okay. But if you want a better answer you have to ask a better question. Hope this helps. ",
