            "answer_text": "Yes you can. But make sure you do not sell on the same site, from where you bought, this is just a safety thing i am suggesting. Also raise legal tax invoice and pay tax whatever is there, this business cannot be just for fun, and all legal formalities need to be done. I am a seller and what you are thinking is not going to make you earn profits as all websites will charge your commissions ranging from 10\u201330% depending on products and categories. Buying online and re-selling even if you have at a discounted rate and coupons i believe you do not have such discounts, if you want to sell online you need atleast 50% margin, that too you will realise after some months whether you are actually making profits, so beware.
