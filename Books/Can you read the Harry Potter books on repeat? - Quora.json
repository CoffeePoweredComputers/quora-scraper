            "answer_text": "Can you read the Harry Potter books on repeat? Yes I have, I actually read them two times in a row to my son then daughter. Due to the fact both have their favorites I read the \u201cGoblet of Fire\u201d, \u201cOrder of the Phoenix\u201d, \u201cThe Half Blood Prince\u201d, and \u201cThe Deathly Hallows\u201d three times. I actually really love them and I\u2019m 42 years old! I have to tell anybody reading if your basing the enjoyment of these characters, stories, and world on only the movies you are seriously missing out. Try the Audio books if reading isn\u2019t your thing but trust me they are fantastic and everytime I have gone through them I found something I previously missed. My daughter is now 5 and son is 10 so I\u2019m hoping to talk her into one more go around before she gets to old for Daddy.. ",

And I almost always have the audiobooks on as background noise during the day - just on a loop. I\u2019m familiar enough with the story that I can listen to it while I\u2019m working or gaming without being too distracted. ",
