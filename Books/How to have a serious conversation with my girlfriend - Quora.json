            "answer_text": "By first understanding that as a man you can't. Women don't think the way men do. Trying to talk to them in the same way you'd talk to another man doesn't work. The best way to talk about a subject with a woman is to first give them subject matter. They're responsive more once subject is made apparent. Give brief statements allowing the woman to share input. Don't try to dominate conversation as a woman will feel left out by not being able to respond. Denying them response time means you really didn't want a serious conversation. In this form of conversation, you'll find women can add wisdom to your situation. Good luck!! ",

            "answer_text": "First, know there\u2019s a time and a place. You have to know when it\u2019s appropriate. For example, at her parents house is a TERRIBLE time to start a serious conversation. At a party or event, or immediately after is also a not a great place to have a serious conversation. Not sober? Not a good idea. Carve out time where you are both free, have no constraints, and have the mental faculty to process your emotions correctly. There was a really great coffee shop by my house that has a semi-private patio where I took my partner to have a serious conversation. We grabbed a cup of coffee together, and found a (somewhat) secluded area. Next I asked her if she could turn her phone off for a few minutes, and that DEFINITELY set the tone. I don\u2019t exactly know what the nature of your conversation is, but I can provide some starters and you can tweak them as needed. There\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been uncomfortable to bring up, but\u2026I wanted to tell you / get your opinion on something, because your trust is important to me\u2026I\u2019ve been feeling conflicted about this, and I need your insight\u2026Know your audience. If your partner processes things emotionally, be sure to include genuine words about how things make you feel. If your partner is more logical, then you can get straight to the point. Its very important to share your emotions with an empathetic person. Taking the time to do so can be very rewarding ;) ",
