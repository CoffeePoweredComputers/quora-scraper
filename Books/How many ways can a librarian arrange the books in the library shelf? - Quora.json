            "answer_text": "A librarian can arrange the books in the library shelves in a number of ways: By classification number followed in the library. Most of the large libraries having books on varied subjects follow this method.By broad categorization by subjects. Medium and small libraries which do not follow any standard classification systems follow this method.By language, followed by author name, arranged alphabetically. This is seen in libraries having only fictions.By sections. School libraries can arrange books - for kindergarten, primary, secondary, and higher secondary.Alphabetically by titles. This is followed in small libraries having books on 1 or 2 subjects.By accession number. A library in the beginning stage can have this system till the collection becomes sizable to have a classification systemBy book size/ color. This is a primitive system",

            "answer_text": "Books are arranged according to the classification system used by the library in question. In the United States, this is most likely to be the Dewey Decimal system or the Library of Congress system. Specialty libraries (medical, government documents, law, etc.) might typically use a system which gives them more flexibility/finer detail in arranging their materials. There are other classification systems in use world-wide. Perhaps someone else can comment on those. ",
