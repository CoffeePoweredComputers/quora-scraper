            "answer_text": "First we have to dispell the notion that entanglement is a quality unique to quantum scale events. If I pick a card out of a deck, write down what it is on a nakin and send you to the other side of the universe; when you look at the napkin you know instantaneously what the card in my hand is. If i give the card to alice and send her to ther left side of the universe, the you and alice scenario is a real world thing, not metaphor. It is in fact the nineteenth century riddle that raised the question in physics in the fiest place. This is not determinism, this is a causal path. The cause of the napkin is drawing the card from the deck. Time is superpostioned just as the electron, when the electron is a wave function, is superpostioned. This is a very long answer, but I keep getting the same questions repeatedly. In particular, look at the link to my answer regarding the HUP. Note that the HUP is only sequitur to the electron so long as it remains a wave function. As a wave function, the electron is in a distribution of places and velocities (hence momenta) that got it to those superpositions of places. Once the electron is detected, is \u2018collapses\u2019 to a particle, and the urban myth that the HUP applies is busted. If you can\u2019t measure both the instantaneous (very small) position and velocity of an electron, nothing in our modern world would work. Even a CRT (old fashioned TV) requires exact location (at the screen, pixel) and velocity (to sweep the electron beam across the screen). The same is true of RADAR, and just about every gadget you use, such as your laptop, right now. If the position and velocity of the electron is chaotic in the chip, then your computer is f&cked. There is nothing more I HATE than getting the HUP consistently wrong. see my answer at Bill Bray's answer to What is quantum entanglement, and what is a superposition in quantum mechanics? Ok, so I got so many requests on this subject that I feel like Santa the week before Christmas. First, understand that I have answered this question in several different ways on Quora, so I will be referring you to several of my former answers rather than re-write the whole thing over again. Second, I have written a text for laymen, which was free to Quora users, but I get crap from the Quora High Command whenever I refer you off site. So, although there is an entire 850 page thick book freely available, I\u2019m not allowed to direct you to it. My answers are typically copy and paste from the text. The first thing you need to review is this, which describes the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiments by Kim, et al: https://www.quora.com/If-an-electron-is-in-a-superposition-state-of-two-possible-energy-levels-from-where-would-it-absorb-energy-to-jump-to-the-next-level-if-the-wave-function-collapses/answer/Bill-Bray-6 You will note that in the first video, he mentions a Nobel for answering this question. That is completely true and correct. Therefore, since no Nobel has been awarded to any web site or TV documentary for answering the subject, COMPLETELY FORGET everything you have heard. Just to clarify: when we got to describing the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser, that erased all doubt that the conscious observer plays a role in the system, not merely an inert detector. Again, no mechanistic argument otherwise has been awarded the awaiting Nobel, therefore counter arguments otherwise simply ideologically contradict the outcome of the experiments. The current verbiage uses the term \u2018entangled with the past\u2019 rather than outwardly state \u2018retro causality,\u2019 or causality violation.\u2019 Among the countless claims of an explanation, none have occurred. In 2012 Wineland and Haroche were awarded a Nobel for scaling the phenomenon up to the macroscopic scale. [Sharon Begley, Chris Wickham; A Nobel prize for being in two places at once, SCIENCE NEWS OCTOBER 9, 2012] Some have misidentified this with a Nobel for a mechanistic explanation of the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser. This development led to the current Quantum Computing model. Essentially, what Wineland and Haroche accomplished was to hit an atom with exactly half of the photon energy to move it to another position. What resulted was the atom being in both locations simultaneously. Normally such a superposition is limited to a single photon or electron. However, scaling it up to atomic proportions was a Nobel piece of work. To make it more clear, Superposition is an observed phenomenon. There are countless mathematical descriptions of it. HOWEVER, there is NO explanation what or why it is. To use superposition as an explanation is non-sequitur. Superposition is not defined, albeit there are tons of mathematical equations describing the behavior by way of observation; that is not an explanation of what or why it is. The math only describes what it may or may not do. In the double slit phenomenon, why does superposition occur at one or both slits rather than anywhere else in the cosmos? Even according to all of the current mathematical descriptions of superposition, there is a wide distribution of possible localities extending out to infinity. While there is a greater probability that it is superpositioned across a more narrow choice of locations, there is no equation on Earth that describes that there are exactly two possible superpositions, oddly at each slit. (Except for those that are fudge). The answer being superposition (with respect to spacial locality), then, is a billion times more mysterious than the original question. That is, the choices in superposition of localities is infinite, and inexplicably result in one or both slits; the odds are exactly infinity to 1 that this is the correct answer. It is in fact so absurd, that it is embarrassing to watch. In the Delayed Choice portion of Kim et al\u2019s setup, why does superposition occur 8ns back in time at detector D-zero rather than any other time in the universe? The answer, again, of the magic black box superposition then becomes a billion times more mysterious than the original question; again. Yes, the wave function is superpositioned in time, and again, the choice of possible localities in time is ultimately spread across (this differs a little) from the Big Bang until the exact present. Why it is superpositioned at exactly two localities in time and not smeared equally across 4 x 1027 (the number of nanoseconds of the age of the current cosmos) temporal localities is a thousand, trillion, trillion times less likely to be the correct answer. That is, the temporal location in superposition is a smear, rather than a distinct locality. In spacial locality, there are one or two outcomes, and we\u2019re OK with that. In temporal locality, (like Bob and Alice) once two positions materialize, the temporal order between them becomes a smear, not distinct. If the temporal localities were distinct, normal \u2018signaling\u2019 between Bob and Alice would be observed, taking time; and Quantum Entanglement would not be observed. Again, this suggestion is so bizarre it is embarrassing to watch someone say it. (Like you\u2019re the one who is embarrassed when the comedian or performer on stage sucks, an oddity in human empathy). Part of what Wineland and Wickham achieved was in fact, getting an atom to superposition where they wanted it to be. However, their methodology is in no way related to the Delayed Choice or the Quantum Eraser phenomenon. Again, I need to stress, amidst the claims of mechanistic answers and claims of observed, yet unexplained phenomenon being an answer is only embarrassing to watch and hear. No one has explained what or why superposition is, there is only math describing the way it behaves after observing it for a century. There is a degree of predictability, but there is no such (non-fudged) equation that places the outcomes at exactly both of the spacial localities of Kim, et al\u2019s setup (which was an arbitrary choice) and temporal localities of exactly 8 nanoseconds apart in Kim\u2019s choice of placement of detector Dx and D0, which was also chosen arbitrarily. It is akin to stating that the God of Superposition was watching over Kim and his colleagues, and taking very careful measurements of their setup while they were not looking, so as to befuddle mankind\u2019s understanding of reality. <\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdx\ufffd\ufffd8 That is, the only Nobel on the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser is scaling it up in size to the real world. There is no universally accepted model which removes the conscious observer from the system. However, those who do render such arguments are quite vocal and zealous. They make claims of \u2018closed time loops,\u2019 the HUP, pure probability, and so on, but again, no universally acceptable answer. \u201cI regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulating consciousness.\u201d - Max Planck [Kahn, Boundless Paradox, Dec 4, 2015] Again, I need to stress, amidst the claims of mechanistic answers and calm dismissals, there is no such answer the removes the conscious observer from the system. You can and will find countless arguments to this effect, but the best that has been achieved is to scale the phenomenon up is size to the atomic. I have read a lot of dismissals of the DCQE as some mechanistic argument, none work. Regarding the photon as superpositioned in space and time (which it is) does not dismiss the result, especially in light of the fact that this phenomenon has been scaled up to the macroscopic. Then, go on to this answer to review the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The explanation will undoubtedly raise hell because of the urban myths that have prevailed since childhood. Nonetheless, this is the correct meaning of the HUP: https://www.quora.com/The-double-slit-experiment-proved-that-direct-observation-altered-results-What-would-happen-if-the-sensors-recorded-results-but-the-results-werent-accessible-by-humans-For-example-what-if-a-computer-put-an/answer/Bill-Bray-6 In that answer, you can see that causality was never a \u2018property\u2019 of physics. There is no linearity to time. We choose to perceive time in this way (linear) because we are quantumly weird. For instance, I do not want you to drag this information into your frame of reference and homogenize it with your view, you MUST move into this frame of reference of the explanation, else, walk away with nothing but another confabulated myth. That is, don\u2019t try and validate your concepts via these explanations, forget everything you know and move into this new frame of reference with me. Then we get to Quantum Gravity. You need to know this because, rather than the Higg\u2019s having to do with anything, it appears in current thinking that space-time and its geometry (gravitation), and hence the forces and constants, properties and so on, are emergent phenomenon as a direct result of quantum entanglement. First you need to understand the Planck units: Bill Bray's answer to Why is Planck length minimum measurable length? In another text, I\u2019m not sure where, I take the -1 Law of Thermodynamics (That\u2019s negative 1 law of thermodynamics), \u2018Information cannot be destroyed,\u2019 as per Susskind\u2019s statement, and express what information is according to Bekenstein\u2019s Black Hole entropy, Wheeler\u2019s work on it, and eventually led to Verlinde\u2019s definition:  Where \u2018N\u2019 represents the number of bits of information, A\u03a9 represents a 2-dimensional Schwarzschild surface (like the surface of a Black Hole), and I believe by now we have discussed Lp. Therefore, I extrapolate this such that we can determine what \u2018N\u2019 is: (no one has outwardly stated what scope \u2018N\u2019 is, but it is obvious)  Furthermore, as a natural number, we set \u2018c\u2019 equal to 1, such that Lp = tp   To simplify, we think of entropy as an increase in the number of possible outcomes of a superposition of that wave function, and Ordiny as a decrease in the number of possible outcomes of that superposition. As the area A\u03a9 increases, the number of possible outcomes of a superposition increases, entropy increases. As A\u03a9 decreases, the number of possible superpositions decreases, Ordiny, or Gravitation. This then extends out to the other forces as well. Each force demonstrates either, ultimately, an increase in the number of possible superpositions (entropy) or decrease in the possible number of superpositions (Ordiny). We see Ordiny as an \u2018attractive force,\u2019 and entropy as repellent. So we take 1 bit, N, 4Lp^2, like a trigonal pyramid, but shape is impossible on a Planck scale, because, for instance, a triangle's hypotenuse is not an integer value of Lp, and therefore a triangle cannot exist, likewise for a circle, with pi diameters, and every other possible shape, and so on. Everything at the Planck scale - the Planck scale is a shapeless domain. This would be a good time to look at: Bill Bray's answer to Does Planck length go against the idea of a continuous space and time? This image was used to try and visualize quantized space on a Planck scale:  In any case, you can see that a triangle, which therefore has a hypotenuse of  a is not an integer value of Lp, and therefore impossible. A circle has a relationship to its diameter of pi, also not an integer of Lp, and so on with every possible normal shape. Then you can review : Bill Bray's answer to Is there a way how natural wormholes could form? This describes the \u2018quantum foam,\u2019 a characteristic of space-time that describes the dynamic structure on the Planck scale. There is a short review of this by wilczek, who actually measured the quantum foam\u2019s effect on the strong and weka forces (for which he earned a Nobel, at 48 minutes into:  In this bit, N, we either have information in it, or there is no information in it. If there is information in it, it by definition is entangled with some other bit of information somewhere. As the distance between these two bits N and N\u2019 increases, the probability that they are quantum entangled decreases, because the wave function in the HUP limits the amount of time such a thing can exist. If N is entangled with N\u2019, then each has an element a or its symmetric partner a\u2019. If there is no N\u2019 then there is no space-time in this scenario. If there is an N\u2019, then time limits us to the probability that it contains either a or a\u2019. From this time constraint, the number of possible superpositions is defined, and so the size of our world sheet, A\u03a9. This is how space-time is then an emergent form from information entropy vs. Ordiny. You may also note that \u2018c\u2019 is not a velocity, it defines the relationship between the world-sheet A\u03a9 with respect to Lp and tp (space and time). It is not a \u2018speed limit\u2019 it is the definition of space-time. 1. Arntzenius, Frank. (2000) \u201cAre there Really Instantaneous Velocities?\u201d, The Monist 83, pp. 187-208. 2. Barnes, J.

            "answer_text": "Quantum entanglement is damn hard to explain in layman\u2019s terms. Not because entanglement is complicated \u2014 it isn\u2019t \u2014 but because entanglement is so dangerously close to some concepts we are familiar with in the classical world, like communication and common-cause correlation. And because it\u2019s it\u2019s so close to these familiar concepts, it\u2019s horribly easy to jump to the conclusion that entanglement is \u201clike\u201d one of these. But the whole point \u2014 the whole thing that makes entanglement uniquely quantum and interesting \u2014 is that entanglement isn\u2019t like either of these things.  Here\u2019s one way to try to uncover the difference, by stealing a concept invented by Popescu and Rohrlich: the non-local box. Imagine you and a friend have a set of black boxes. On the top of each are two buttons marked \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d and a light, which instantly flashes red or green as soon as its button is pressed. These boxes are matched in pairs, and each box can only be used once \u2014 after a button is pressed, the lights just continue forever flashing the same colour. However, you do have an infinite supply of pairs of boxes. You and your friend play around with these boxes for a while and realise that they follow a rule. If either one of you presses button 0 then the lights will flash identical colours. But if you both press button 1, then the lights will be different. Beyond this rule (which always works) there seem to be no further pattern, the reds and greens just flash up with 50% probability.  By the way, the button presses don\u2019t have to be done at the same time \u2014 if one of you doesn\u2019t press a button, then no light shows on their box so you can\u2019t even check the rule. But if the button is subsequently pressed, then the light colour will respect the rule \u2014 even if you press it years or decades later than the other one. As a further test, you try separating the boxes (one of you goes to Alpha Centauri with a bunch of boxes, the other stays home) and you each randomly press buttons and record the colours the lights flash. When you return, you compare notes, and find out that the pairs of boxes were still following the rule, even when you both know that you only decided which button to press once you were four light years away from one another.  Two, very, very important things should be clear about these boxes. You can\u2019t send any messages \u2014 just from looking at a series of red or green lights flashing, you can\u2019t tell anything about what your friend is doing, and nor can you send them any messages. Locally, each set of colours are indistinguishable from random sequences. It is only after you come back together and compare notes that you can check the rule above.The pattern cannot be achieved by any local mechanism \u2014 no matter what supercomputer is inside the box, it can\u2019t follow the rule unless it \u201cknows\u201d which button has been pressed on the other one. This is strange, because when you sent one of the pairs to Alpha Centauri, you thought you\u2019d made sure that this information was impossible to obtain.If they are not immediately clear, then it\u2019s very, very worth convincing yourself of the two statements above before continuing, and it\u2019s also worth getting comfortable that both things (\u201cno signalling\u201d and \u201cnon-local\u201d) can exist at the same time. If it feels odd, then \u2026 good, it should feel odd.  Further, if you feel like playing around with some of these boxes then you\u2019re in luck: someone has gone and created Popescu-Rohrlich boxes for Minecraft. You can download the mod here and play about with the buttons and lights as much as you like: PR-boxes in Minecraft:   OK. Now, in fact, these boxes cannot be constructed in the actual world \u2026 But, we can make pairs of boxes that show about an 85% success rate at following the rule above. This can be done by using entangled particles and placing them in the pairs of boxes. Pressing the buttons measures them in different ways. The flashing lights give the results of these measurements. It\u2019s not particularly important exactly how this works, but it can be done. What is important is that even at an 85% success rate, both of the statements above: \u201cno signalling\u201d and \u201cnon-local\u201d remain provably true in our actual world. Demonstrating that they hold at an 85% rate isn\u2019t quite as obvious as seeing that they hold at the 100% success rate \u2014 but it\u2019s true, and provably so. That is, entangled particles show correlations that: Are higher than anything achievable with any local mechanism (it\u2019s not classical common-cause).Cannot be used to send messages (it\u2019s not communication either).These correlations are what we call quantum entanglement. And you should be able to see now why it\u2019s tough to explain in everyday, layman\u2019s terms. The whole point of entanglement is that it\u2019s not similar to anything that happens in the everyday classical world. It is a signature feature of the quantum world, which is also precisely why it is so interesting. ",
