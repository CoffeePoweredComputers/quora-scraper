            "answer_text": "You would find this information on the indicia page of any existing editions that were published in the past 70 years (assuming he\u2019s still alive). You would likely begin there and then contacting the publisher, expressing your interest in producing a translation. They can flatly decline and in a few cases, me getting in touch to express interest in doing so has prompted the publisher to translate and sell their own edition. If the publisher has lost the rights to the book, normally because they let it go out of print, the rights almost always revert back to the author, who would own the rights to their work and whom you should reach out to if the publisher does not own the work.
