            "answer_text": "I will tell you how safe are Hindus in Bengal.I am a Bengali Hindu.I will tell everything from my own personal experience. 1)My village is in West Midnapore in Mohanpur.My uncle was travelling through a car in one of the slum area of Mohanpur inhabited by muslims.it happened that at the same time two Muslim youths were riding bike and they collided with my uncle's car.Instantly the whole Muslim community of that slum supported the two youths although it was their fault.They even threatened my uncle.I am not spreading fake news but it really happened.Recently in protests against BJP the TMC party used local Muslims in their protests in Mohanpur.You know what these people did.They did vandalizing of homes.You can ask people of Mohanpur. 2)see for yourself how the WB government concealer Dhulagarh riots. 3)Kahgragarh bombing culprits mostly were illegal Bangladesh immigrants whom the opposition including Congress,TMC and Leftist parties are trying to save from NRC. 4)Recently one my uncle was beaten by a Muslim youth after a bike collision in a Muslim slum area in Baksispur village in East Midnapore.The whole Muslim community did nothing to stop the beating.Infact many of them supported the youth. After this how do you expect me to say Hindus are safe in West Bengal.Our beloved Didi Smt.Mamta Banerjee gets irritated hearing Jai Shri Ram but with joy shouts Allah u Akbar.Please note I am not being communal.If Hindu extremism is rising then the sole reason is minority appeasement by Congress and leftist parties.You people might have seen that how the Muslims reacted to NRC in Uluberia area of Bengal.I don't like the BJP version of Hinduism but I hate TMC\u2019s version of Secularism.Atleast BJP is trying dilute some of these problems like illegal immigration.Yes I support NRC.Pseudo secularist who are opposing NRC stating that it affects secularism please understand that you are creating a grave problem for Hindus.And I don't hate Muslims.But I hate ideologies like Wahabism which are imparted to Muslim community through Saudi funded Madrassas.These places are breeding grounds of terrorists.Many Muslims are truly good and they themselves should understand that how these sort of things affects their reputations.

            "answer_text": "Okay, Bengali here. From West Bengal itself. And just to make it clear, I am not a Trinomool supporter, in case you think my answer is biased. Look, I don\u2019t know what the rest of Indians have got into their heads, but Hindus and Muslims in WB are NOT at war with each other. We continue to cooperate with one another, as we always have. First, let me give you some background about Hindu-Muslim interactions in West Bengal. Bengali muslims have tremendous respect for great personages like Swami Vivekananda, Ramkrishna Paramhansa, Rabindranath Tagore, Raja Ram Mohan Roy and others. Likewise, we Hindu Bengalis hold personages such as Kazi Nazrul Islam in high honour as well. Insult the great Nazrul in front of a Bengali Hindu, and he will make pudding out of you in three minutes. Because This. Is. Bengal. For centuries, Hindus and Muslims have lived together comfortably in Bengal. There have been occasional clashes, but except for the partition of 1947, there has never been a significant friction. We wear the same dress, eat the same food (fish, meat, mutton), enjoy the same sports, have similar opinions on life and work, and most important of all, speak the same language. For us, religion is a fairly superficial basis for classification. It has always been so. (except in 1947) In 2002, a muslim man from the Purulia district of WB saved a dilapidated local temple by petitioning to make it a heritage site (I am sorry I don\u2019t have a link now, but it was all over the news then). There are many Bengali muslims who are conversant with Hindu mythology, and some Bengali muslims even know Sanskrit quite well. Some of our best handicrafts depicting mythological events are crafted by Muslim artisans. Muslims enjoy the Durga Puja just as much as we hindus do. In fact, the first ever Bengali translation of the Mahabharata, as well as that of the Ramayana, were both commissioned by Muslim rulers - the Pandobbijoy by the great meritocrat Sultan Hussein Shah. The most popular Bengali Eid song right now is Doriyae ailo Toofan, and it was written by Gautam Chattopadhya - a Hindu. He was to co-founder of India\u2019s first rock band: Mohiner Ghoraguli. Now we come to the problem at hand - the recent friction between the communities in WB. The link in the question description talks about the kidnapping of Hindu girls by Muslim gang-boss. I understand that this is a very serious crime, but does this sort of thing not happen in other states? There have been (and still continue to be) Hindu rapists in Delhi, the heart of the nation itself. Crimes are committed, and the underworld association sometimes does have a large number of Muslim participants, as it was in Mumbai during the days of Daud Ibrahim. While attention is definitely required, there is no reason to put their religion as the basis of fault. Remember the hue-and-cry about the Malda violence? Well, I have friends from Malda. They said quite frankly that the violence had been limited to a specific part of the district. It wasn\u2019t like every Hindu in Malda was running for his/her life. Yes, it was serious. I won\u2019t sugarcoat something like that. But lets not interpret the violent actions of a couple of misled youths as a Jihad, shall we? During my BE days, we used to live in a hostel but return home for weekends. I have a Hindu friend and a Muslim friend from Malda, and they always returned together, buying adjacent tickets and chatting all the way back home. Now look, I won\u2019t deny that there have been instances of communal violence in WB in recent times. Yes, a stash of explosives and guns were found in a Trinamool neta\u2019s house. Just before you jump to conclusions, many Muslim Bengalis are deeply opposed to the Trinamool. While in several states, party ideologies and support bases are based quite deeply rooted along religious lines, that is not the case here. Neither the CPI(M), nor the Trinamool Congress has a core affinity towards the followers of any one religion, although the Trinamools are trying to make a vote bank out of the muslim populace. They have been somewhat successful so far, but their success rate is not so alarming. Being a fairly liberal state helps, you see. Bengali Muslims can see through the fake smiles of \u2018religious\u2019 leaders, just as Bengali Hindus can. Likewise, there are darker places in WB itself, where communal hatred runs deep. But such violence is seldom committed by the bengali muslims themselves. They are often the result of the (and I mean no offence or stereotype here) Urdu-speaking muslim population in WB. Also, more often than not, these are wild acts done under the influence of alcohol, so they don\u2019t exactly count as \u2018religious animosity\u2019. A nice knock from the CRPF has always set these doodgers right, and it always will. The main problem here is our proximity to Bangladesh, the porousness of the Indo-Bangladesh border, and the existence of the Jamat-ul-Islam in Bangladesh. The problem is not the Indian bengali muslim. The problem is a foreigner. But trust me, these problems are on the decline. West Bengal is getting more and more peaceful, with each increment in tolerance. Rationalism does not hurt Bengal, it heals the wounds of Bengal\u2019s past. Trust me, we Bengalis do not need to get fired up, but rather to calm down. We have always seen through false barriers like religion and caste, and that remains the way forward. As the great 15th century Bengali poet Chandi Das has written, \u09b8\u09ac\u09be\u09b0 \u0989\u09aa\u09b0\u09c7 \u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09c1\u09b7 \u09b8\u09a4\u09cd\u09af, \u09a4\u09be\u09b9\u09be\u09b0 \u0989\u09aa\u09b0\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be\u0987\u0964 \u201cThe highest truth is humanity, above that is nought.\u201d ",
