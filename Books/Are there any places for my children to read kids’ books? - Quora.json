            "answer_text": "There are actually a lot of places where you can give a kid\u2019s books for your child to read. In my case, there are some local library near me which are free to enter and read there. Other than that, I usually go online when I don\u2019t have the time to take my child\u2019s there. I\u2019m using this application to read a book online through my phone, or tab for my child\u2019s. The book is in an eBook format and if you don\u2019t know, eBook[1] is an electronic book, also known as an e-book or eBook, is a book publication made available in digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, readable on the flat-panel display of computers or other electronic devices. There are two reading there that became my child\u2019s favorite. The first one is called \u201cAdventure of Huckleberry Finn\u201d, and the second one is called \u201cJust So Stories\u201d. If you\u2019re wondering where to go and what to read, then you can give these books a try. Footnotes[1] http://E-book - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book)",

            "answer_text": "Nature is our greatest teacher as she has got so many things in store for us and has her ways to teach people and make them aware of its importance. You can take to your children out in the garden and teach or read to them as well as play with them. It is a really fun and interesting way of teaching, in that kind of environment. You can visit the nearby libraries too as that will encourage reading and exploration in children and also helps to participate in the community.  I hope you will find many collections of children\u2019s books at MyPustak, which is an online website for used books free of cost or at a cheap price (pay the shipping and handling charges). Best wishes. ",
