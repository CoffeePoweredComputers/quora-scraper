            "answer_text": "It is not only possible for foreign books and stories to be made into manga and/or anime, it is not especially uncommon. People who make manga and/or anime do so with whatever source material they want. For instance, a lot of Miyazaki\u2019s works come from Western sources. Studio Ghibli has adapted Howl\u2019s Moving Castle, A Wizard of Earthsea, The Borrowers, and When Marnie Was There. Switching genres a bit, you will also find manga or anime adaptations of The Viscount\u2019s Betrothal, Heidi, Deltora Quest, The Moomins, and several others. The normal process seems to be like this: A book is written.It becomes popular in its home country.It becomes translated into Japanese. (N.B.: if the mangaka is very fluent in English or another foreign language, this step may be skipped\u2014but be aware that a goodly fraction of all books published in Japan are translations. Very literate Japanese people know more Western literature than I do.)A mangaka finds it, falls in love with it, and wants to adapt it.Negotiations about translation/adaptation rights.The mangaka makes the manga adaptation.",

            "answer_text": "Not only possible, it\u2019s been done. Studio Ghibli has adapted several non-Japanese books into animated movies. And the movies are amazing. Howl\u2019s Moving Castle (Dianne Wynn Jones)Tales of Earthsea (Ursula Le Guin)When Marnie Was There (Joan G Robinson)Arietty (The Borrowers by Mary Norton) Also Miraculous Ladybug & Cat Noir is made in collaboration of a French animation studio and Tohei co. (the same animation studio that created Dragonball Z) Originally the series was going to be a 2-D anime but global audience marketing and the glitches caused by animating Ladybug\u2019s outfit made them turn to 3D animation. I wish I could give you information as to how this happens. I assume the companies/creators contact the authors for permission to adapt the novel, similar to how movie companies do contracts. ",
