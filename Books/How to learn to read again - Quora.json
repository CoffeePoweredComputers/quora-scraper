            "answer_text": "Practice, practice and guess what more practice! The only way you'll develop your reading skills is to consistently do it! Get into the rhythm of reading, you don't need to start with full novels but more with casual readings. Magazines are a great place to start, if National Geographic or Time magazine has an interesting cover page, flip through it and read the article! After doing this for a while you should take a trip up to your local bookstore and spend a few hours there, go around to different sections and read the first few pages in a bunch of different books. Once you find one that grabs your interest, and believe me there will be more than one, then just purchase the book, go home and the rest will be history! Just like Asif said, you need to make it a habit. After a while it'll just become another, very beneficial, part of your day! ",
