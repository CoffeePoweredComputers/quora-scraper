            "answer_text": "I liked India: A History by John Keay. Let me say something more than just dropping the name of the book here. I am not a history buff. A thing I don\u2019t like in many history books is that historical characters and events are treated as if they are mythological. People are worshipped and made larger than life. And we forget that great though they were, they were people with maybe their dark sides, doubts, anxieties, mistakes and learning curves. We treat them as the Gods. And probably because of this societal pressure scholarly research oriented history is rare. I understand hero worship. Across nations we humans need our heroes and I am all for worshipping Shivaji, Ashok, William Wallace, Victoria and maybe a John Adams or two. But we forget that hero worship is just one aspect. Another aspect, for example, could be a fact based impartial look at the history and these heroes. I also don\u2019t like agenda/ propaganda based history books. A lot of them are historical fiction at best. What I liked about this book is that it takes a no non-sense approach. It gets rid of folklore and just describes the history. Of course, it borrows from other books and research. The best thing about it is that it is scholarly rather than emotional. Assembling this much information must have taken a lot of efforts. The author, while not making any bold \u2018offensive\u2019 claims, tries to put things in perspective. He does not try to evoke passions but simply makes observations and statements. Am I sure that it is the fact based description? No. But it seems to be. I did not finish the whole book- which is bulky and I stupidly did not buy the kindle edition. I did not complete the description of the Indian freedom struggle. Some other time, maybe. The book discusses the Indus Valley civilization, the writing period of Ramayana and Mahabharata, the Mahajanapadas and many things since. A history of a country as diverse as India is difficult to write. The author of the book understands that. And I think he has done a great job. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 I liked NCERT history text books which I read out of curiosity about the syllabus and contents. I was curious about what they had to say about Shivaji and the Peshwas. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 I had spent quite a lot of time looking for a good book on India\u2019s history before I picked John Keay\u2019s book. And I think it says a lot about the book and my confidence in the author that when I wanted to read about the Chinese history I picked his book on the subject. I did not finish it. Too many dowager princesses and Ming, Qing, Tang, Song, Shang dynasties to keep track of for a person like me who\u2019s totally new to that country\u2019s history. ",

            "answer_text": "If you wanna know the facts go with NCERT books.. nothing other than NCERT could provide you with basics in a simple and easy way that makes you love history. If you are a novel reader sharpen yourself with: 1 AUTOBIOGRAPHIES and BIOGRAPHIES of great leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and by writers like Kushwant Singh, Kamala Das which not only helps you in knowing about leadership, administration but also shows you the culture, lifestyle. 2 NOVELS that conveys messages on WOMEN\u2019S RIGHTS, STRUGGLES, COLONIAL RULE etc. Ex: ICE CANDYMAN, COOLIE. TRAIN TO PAKISTAN and so on\u2026 3 From the time of Aryan civilization till now, India has been rich in culture, tradition and religion. It is necessary to read epics and myths of various religion to understand each society and their practices. MAHABHARATA, RAMAYANA, BUDDHISM, BIBLE, PROPHET MOHAMED, anything and everything. After all, history has both truth and assumptions. Start reading everything in the perspectives of culture, tradition, their way of living and it becomes easy to understand our history. ",
