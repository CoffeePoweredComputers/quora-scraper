Most times we tend to read books along the same topic lineSearch via genre\u2026most times people read a certain genre like maybe \u201chistorical fiction\u201d you'd see alot you've already read on that genre with new books scattered around\u2026mainly because people tend to read books with more views votes and comments and so these books would be at the topIf you vote or comment on books\u2026 on the General feed page that recommend books for you\u2026you'll see something like \u201cbecause you voted on\u2026.\u201d Or \u201cif you loved\u2026.you will like\u2026\u201d Things like thatFinally this is not a recovery means but an advice\u2026..use your archive space\u2026archive books you'd love to read over and over again or books you can't wait for the update\u2026.maybe the writer is taking a sabbatical\u2026 for books like that if an update is eventually made then it would automatically be re added to your library. Another thing you can do is to create a reading list\u2026\u2026name it something like \u201cfinished and loved\u201d and add books to it\u2026.this way even if you remove these books from your personal library you can go on your profile and recover these books from your reading listsOk I think I've spoken too much. Try it..I hope it helps\u2026infact I'm sure it will. \u2665",

You can try these things if you want to find a certain book that you\u2019d read at a point of time. Very tedious thing but yes, you can check your activity and see if you can see something related to it.You can put on tags in the search box. I\u2019ve found many books this way and it\u2019s a lot better than the first one.I know, this was anything but helpful so sorry! :( ",
