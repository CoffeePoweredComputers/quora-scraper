            "answer_text": "There is a persistent rumour and myth that keeping a copy of Mahabharata at home brings the Mahabharata or the great war to the home. This is very typical blind faith and bogus information. I have four different versions of Mahabharata in my home. It started with C Rajagopalachari\u2019s abridged version in 1985, the Gita Press two volume abridged Hindi version in 1998, the Amar Chitra Katha 3 volume set in 2009, and finally the English translation of BORI CE by Bibek Debroy in 2017. I am yet to see the famous war at home. ",
