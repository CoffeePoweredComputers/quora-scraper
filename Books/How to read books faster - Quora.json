            "answer_text": "As someone who has been a kind of professional reader for much of his life, let me encourage you \u2014 unless you are reading something dull and dry, like an HR policy manual, in which case there are speed-reading techniques \u2014 not to think of reading fast as a virtue. Lots of people read quickly. Very few people read well, or retain what they read. Francis Bacon writes, memorably, in his essay \u201cOf Studies\u201d: Reade not to Contradict, and Confute; Nor to Beleeue and Take for granted; Nor to Finde Talke and Discourse; But to weigh and Consider. Some Bookes are to be Tasted, Others to be Swallowed, and Some Few to be Chewed and Digested: That is, some Bookes are to be read onely in Parts; Others to be read but not Curiously; And some Few to be read wholly, and with Diligence and Attention. Some Bookes also may be read by Deputy, and Extracts made of them by Others: But that would be, onely in the lesse important Arguments, and the Meaner Sort of Bookes: else distilled Bookes, are like Common distilled Waters, Flashy Things.[1] Figure out what kind of reading you\u2019re doing. If you\u2019ve got some flashy thing, \u201clike Common distilled Waters,\u201d skim along, sweep your eyes across the page. But first \u201cweigh and Consider.\u201d To do that, you must be deliberative: slow down, take the time to judge what you are consuming, and if need be, chew (slowly, so you don\u2019t choke) and digest. There are so many books in the \u201cchew and digest\u201d category that you could read them back to back 24/7 for ten lifetimes and never come close to making an end. There\u2019s nothing wrong with lowbrow entertainment, and some things are written to be consumed rapidly and with pleasure. But when you are on to something worthwhile, quality over quantity every time. Or so I have always urged my students. The world valorizes speed and efficiency, but wiser heads have always known better. Like Leonard Cohen, who \u201calways liked it slow.\u201d Footnotes[1] Bacon, \"Of Studies\"",

Also, speaking only for myself, I am not big on speed reading; I took a course in that as a child and I just never took to it. But I think we all process information a little differently so some techniques work better for some and different ones for others. Along the lines of the goal maybe being how to read books faster with adequate comprehension, I have my own trick for that (similar to the others here). I found that when I had to read a text book for something I wasn\u2019t all that interested in, I was able to pay better attention if I read out loud to myself. It could be very quietly, kind of under my breath but I needed to be forming the words with my mouth, not just thinking them in my head. It seems that this causes the work to be done in a different part of the brain; in this case I am more of an active participant maybe? In a related vein, I found that taking notes in meetings (or class, I suppose) would help my retention, even if I never referred to them. Toward the end of my working life, I got to where even I couldn\u2019t read my notes after the fact but I didn\u2019t really need to. One last thing that is probably self evident but maybe over looked. Practicing anything tends to make you faster, so the more you read, the better and faster you would get, I would think. Not a quick fix or technique, just not to be overlooked. I wish you well. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a variety of methods that can be used to increase your reading speed but at the end of the day it really boils down to read, read, read. Yes, you can use a recorded book and speed up the playback. You will get through it much faster but that is not reading that is listening. Following along while listening to a book will definitely help improve your speed because you are engaging two senses which will reinforce each other. Much of reading is not just digesting the words on the page but \u2018hearing' the author's \u2018voice'. There is a cadence, a rhythm in great prose and even more so in poetry that can be lost by trying to read at speed. When the need is to get through large volumes of written material and there is no availability of a recorded version then reading rapidly can be a very real need. One approach that I have had some exposure to is Evelyn Wood\u2019s book Reading Skills. Incidently she is the person that coined the expression speed reading. I personally have used some of her techniques and have, at one point, achieved measured speeds of 800 to 900 words per minute with 90% retention. I have been with people who read at a speed double that with similar retention. ",

            "answer_text": "While Michael Masiello gives the essential answer to this question\u2014reading too fast might be missing the point\u2014and I know from occasional experience that Habib Fanny\u2019s trick\u2014listening as well as reading\u2014is generally (if not perfectly, as the number of continuing-education programs I\u2019ve sat through, read the materials during the program, and then promptly forgotten attests) effective, I\u2019ll answer to add a trick that is often used in my profession and I tend to use myself, even in non-professional settings. Actually, I suppose my answer is \u201chow to read better faster;\u201d I am assuming that the reader is already familiar with the notion of skimming over text for keywords.  You have to read a lot to practise law. And in American law, a \u201cprimary source\u201d of the law is reported court decisions. Typically these are published in a case reporter, though a \u201csecondary source\u201d such as a hornbook or a treatise might be used that gives a \u201cdigest\u201d of the law. We generally don\u2019t sit down with a whole book (be it a case reporter, statute book, treatise, what-have-you) and just \u201cread\u201d it\u2014you would really be asking for it if you attempted to internalise the entire contents of such a volume. But say you are reading an opinion, especially one by the United States Supreme Court, which has over the past half-century or so tended toward more and more ponderous opinions, or a state-law appellate decision that treats a number of issues of questionable relevance to your issue. You don\u2019t have all day, because the brief you need to write is due at 4 p.m. So what I would do in such a situation is I will look for the holding of the case by skimming over it to find language that is consistent with the same and possibly relevant to the analogy I am wanting to make. There\u2019s rather a standard architecture to reported opinions that makes this relatively easy, but most literature, even works of fiction, have some sort of \u201ccrux\u201d of the story that is more important, and you can identify it by changes in tone. For an academic paper, start with the abstract or the conclusion. For a textbook or treatise, do this chapter by chapter. For a unified work of fiction, try near the end. Now just finding the most important bit does not actually cause you to \u201cunderstand\u201d what you just read part of, it is quite true (and sometimes lawyers make the mistake of failing to recognise this and quoting stuff out of context). You do still have to go back and read the rest of it. But having the idea in my head of where I want to be going in my reading will help my brain filter out irrelevant matter and I can get more out of the remainder of the work faster. Returning to the example of the court opinion, you look at the statement of the case with the notion of \u201cthis was how they got there\u201d and \u201cthe parties claimed this and that\u201d rather than trying to make sense of it on its face, which is typically a confusing jumble of dates and procedural steps taken by the parties prior to the appeal.

Train yourself to speed read to get through these tasks much faster. Reading faster does lead to less understanding, but with practice you can overcome some of this effect. 1.Stop talking to yourself,while you are reading. 2.Chew gum or hum while you read. This occupies muscles used to subvocalize. 3.If you move your lips as you read, hold a finger against them. 4.If your eyes jump several words or lines back, that's a sign that you may need to slow down. 5.While reading, your eyes move jerkily, stopping on some words and skipping others. You can only read while your eyes are stopped. If you learn to make fewer movements per line, you'll read a lot faster. But be careful. 6.Your brain normally decides where to move your eyes based on how long or familiar the next words look. You can read faster if you train your eyes to move to specific places on the page instead. 7.Take a pencil and underline the sentences and Mark the words you want. 8.Begin by only reading the chapter titles and any subheadings at the start of large sections. 9.If you still wish to learn more, brush your eyes rapidly across the page rather than reading normally. Now that you know the gist of the section, you can pick out key words that mark important areas. 10.Pictures and diagrams gives a lot of information without much effort for reading. 11.Examine pictures and diagrams. These often present a lot of information without much reading required. Take a minute or two to make sure you fully understand each diagram. 12.Timing Your Reading Speed Time your reading speed. Track your progress by timing yourself daily, or each time you try these exercises. Trying to beat your best speed can provide great motivation. ",

            "answer_text": "Remember the movie Good Will Hunting? Well, in that movie Matt Damon's character is reading and turning pages in a book about each 3 seconds. Does he have super human eyes that goes through every lines of text at mach10 speed? No. His brain is doing all the work for him. He is looking at a page and then the subconscious parts of his brain kicks in and proces and stores all the information. Although Will Hunting is a fictional character, speed reading is not. You can't train a photographic memory, but you can improve it and increase your reading skills. You can increase your reading speed by widening your focus while going through the text. This means not noticing or reading single letters at all but instead notice full words and clusters of words, thereby minimizing the number of fixations you have per line. Increasing your horizontal (and perhaps vertical) peripheral vision like this takes practice, but it shouldn't take too long before you notice improvement.  Aoccdrnig to rseerach at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a total mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. Amzanig huh? PS: Hwo'd yuo lkie to run tihs by yuor sepll ckehcer?  --- the above paragraph was snatched from someone else on the web and sadly I can't remember link--- EDIT: One way to speed up your reading would require you to gradually increase the number of words you process. So, instead of processing just one word you press yourself to process two words. Pretty fast you will be able to segment a line of text into three or two pieces. The end goal is to not consciously read the line but instead just notice the symbols within that line and leave it to your subconsciousness to process the information you just gathered... I went to a speed reading course some years ago. We started out wit eye warm up excercises and then moved on to the reading part. By constantly forcing me and the other participants to increase the speed by letting go of conscious data processing and letting the subconcious parts of the brain take over, we progressed the reading speed immensely throughout the day. The end goal was reading 100 pages in 10minutes. Everyone did this or was close, but I still felt that I missed out on too much information when doing it. I was reading quite fast before I entered the course, but I do switch into fast mode when skimming news, reports and the likes... O ",

            "answer_text": "Method One of Three:Improving Your Reading PaceEdit 1Practice a little every day. A lot of the skills necessary to improve your reading speed will not come naturally to you, so you will need to practice them everyday until they become second nature. Even 15 to 20 minutes of practice per day can make a huge difference to your overall pace.Improving your reading speed will take time, as you are learning how to read in a whole new way. Remember it took you years to learn how to read well as a child, so be patient with yourself this time round.A good way to track your progress is to time yourself on a regular basis. Set a timer and count how many words you read per minute. The more you practice, the higher this number should become.2Start with easier material. When you are training yourself to read faster, it's a good idea to start with easier material -- something that you enjoy or gain immediate value from -- until your abilities improve.Something like a travel book or memoir of famous figure, for example, might be a good option. Starting with something very dense -- like a physics textbook -- can throw you off and make the whole process seem more daunting.Once your skills improve and you learn what to look for in a text, you will find yourself much better equipped to deal with longer, more complex material. By this time, you will have developed a good grasp of which techniques work best for you and learn to recognize which parts of a text are most important.3Use your finger or an index card to set the pace. It's a good idea to use your finger, a pen or an index card to mark your place on the page as you read. And while using a pointer prevents you from losing your place and having to make regressions, this is not the only \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430, \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043e \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0445 \u0432 \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438 moving the pointer quickly across each line and down the page you can set the pace you wish to read at, as your eyes will be forced to keep up.Think of your your eyes like a magnet that's attracted to the pointer on the page -- wherever it goes, your eyes will follow!",

            "answer_text": "First off, there are two extremes, but the middle is something you have to find for yourself. If you type \u201chow to read faster\u201d in YouTube you will get various booktubers and motivational speakers who claim various things. It kind of depends on what you want, is it about enjoyment or the information you want to retain. Examples are of Merphy Napier (a booktuber. Here\u2019s her new video on reading more.) and Thomas Frank, both discuss speedreading (I have added the links to their videos). The most common methods are mostly these: Use a pencil or bookmark to help your eyes track what you are reading (though bookmark will only help to focus on a line vs a pencil tip which would focus on a word).Jump between a few points on a page. Do not focus on the words focus on the general information in the area and jump between the points go read faster (drawing a line or a few lines to know where to focus might help). For example, draw there equal spaced lines down the page. Now read the page but only looking on the points where the pencil line is when you read downwards (it's easier to show than explain but I'm sure you can find a video mentioned jumping between points on a page to minimize the saccadic movement.Minimize internal voice when reading. When people read they tend to read in their head but if you learn to turn that off you can increase your speed.For more effective reading: Know what you want out of that particular book. Are you enjoying it (for example Laini Taylor\u2019s writing creates a great atmosphere and Rick Riordan\u2019s writing is humorous). On the other hand, a history textbook is read for the information not the atmosphere. If you are writing an essay critiquing the historicity of Suetonius\u2019 The Lives of the Caesars, you do not have to hang on every word and certain useful sections are easy to spot (like the \u2018omens\u2019, or the physiognomy).Take notes. Engage with the texts. Merphy Napier mentioned how she took notes in her book and when she lends them to her friends, it allows her to engage with her friend in discourse even if she\u2019s not with them. Later it allows for more detailed discussions.Use sticky notes when necessary (and have a back-up plan on how to remove them if you so choose to sell the book later (might require an eraser or some rubbing, or baby oil or soap for the glossy cover). Maybe divide each section (helps for school).Kind of off-topic, but read the reviews. Know what is worth your time and what isn\u2019t. If you are looking for something academic, then read the reviews to pick the better books or read peer reviews if it\u2019s not that education. If it\u2019s a book for the soul then know what you like. When it comes to personal preference everyone has varying tastes. Some like brief descriptions (think Harry Potter or Blood of Elves by Sapkowski). Others enjoy more flowery books, think Laini Taylor. Others like the very, very saturated books like 20 000 leagues under the Sea or Lord of the Rings. Just keep in mind that just because a review is 2 stars does not mean you will not like it; read the 2 star and 4 star reviews and check to see what they actually say. Look for the tropes and stories you like not necessarily what the result was. This will help to read more effectively as it keeps you focused on what applies to you. There are some books out there that could be summarized in a short paragraph (probably a lot of self-help books can be placed in that category) which depending on your preference might make you chose to read a book summary over the book.Reviewing the book may help. I read a lot generally (though not as much as some people) and reviewing can help me recall my initial reading experience.",

I'm not being as obtuse as I seem - speed reading works for mindless web articles perhaps, but if you think you are going to speed read a great work of literature or philosophy for example - something calculated to improve yourself, I think you are misguided. So to me, reading slowly, methodically, actively - will ultimately allow you to actually read more books, as opposed to having merely skimmed many books... I'm an avid reader, and I totally understand where you are coming from, I tried speed reading, web apps etc.. all for the seductive idea of imbibing priceless wisdom at a fierce clip of speed. All to no avail. The realization has been, that like so much in life - anything worth having takes applied effort, and often much time - so it is with reading. I will give you two tips I have found to increase my reading speed, both come from speed reading ideas:  Use your finger / pencil as a pointer as you read, this helps stop regression (skipping back and re-reading words / lines)Begin looking at about the third word of each line, and stopping about three words from the end of each line. For example:\"The apple grew on the tree, it was red, and tasty.\" In that sentence you would look at the word \"grew\" and pick up \"The apple\" preceding it, with your peripheral vision. If you do this, you end up kind of chunking each line into two, and you go a lot faster. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Ajay -  A lot depends on what sort of book it is and what you want to get out of it (that is, what does 'effectively' mean for you and that book). But - speaking very very generally: Look at the preface, the intro, and the table of contents. See if these give you an overview of what you may expect from the book. Read it sitting up. Read the chapter titles (if it has any). Keep a pad of paper and pencil next to you so you can jot down any notes, or questions, or words you don't know - anything you want. Pause occasionally and think over what you just read and relate it to the rest of the book as you go along. If you find a point that you don't 'get', go back and re-read. Note that none of that is the same as 'quickly'. If you read something quickly, you may enjoy it a lot, but you probably won't pick up more than a few things that hang in your memory - so it probably won't be 'effective' to you (unless you are simply going for speed for the sake of speed).

            "answer_text": "Many slow readers sub vocalize, meaning they are reading aloud to themselves. Doing that means you slow yourself down to listen, as you form each word with your mouth. Some people even move their lips as they read, and read every word, one at a time. You can understand how that slows one's reading speed. I have always read fairly quickly, but I increased my speed by taking a course through Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics. I think the company now sells a home version of the course, but I took it in a class with other people trying to improve their speed. The course is simple, and begins by teaching students to turn pages quickly. The next skill taught is to drag one's finger at a reasonable speed down the page. Your eye is naturally drawn to a moving object. Surprisingly, you will find that you pick up words through peripheral vision as you follow your finger. Gradually you will improve your comprehension. The faster the rate at which you read, the better your comprehension. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Learn how to read without subvocalizing Welcome to the hardest and most crucial habit to tear down. When it comes to reading, we are often limited by the time that it takes for our subconscious mind to pronounce the words on the page. We don't say them out loud, but our mind speaks them unconsciously: This is known as \u201csubvocalizing.\u201d When we speak a word out loud, that takes a certain amount of time to pronounce. However, we do not actually need to pronounce words when we read. We can simply absorb them. Have you ever found yourself reading a sentence quietly, but your lips still mimicked what it would be like to say the word out loud? That is subvocalization. Unfortunately, the habit of speaking words as we read them is often so deeply embedded in our unconscious mind that the idea of breaking free of it seems impossible. A great trick is to pick out any word in this text and look at it for a moment in total silence. There will still be a slight bit of sub-vocalization, but by merely observing words without the desire to pronounce them, the new habit will begin to form on its own. A great tip for defeating this step is to start looking at and thinking about words without the need to pronounce them. This part might feel obscure or abstract in the beginning, and that's totally normal. All that you need to be concerned with is looking at words without the desire to hear the way they sound. After a little bit of practice, perhaps a few hundred words, you'll start to notice the difference between speaking the word unconsciously and simply allowing it to enter your mind. And once that's done, you've torn down the biggest barrier between yourself and speed reading. It might not be easy at first, but once you've beaten this part, everything else is cake by comparison. 2) Reading when your mind is fresh: It may seem an elementary idea, yet it works \u2013 your mind assimilates information much faster when it is fresh, like just after you wake up in the morning. Schedule your most important reading for the morning, and you\u2019ll find that you get it done at least 20% faster using this technique alone. This is because a rested intellect and improved concentration equal an improved reading speed. 3) Environment: The place where you read, and even the angle at which you place your book is crucially important. Your environment should be well-lit enough to keep you alert. Moreover, the lighting should be a warm yellow light that simulates sunlight, and not cold white light. This is important because the \u2018day\u2019 conditions of yellow light stimulate alertness in us. Your book or reading matter should be placed at an angle of forty-five degrees. 4. Use a Timer Speaking of \u2018record time\u2019, now is your chance to test yourself and work on how to increase your reading speed each time you read. Set a timer for one minute, reading normally as the time dwindles down. When the timer goes off, note how many pages you have read. The website, WordstoPages, will help you to figure out how many words you have read. Now, combine everything you have learned and repeat the test. Jot down that number, too.  Keep doing this, continuing to beat your previous count each time. Set a daily or weekly goal, and treat yourself when you reach it. Continue with this little game, and you\u2019ll be able to increase your reading speed in no time! 5. Set a Goal Holding yourself accountable will better ensure you stick with your reading and your timer tests. Give yourself a goal of a certain number of pages to read each day/week/etc., and stick to it. When you reach it, treat yourself. Incentive never hurt anyone! 6. Use a Marker Do you find your vision slipping and sliding through the page as you read? Not a problem. Simply place an index card below each line, and slip it down as you read. This will ensure you stay at reading one line at a time, rather than flitting your eyes about and taking nothing in. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Michael Masiello. If you want to understand something well, you have to take the time to digest it. Nevertheless, there are situations where you might want to digest large amounts of material more quickly than you can at your normal reading speed. In such a circumstance, I\u2019ve found something that might be useful to you: Comprehension is much higher with fast speech than with fast reading. Think about a normal conversation. Imagine that all of a sudden you moved to a place where people spoke 50% faster than what you\u2019ve heard all your life. It will seem odd to you that they are speaking so fast, but you will still understand them. Now, imagine that you are reading something at 150% your normal speed. How much will you retain? Not very much. From this insight, I have learned a tested the following: if you want to get through a book faster, listen to the audio version. Most audio platforms have a variable playback speed. You will be able to either slow down or speed up readers as you please. I\u2019ve found that, depending on the book, I can listen at 1.5X regular speed and still understand everything I need to. Sometimes, I need to rewind. Other times, I need to stop and think about whether I can intelligently explain what I\u2019ve just processed. But I get through the book much faster. You can get an even greater effect if you use a bisensory input to process the story. What do I mean by that? I mean if you rely on 2 rather than 1 sense. You can listen to an audiobook and read the text at the same time. I have done this in 2 scenarios: Dense, technical books like Capital in the 21st Century. I kind of overtaxed my brain by listening in English while reading in French. That was\u2026 fun. But you don\u2019t have to do it that way.Books you\u2019re having a hard time reading and where you want to faster barge to tow you along. I did this with The Goldfinch and The Sun Also Rises.Here\u2019s something remarkable. You can understand really, really fast speech if you\u2019re reading the material simultaneously. And you retain it too! I could listen at 2 or sometimes even 2.5 times regular speed and still follow the text on my tablet. It was the fastest reading I\u2019ve ever done. The reason I needed to read so fast is because I was in med school and taking a lit class on the side. And we had a ton of reading to get through. It was really helpful. And it\u2019s one of my fondest memories because it was an experience I shared with a woman I loved very deeply. In any case, that\u2019s my trick. Read and listen at the same time. Increase the listening speed. It will make you read the text faster without losing comprehension. Good luck! ",

Non-Fiction Most non-fiction books are well-structured. So here\u2019s an idea - Read the IntroductionRead the forwardRead the indexRead the first paragraph and last paragraph of each chapterStart reading each chapter by reading the first 1 or 2 sentences of each chapter. Then start reading the chapter from beginning to endIf you find a chapter that doesn\u2019t resonate, then skip it.The above works will for non-memoirs and biographies. But still do 1 to 4 above for memoirs and bios. Will your speed increase a lot? Give it time. Three months from now, you\u2019ll notice a difference. Finally, on non-fiction, use your finger to guide you in the book or electronic device. That helps. ",

You don\u2019t have to think about completing the book in a couple of days. Start loving the book. The contents, the character and the things which are happening in the book. Start imagining it like a movie or anything related to that specific book. Read daily, share the things which you love about the book to your friends. It maybe a specific line or a mathematical question, anything. The time only flies faster, when we love something. Imagine that kind of connection with the book. Trust me, it will make you happy. Don\u2019t aim to complete the book, aim to learn all the heck out of it, be enlightened or informed as much as possible from the book. And when you will look back at yourself, you will realize a change within you. This is how we grow, we make an impact in the lives of us and gradually in the lives of people. That\u2019s it.

            "answer_text": "Alternate between different reading speeds, and practice all of these. The most important speed is your own natural comprehension speed, which will probably be between three and six words per second, or about 200\u2013400 wpm. The only thing that you can do here is simply practice, and avoid subvocalizing if you do so. The next thing to practice is scanning. You can do it right here on Quora. Just look at an answer fragment for a second or two before deciding whether to scroll down or click \u201cmore\u2026.\u201d You can use this strategy on pages of textbooks too, looking for headings and captions to get a feel for the book. The hardest thing to do is to read at beyond your speed of comfort and still have significant retention. Again, only practice will help. But with the two tools you already have, take a glance at each paragraph, and then decide whether it is relevant to you or not, and then if it is if you want to read it slowly and deeply, or normally, or to go a bit faster than you would otherwise be comfortable with. Above all, remember that authors are trying to communicate as best they can, and that opening and closing paragraphs of essays, articles, and chapters are more likely to be critical than any other random paragraph. As many of the other answers here suggest: more haste, less speed. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the skill of reading faster than you are comfortable isn\u2019t valuable, nor that the tips to get you from say 200 wpm to 300 wpm aren\u2019t valuable. Just read a lot, and occasionally try to up your tempo by a few percent, perhaps as much as a factor of 1.1 - so if you are currently reading at 200 wpm, give yourself five minutes to read something 1100 words long. Perhaps obviously, read books almost every day, for at least an hour on average. If you haven\u2019t been a big reader before, it may take years to get to what you can do, but perhaps only months. Finally, never be afraid of having to reread. It isn\u2019t as if everything you read at even a slow speed will be permanently committed to memory. And with fiction, you can always reread a good scene right away, should you wish. ",

The following structure of each book gave me the pre-knowledge of the book for better memory recall. Read about the author first. Read the references second. Read the list of Chapters third. Read the last chapter fourth. Read the first chapter fifth. Read the index sixth. Read the 2nd through the last chapters next. Read the acknowledgements last. ",

Don\u2019t be discouraged that you aren\u2019t great at first. You\u2019ll get better.

If you are reading some relatively mundane mystery novel or something - and have no real need to remember it later - then you can read pretty quickly. For a lot of poetry, reading shouldn\u2019t be in terms of \u201cwords per minute\u201d or \u201cpages per hour\u201d but in terms of \u201cpoems per day\u201d. I think that, in some respects, you can\u2019t fully appreciate some poems until you\u2019ve read them multiple times, years apart. And you might even have them memorized. For philosophy, slow reading is essential. ",

There was this one thing I was told when I was taking special Creative Writing classes, and I think it was the one thing that my mind throws at me each time I find a book kind of draggy, uninteresting or just plain unreadable. \u201cDon\u2019t ever feel obligated to finish a book once you start reading it.\u201d It was Simon Van Booy who said it, as far as I remember. And it was the best advice anyone\u2019s ever given about reading. Don\u2019t feel like you have to finish a book once you\u2019re 50 or even a 100 pages in. Only read stuff that gets you hooked or inspires you to go further. When you find a book boring, it doesn't necessarily (most often) mean that the book is bad. It\u2019s mostly not bad at all. It\u2019s just not your thing, to explain it lightly. Don\u2019t feel bad about leaving, in the middle, not reading or giving up on books. It\u2019s completely fine. But if you have to finish it, just skim though. It works just fine. ",

If you have an Android phone - Google news play-stand / daily-hunt I don\u2019t have an idea about the news apps for Apple. Hence not mentioning it. Take the help of these apps as there is a lot of content and you can learn a lot of things which happen in the world. A win-win. Also, if possible try reading a book/novel/autobiography etc and see if it interests you! ",

This happened to me with one book, The Idiot. I am a fairly fast reader. I can finish a 200 page novel in a day. But it took me 1 whole year to finish this book. This is actually a well sought after book but the genre was very boring for me. Reading this book was like a fact finding exercise to me. I tried to find the reasons people could like the book. I mean after a time I started getting curious about what could appeal to others. I still could not read a lot in one sitting but it motivated me to complete the book. . . . Or maybe there is a book that you have to compulsorily read for some specific reason either for school or work? If thats the case, set short targets maybe chapters or events. Complete one target in each sitting. That way you wont be bored. ",

Of course reading prowess really depends on how many words you can cover per minute, but for a little turbo boost here are some suggestions. If they are educational they could be a bit lacklustre in the imagination department, but I pretend (mentally) that I am right beside the author as he is penning his words of knowledge, perhaps making suggestions here and there that he just doesn't listen to.  With narratives, however, its like making a movie. Let everything come alive in your mind and you'll realize that you are gobbling up the pages because the movie just shouldn't end. Keep in mind though that there are books with topics that will never reach out to you and those will be a challenge. ",

But if you\u2019re trying quickly to get the essence of a non-fiction book, there are a few tricks. If I just want to understand a little about what the author is trying to say, but I don\u2019t necessarily want to read the whole book, I skim the introduction to see what clues I can pick up. I look at the table of contents to find out what topics are covered. Finally, I flip to the very last page and read the last couple of paragraphs (NEVER do this with fiction!) where the author has usually summed up his or her main points. ",

Or better, try to find out what is interesting in a book before picking it up, for there must be a purpose whatever it may be for anything you do in your life. This might help you in changing your perspective about the same. And for the part where you want to read faster, that needs practice. You cannot expect yourself to finish your very first novel or novella in an hour. But with time, the amount of words you can digest in a go that too in a sensible manner will increase. So, to increase the reading speed you need to read lots of books. Again, i would like to mention, do not pick up a book which is boring unless and until you have to. Why waste the time? ",

Initially read something which makes you interest for 30 mins per day.Do the above for 21 days then you will be used to reading habit.Take a scribble pad or notepad in a computer and note down the meanings of frequently appearing words with an example.Whenever you start reading a book just skim over those words.(This boosts your pace)You are reading a book to learn something from it. So make note of stupendous points.(This makes you to focus on reading)Later ,choose a book of your own interest.Read the book and parallely make a note of useful points.Take 5 minutes break for every 30 minutes and go ahead.Take 10 mins break after every 90 minutes and go ahead.While reading the book,don\u2019t just read it,think about the situation and relate it with your past experience.( if you have any.)Don\u2019t read loudly.Read with your soul and heart.And finally,number of books you read is not important,how much knowledge you can with stand with you is more important.Hope this is useful.

But before you decide not to read the book give it some time, read it little further without thinking about boring part of the book. Try getting more involved in it. Try picturing the scenes and if possible try relating those. You will start developing more interest in it. At start try avoiding long breaks while reading the book. It may break your thought sequence, running in your head parallel to the story. Try it and let me know how it goes. Happy Reading \u2026 ",

But here I would like to tell you that, if you read fast, you don't enjoy and sometimes you don't get the true taste of words and thoughts. Its better to read them when you are completely free and reading it for enjoyment. If you don't want to follow this, you have many options with you. You can go for summary reading, if you really are in haste. You can comprehend the content and try to grasp the meaning according to your ability. Sometimes, I have not tried this, as I love reading the book when I'm free and happy. \u201c Practice makes human being perfect.\u201d The other thing is that, if you read fast, you won't be able to digest the content.

All the while, maintain a selection of books that cover subjects you enjoy. Without that added incentive, it is very hard, indeed, to keep focused. Your reading will become smoother, which will make reading the next book faster. Smooth is fast. Focus on fluency of reading, rather than complexity , and your speed will increase more quickly.
