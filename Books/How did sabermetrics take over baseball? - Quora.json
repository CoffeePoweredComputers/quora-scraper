            "answer_text": "Baseball - more than any other sport - has always been a game where statistics matter and people openly discuss them so it makes sense that when more statistics become available they get added to the discussion. Bill James is generally considered the father of advanced metrics but other statisticians who were also baseball fans built upon his work. The Internet gave fans access to their work and and spread the \u2018religion\u2019 of statistics quickly. My dad used to say there\u2019s no one who believe in something as strongly as one recently converted to it. Statistics zealots took off on their at a wild pace while others worked methodically to make sure their methodology was correct. The metrics grew and matured through hard work and constant reexamination. Maturity brought greater accuracy and began to be picked up and used by major league teams. Billy Beane\u2019s book - Moneyball - became a hit movie in spite of the fact that it took a small part of the team\u2019s success and blew it up to be the driving force in Oakland\u2019s run. Baseball teams are copycats. When they see something work they will try to emulate it. The path wasn\u2019t easy as a lot of old guard baseball executives, managers coaches and players resisted. There wasn\u2019t a single turning point when suddenly everyone jumped on board. Rather there was a slow realization that advanced metrics added to the the evaluation of scouts helped teams make better decision about drafts, trades and signing players. Owners began to hire young executives to run their teams front offices, executives with a knowledge if the game as well as the value of the metrics. Advanced metrics aren\u2019t as some people believed when they first became a fad, an answer to everything. Over time the \u201call numbers\u201d people realized that metrics are simply an added tool in the decision makers toolbox. That\u2019s how we got to where we are today. Where we go from here is the question. ",
