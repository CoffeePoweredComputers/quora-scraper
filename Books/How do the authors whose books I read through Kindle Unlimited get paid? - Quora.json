            "answer_text": "Authors get paid from a large pool of money. Each month, Amazon decides how much money goes into the pool and divides it by the total number of pages read that month across all books. It\u2019s typically around $0.005/page, sometimes more, sometimes less. You don\u2019t need to read each and every page to satisfy book completion. At the moment, they don\u2019t record which specific pages have been read (that would be a huge amount of data to keep track of!). Instead, they record the last page you read. So, if you skip to the end, the author will be credited for every page in between. Authors are only paid once for a borrowed book. No matter how many times you read the same book, the author only gets paid once. ",

Authors aren\u2019t very happy with the system since there have been a number of attempts to scam the system and get high \u2018page reads\u2019. Some people (who don\u2019t deserve the title author) put links at the front of their very large and boring book to a page at the back of their book. Amazon\u2019r early software took that as a whole book read.To counter that Amazon introduced \u2018page flip\u2019. That upset authors even more because some people are reading the entire book in that mode and Amazon counts that as a single page read. So if you feel the author deserves to be paid\u2014don\u2019t read in \u2018page flip\u2019 mode. ",
