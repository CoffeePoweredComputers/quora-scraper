            "answer_text": "Google is your friend. Newman Springs Publishing is what is called a Vanity publisher. They make their money by charging you to publish the book. They attract people by their low royalty take of 6%, which makes them seem really good when you compare to Amazon\u2019s 30%. But what they don\u2019t say is this 6% will be in addition to Amazon or any other platform\u2019s take. So put the book on Amazon yourself, and you get 70% royalty. When they put your book on Amazon, you get 64%. Here\u2019s why you google a question like this. People have asked what the cost of publishing with them is multiple times, and each time the answer is this: The fee varies based upon the word count of the book, whether illustrations are needed and things of that nature. The average price is around $3300 with only an initial deposit of $400 and installment payments thereafter.This makes them a VANITY publisher. Publishers do NOT charge you a fee to publish a book, they PAY you an advance to publish the book. Vanity publishers make their money from their up front fees. So are they a good place for publishing a book? Ask yourself this: Can you do it yourself? If you answer no, and don\u2019t be too hasty about that as everyone can do it themselves on Amazon and like sites, then maybe they are for you. Do you just want a few hard copies for friends and family? If yes, then maybe they are right for you. But if you are serious about selling your book, do you know how long it will take to earn back that $3300? Obviously from the question, you don\u2019t. The average book will land on the Amazon charts in the 50,000 range, given a few sales on day 1. If it doesn\u2019t continue to get those sales, it will drop down to the millions very quickly. Now, a book well launched with 100 sales on day 1, and a continuing lesser amount for the next few weeks, can earn $1500 in the first month. In which case, it will take 3 months to earn out that publishing fee. BUT, most books are not launched effectively, and without a good launch, they never make back $3300 in royalties. A lot of authors who write 3 or 4 books a year, don\u2019t make $3000 in royalties in a year. Lots of authors with 50 books, don\u2019t make $3000 in a year. So my take on your question, with 30 seconds worth of google, and the assumption you\u2019re not just after a dozen copies of a paperback for family and friends, is a resounding NO. Even if you are after a dozen paperbacks, you can get these done through print on demand yourself. The only difficult thing is the spine calculation, and some sites help with that. Anyone serious about publishing, avoids Vanity publishers. They are there to make money off you. Once they have it, they rarely deliver on promises. ",

            "answer_text": "No - they are vanity publishers and they are charging you a fortune for things you can do for yourself, or find others to do for cheaper. If you have a strong desire to consider yourself a \u201cpublished\u201d author, then do what other published authors do, and shop around for an agent, get your book submitted to proper publishers and instead of draining your bank account, you may get a nice advance, and at least won\u2019t have to pay for editing, covers, promotions and formatting. If you just want to get your book out, you can create an ebook and paperback version of it with a free account on Amazon kindle. Find a reasonably priced editor from a local university, hop on a site like Fiverr to get your cover made, make sure your Word document has default margin sizes for the kindle version and upload that, and use the free template on Amazon to create your paperback book. This way, if you just want paperback copies to pass out to friends and family, you only pay the \u201cauthor copy\u201d price for them on Amazon and they will ship your books to you. Also, no minimum copies to buy. Honestly, please don\u2019t waste your money on vanity publishers. You won\u2019t be happy with the results, and your bank balance will suffer as a result. Self-publishing is not that difficult once you understand what is needed, so maybe Google advice about that instead. Good luck and thank you for the A2A. ",
