            "answer_text": "There is no book by Freud called \u201cStudy about dreams\u201d - there is The Interpretation of Dreams but is rarely read cover to cover, and is much more used as a reference or consultation handbook, as it is in fact a sort of \u201cGeneral Grammar of the Unconscious\u201d. Also Freud never wrote an \u201cAutobiography\u201d, he wrote an \u201cAutobiographic Study\u201d together with \u201cHistory of the Psychoanalytic Movement\u201d in the early 1920s. Good you are reading Freud and enjoying! - it is a clear sign you are a non-idiot: the next natural step is to start your psychoanalytic treatment with a psychoanalyst (and in the meantime produce a neurotic suffering so a clinical demand may appear).
