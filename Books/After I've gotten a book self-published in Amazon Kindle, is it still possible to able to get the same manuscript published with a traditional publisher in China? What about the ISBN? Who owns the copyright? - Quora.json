            "answer_text": "YOU own the copyright. Amazon just sells the book for you. EBooks on Amazon don\u2019t get an ISBN. EBooks don\u2019t need one. If you sign with a publisher anywhere, you will need to pay attention to what their contacts says about other rights. They may require you to take down your Amazon version so they can put their version up instead. When you sign with a publisher, it should NEVER involve you giving them the copyright to the book. They get RIGHTS to produce and sell it. You still OWN it YOURSELF. If someone wants the copyright, they need to pay you big money for it. And that has nothing to do with sales. China works differently for publishing than the rest of the world, so make sure you understand what they are offering and the legalese of it. BEFORE you sign anything. ",
