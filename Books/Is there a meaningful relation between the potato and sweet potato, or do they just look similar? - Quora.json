            "answer_text": "They are unrelated plants, which both happen to create a tuberous root which look similar. So do yams, by the way, which happen to be ANOTHER totally unrelated plant that happens to create a similar tuberous root. For the sake of it - LOTS of plants make tuberous roots. Oxalis does. Iris have a rhyzome which isn\u2019t amazingly different. Tuberous roots - the wild smilax (cat claw vines) in the woods around here (and in my backyard) make some AMAZING large tuberous roots. It\u2019s a common type of root development. We eat roots. We eat beets, turnips, onions, potatoes, yams and sweet potatoes (all different plants) and others. Plants store starch in those tubers to keep themselves going longer when conditions aren\u2019t good - such things aren\u2019t rare. Sometime when you have a minute, look up peanuts. Plant adaptations are pretty cool. ",
