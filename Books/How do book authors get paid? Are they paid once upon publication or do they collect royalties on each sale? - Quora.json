            "answer_text": "At the very simplest, every author is paid a portion of the sale of each copy of their book(s). This portion is called a royalty. It starts getting interesting from here\u2026 Below are very basic explanations. But they should give you a foundation of understanding on the subject. In traditional publishing contracts, there are a lot of variations\u2014especially if your books turn out to be particularly popular. It is very important to keep in mind that as a writer, you are self-employed. You are not an employee of the publisher who takes you on. You are an independent contractor who creates product that the publisher will then distribute. Traditionally Published Authors Initially you are paid an Advance. As the name implies, an advance is an advance royalty payment ahead of sales of your book. The publisher knows you have to put food on the table, make bill payments, buy clothes, etc., while you work on your second book. So they give you a check based on their estimate of how many copies they figure your book will sell at the least. Most publishers are pretty good at estimating this. Then your book is released. Because you were already paid an advance on the first X,000 copies to be sold, you won\u2019t receive any royalty payments until your book sells copy X,001. If your book proves to be popular and it actually reaches that point, it will have earned out. This means it sold enough copies to generate enough returns that it covered the advance royalty they paid you at the beginning. Now you start receiving royalty payments. Most authors expect to be paid quarterly by their publishers. (Again, this schedule depends on your contract with the publisher.) So, every quarter, you will receive a check for all the royalties your book earned during the previous quarter. What you are paid depends on the contract and the agreed rate with the publisher. A really good rate is 15% of the net profit. Keep in mind, that is not 15% of the list price of the book, it is 15% of the net profit from the wholesale price. That means you are getting roughly 3% of the list price of the book. Again, it depends on what is in the contract. If you don\u2019t understand those numbers, I strongly suggest you do some studying about how retail sales work and the book sales industry. Independent Authors (Self-published) YOU are the publisher on top of being the author. Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, and others are NOT your publisher. They are retailers. Do not allow yourself to be confused! Depending on the terms the retailer offers, your royalty is a portion of the list price you set. The most common format that books are sold by independent authors is the ebook. For ebooks, most often this royalty share is 70%. (Some retailers charge \u201cdelivery fees\u201d that drop this to 68%. Some only charge 65% share. Pay attention to their terms before you jump in.) So, if you set your ebook to be sold at $4.99 and your share is 70%, then your royalty for each copy sold will be $3.49. Most retailers pay out royalties 60 days from the close of the sales month. This means if you sold 1,000 copies in January, then you will receive a check for the sales proceeds on April 1st. If you choose to make your book available in print through Print On Demand (POD) services, your share of the sales proceeds will be much smaller than 70% because the retailer is assuming the costs of paper, ink, energy, and maintenance on the machine that does the printing towards printing your book. Whatever is left over is the net profit, and you will get a share of that. WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! Before you get too excited looking at 70% vs. 3% of the list price, self-publishing vs. traditional publishing, keep in mind that as an independent author, you are the publisher!!!! This means that you have to front all the costs of producing your manuscript by paying for editing, cover art, advertising, and any other costs that come up related to production of a manuscript and distribution of your book. Plus, you will in no way sell as many copies as an independent as will a publishing company. You just don\u2019t have all the contacts and channels that a trade publisher has. You can build up these contacts and networks over time, especially if you turn out to be a popular author. But a publisher has these already in place. It will take you years to reach that point. Self-publishing is a marathon, not a sprint. If you don\u2019t have the wherewithal to stick it out for several years of work before seeing meaningful returns, it is best you take the easier route and find a publisher to take you on. ",

            "answer_text": "Money! Every writer's dream! I sold my novel A Kill in the Morning to a major publisher, Transworld for a rumoured million dollars.[1] This is how it happened and how I got paid.  The Process A commissioning editor at the publishers was interested in my book.He took a proposal to buy the book to the acquisitions committee.The acquisitions committee agreed to buy the rights to the book.The editor offered me an advance in return for rights to the book.I agreed in principle to sell the rights.The editor then negotiated the details of the contract with my agent.Most of the contract terms were standard boilerplate.The negotiation concerned the schedule.When my agent and the editor agreed the contract, the publishers and I signed it.I got my signing advance. When the book is published I will get a further advance called a publication advance.As the book sells, a percentage of the price is notionally assigned to me. If that money adds up to more than the advance then the book \u2018earns out\u2019 and I start getting royalties.All the italicised terms are explained in my Guide to Literary Contracts, but here are the most relevant ones: Rights When you write a book, the copyright is automatically yours \u2013 you own it and no one else can legally copy or publish it. What the publisher buys off you when you sign a contract is the right to publish the book, usually in specific countries, called territories. Advance This is the money the publisher pays up front for the right to publish the book. It is often split into a signing advance, paid when the contract is completed, and a publishing advance, paid when the book goes on sale. Sometimes there are other advances based on targets the publisher sets, like delivering the manuscript, or winning a prize. Subsidiary Rights These are the rights that are bought by the publisher and then sold on. For example, the right to produce: A serialisation of your novel in a newspaper or magazine.A Book Club edition.An audio book based on your novel.A translation of your novel into a foreign language.An edition of your novel specific to a territory, like a US Edition.When the publisher sells the subsidiary rights it generates more money for everyone, not just the publishers. The percentages used to split the money are contained in the schedule and negotiated between the agent and editor. The split percentages vary, but are often in the 50:50 or 60:40 range. Royalties Every copy of the book sold earns the author a small percentage of the price (typically around 10% of the price, although it can vary). If the book is sold at a discount then the percentage can drop. This is defined as price received, rather than the official published price. Earning Out Initially, the money the author earns in royalties is set against the money the author has already received as an advance. If at some point the amount earned in royalties exceeds the amount paid as an advance then the author starts to get paid more. This is called earning out. Most books don\u2019t earn out. NB: The author does not have to pay the advance back if the book fails to earn out. Actually getting paidThe publisher pays the various advances and royalties in the contract to your agent. The agent takes their cut (typically 10-15%) and transfers the remaining money to you. Here's what that glorious moment looks like:  Yay! Free Money! More DetailsI go through the whole process of selling a book and getting a contract in my Guide to Literary Contracts, which includes some of the weirder clauses you need to know about, like the Reversion Clause.  I know that's the rumour, because I started it. It was a lot less really. The figures in the picture aren't real either :-)",
