            "answer_text": "I can find only three. Each has claimed copyright or trademark infringement based on South Park\u2019s having allegedly misappropriated the plaintiff\u2019s protected content. South Park has won all three \u2014 two were dismissed by the court, and the third was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff. (In general, parodies are exempt from infringement claims under the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine.) Oh Mickey, what a pity, Toni Basil won't take the stand 'South Park' Wins Lawsuit Over 'What What (In the Butt)' Parody (Exclusive) Docket for WARDLAW v. SOUTH PARK STUDIOS, 2:12-cv-05617 - CourtListener.com Why have there been (so far as I can tell) no lawsuits by celebrities upset over having been disparagingly parodied by South Park? First, under settled U.S. Supreme Court precedent, such celebrities have no legal claim. In Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988), the Court held that the First Amendment immunizes against claims for damages any caricature, parody, or satire of a public figure that a reasonable person would not have interpreted as factual. Both the outrageousness of South Park\u2019s depictions in particular, and its well-known reputation as a non-factual purveyor of the ridiculous in general, make it nigh-impossible that an offended celebrity could win under that test. This, however, only explains why lawsuits have not been filed in the United States. South Park is distributed in many other countries, none of which (including the United Kingdom) has free speech restrictions against defamation suits as stringent as the United States. Another, more globally-applicable reason for the dearth of celebrity lawsuits may be that most public relations professionals (and the celebrities and institutions they advise) understand that, however much they may curse South Park in private, there is no PR upside in coming off as a bad sport. Of all the non-criminal acts a celebrity may commit likely to damage a career, being perceived as taking oneself too seriously ranks at or near the top. (See, e.g., Anne Hathaway). The Mormon Church (not exactly known for self-deprecating wit) set the gold standard for those in South Park\u2019s crosshairs in its response to the South Park creators\u2019 uproariously blasphemous The Book of Mormon. Rather than condemn, protest, or boycott the show, the Church bought ads in the show\u2019s playbills with epigrams such as \u201cThe book is always better\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the play, now read the book.\u201d How the LDS Church's response to 'The Book of Mormon' musical is actually working In closing, I\u2019ll share a description of one of South Park\u2019s particularly tasteless skits I just now came across. I\u2019m ashamed of myself for finding this funny, but I just can\u2019t help it. \u201cLess than two months after beloved crocodile wrangler Steve Irwin died in 2006, South Park included him in the episode \u201cHell on Earth 2006.\u201d Not only did viewers see Steve Irwin in hell, but he still had a sting ray sticking out of his chest. Even Satan admitted that it was too soon for the joke, but that didn\u2019t stop it from happening.\u201d All The Times Celebrities Had A Beef With \u2018South Park\u2019 ",

According to TMZ: \"Creators of South Park Matt Stone and Trey Parker have been sued by a guy claiming to have created a show called \"The Lollipop Forest\" years ago - only to have the South Park guys rip off one of his characters for their 3 part show \"Imaginationland\" that aired back in 2007. The character in question is the Lollipop King, which according to the suit, is a ripoff of a character called 'Big Bad Lollipop' from said Lollipop Forest.  The creator of Lollipop Forest said his show was meant to be a wholesome family show, and its value was diminished when his character was subjected to unwholesome language and sexual innuendo.\"   Honestly, what character on South Park HASN'T been subjected to either of those?  Repeatedly??  You can decide for yourself: South Park's Lollipop King:  Lollipop Forest's \"Big Bad Lollipop\":  Written 11 Sep ",
