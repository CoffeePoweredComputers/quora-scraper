            "answer_text": "In 1970 (which I chose because it\u2019s in the middle of your chosen era, the \u201c1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s\u201d), the average annual household income in the U.S. was $9,870. In 2020 dollars, that\u2019s about $66,000. EDIT: I had old data when I first published this answer. According to the U.S. census bureau, the average household income in the U.S. for 2019 was $68,700. So the average 1970 income, adjusted for inflation, was roughly $2,000 less than the average annual household income in the U.S. today. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me google that for you: $6,900 According to estimates released today by the Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce, the average (median) income of families in 1965 was $6,900. Now let\u2019s run that through an inflation calculator: $57,013. And let\u2019s compare that to what the actual median family income is in 2020: $68,400. So households today are quite a bit better off than they were in 1965. This is obvious in the things we have today that most people did not have in 1965\u20132 tvs. color, of course, bigger fridges full of more food, two cars, larger houses, etc. (also fewer children, on average). However, there\u2019s a better chance that it takes 2 people working today to earn that income while in 1965, it was more likely to be a single wage-earner. ",
