            "answer_text": "Because people don\u2019t agree on what constitutes a bad book. In a technical sense, The Da Vinci Code was a bad book; it sold like crazy anyway. Lots of people thought it was badly written and downright stupid, but hundreds of thousands of other readers disagreed. Same with Twilight, and various other bestsellers. When a book is published by a traditional publisher, it doesn\u2019t mean anyone at the publishing house thought it was great literature; it means an editor (and usually someone higher up, as well; most acquiring editors don\u2019t have carte blanche to buy anything they want) thought it would make money. (Almost always; see below for exceptions.) The fact that bad books have sometimes become bestsellers means that being well written isn\u2019t essential, and what\u2019s considered interesting will vary with readers\u2019 tastes. Acquiring editors guess wrong a lot. If they guess wrong too often, they get fired. If they make a couple of spectacular right guesses, though, that can make so much money for the company that they\u2019re pretty much set for life there. I\u2019ve decided I shouldn\u2019t name names on this one, but an editor I knew many years ago asked my opinion of a book he\u2019d bought that had famously been rejected by more than twenty other editors before he bought it. It then became a runaway bestseller. After I hesitated and he insisted I be honest, I said I thought it was crap. He happily agreed, and smilingly told me that he knew it was a terrible novel, but he also knew it would exactly fit a particular under-served market niche and sell like crazy. He was right. He explained in detail why this lousy book had been so successful, and I could follow his reasoning, but he and I both still thought it was crap. So lots of bad books get published because someone thought they would make money. Sometimes those people are right and the book becomes a bestseller, and sometimes they\u2019re horribly wrong and the book only sells a dozen copies. It\u2019s a chance they take. Okay, there are some exceptions to the \u201cwill make money\u201d rule. A publisher will sometimes buy a book knowing it won\u2019t make money if it serves some other important purpose, such as generating prestige for the company, or keeping a valuable author happy when he\u2019s done something different that didn\u2019t work \u2014 for example, if J.K. Rowling were to write an absolutely boring history of tea cozies under another name, her publishers would probably be willing to take a loss on publishing it just to stay on her good side. (Not that I think Rowling would do that.) As for generating prestige, some books get great reviews and impress the hell out of critics and win awards, but don\u2019t sell, and everyone knows going in that they probably won\u2019t sell, but they get published anyway because then the publisher can point to them and say, \u201cLook at these critically-praised, award-winning books we published!\u201d Which means the publisher is taken more seriously by critics, and by people looking for a publisher. There may be other reasons, as well. But at least 90% of the time, the book got published because someone thought it would make money. ",

            "answer_text": "I think, if I may, you might be making an invalid assumption in this question, in that your premise is that books are either bad or good, interesting or boring, well-written or poorly-written. I think the truth is that a single book may be bad, good, interesting, boring, well- or poorly-written all at once, and depending on who is reading it. Agatha Christie and John Dickson Carr wrote mysteries with brilliant plots but often two-dimensional characters and lifeless prose, for example. We might say the same for Isaac Asimov, in the SF genre. Dan Brown and EL James are regularly pilloried as a terrible writers, but their books must have some kind of quality, some kind of enjoyment to be had, or people wouldn\u2019t keep buying them. (If Fifty Shades of Grey had been a straightforwardly bad book, surely we\u2019d have seen a massive drop-off in sales for Fifty Shades Darker? But not really.) The way publishing works, in fact, is that you need a wide variety of books. Not everyone likes the same sort of thing, and not everyone values the same qualities in books. It\u2019s like running a hedge fund, I suppose, except not nearly as lucrative; you need a wide portfolio that will cover your losses if some bet doesn\u2019t work out. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that bad books don\u2019t exist and don\u2019t get published. Of course they do. But during the process of publication people weren\u2019t thinking, \u2018this is a terrible book that will do badly\u2019; they were thinking \u2018this book has an audience who will enjoy it, and I\u2019m publishing for them\u2019.
