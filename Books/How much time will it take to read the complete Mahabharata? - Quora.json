I have not touched the spiritual or philosophical aspect! But, YES, Start to read with C Rajahopalachari\u2019s Book, good to start with covers most of the main storyThen preferably KMGThen BORI\u2019s translated work -by Bibek Debroy. Yes, forgot to mention - READ IT do not SEE it. This is my personal view ",

Unless one learns to Live fully, one would read Mbh selectively and feel repulsion to some other parts. Mbh is thus a test whether you have power of acceptance to all different colours of life. ",
