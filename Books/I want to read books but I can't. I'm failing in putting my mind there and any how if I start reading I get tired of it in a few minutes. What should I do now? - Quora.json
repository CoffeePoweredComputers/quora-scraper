            "answer_text": "Here are some tips: Choose a simple book. This plays very important role if you have just started to read. Don't choose books with so much complexity. Choose a book which is very easy to read and at the same time interesting. You can choose books from the author like Sudha murthy. My first book was 'The day I stopped drinking milk'. It is a collection of stories from Sudha murthy.   Less number of pages. It is really important to note that nobody can read book of 1000 pages in the beginning itself. Choose a book with less than 150 pages. You will get interest to complete book. Don't try to read the entire book at once. It is difficult even for an avid reader to complete a book at once. So divide the entire book into few parts based on number of pages or based on chapters. For example : Consider, you are reading a book with 10 chapters. If they are small Chapters, you can read one chapter per day.If they are big chapters, you can read half a chapter per day.By doing this, it will take long time to finish a book but don't worry, you will not feel tired and day by day you will start reading more. Have a schedule. Before start reading, divide the chapters as I mentioned above. Mark the date on which you have started and the date which you will end that book. Try your level best to reach that target. Reward yourself. When you are making schedule, decide what you are awarding yourself. Example: If you decide that you will complete a book by next week and you will buy a ice cream for yourself. You have a work to do and a target to reach and also a prize to win. So your mind will stay focused. I have prepared a model for your reference. I am currently reading a book Driven by Vijay lokapally.  It has 15 chapters. This is the model of schedule.  These small steps will make you a great reader one day. Image Source: Google and gallery. Thanks for reading. ~Pooja. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been in that situation before and have overcome it to a certain extent. I think I can help you in some way. Please understand that what you are facing right now is absolutely normal. There is no need to worry about it, or keep living with this fear in mind. There are proven ways by which you can overcome this little fear. Stay with me and you'll learn them all.  The point is, whenever you start forming a new habit - reading in your case - it takes time to develop. Reading a 400-page novel in one go, when you have never read so much in your life, and understanding the gist of it, doesn't happen overnight. It is a skill that gets polished over time. New habits always need time to get into shape. But be assured, as you start putting more time and energy into that habit, day after day, it starts giving you signs that you're going ahead in the right direction. You start feeling pumped up to do more of it, and it's a good feeling to have. With time, you start feeling comfortable with your new habit of reading and so, you start feeling more aligned to continue that habit, reading more and more books. It's a snowball effect that has many advantages of its own. That's the power of habits.  I want to first congratulate you as you've taken a beautiful decision to read books. You will learn so much from each and every book that you read and transform your life in a new amazing way. There are a few things that I'd suggest you to start with. Pick a short book that interests you. You need to always be at ease with yourself while reading. Choosing a short book that keeps you interested will be a good first step. If you like biographies, choose one from that section. If you like Drama and thriller, choose one from that section. But make sure whatever book you choose to start with, it should match your interests and you have to finish reading it. That's a must. Leaving it midway isn't an option. At first, choose a book that has only 100\u2013150 pages in it. There are many books that are under 200 pages in total. Go for them [1] Otherwise you'd lose interest midway and then the whole habit-building process could be a waste of your time and energy. Start small and increase as time goes by. Read one chapter. Then take a mini break.Once you have selected the book of your choice, start reading chapter by chapter. There is a reason why books have chapters. Every chapter has something to tell of its own, and something that connects it to the next one. So, if you are starting to read, just focus on reading and finishing one chapter at a time. Read slowly and understand what the author wants you to know from that chapter. Once done with this activity, take a mini-break. Have some coffee and listen to music. Let those thoughts sink in. Once you feel ready to read again, go for the next chapter and then repeat the same process. Taking such an approach has big advantages: It keeps your mind free from the burden of completing the book at once.It helps you to be creative and imaginative as you start connecting the dots in a meaningful way. Reading should be fun, after all!Completing one chapter gives you a sense of accomplishment and then you are ready to take another challenge. Another chapter. This is powerful!Keep a highlighter / notepad along with you.  While reading, you would come across many lines and paragraphs that feel super important to you, lines which you would want to revisit. Highlight them. If that is not possible, write those sentences in a notepad and keep that for your ready reference. When you finish reading the chapter, and eventually the entire book, you'd have a lot of content that's marked as important. With this, you will learn to create your own beautiful summary from the book and that's when you would accomplish your entire objective of reading it in the first place. Now you are absolutely ready to jump in to the next book. You're making real progress! Be proud of yourself. It is important to enjoy the process of reading, and not think about the outcome.  After reading 3\u20134 books in this manner, you would be in a good situation to formulate your own strategy of reading, keeping the basics still intact. And when you feel that you have the confidence to read books with more than 200 pages in it, go for them as well. Then go for 400-page ones. You get what I say. With this approach in place, you'll be surprised by the way you now take up those reading challenges. They won't bring you fear, but a feeling of excitement and a desire to learn. \u201cReading is still the main way that I both learn new things and test my understanding\u201d Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft In case you still need any support, feel comfortable to message me on Quora. I would be happy to help someone who wants to develop a strong habit of reading.  Thanks for reading. Source: Google Images. Footnotes[1] 35 Brilliant Short Books Anyone Can Find The Time To Read",
