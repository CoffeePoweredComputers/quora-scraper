            "answer_text": "A good literature is defined as great when it incorporates the political, civic reality and builds a story around it. If you read literature on Partition from Manto to Krishanchander to Khuswant Singh to anybody you will be surprised how partition is treated and incidents during partition are treated by different authors and writers. Manto specialized in bringing small incidents and human depravity to the fore in his stories and was pretty good in describing animal within men when they are in MOB and frailty of common man when faced with history. Krishanchander tried to bring the same out in his long stories but difference between him and Manto was expression where Manto was free flowing and dis not mind using language of gutters to express , Krishanchander and others were more suave and sophisticated hence were less hitting or scandalous than Manto. Khuswant Singh weaved a tale of love and lust between a Sikh and Muslim protagonists into tales and stories and facts of Partition, and also social norms prevalent then with a week, lecherous character who was also a mid level government /district official. The Language/Syntax used by Khushwant Singh was colloquial Punjabi with all local cuss words , the language used by him was scandalous and expression more near to Manto than any other contemporary writer in English. The incidents and events mentioned in the Train To Pakistan are part of our history and facts which happened during Partition, we Indians have a problem with history where Oral testimonies of survivors of events are not maintained and are not studied and researched so today the events seems to be imagination of a writer. The other example of Partition which used oral history and testimonies of common man very effectively was TAMAS by Bhisham Sahni. The Holocaust Museums in both US and Israel maintain a very big data base of Oral Testimonies of survivors of holocaust and these testimonies help in big way in answering people who question Holocaust and build up a movement against repeat of such events. In last 70 years many such events have happened in India starting from Partition, The 1947 invasion of Kashmir by Pakistan, Caste/language /Cow riots in 1950\u20131960, Liberation of Bangladesh, Emergency, Operation blue Star, 1984 anti Sikh riots, Ram Mandir/Babri Masjid riots, Godhra and anti Muslim riots in Gujarat, insurgency in Punjab/Assam,/Nagaland/Mizoram/Manipur/Kashmir, Naxalism, expulsion of Pandits from Kashmir/anti Muslim operations in Poonch in July 1947 etc etc are few of the instances where the Museum of oral testimonies should be created and shared with people. These testimonies will help create a better understanding of the issues involved and help in reconciliation and acceptance and moving forward\u2026.and also bring closure to issues which have become contentious(causing or likely to cause an argument; controversial, disputable, debatable, disputed, contended, open to question/debate, moot, vexed; involving heated argument.\theated, vehement, fierce, violent, intense, impassioned, committed; relating to or involving differences between contending parties) ",
