            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll jump in on this. First: define the length of a book. And genre. I say this only if an author is bragging of this feat. THE COLOR KITTENS and POKY LITTLE PUPPY are children\u2019s books that are sixteen pages long. Take books like The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Tim Holt, Tom Corbett. All short novels written for teens. Romance novels can be short, take a look at the spine of a Harlequin romance. Barbara Cartland and a few other names like hers will write longer novels, so good on them. I was lucky to make the acquaintance of Evan Hunter in the early 90s and we stayed friends until his death. He used the name Ed McBain and wrote 55 novels about the 87th Precinct. In the 50s and 60s, he was writing three books a year, but they were short. He knew that. Write a book someone can finish in a day or two. It wasn\u2019t until the mid-70s that books in the mystery genre were made longer so that the prices could be jacked up. I have a hardcover book on my shelf, THREE FROM THE 87th. My first novel has more pages. That book has three novels in it. But it was a different time. Again, if it is someone bragging about it, then I\u2019ll call bullshit. With Evan, he wrote stories for Playboy on retainer. If they didn\u2019t like something of his, they would pay him for it but if he sold it elsewhere, he would have to use a pseudonym. And so Ed McBain was born, and Richard Marsten, John Abbott and a few others. Some of his longer pieces he would turn into novels that topped out at 125 pages. He told me that when he wrote ICE in 1980, that was the first time that his publisher wanted a 300 page book. It is not uncommon to see novels hit the 400 page mark now. So that changed the dynamic. 250 words=one page. So at one point, Evan was tripling his word count. Mercedes R. Lackey mentioned L. Ron Hubbard. For those who want to disagree with her stating that almost all of his books were written by other Scientologists, I was fortunate enough to meet writers who knew Hubbard. Murray Leinster. Fritz Lieber. Several others. My first convention was in 1986. I heard the same thing. Hubbard died in 1982 and the dealer\u2019s room was filled with marked down copies of the 750 page BATTLEFIELD: EARTH. My youngest niece devoured FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC and had all her friend read the book and those that followed. Andrew Neiderman wrote most of the V. C. Andrews novels after her death, he had been her typist for FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC and she left many notebooks behind. Publishers want the name that is branded. But I never destroyed my niece\u2019s image of Andrews, I let her find out about her death on her own. (Neiderman wrote THE DEVIL\u2019S ADVOCATE under his own name, and it was made into a film starring Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron.) Names are brands, writers might as well be soft drinks or air fresheners. You die, someone might step in. My own agent inquired with Evan Hunter\u2019s estate if there were plans to have ghost writers continue writing the 87th Precinct books. I would have been happy to write one, but the estate said no. No more novels. I\u2019ve also seen authors with Print On Demand books that have *huge* margins, so that one line might be ten words on a page. So a 300 page book would be 175 or 200 if printed conventionally. Timothy Ellis answered this the way I intended to end my ramblings. Go by word count, not by the amount of books. A thousand words is sixteen pages. That could be Chapter One of a novel or it could be a children\u2019s book in it\u2019s entirety. That is one perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt any have. If anyone claims to have written 1,000 books, I daresay it is one of the following: The numbers are deceptive.If you write a 5,000 word story and print it as a book, does that count? Possibly, but to then put that on the same level as War and Peace isn't honest. Things like the length of book is important. Does Lord of the Rings count as 1, 3 or 6 books? Arguments can be made for each of those, but using one number doesn't magically make Tolkien more or less prolific than if you use another, even if it sounds like it does. Another example is Enid Blyton, who has written from 700 to even 1,000+ books, depending on how you count them, but Enid Blyton's work was usually quite short. I have a fair few of her books (not even close to the 700+ she actually wrote though) and the only ones that I have approaching a normal length book for me, also happen to be omnibuses with at least two or even three \u201cbooks\" in to bring them up to ~400 pages total. You could easily half that number to put them on par with what most people would consider a book. That would put her number to not even half way to the claimed 1,000 books in the question. I say \u201ceven\", she is still a very prolific writer. Anyway, continuing: They're exaggerating.They're including co-authored books as whole books. If 5 authors are collaborating, that'll take less effort than if one did it by themselves (sure, it would be more than the 1/5th implied, but still less than doing it by themselves).They're including things like ebook short stories, which links back to the first point.They're telling the truth and have written 1,000 full length books by themselves, and are, in fact, super human. Let's do the math on that.1,000 books over 100 years (I doubt any one would have had 100 years of writing, but it makes the maths easier), that's 10 books a year or a book every 5 weeks. About 100 pages a week (ok, so that is with rounding up, but more than countered by being spread over 100 years, I doubt any authors did 80 years). That's 14 pages a day, every day (no days off, working weekends, no holidays etc), for 100 years. That time also includes the planning, editing, as well as failed drafts, rewrites, notes, plans plus anything else that doesn't directly contribute to book count but is still necessary. Assuming a full work day each day, that's a page every half hour. A finished page every half hour. Granted, authors will write faster than your average Joe, but still. How long does it take you to write a page? How often does it turn out to be drivel? Imagine being able to churn out a fully formed, properly edited and ready to publish page in half hour. Now do it every half hour for 7 hours straight. Now do that every day for 100 years. I wouldn't say it's impossible, but I'm highly doubtful that there are many, if any, authors who wrote 1,000 full books or the equivalent thereof, at least not without co-authors etc. They'll most likely be shorter stories like Enid Blyton. To be able to do it, they'd have to devote their entire life to it, meaning they'll be pretty famous because otherwise they just won't sell enough to pay for their living, they won't be some nobody like me claiming to have done it.
