            "answer_text": "Original Question: Are people still into adult coloring books? My Answer: Yes, there are still a whole lot of people who still enjoy adult colouring. (Just as an FYI for any curious readers I'm Canadian and we spell English the same way as the UK, hence the letter U in some words that Americans don't use it in. i.e: colouring versus coloring) Side note: This answer turned out to be waaay longer than I'd planned. For any readers that are thinking of trying adult colouring, or have only been colouring for a brief time, please stick with it and read the whole answer, because you'll probably see some stuff you might want to know. Especially if you take the adult colouring hobby seriously. ~ end of side note ~ There are lots of personal colouring websites owned by folks who love the adult coloring hobby. There's a number of different YouTube channels and videos devoted entirely to adult colouring. On these websites and YouTube channels, there's all kinds of product reviews and tutorials. On top of all these free resources, there's also a good number of adult colouring groups on Facebook, some of which I belong to. We share our work, including noting what mediums you used to colour the pages we're posting. We also share colouring tips and techniques. Adult colouring as a hobby is something that a lot of people living with chronic health issues, including chronic pain, mental health illnesses, etc. find colouring helps them cope with their lives. It's certainly always been the case for me, especially for my chronic pain. Both men and women enjoy adult colouring. I know there's a couple of men in at least one of the adult colouring groups on Facebook that I belong to. Adult colouring is NOTHING like the colouring we all did as kids. For example, I have: most of the 150 Prismacolor Premier coloured pencils.a full set of 120 Faber-castell Polychromos coloured pencils. Both the Prismacolor Premiers and the Faber-castell Polychromos coloured pencils are expensive artist grade pencils. Fortunately, you can now buy both brands open stock. As in you can buy them individually over time until you have full sets, should you want them.a full set of 72 Arteza Expert coloured pencils. These ones are not sold open stock so you'd need to buy a another set to replace any of them. However, I heard a rumor on one of the YouTube colouring channels, that Arteza is hoping to sell them open stock at some point. But I wouldn't count on it. If you want a decent, yet budget set of coloured pencils, search YouTube for \u201cbudget friendly color pencil reviews and comparisons\u201d or some version of it. Have a pen and paper handy while you're watching the videos and take notes.a full set of Koor-i-noor Polycolor coloured pencilsa full set of 50 Sergeants coloured pencils. These ones can be found super cheap on Amazon Canada and Amazon US. Their largest set includes all 50 pencils, plus one each of the rest of this pencil line, including some watercolour, pastel, neon and metallic coloured pencils.a full set of 100 Crayola regular coloured pencils. If you can afford a tiny bit more, get the Sergeants or another brand in that price range. Crayola's are okay\u2026but not my favourites by any means.a couple hundred water-based and alcohol based markers.about 150 chalk style pastels and a small 6 pkg of Faber-castell's Studio Oil pastels.a 21 piece of pearlescent metallic pan watercolour paints.Relax, you don't need anywhere near this amount of supplies. I've acquired all of the above over the last 30+ years. Most of it bit by bit. And before anyone asks, yes, I use all of them in my colouring. Not all at once, of course. ",

            "answer_text": "I loved coloring books when I was young. Trying to find colors that pair well together so it will look perfect at the end, and make the outline of the pictures darker so it looks more \u201cprofessional\u201d. It was relaxing as a kid because you wanted to perfect it and like a good book - you ended up in your own world. Adult coloring books suck. I never could get into them. It\u2019s always these random shapes and small pieces. I\u2019m not saying I want to color in a Lisa Frank ice cream cone and dolphin but I want to color in a Lisa Frank ice cream cone and dolphin. It\u2019s simple, it's cute, it's nostalgic. And just like children, there are no limits to what color goes where. I wish adult books were more simple, more fun and not as stressful. I always found myself more stressed trying to color in this picture that has a zillion small parts and realizing I\u2019m only a quarter of the way in and it\u2019s been an hour\u2026 I end up annoyed and just leave adult coloring books in the trash. They\u2019re no fun. They\u2019re difficult and they're boring. Which I guess is a generic metaphor for being an adult. ",

When I was younger, teenage through college, I loved painting and sketching. During high school, I spent a lot of free time in the art room, copying Holbein\u2019s portraits of Henry VIII and his court. On my way to and from school, I would carry a briefcase with an artist\u2019s pad and charcoal pencils, and sketch people waiting for buses and trains. But, sad to say, there was no money in it, and after I went away to law school, there was no time. And I\u2019m sure not many young lawyers neglect their contracts for paint brushes. The modern world is simply too demanding. It was fun to be young with less responsibility. I didn\u2019t have to cheat to be admitted to Georgetown. ",

I carry colored pencils and pictures every where I go so I have them in case of having any down time especially if I'm working on a picture then I feel is turning out to be better then I had invisioned it to be. My daughter and boyfriend get frustrated with me because I have close to about 1, 000 colored pencils. Sometimes in order to be creative you must have many different options to make a true master piece in my personal opinion. ",

The difference between my childhood self and my adult self is that now (as well as using crayons and felt-tip pens sometimes) I use an awful lot of oil paint, and my colors go onto canvases. I will sometimes work into my paintings with oil pastels, which are just wax crayons grown up. ",

When I lived on an island in BC, along with the rest of us friends, we adults did color - in books of adult (not THAT kind) material, like greek statues, or the fancy lettering used in old illuminated Bibles, or mythical animals or operatic themes. They were more difficult than the ones for children and we enjoyed them immensely. ",
