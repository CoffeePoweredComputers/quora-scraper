            "answer_text": "You can't, because although negative entities/spirits/demons or whatever we choose to call them DO exist, 'demonology' is a man made subject written of by men. There are no human experts on this subject, just several claims and made up books, over-theatrical and over-exaggerated movies and TV shows. These ancient beings predate humanity by an eternity and are highly intelligent, cunning and insidious. They rarely speak of names and hierarchy, and when they do it's always a lie. They're experts at mixing part truths with lies to keep people hooked and to form a fake trust/bond to strengthen their attachment to a home, person, land, animal or object. They'll tell us whatever we want to hear and pretend to be whoever we want or expect them to be in order to further deceive. There are no king demons and none that represent emotions. There are no incubi, succubi, shapeshifters or poltergeists either, they're basically all the same type of entity and all are capable of pretty much the same thing, depending on their agenda. A lot of nonsense (deluded, deliberate or ignorant) has been written about these beings over the centuries, and as I mentioned before, there are no experts on them, myself included. I can only give my opinion based on dealing with these things for over 30 years. Demonology and magic books are made up. As well as all of the above, humans can't summon or command one of these beings either. It's another myth. They don't answer to any human, but they will pretend to if it suits their agenda and forms a bond and strong attachment to the gullible human. I hope this helps. ",
