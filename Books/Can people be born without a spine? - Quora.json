            "answer_text": "That is called a neural tube defect. Complete neural tube defects include anencephaly (no brain either). Some of these children ARE born live, but they live for only minutes. If you want to see what they look like, and i don\u2019t recommend it, search on severe open neural tube defects. A lot MORE children are born missing a great lot of their spines, or just a large part of their brains, and they can survive for years, though they are seriously handicapped. Some children born without large portions of their lower spines are mentally normal, though wheelchair bound. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cNo, you can not live without a spinal column. It is made up of many vertebrae, which are special types of bones, arranged in a column, so it can also be referred as a vertebral column. In fact, to be a vertebrate, you must have a such a column from the spine in little fish to the huge vertebral column of a giraffe or a blue whale, the largest animal ever known to have lived. Without one, your body would be drastically different, for example, octopuses do not have one.\u201d izzy xo ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean that literally or figuratively?If literally, then no. Any such deformity would lead to a miscarriage early in the pregnancy. Interestingly you can be born without much of the head and brain (look up anencephaly). If your question is meant figuratively then that\u2019s much more difficult to explain. What you may consider spineless, others may see as a way to survive, get ahead or just avoid conflict. ",
