            "answer_text": "It may, under some circumstances, be mere copyright infringement, while in others it may be theft. I\u2019ll just look at the two extremes. I\u2019m going to use the term \u201cout-of-print\u201d a lot here because it\u2019s important. There\u2019s an explanation of it at the end of the answer. Let\u2019s say you discover a little known out-of-print book published in the 1980s called \u201cCentipedes, and their influence on micro-ecologies.\u201d You take the text, add some photographs, re-title the book \u201cThe World\u2019s most Astonishing Creepy-Crawlies,\u201d and publish it as an eBook via KDP. You have done a substantial amount of work yourself, and technically, the copyright of the book as compiled (assuming you own the rights to use the photographs) belongs to you. But the text is from an out-of-print but still-under-copyright book. So you have violated copyright, and (depending on jurisdiction) may be prosecuted and have to surrender ALL proceeds of sales (even though \u201cThe World\u2019s most Astonishing Creepy-Crawlies,\u201d belongs to you). In some countries you might be able to negotiate a settlement where the author of \u201cCentipedes, and their influence\u2026\u201d gets most of the money, because if your book sells well, then it makes sense for them to share in the success, because they can\u2019t take \u201cThe World\u2019s most Astonishing Creepy-Crawlies,\u201d and sell it for themselves, only prevent its sale. In the UK this would likely be considered a matter for the civil courts. That\u2019s the best case scenario. Now lets imagine the worst. You acquire (let\u2019s say, legally) the original electronic typesetting files for hundreds of books published in the early 1990s. The files are electronic, but none of the books have ever been published as eBooks, and they are all now out-of-print. You upload them all, unchanged, to Amazon KDP to sell as eBooks, with the original authors\u2019 names and book titles. You have now committed the crime of theft, specifically copyright theft and potentially (this depends a lot on laws in different countries) theft of earnings. In the UK and France, this would be a matter for criminal courts, and you would be prosecuted for theft by the state, and could be given a prison sentence. All the earnings would be confiscated.  Out-of-print is a bookseller/distributor\u2019s term, which is important to know, in association with two other bookselling/publishing terms, namely remainderedout of copyrightOut of copyright means that the copyright has expired. Sufficient time has passed since the book was originally published (or last published, or the author died, or the last distribution/diffusion rights expired - it varies a lot from country to country) and the TEXT has become public property. Once this happens, anyone may repackage the text and sell it, either with a new title or under the original title. Remaindered books are books that were ordered by bookshops from a distributor on sale-or-return. This is how books were sold in the past. It still happens, but on a much smaller scale. Once returned to the distributor, the distributor might then choose to bulk sell them (often to smaller independent bookshops and to book warehouses, or re-sell them in a different country, which was common for books written in English. Some people will read whatever they can get their hands on.) If you acquire remaindered books that are not out-of-print and are not out-of-copyright, then you must sell them unadulterated (unchanged from how they were when you acquired them). Obviously, this doesn\u2019t apply in any way to eBooks. Before the days of electronic publishing, a book was said to be out-of-print when the publisher melted down the printing blocks to use to make a different book. (To be really, really strict, it meant the blocks were no longer in the press, but advances in printing technology blurred the meaning quite a lot.) Publishers would try to keep the blocks as long as possible since making them was an expensive part of the process, but they would melt them down eventually because the blocks take up space, and in any case would deteriorate. Out-of-print means, therefore, that the publisher has no intention of making any more copies, and has not sold the rights on (and therefore the blocks, too) to another publisher. It is likely therefore that the rights to an out-of-print book (this is the right to print, distribute and sell) will have reverted to the author. Likely, but not certain. You would have to read the terms of the publisher\u2019s contract with the author. Today, if a publisher says a book is out-of-print they are a) showing their age and b) using it as shorthand for saying that the rights have reverted to the author. Usually. Today, the term out-of-print (or the abbreviation OOP) is falling out of use, but is sometimes applied to other media such as film and audio. It\u2019s meaning is almost diluted to nothing, however, since electronic storage means that any form of media can be reissued with a minimal investment. ",

When a person writes something - even on a bulletin board - there is an implicit copyright associated with that work. If you copy their work and publish it - even if you're just giving it away - then it's usually violating that copyright. 10 Big Myths about copyright explained provides a good summary of answers to relevant questions you might have in this regard. I don't know for certain it is correct, but it aligns with what I know about US copyright law. ",
