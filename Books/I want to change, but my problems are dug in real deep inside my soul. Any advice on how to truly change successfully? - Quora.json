            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have much advice except a couple of general directions where you should definitely start looking. Uncover and face your fears. You need to have an upper hand because it gives you sense of control and security. Security from what? You need to figure out what you are afraid of so much, and go through your fear by admitting it and experiencing it fully until you see that what it is doing to your life is worse than what this fear is trying to protect you from. You need to live through your fear and come out on the other side. Stop running from it.Question deeply, how much other people are really responsible for your happiness. Hint: not at all. Your happiness or lack thereof comes from within. Somebody lied to you; big deal. Why is it important to be so fixated on and upset about what other people are and what they do? They don\u2019t need your respect or your punishment for their sins. Nor do you. Realize that as long as you make your own happiness conditioned on what other people do, you will never be happy, because what they do is completely outside of your control.Bottom line, forget about other people for a while and focus on finding peace in yourself. Once you are comfortable with yourself, it will feel OK for you to let other people into your life without breaking them. ",

            "answer_text": "we all have deep rooted unhelpful harmful patterns. Here is what I have found helpful to me: Accept it: noticing it's an unhelpful pattern does so much more than you realize. Patterns that continue to run are the ones we are totally unaware of. I gather your particular pattern is still running because you are resisting it so much and there is still an unconscious part of you that sees value in it. Accepting it fully will allow it to flow through you and be released. What does this look like? Say you are controlling in relationships but you know it's unhelpful and harms them, accepting it looks like telling your partner you are controlling at times yet you know she/ he deserves to be free so when you do act controlling let me know. Or it can be when you actually do the controlling things notice it\u2026. Notice how you feel during it and fully accept that feeling ( no one feels peace/love while in a state of control/ resistance ) Work on your thoughts about it: so you are controlling? Maybe so ..but is that how you want to be? Probably not because it doesn't feel good. So repeat that you are free ( notice whatever you feel you need to do to someone else is really what you wish upon yourself) you unconsciously in this case want to inprison or control yourself so repeat daily as a mantra I am free. Say this to everyone you meet silently in your mind. Over time your hold on needing to control others will lessen. above can be applied to any unhelpful trait. Even if it's some trait you see in someone else. (I do not mean that you will cause another person to act differently but you will see them differently and the only choice they will have is to leave your orbit or vibrate on the level you allow them to. ) ",
