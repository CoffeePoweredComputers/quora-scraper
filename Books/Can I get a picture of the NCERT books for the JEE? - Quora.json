            "answer_text": "Ok fine! First I would like to tell you that jee particularly jee mains is mostly based on NCERT so you must have to go through them at least once especially chemistry in detail. As far as jee advanced is concerned you can't depend on NCERT books because advanced has some higher level of concepts which you can't get through NCERT. For theory I would recommend you to go through some special theoretical books from significant authors and atleast solve NCERT questions part for once to give yourself a confidence boost. ",
