            "answer_text": "The entries in a Word Table of Contents are formatted with styles: TOC 1 for listing Heading 1 content (or paragraphs set to outline level 1); TOC 2 for listing Heading 2, etc. If you are seeing unwanted bold in your ToC, you can just modify the applicable style definition: Select a line of the ToC with the bold you don\u2019t want.If you don\u2019t already have the Styles panel displayed, press Alt-Ctrl-Shift-S to bring it up.Scroll down in the list to see the currently-selected style (it should be one of the \u201cTOC x\u201d styles), and right-click within it to choose \u201cModify\u2026\u201d.The Modify Style dialog lets you make changes to the current definition of the style. The \u201cFormat\u201d button in the lower left gives you access to several more formatting dialogs that let you make more detailed modifications \u2014 but if all you want to do is remove the bold, click the \u201cB\u201d in the Formatting shortcuts to toggle it off.Before you click OK, turn off the \u201cAutomatically update\u201d checkbox if it is on. If you don\u2019t, Word will automatically modify the style if a representative paragraph using it is changed.Click OK and regenerate your ToC by pressing F9 and choosing the option to \u201cUpdate entire table\u201d.Repeat for other TOC styles as needed.

            "answer_text": "Here is a more elegant alternative to manually formatting the TOC entries. I\u2019m assuming we are starting off with bold heading styles within the text. Go to REFERENCES tab. Select Table of Contents > Custom Table of Contents:  Click Modify to display:  Click Modify once again to display:  Click Format > Font and select Regular for Font Style:  Click OK your way back to Modify Style screen where you should select \u201cAutomatically Update\u201d and \u201cOnly in this document\u201d options. Click OK twice to go back to the Table of Contents screen. Click OK to insert/replace a new TOC. This one should not have bold TOC entries anymore, just as you wanted. Do the above for every TOC paragraph heading style that is set to Bold within the text. This should do it. ",
