If such a thing were to happen, it would be against a group of people that pretty much everyone sees as morally and ethically wrong.  That is the requirement.  That was the requirement then too.  It probably does happen, we just don't see it happen.  I'm sure such persecution happens elsewhere.  I am not sure of whether it happens in the USA, however.   There are literal witch hunts in India, and I think they qualify as collective hysteria.  Not sure of other places though.   ",
