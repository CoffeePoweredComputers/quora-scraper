            "answer_text": "The only thing you have is the possibility of launching a lawsuit, with the help of a lawyer, to defend your copyright, assuming you can validate that copyright. Keep in mind clearly that there are no copyright police. Any enforcement of your copyright is entirely up to you, done entirely at your expense. Your lawyer will walk you through the likely course of how proceedings are likely to unfold, first trying to get the pirate to take the book down by writing stern cease-and-desist letters, of course, and see if that has one of several desired effects, but if there\u2019s any whiff of a request for money or compensation in the letter, that\u2019s likely to engender resistance. At this point of the walk-through, the lawyer will talk to you about his-her costs to you of doing just that much (if they don\u2019t, you should ask). When you hear the amount for writing a couple of letters, or an order of magnitude worse, what a contested trial might cost you, up front, how much you will have to prove to a judge is your due from the pirate, you can then do a little cost-benefit analysis to decide if that cost, in funds lost to you by the pirate, generated by the e-book over time, is worth all the fuss and time and work you\u2019ll have to expend\u2014with no guarantees of any positive result. Or maybe those funds, or a lesser amount, might be better spent in marketing your ebook at your address, and ensure your potential customers know this is the only proper address for purchase, without once mentioning the existence of the pirate.
