            "answer_text": "I think the influences are so strong they are difficult not to miss \u2014 if you\u2019ve read both authors. The threat of a \u201cDark Lord\u201d \u2014 this title, also adopted by George Lucas, is a direct borrowing, or stealing, from Tolkien. His work is dominated by Dark Lords\u2026 first Morgoth and then Sauron (who is referenced even in The Hobbit as the \u201cNecromancer\u201d). Note that the Dark Lord is not just a run-of-the-mill villain, but a very special type of villain created by Tolkien: a Satanic figure nearly as powerful as Satan himself, but nonetheless with a physical presence in this world. Notably, the Dark Lord commands entire armies of Really Bad People. Incidentally, does that mean that Hitler and Mussolini were \u201cDark Lords\u201d? Well, many people have thought that the Dark Lord is a symbol for Hitler, although a true Dark Lord also has to have supernatural powers. Gandalf/Dumbledore \u2014 These characters are so similar they are almost the same\u2026 and could certainly be played by the same actor. Ian McKellen would\u2019ve made a fine Dumbledore and Michael Gambon could\u2019ve played Gandalf. Why? It\u2019s almost the same role!! Specifically: a powerful wizard who nonetheless has his limitations and can\u2019t defeat the Dark Lord alone\u2026 who is also a constant mentor to the main characters\u2026 who sacrifices his life as it is the only way to preserve \u201cthe Quest\u201d\u2026 but then somehow comes back to advise the good guys later on. A small, humble hero \u2014 whom of course the Dark Lord completely underestimates\u2026 in Voldemort\u2019s case, again and again and again\u2026 to his utter folly, of course. Magic has Rules \u2014 Although JK Rowling\u2019s wizards have mostly far greater power than Tolkien\u2019s wizards (and there are far more of them), she did learn a very, very important lesson from Tolkien: If you put magic in your story, you must be careful to delineate its limitations. The mistake both of them avoid is to make magic users either omnipotent or have fuzzy limitations. There are some clear limitations to any wizard\u2019s power; otherwise Voldemort could not be defeated. A connection to our own world, however remote: \u2014 Tolkien makes his Middle Earth more real to us by setting in our distant, super-ancient past. (But the connection is put right into the plot: the Dark Lord is banished, and meanwhile, the Elves leave this world, clearing theway for the Age of Man.) Rowling does it by showing a world in which the wizards and witches walk among us but work very hard to remain unseen. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on your point of view. \u201cAnd much of his power was bound up in it, so that while it existed he could not die\u201d - a description of The One Ring and a pretty accurate description of a horcrux. Clearly The One Ring came first, so it would be fair to argue (from a certain point of view) that the idea of horcuxes could have come from that. But I am pretty sure the idea of binding your life force to an inanimate (or even animate) object can\u2019t have originated with Tolkien, so horcruxes may have been inspired by something else. There\u2019s a similarity between the spiders of Mirkwood and The Forbidden Forest, but if you think Tolkien was the first person to propose spiders are scary then \u2026\u2026 no. Lord of The Rings is pretty much a staple of British fantasy (and world wide fantasy, come to that) - anyone who has an interest or liking of it will have read it, so there are good odds it will have seeped into her writing somewhere. But the same can be said of almost anyone who has written fantasy novels in the past 50 years. If you look at the structure of Babyon 5 (for example) it is almost impossible not to notice a certain\u2026\u2026. similarity in places. Tolkien was one of the grandfathers of fantasy, and I would imagine almost everyone has written in the fantasy genre has been influenced - some more than others. As I said - horcruxes do bare more than a passing similarity to The Rings of Power but for all I know (and I\u2019ve done very little research) there is a 12th century legend of Matrok The Wise who bound his soul to a potato.
