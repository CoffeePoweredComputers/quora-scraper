            "answer_text": "It depends on what you call too small. It's a 13 inch laptop and it has several options for screen scaling. By default you may find the text a bit too small but go one or two settings lower and it should be fine. If you go one lower you're actually at the screen's native resolution so text is definitely sharp there. The Mac is pretty great as far as scaling goes, whether you want to read more easily or fit more content on the screen. ",

Find a big laptop with a big screen and a big battery with a big keyboard. and a big trackpad. Then it won\u2019t be so tiny and you won\u2019t be worried. I recommend a powerful Windows machine. ",
