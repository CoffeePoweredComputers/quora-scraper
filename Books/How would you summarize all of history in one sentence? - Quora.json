            "answer_text": "That one is pretty easy. \u201cYou got stuff, so you need to give it to me.\u201d We\u2019re in a time unparalleled in history. More people are overweight than ever before & more people are able to eat than ever before. It\u2019s not perfect but it needs tweaking (like the way we deal with terrorism) rather than wholesale tearing down of systems. When one is in a medieval society for example, there is very little surplus most of the time. The tech is low so you must eat what is produced locally. You may think that this is something to rejoice over. There is a movement to try to buy as much as possible from local producers. But what happens in a low-tech society with low-tech transportation when there is a local crop failure? IIRC In Japan under the Tokugawa Shoguns there was famine in the country for 125 of their 267 (1600\u20131867) years in power. This is not the engineered famines of Stalin\u2019s Soviets in the Ukraine or the reactions to Soviet collectivizations in 1921. This was people who were not being purposely starved out, but for various reasons had crop failures in a country that was at peace. So you have to understand that people being people, the ones at the top are going to try to be as secure as possible. Unfortunately, that means there is no room for much of a middle class & the poor are at risk. A big part of the problem when the Black Plague hit Europe was that the population outstripped the available tech. So a big part of the population was undernourished. Underfed people are vulnerable to disease, especially a new disease that they carry no immunity to. Thus a 25\u201350% kill rate. When people go to war in most of the world\u2019s history, they do it to get spoils. In Ottoman times before their decline, the Sultan was supposed to keep balance between the Anatolian parties & the Devshirme (those European kids taken from their peasant parents when young, brought up as Muslims & recruited into the political corps instead of the Janissaries). One party would want war, because the Sultan was rewarding them with lands for income and plunder. The other party would advocate peace as they got nothing from war. The Sultan would listen to both, thus getting balanced advice. When the war party got too powerful, the Sultan would start giving lands & plunder to the peace party, who would start advocating war while the other party now advocated peace. If you look at Africa or Asia, you find the same thing. The nomads get tribute from China or they invade. In Africa, the northern tribes in East Africa, make slave raids to sell slaves to the Muslims cheaply, so that the Muslims don\u2019t take them as slaves. Some of those tribes even migrate south or west. In Asia you find tribes that push others west, like the Hsiung-nu & the Alanni. With technology we\u2019ve lessened the need for people to be so bloodthirsty. Unfortunately, Americans now countenance bloodshed because they\u2019re so comfortable, they don\u2019t understand that there is no argument that they can use to convince terror orgs to give up and settle for 1/3 of a pizza when they can fight some more & maybe get the whole thing. We don\u2019t understand \u201cYou got stuff. Now give it here.\u201d ",

When two cultures clash,the loser is annihilated and the winner writes the history that elevates their own cause.Well losers,the whole thing was their fault in the first place. History is full of greed,lust and blood. It has nothing to do with good or bad because good is only one\u2019s perception and if the history is told from the perspective of bad(as was defined by so called good people) it will never be the same. We are governed and our minds are molded to believe what the majority thinks is right. ",
