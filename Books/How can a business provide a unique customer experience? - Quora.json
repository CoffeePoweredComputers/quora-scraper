            "answer_text": "Hi, a lot of answers feature a lot of tech and that\u2019s great. I\u2019d like to go back to the basics. Now-a-days we have unprecedented access to products and services thanks to the Interweb. We can easily learn all there is on almost any kind of product. We can easily compare them. We can see reviews on Amazon to help us make our minds\u2026 And those products which we know, like and trust the most are the ones making us take out our credit card. The thing is, because we have a lot of access, brands have changed their nature. Brands now have to incorporate some kind of \u201cmessage\u201d plus some competitive advantage that make it unique. Now we know that products and services are just commodities. It\u2019s the brand, the offerings and the experience we add to it that make them valuable. Basically the experience is the service + theater you add to match and go beyond the expectations of your offering. It\u2019s like Disney does, every guy with a costume is in its role and they work hard to make every kid to feel happy and engaged. If you own a classy restaurant, then having some nice foreign hostess with an accent adds to the experience. If you have a nice house of fashion, then having a savvy personalized shopper who knows about business will add a lot of value to your image. For those that use data, knowing what parts of the product, usage and social engagement brings the most attention and interaction will help you focus on creating more of that. Read about the service experience that Mercedes-Benz and the Ritz-Carlton design for their customers. Sometimes the theater is given by the story the product has. The exquisite and unique ingredients or parts that it\u2019s made with. The location. The over-careful process that builds it to match your high levels of standards. No matter if we are talking about ice cream. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a brilliant thing to make a documentary about your brand, the team behind the brand and the process to deliver an unique experience you develop. If you look close enough, every brand that really owns a unique experience has one. So first see where you can make an emotional impact with your product (think about your Why - Simon Sinek reference) ,Make it consistent to the offering so it can become a competitive advantage,Now add influence to it (refer to Robert Cialdini\u2019s work)Finally make it a system where you use technology, people and processes to really engage people into your brand with nice theaterHope this helps.

            "answer_text": "A unique customer experience is the outcome of a unique company. What I mean by that is that, yes a company can put tactics into place that transactionally are out of the ordinary. But in order to be steadfast in the market and with customers and employees and partners as a company that is unique - they need to address both the internal and external factors to enable them to deliver in a unique manner. Here are some of those dependent dimensions that exist inside the worlds most beloved or \u201cMake Mom Proud\u201d companies: They angst over deliberate leadership actions to give permission. Any one of these simple actions can start a groundswell for good. For example, Cleveland Clinic\u2019s transformation began with the commitment by CEO Toby Cosgrove, accompanied by an investment in training and communication, that everyone in the organization was considered and given permission to act as a \u201ccaregiver.\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t Years of actions later, which built upon that commitment, they are rated the number two hospital in the United States by U.S. News & World Report. Actions for Hiring and Development Set the Tone. To enable an organization to imagine, care about and build and deliver unique experiences, the right people must be found to be a part of that experience. For example, Pal\u2019s Sudden Service, a drive-through restaurant based in Tennessee with twenty-six locations enlists a 60-point psychometric survey to determine whether the teenagers who will deliver food to your drive-in window or make your burger will sync with the values of the company and team they will join. They then receive over 120 hours of training and ongoing mentoring. Their turnover is one-third the industry average, and they have lost just seven general managers in thirty-three years. Pal\u2019s enjoys one of the highest revenue per square feet in the quick serve restaurant industry. CEO Thom Crosby connects this back to the team, and how they are hired and developed. They imagine experiences with a human and mindful eye. Enable employees to take spirited actions, to be authentic in their personality, and to just be real and human is wired into experience design. First Direct Bank, for example, took the action to have a human available every day 24/7. Just like mom. And the humans you reach have your back, and permission to do what\u2019s right for you. Every person WORD MISSING HERE? customer\u2019s reach is trusted to change processes, procedure and policies to improve their situation. 92% of First Direct Customers commit that they would recommend the bank to someone else. They wire two-way trust into experiences. For example, new market entrant and disruptor, Lemonade Insurance took the action to have claims fulfilled first, by having people film and sign an \u201chonesty pledge.\u201d On the Lemonade App you chat with Lemonade\u2019s bot \u201cAI Jim\u201d who first asks about what happened and why the claim. Next he asks you to sign the \u201cHonesty Pledge\u201d on the app - vowing not only to Lemonade, but also to the other members in this with you, and the charities who benefit from fairness in reporting. Finally, this oh so smart and mom-like company asks you to look them in the eye, and record a video giving the reason for your claim. On their \u201ctransparency blog\u201d where they note their performance, a recent post shared that Lemonade has captured 27% of policyholders who are newcomers to insurance in their current limited New York market area. There is power in truth and trust. They take the high road in blotting out practices that have defined their industries, earning love and admiration and advocates who grow the business. For example, the Columbus Metropolitan Library took the action to get rid of late fees. They want kids to meet their summer reading goal, not worry about those ten cents a day fees. The first library in the United States to do this, their action focuses the organization back to their mission. There is a bit of tracking \u2013 you\u2019re asked to get that book back in twenty-eight days. Reasonable. Automatic renewal has been put in place so instead of calling your book late, it is renewed back to you. The library actually now gives you ten renewal periods to get back that book \u2013 so think of that as 280 days of grace. Because of this act and many other, Columbus Metropolitan Library, is one of the most progressive and acclaimed libraries in the United States. So as you consider unique experiences, begin first by holding a mirror to your organization, its \u201cunderbelly\u201d and its focus and ability to gear how you build experiences to present the humanity of your company. That \u201cunique\u201d quality of showing up as a company that cares about customers\u2019 lives will make you stand out in the marketplace, and with your employees. ",

Just kidding :D What I hope to illustrate to you today is something most people don\u2019t realize: how well you onboard your users is directly correlated with how effective and unique the Customer Experience you provide can be! To provide a special CX, you should focus on the Customer Success strategy you\u2019ll follow. Based on the desired outcomes and individual experiences each customer requires, it\u2019s possible to create a roadmap that includes specific targets (milestones) and decide on all the elements (people, content, technology\u2026) you\u2019ll carry out. A Customer Success strategy deeply rooted in User Onboarding and the Customer Journey will blossom into a Customer Experience promoting success and advocacy.My company discusses this more in depth here, but I\u2019d like to highlight how certain tactics during the Onboarding and User Adoption phase can lead to a beautifully unique Customer Experience. Proven Customer Success Tactics That Work >> Highlight Benefits, not Features When presenting features to your users, don\u2019t focus on characteristics. You need to focus on the results.>> Push Users to Doing Things Lead users to engage with the product as soon as possible.>> Provide a Visible Checklist Tracking progress and rewarding completion will allow you to increase engagement!>> Communicate with Users Individually Users who feel guided during onboarding are more likely to go through the entire process.If you\u2019d like to see how you can achieve a unique CX through these methods, I\u2019d recommend checking out a guided walkthrough service, such as Userlane, that can help you implement them successfully! If you\u2019d like any additional resources, wish to discuss my answer some more, or just want to connect- reach out! I hope I was of some help! Elyse ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, let\u2019s start with the word, \u201cexperience,\u201d as many businesses do not understand the idea. For many, experience is about having a clean restroom, or customer facing employees who give, \u201cservice with a smile,\u201d but that is way far out of date. That is the thinking of the \u201cService Economy,\u201d and there is a case that has been made that many economies, particularly those of western nations, have moved passed the service economy and are now part of the emerging, \u201cExperience Economy.\u201d This case was most famously made by Pine and Gilmore, in their paper, \u201cWelcome to the Experience Economy.\u201d Here\u2019s a link to the paper, which someone has very nicely highlighted so you can get the salient points really quickly\u2026 https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/33727940/pine___gilmore_welcome_to_experience_economy.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1525201057&Signature=enMv2NncQe3WFD0jU9RgP7LZ7A4%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DPine_and_gilmore_welcome_to_experience_e.pdf Now, once a business has grasped the idea that experience is more than just a shiny paint job, we must ask how to really think about it. When I am teaching about experience economy I urge my students to think about photographs. See, we don\u2019t really have photographs anymore, at least not in the way we used to. We used to be limited to 36 exposures, and would have then take those rolls of film in to be developed. Half of them would be just black prints from where the camera went off before we took the lens cap off, and others would be blurry, and maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026 if you were lucky, you\u2019d get two or three good shots. We\u2019d take those and put them in a frame so we could look at them to remember our visit with friends and family, or a special trip, or what have you. Now, we have phones were we will take thirty pictures of our ham and cheese sandwich and select the best one to post on Facebook, and the rest are forgotten in our phones, never to be looked at again, and the one on Facebook is rarely thought of again either, except when Facebook posts it as a \u201cmemory.\u201d So I encourage my students to think of creating experiences as creating memories as photographs in the mind. The thing that really stood out beyond what was expected. Try to put yourself in the shoes of the guest - and think of them as guests, rather than customers, for starters - and try to see what they see as they walk around your store - or as we call it, the \u201cservicescape.\u201d Are they being tended to by the customer facing staff? Are the staff really engaging with the guest, or are they \u201chard selling\u201d them? Caring and friendship create experiences, so staff members who can make a real connection with guests impart memories. They can further enhance those memories by engaging the guest with the products or services that the firm offers, and roll those into the budding friendship, because that\u2019s what they\u2019re really doing: building a friendship. Relationships are experiences. Think of the servicescape as an amusement park for the things the firm offers. This idea is often misunderstood because people think an amusement park is just for fun, or for kids, or about a whacky person dressed up as a cartoon character. Think about this though\u2026 There is, what could be called an amusement park, in Las Vegas (I think.) that allows people to use giant earth moving equipment like excavators or bulldozers, and it\u2019s not just for kids. Adults go there because those things can be a ton of fun, and it\u2019s like playing with Tonka toys as an adult! In most cases there is a group of people for whom your product, or the segment you operate in, is great fun. They\u2019re not just there to buy a t-shirt\u2026 That\u2019s why Carhartt does so well with their premium product, because the clothing is a lifestyle investment, and people who wear those clothes are signaling that their part of the same team. The same is true of sports paraphernalia, cars, golf clubs, premium branded clothing, consumer electronics\u2026 I mean, think about how vehemently Apple \u201cpeople\u201d love those products, and Apple serves up their own little amusement park in the form of Apple stores where those people can go to be embraced by their team, their culture, their family. You can\u2019t just walk into an Apple store and see an expert\u2026 No, you have to make an appointment to see one of their \u201cGeniuses\u201d at the \u201cGenius Bar.\u201d During your time with the \u201cGenius\u201d you\u2019re special, and to them, you\u2019re the only one in the whole world. They are totally devoted to you, and they know your name, and you know their\u2019s, and together you coproduce an experience were you solve the problem. When you leave you have a photograph in your mind of the experience and a memory has been created. THAT\u2019S experience generation, and it\u2019s how it\u2019s done right. So, in short, make your business a place people go to revel in the product or service you provide, where you signal to them that they are part of the club, and that by being so, they are unique. Build relationships with them, and create an environment that is inviting and suggestive of a community of like minded people. ",

Face to Face meeting Every time an automated message is sent out on your behalf to the customer, that communication is faceless digital communication. It\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s not human. It doesn\u2019t help people feel, seen, and heard. So we need to get face-to-face more often. Even in this period of physical distancing, we can have face-to-face meetings because it provides us clearer communication. It\u2019s richer than text and images because it has an emotion tone, pace face voice personality ad it helps to build human connection. Micro Conversation Yes, I\u2019ll reply to your email. Yes, I\u2019ll return your phone call. Yes, I\u2019ll click through and fill out this survey. Yes, I will do you that favor. Yes, I will make that introduction. Yes, I will share my thoughts and opinions with you. These are all the micro yeses that we need to get which constitute our success. Video relationship When he talks about video as a medium, he does not just talk about live synchronous video. We\u2019re all over the world right now, but we all had to be here. There\u2019s something through which all of us can participate starting today and he calls it movement relationships through video. Those are conversational and unscripted video messages that we record with our webcam or our smartphone and send to one or more other people at our convenience. So in this way, it overcomes distance. You have opportunities across the entire customer lifecycle and across the entire employee lifecycle to benefit from this style of communication. ",

To grasp what the customer desires, a company has to analyze customer data gathered from customer interactions and other sources. First, second and third party data should all be collected, processed, and matched to produce a singular view of your customer. Unifying these huge volumes of data can take time. This is why many companies offer analytics services. Data analytics takes care of cleaning and aggregating data, with aim of transforming raw data into actionable data. Providing a unique experience should be top priority for companies. If you need help figuring out how to do that, then ask Tenfold for help.

It just takes is all the efforts to make it a success. Greeting your customers well always is a good start. Sending them gifts occasionally is one of the great ideas you could opt for to build a good customer relationship. But knowing what way would be the best is equally important. Lets say for a hospital it is very important to have nurse name badges to create a good relation with the patients and the visitors too. Patients would feel like home, isn\u2019t it? So, that was just an example! Customer experience varies from one industry to other. Just the right effort should be kept in! ",
