            "answer_text": "There are 2 ways you can store ebooks on the Kindle app. One is default Cloud storage associated with your Kindle Account and other is the Offline storage. For offline storage, it depends upon the device on which you are using the app because generally after purchasing, an ebook on Kindle app is downloaded on your phone before reading. Suppose your smartphone or tab have 4 Gb of free space left and each ebook holds 4mb of space then you can store upto 100 ebooks on your device and if you want to store more books, then you can do so by creating more space on your phone by deleting useless files or old books you\u2019ve already read. For online storage, there\u2019s also a cloud service associated with the app and your account which means the all your purchased books and magazines are by default saved in your online Kindle account which you can access your books on more than one devices at the same time by signing into Kindle account . So theoretically a Kindle app can store unlimited ebooks on their cloud service but practically it depends upon the device\u2019s memory that how many books can be stored offline. ",

            "answer_text": "It will depend on the size of the eBooks, as comic books are orders of magnitude bigger than plain text books (5MB for an eBook vs 25MB for comic is not unusual, with some reaching 250MB+ in size, wow).  In any case, the usual propaganda of \"it can hold thousands of eBooks\" has always seemed ridiculous to me; why would I want to store thousands of eBooks on a device where it is so uncomfortable looking for them? I very much prefer to have my whole library on a Cloud location, where I can look for specific stuff, annotate and select my next readings with ease, then sync with my eReader (Kindle or any other) just the eBooks I plan to read in the coming days/weeks, or I need to consult for some work I'm doing. In case you're interested, I'm founder of a startup which does precisely that: http://nimbooks.com :-) ",
