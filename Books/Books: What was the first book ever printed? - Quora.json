Nowadays we hear about different types of printing, and hear about books printed years before Gutenberg invented the printing press in Europe in the 15th century.  On the other hand, here\u2019s something that is far earlier than that. Above is the front of the Diamond Sutra. An early copy has a print date of May 11, 868. It\u2019s completely intact. Note that it\u2019s an actual printed book, not hand copied or written. It also says in the dedication that it\u2019s for universal free distribution. ",
