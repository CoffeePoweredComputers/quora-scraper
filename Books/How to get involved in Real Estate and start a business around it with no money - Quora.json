            "answer_text": " Learning how to make money in real estate is a difficult task, let alone with no seed money to start with. I wont sugar coat it - not having a lot of money will make your journey more difficult. ...but not impossible. Far from it. I know because I had to climb up the success ladder from the bottom rung. I worked my butt off, put in a ton of sweat equity, and I learned how to make serious money in real estate. But I got cocky. I thought I had figured real estate out. I made a huge investment in a housing project I didn't fully understand, and I ended up losing everything. I had to start all over again right back at the bottom rung. I realized that my success was directly attributed to the power of hustle, not the power of my bank account.I've climbed that ladder once more, but this time, I wont forget that incredibly important lesson. If you take massive action, push forward, and you never give up, you won't need a penny more to make it in this business. Without further ado: 4 Ways You Can Start A Real Estate Business With No Money Out Of Your Pocket. 1. Create a Lead Generation Business The backbone of any real estate business is lead generation. It doesn't matter if you're a Realtor, a house flipper, or a mortgage broker, you need a constant stream of leads to create new business. Most real estate professionals struggle with lead generation. Here's an example: According to the National Association of Realtors 2017 Annual Report,the average Realtor completes 11 transaction annually. The average transactions among the top 1,000 Realtors in the county is 190, with the top three averaging 1,500 transactions. That's an enormous difference. So why do the top agents get the majority of the business? Because they're excellent at generating leads. So where do you fit in? Create a lead generation business and links motivated sellers and agents together. If don't have a lot of money to start with, emulating a business model like Bold Leads or Market Leader isn't going to work. They have massive online advertising campaigns to find leads from all over the country. But you can beat them at the local level. This is how I would start a lead generation business if I didn\u2019t have money to invest.  1. Find Agent-Clients FIRST Make sure you find a market to sell to before sourcing the product. Find agents on Zillow, Redfin, etc. and call them up. Ask them if they'd be interested in more leads. Create a database of at least 100 agents interested in buying leads from you.  2. Find Motivated Sellers Since you're on a tight budget, handwriting notes or cold calling are your best bets. Go to Zillow and find the areas with the most activity. You can get address and phone info from Batch Skip Trace.  3. Sell Leads to Agent-Clients Once you've collected leads, broadcast to your agent-client list. Sell the leads exclusively, otherwise they won't have value. Depending on your location and the lead quality, you can expect $20-$50 per lead. Build a foundation based on integrity and trust. You need to be honest with your prospects and you need to offer high quality leads to your agent-clients. If you violate either tenant, you're business will fail. If you use unethical practices, you may also land in legal trouble. *You MUST do your own due diligence on local real estate rules and regulation. Consult with an attorney before starting a lead generation business. 2. Intern For A Power Real Estate Agent Every market has a few dominant agents that do a disproportionate amount of business. As a result, they are overwhelmed with clients, listings, marketing, eduction requirements, and innumerable other task pulling them apart. Find the power agents in your market and call them up. Explain your interest in real estate and see if they'd take on an intern. Offer to put out signs for open houses, make photo copies, get coffee, whatever it takes to join the team.  Make coffee, put up open house signs, make photocopies, whatever you need to do... In exchange, ask if the Power Agent would sponsor you to get your real estate license. Don't make your internship conditional on this request, just ask if they'd consider it. Most will say yes, provided you hustle and are a benefit to their business. Once you get your license, you may be able to say on their team as a buyer-specialist or listing-specialist, or you can strike out on your own. Either way, learn what it takes to be a successful agent and adopt it for yourself. 3. Partner With A Real Estate Investor This is how I got into real estate development. It was 2010, two years after I started in real estate, and I was struggling hard. We were in the teeth of the Great Recession and the housing market was on life support. I decided to make one last ditch effort at real estate before throwing in the towel. I found a potential deal (it was a total dog, in retrospect) and called around to hard money lenders to see if I could get financing. One of the hard money lenders recommended I talk to his friend, a successful real estate investor in Washington D.C. I agreed, and it turned out to be a huge turning point in my life. The investor agreed to let me work with him. I did project summaries, pro formas, fetched permits, took project photos, and a ton of other grunt work. I didn't earn a penny, but I learned the business and ultimately became independently wealthy from real estate investing. Where do you find real estate investors? REIA Meetings - Network with active investorsReal Estate Agents - Call the major agents in your market.Title Attorneys - They know every investor in town, but may not share that information freely. Keep in touch and build rapport.Search Zillow- Look for renovated houses and contact the listing agent. I searched Zillow and found this renovation. The photo and description tell us this house has been renovated. Contact the agent and see if the house was renovated by a professional investor. When get a few investor leads, call them up and see if you can take them out for coffee. Offer to do grunt work - believe me, they need the help and would love you for offering. When you get task, treat it with the utmost urgency, no matter how mundane. If the investor asks you to make photocopies by 5 p.m., do it by 4 p.m. If you are asked to take 20 photos, take 100. Go above and beyond on every task - I promise you it will pay massive dividends. While you're grinding away, start to add real value to the relationship by finding off market deals. Focus your search using free (or practically free) lists that contain motivated sellers. Examples are: Tax Delinquent- Cost: Free - Get from your town, city, or county.Code Violation- Cost: Free - Get from your town, city, or county.High Equity- Cost: Approx $.05/Lead - Get from Listsource.comUgly Houses- Cost: Whatever gas costs - Get by driving your neighborhood.Start to reach out to these prospects and generate leads. Once you have a hot deal, bring it to your investor and split the profit 50/50. Rinse and repeat until you have enough capital to start house flipping on your own. This is a great strategy if you're a real estate investing beginner. Learn the ropes without taking too much risk. It's how I got started in the business and it will work for you if you're willing to do what it takes. 4. Passive Investing: Crowdfunding & REITs If you're have a bit of money but not ready to start a full-fledged business, you can still make money in real estate by investing in crowdfunding companies or Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Crowdfunding Crowdfunding is an absolute phenomenon that allows anyone to invest. If you're a real estate investing beginner, want to become an investor but are too busy at work, or if you're not ready to dive into the business yourself, real estate crowdfunding is a perfect option. What is Crowdfunding? Crowdfunding is a method of raising capital from the public to fund a specific investment. Although this practice has been around for hundreds of years, crowdfunding is defined by small contributions made through an internet platform. Crowdfunding is divided into two categories: rewards and equity (this is a huge topic far too broad for this answer. We'll be focusing on equity crowdfunding, for the time being). Equity crowdfunding offers equity shares in a private company to the public, with initial investments amounts that are accessible to most people. Equity crowdfunding was adopted in the 2015 Jobs Act and shot off like a rocket. Popular Real Estate Equity Crowdfunding Platforms FundriseRealtySharesRealtyMogulMinnowCFundingHow Do I Make Money Investing With Real Estate Equity Crowdfunding?  Similar to investing in a publicly traded company, you make returns through dividends and the appreciation of the company. Fundrise, for example, combines dividend and appreciation totals and reports a 8.9-10.3% annualized return on investment Pros and Cons of Real Estate Crowdfunding Pros- Passive investing channel with strong annualized ROI and minimum investment requirements that are accessible to most people. Cons- Won't do much to progress your knowledge base if you're a real estate investing beginner. Not all real estate crowdfunding platforms are created equal, so make sure to do your due diligence. Crowdfunding has opened up real estate investing to the masses. It's a viable investment channel, but it's completely passive. You invest, collect your dividend, and watch your equity share appreciate. If your ultimate goal is to invest by house flipping, buy and hold investing, repositioning multifamily property, or any other active real estate investing strategy, equity crowdfunding won't help much in your journey. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) Another way to make money in real estate is to invest in real estate investment trusts (REITS). REITs are publicly traded companies that acquire real estate and manage for cashflow. They enjoy a special tax designation that bypasses corporate tax rates, but in return, they must pay 90% of net income to their investors as a dividend.  REIT Basics REITs differ from real estate crowdfunding in a few key ways: They're publicly traded companies and are effected by stock market fluctuations that have nothing to do with their own business fundamentals.REITS buy and hold properties for cash flow. Crowdfunding companies include fix-and-flip projects in their portfolios.Significant capital at their disposal, allowing them to invest in Class A projects.Since REITs are publicly traded, its a good idea to get familiar with the basics of stock market investing. Focus on REITs that have stable and diversified portfolios, as these companies are more insulated to market vicissitudes. After you find a few candidates, examine their balance sheets and make sure they're not overloaded with debt. If they have a lot of debt, they may have difficulty making interest payments and puts your dividend at risk. Lastly, examine the REIT's dividend payment history. Are they consistent with their distributions? Does the dividend grow over time? A spotty dividend history is a red flag, and more research is required. Disclaimer - Please do your own due diligence and consult with your financial advisor. Conclusion Real estate investing is a wonderful way to build wealth and is totally accessible to everyone. Making money in real estate is not easy, particularly if you're starting small. But you're success is 100% predicated on your ability to work hard and take massive action. Having a lot of money helps, but is NOT a prerequisite. Remember - you can't skip steps in this business and you CAN'T BUY SUCCESS. If you're willing to build sweat equity, stay focused, and never quit, you will smash any goal you have set for yourself. Just pick a path and get to work! Hope this was helpful! -Neil P.S.

            "answer_text": "One of the most popular questions that I get from my students is \u201cHow to start real estate investing with no money?\u201d So here I am going to discuss one strategy that we employ to find that elusive question of initial funding: Owner Financing. Also read: How You Can Use Creative Financing to Create Wealth | Jake & Gino Owner financing is confusing to many newbie investors, as well as seasoned investors. It is referred to by other names, such as seller financing, holding paper and private money mortgage. Owner financing is simply a loan provided by the seller to the buyer. Buyers use this to assist in the financing of their deal, and agree to make installment payments usually on a monthly basis over a specified time frame until the loan is repaid. Let me give you an example. In our first deal, we had no credibility and even less money, but we located a property that had potential. The property was listed for $750,000, but had been listed on Loopnet for over two years. We approached the seller and asked if she was willing to hold paper as pat of the down payment. We agreed on a $600,000 sales price, with 10% cash down from us, 10% seller financing and 80% bank financing. There are several factors that are needed in a deal to be able to utilize this strategy. You need a motivated seller. We had one, a couple that was burned out and ready to retire.You need a broker who understands owner financing and can convince the seller to consider it. I would use the word educate rather than convince because there are benefits to the seller.You need the participation of a bank who is willing to lend money on a deal with owner financing. Our deal met all of these conditions, and we closed on the deal.We were able to control an asset that was valued by the bank at $600,000 with only approximately $80,000 out of our own pockets. This is one of the main reasons why owner financing leads to achieving massive wealth. Most successful real estate investors have heard of the term OPM, (other people\u2019s money) and by being able to control the most amount of properties with the least amount of money leads to an explosion in wealth creation. One note: Leverage works in the other direction. If your investments begin to falter, then your losses will also compound. Fast-forward three years. We have just refinanced this first deal. The bank appraised the property for $800,000, and we were able to distribute $180,000 to ourselves. The power of leverage allowed us to purchase a property with $80,000 of our own money, and with excellent management, we were able to increase the value of the asset and recoup our initial investment. Our rate of return going forward on this investment is infinite, and that is the goal with all of our investments. What happened to the note with the seller? We decided to offer the seller $10,000 if she would extend the note an additional five years. She agreed, and the length of the term of the note was now eight years. ",

How To Invest in Real Estate With No Money The first thing to do before investing is to evaluate your financial situation. Why are you going to invest in real estate with no money? Should you do so? Have you explored all options? If investing with no money is suits you, these are great strategies for investing without spending any money at all. 1. Trading Trading possessions is one way for buying investment properties with money. This could be another property or another asset such as a car. You could also try purchasing a property in exchange for work. For example, a contractor can offer labor to a real estate developer in exchange for a down payment. For investments, it makes more sense to exchange an asset other than a property to obtain a new investment property. Be sure to write up a legal document including the value of both assets. 2. Wholesaling Wholesaling does not require money but does require networking. A wholesaler finds a seller whose property has not yet gone on the market,and then finds a buyer, and takes a cut of the selling price. Wholesaling is great for those who don\u2019t have assets or money, but it will require building relationships and commitment. How To Invest In Real Estate With Little Money (No Money Down) The more money you have to invest, the easier. These options include spending money over a longer period of time. 1. Lease With Option of Buying This strategy is also referred to as \u201crent to own\u201d or \u201clease-purchase.\u201d This means you would make payments just like with an ordinary lease and payments go toward buying investment properties. The agreement includes a time frame in which the tenant has to buy the property for a specific price. During the time period, the owner or investor cannot sell the property to anyone else. If going with this strategy, make sure to agree on a final price in a legal document. 2. Flexible Sellers Some sellers, turnkey providers, who have move-in ready properties will sell to investors for as little as 5% down. This is an effective way to invest in real estate with little money down and avoid putting more money for renovations. These sellers have high interest rates so it\u2019s important to calculate cash flow - including vacancies - ahead of time. 3. FHA Loan The FHA mortgage requires a down payment of only 3.5% and must be owner-occupied. If the property is flip, you can live it in it first, fix it up, and sell it. The 203K loan is combined with the FHA mortgage and lends renovation costs.. Another option is buying a multi-family property and living in one unit while renting out the other unit.

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll need a little bit of money but the general no capital strategies for real estate are: Bird dogging. This is where you work out an arrangement with another investment where you go find the property and get a referral fee when they buy the property. Most of the cash poor bird doggers find their deals by driving for dollars (driving around a target neighborhood) looking for homes that are in distress. Some things they look for are overgrown yards, roofs in bad shape, amongst other things. You still need money for gas though.Wholesaling. This is where you find the property, get the property under contract and then assign (transfer) your contract to another buyer for a fee. In this strategy you\u2019ll need some money for earnest money but you\u2019ll get that back when your end buyer buys your interest in the contract. Common ways people get capital for earnest money are balance transfer checks from their credit cards or savings. Wholesalers are generally marketing machines. They build lists of investors who will buy their properties all while trying to generate leads of motivated sellers. It takes a littleRaising money from others. This is generally how big commercial deals are done but I\u2019ve seen this done on a small scale with something as small as a single family house. You\u2019ll have a managing partner who finds and subsequently runs the deal and then raises money from others. The managing partner will take a fee and receive a piece of the project for running it while paying out a return to the money (general) partner.All this said, you either have money or time (or some combination of both). Even as someone who has been doing this for nearly a decade, I still use these strategies. Sometimes you have a deal and no dollars while other times you have dollars and no deals. These are ways to make all that align to make magic happen. ",

            "answer_text": "There are ways to purchase properties with no money down, but that will be hard to do with no experience.  Most of these strategies require a partner or private investor that has no reason to invest with you if you can't show experience or results.  So you will probably need to start with something like wholesaling.  Since I first answered this I've worked with and bought properties from wholesalers and they are a great resource to investors.  It's also a great way to get started in Real Estate because you don't need money to get started.  You help people that want to sell find people that want to buy.  It's hard work and not the passive investment that many RE investors are looking for, but it's a great place to start and you may enjoy it!  There are some great resources online for learning how to get started in wholesaling, but I would say this is your best bet.  Try attending a local Real Estate Investors Association meeting and get to know some of the folks there. Find out what kind of deals they are looking for and then go out and find it. This could mean knocking on some doors or writing letters to some current owners to see if they're interested in selling. Most will say no, but one will say yes. Now you have a deal and at the right price there's always a buyer. Tack on an assignment fee as your profit from the deal and now you're on your way! ",

            "answer_text": "There are some low and no money down strategies promoted, often by gurus and self styled experts, that sell quite widely, often through late night infomercials. Some may have mixed results and high costs as one might see through complaints lodged with various agencies.  Many zero money down strategies may not be prudent and rely on situations and circumstances that may be more rare in your market (like seller/creative financing, partners willing to add capital, lease options, etc).  Provided we avoid some of those strategies, your best bet is to save for a more traditional down payment. However, keep in mind this could be quire reasonable in the U.S. (see programs like USDA, FHA, VA, if applicable, etc). So for 3.5-10%, even less for VA, you could be a new first time home owner, for example.  Now, you could get creative with a first home purchase and target as your first home a 2-4 unit multiplex (1-4 unit properties are considered residential).  And there for just a down payment you are a real estate investor. Learn along the way and and try to repeat the process in a few years.  This is an example of a simple method without a lot of money down and is more practical than those aggressively marketed zero down seminars. Best of luck. ",

I had some stocks that I was earning reinvested dividends from the late 70\u2019s. I sold some of my stocks and bought more property while investing in both. Later on in my real estate investing, I started buying real estate with OPM(other people\u2019s money) when I had many properties bought and paid for and earning cash flow from. I grew up in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania and attended Fox Chapel High School. I graduated in 1983. During that era, kids worked. I had a paper route when I was thirteen, started buying stocks at 14\u201315, and operated many small time businesses by the time I graduated high school. You can buy real estate with no money. It is easier to own first(I mention this in my book). You must learn how to find deals, what makes a good deal, and have capital(somebody else\u2019s) to help you close it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways to do so. One way is to use a private lender who will finance 100% of the purchase and closing costs. I would do this with a multi family 4 plex or more. Make sure you have 100% occupancy and cash flow that exceeds the amount of expenses and mortgage etc. Go to the credit union and do a refi cash out. Pay the private lender off. Continue letting the rents pay for all the properties expenses and mortgage. Another way is to use the NACA mortgage program. Purchase a 4 plex and live in one unit rent out 3 units. Use 75% of the gross rental income from those 3 units to help qualify . There are some up front costs but small enough that you could borrow or pay yourself. No down payment no closing costs If you can cover from the 3 units rents it ends up free. Restrictions apply do your due diligence. Borrow a down payment then make your purchase. refi cash out and take your down payment back. Now you have capitol to continue this process. If you have enough equity when you refi you may be able to pay whomever you borrowed the down payment from or if they are patient continue letting the rents pay it. You have to secure funds from somewhere. Private lenders make good returns lending their funds. You wont see any money. They pay it straight to the title company and take first lien position. It is asset based and they put you on title. Default and they foreclose and sell the property to get money back ",

That really leaves you with one option, and that is to become an agent. When you represent a buyer or seller in a real estate transaction you really don\u2019t need much money at all. But you must get your real estate license in the state that you live in. There will be a cost here. How much will depend on the state you are looking to get licensed in. Once you do have your license they you could start representing your friends, family, and colleagues in home sales and purchases. Of course starting a business and making money in a business are two different things. apartment locator There is something else you can do depending on which state you live in. Big states like Texas and Atlanta have a huge number of apartments. You could start out as an apartment locator. Here is an example of a business Apartments for Rent in Houston, TX [See the Latest Rentals]. Here is how it works. The renter lists the company name on their application. Then when they move in the apartment pays the agent or you a fee for doing so. Its super easy to start up and doesn't take much money. You need a phone and a computer. ",

Real estate investment has become a popular way for people to make money and it is not uncommon to buy a house or land without any intention of living there. Many people are clamoring to invest, but with moderate incomes or a lot of expense, just haven\u2019t been able to save much cash. Although I do recommend having some money in reserve at all times, it is absolutely possible to get started without a lot of savings. Some people simply buy and hold property, waiting for it to appreciate in value before re-selling it. Having cash for a down payment is the quick and easy way to enter the real estate market, but it's not your only option. Many people have found ways to start investing in real estate with little or no money of their own. Options include borrowing money as well as a number of more unusual and creative paths to ownership. ",

Last I was told, only 10% to 20% of those getting their license do it as a career move. the others do it for the knowledge and investment opportunities.  Another way is to bring in friends and family and start an investment group. You can secure their position by having them on title and making them part of the LLC.  Each property should be owned by a single purpose LLC which limits the liability to that property only. ",

I never have to own the land so there is less risk for me and I share the development profit with the land owner to encourage them to participate. Win - win! I\u2019ve answered a few question like yours before so if you search my answers you will find some info that will help. If you found this answer helpful, please Upvote it. Thank you. ",
