            "answer_text": "You have a few questions in this, so let me try to answer each\u2026 What age for a kid\u2019s ebook? If you\u2019re talking under 7 years old, keep in mind that those kid books have pictures, which means you need to hire an illustrator. Young children don\u2019t have Kindles or e-readers, not until they are older.Whether you write a kids book or a book for adults and you self publish, you will need to hire a graphics designer to do your book cover for you. There are people who don\u2019t do this, but their amateurish and ugly covers hurt their sales. It\u2019s best to hire a professional to do a really great cover.With self published books on Amazon priced between 2.99 - 9.99, you keep 70% of the profit and Amazon keeps 30%. If you price less than 2.99, you keep 35% and Amazon keeps 65%, and the same for prices over 9.99.To really make money on ebooks you need to keep writing and putting out more ebooks. One book will not let you quit your job or retire. If you really want to do kids books, I\u2019d recommend some sort of series and that way readers are more likely to buy the next book, hence making you more money.Hope that helps but let me know if you have any other questions. I also do lots of writing & tips on my website, How To Self-Publish Your Novel Thx, Elaine ",

            "answer_text": "You can make 70% royalties on a self-published e-book on Amazon. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is\u2026 it\u2019s more difficult to market and sell e-books for kids than it is for adults. Your target market is the children, but they don\u2019t have credit cards. So, you have to somehow appeal to both the kids and their parents. That\u2019s been my challenge with marketing my self-published middle-grade book, \u201cThe Mirror of Doom\u201d (by Bailey Baxter, my pen name). I even looked for help from professional book promoters online, but they won\u2019t touch a children\u2019s book. Too hard to promote, they said. (No kidding!) Plus, with children\u2019s books, you need to hire someone to design the cover and draw the illustrations \u2014 which drives the costs up. And, you may even need to bring on a professional formatter to turn your manuscript into a Kindle e-book, because the illustrations make things so complicated. May I make a suggestion? Write an e-book for adults. Then, you only have to worry about hiring a cover designer \u2014 and you can find one affordably on Fiverr. And promoting your book will be so much easier. ",

            "answer_text": "Children e-books do need pictures and illustrations. If you are not particularly good at producing such, you do need to hire an illustrator or consult a graphic designer. Graphics are a big part of children literature. How much you make depends on your pricing point. For example, my price point is $2.99 and I get 65% while Amazon takes 35%. Lower price points give you a smaller cut, I am a bit hazy about it because I have never priced my books below $2.99 but if I remember correctly it is 30% for you, 70% for Amazon. You might want to do further research as publishing children e-book is a bit different compared to publishing fiction aka mostly text-only literature. You need to know what kind of children books are selling; what is the best length (how many pages), what kind of illustration that sells, what are the popular topics etc. ",

            "answer_text": "First and foremost, you have to have a great product for people to buy it. Be very cautious of offers which promise you everything but can\u2019t really back up their promises. You have to treat your publishing as a business. You have to look at cost benefit analysis and return on investment. So if your book is $2.99 and you get - for ease of math - $2 per book sold. If you spend $100 on advertising on social media or Amazon, you have to then sell 50 books to break even. Start small. Start small and try something for 30 - 90 days. If you see an increase in sales, put more money into it. If you don\u2019t, then try something different. ",
