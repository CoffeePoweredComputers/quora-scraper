            "answer_text": "Broadly speaking yes. But there are major factors you need to consider. Have you developed your manuscript to the best of your ability? The more work you have put in, the less work an editor needs to do and the less you have to pay. Have you written and re-written this book a number of times? Have you had beta readers give you their opinion? If not then doing a how\u2019s my driving initially might be the better plan. What kind of edit do you need? How\u2019s my Driving: A quick and relatively cheap look at the first 10,000 words which gives you an indication of how near or far you are from a publishable standard.Development edit: An in depth look at the entire manuscript to catch weaknesses within the structure and writing.Copy edit: A forensic examination of grammar, spelling, punctuation and sentence structure.Have you done your due diligence? While a good editor deserves to be paid at professional rates, there are sharks in the water. Some Vanity Presses whose business model has been compromised by e-books now offer \u2018editorial services\u2019 which are total scams designed to milk you of money. If the editor you are considering has any ties whatsoever to a vanity press, drop them like a stone. In addition you should choose an editor who has experience in your genre of writing. While in theory a Literary editor should be able to edit a fantasy book and vice versa, in reality they will bring their bias with them and you also want to be able to pick their brains about your area of writing. You also might with all the best will in the world simply have bad chemistry with an editor and you need to understand in advance the terms and conditions of your contract with them so it can be amicably dissolved if necessary. How do you do due diligence on an Editor? The good news is that there are a ton of excellent editors out there, but they are probably not on fiver.I would start with checking who edited books you admire in the area of your writing and checking if they do freelance work.Feel free to ask for references and make sure that you follow those references up.Check if they have featured on Writers Beware.

            "answer_text": "OK, quick question. You\u2019ve decided to enter into a professional business where your work will be judged harshly against that of people who\u2019ve been doing it successfully for years. You ever have a nightmare where you end up on stage naked? Your editor is your (paid) get-a-grip friend who will impartially inspect you before you step out there so you won\u2019t have a book-costume that falls apart on you. Invest in your excellence. I recognize there\u2019s privilege embedded in that, but you may be able to at least find other authors willing to trade edits at first. Just take it seriously. ",
