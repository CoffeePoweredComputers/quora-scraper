Of those, so far, The Future Rhymes is also available in hard copy. To date Amazon has not charged me a single dime but has from time to time made direct deposits of royalties to my bank account. The only expense involved in self-publishing on Amazon is the time it takes to learn how to do it from the free downloaded instructions they provide. As for marketing your book once it is published, that is another story entirely and I can provide no helpful advice on that front, but Amazon does have some programs you can look into and those will be pay-for-play.

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \u2018expensive\u2019.Let\u2019s talk about how you get your book out there - you need a cover, editing and formatting. Depending on your skills, you can do your own cover and formatting, and very rarely, editing, but ideally, you should hire that out, and you should hire anything that you don\u2019t feel confident matching professional books at the level of quality. A good cover can cost from $-$$$ and can range from pre-made to custom. Some people swear by marketplaces, others deal with designers.Editing, again, runs the gamut in prices.Formatting is actually usually fairly cheap, if you are going in with a clean document (which you should if you\u2019ve edited etc.), and can be created quite easily. That can usually cost the lower end of the cost of a cover. So if you\u2019re factoring that into the question, then it costs more than if you\u2019ve done all that, it\u2019s not part of the question and you mean the actual upload to Amazon etc. which is free. Paperbacks can be gotten at a reduced price too for events etc.KDP (ebook)/Kindle is an option for eBooks of course. Kai ",
