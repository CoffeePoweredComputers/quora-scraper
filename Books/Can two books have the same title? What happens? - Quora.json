            "answer_text": "Yes. It is possible (and quite common) for two or more books to share the same title. It is best to avoid this situation unless you are positive that there won't be any confusion between the two titles. (Perhaps one title is very old and out of print; or the the two books are on radically different topics.) If the two books are on the same topic and are both in print at the same time, confusion may occur, leading to frustration for everyone involved in the book publishing process, including the potential book buyer. The only time when it is not possible to re-use the title of an existing book is if that title contains a trademark. Note: It becomes possible to register a trademark related to a series of books once two or more of the books in that series have been published. For example, I was able to register the trademark THE MOTHER OF ALL for the various books in my pregnancy and parenting series once first two titles, The Mother of All Pregnancy Books and The Mother of All Baby Books, had been published. I could not have attempted to trademark the books if I had only written a single title.

The plot revolves around a man with a genetic disorder which causes him to time travel frequently causing his wife to deal with his disappearances. That was all I knew about this book. I searched for this book on Scribd and began reading it. I finished it within 100 minutes. I wished that I could bash my head against the wall for it was the most terrible piece of writing in a long time. It was later I realized that I had been reading an entirely different novel of the same name.  This had been the book I read. Answering your question, it is definitely possible for two different books to have the same title. This book presumably try to trick people like me into reading it. Also, lesson learnt. Never read a book before verifying the name of the author. ",
