            "answer_text": "It depends on how you are defining \u201cregularly\u201d, but we can say if you are reading each day on average you can complete at least one book each week, which is around 50 per year, it means 1000 per 20 years. Reading is a wonderful habit, but I think it better to forget about the count of the books you can read, instead focus on why you are reading, for example if it is a novell just try to enjoy it, if it is a non fiction try to get something out of it.
