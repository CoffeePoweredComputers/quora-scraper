            "answer_text": "In most cases\u2026 Yes.But you need to check some things out to see if its practical. Is it in a flood plain? If yes, don\u2019t build there.Is the soil stable enough to support the house?How far will the power company need to run the wire? You have to pay for that and the cost of the poles or the digging if its underground.How about water access? You do not want to have to pay for water to be trucked in.Can it pass a perk test for septic or is there sewer service available? You do not want to have to have a holding tank pumped every month. And more\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Technically yes. But if you have other options then I'd suggest proceeding with those. In the US you might have to deal with zoning laws, which requires you to appeal the land\u2019s classification before the county. Not only that, you might be buying prime land. This is land used to grow crops and make money, therefore it's inherently more expensive than non-agricultural land. You might be better off buying pasture land instead. ",
