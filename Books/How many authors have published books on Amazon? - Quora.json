            "answer_text": "Literally millions of authors have published on Amazon. I long ago stopped looking up the figure, back when there were more than 9 million books on Amazon. The majority of those books were one-time or first-time authors, I believe. There was an article in Omni Magazine back in the 80s. It was a humorous opinion piece about a fictitious company that published unpublished and unpublishable manuscripts. This, of course, was prior to the internet. It was a wonderful piece, but it rankled me somewhat. You see, I was one of those unpublished writers who submitted manuscripts that went directly to the \u201cslush pile\u201d they were referring to in the article. And now, boom, here\u2019s Amazon, doing that very thing.  ",
