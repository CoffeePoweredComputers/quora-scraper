            "answer_text": "We read literature through the lens of our own experience. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve never bought into the lists of the greatest books of all time. Whose list is that anyway? Yes, public popularity may play a role in that decision, but when it is all said and done, that is some individual\u2019s list of favorites. I say, make your own list and stand by it because that is a \u201cbest of\u201d that will always be meaningful to you. And when it comes to literature, whose opinion really matters but yours? ",
