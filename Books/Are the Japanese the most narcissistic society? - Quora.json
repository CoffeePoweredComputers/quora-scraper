            "answer_text": "No less an authority than Wikipedia would tell us that narcissism is \u201cthe pursuit of gratification from vanity or egotistic admiration of one's own attributes.\u201d So we\u2019re concerned here with whether the Japanese are vain or self-centered in the way they prize their own national qualities or character, and whether or not they pursue gratification from these less-than-realistic attitudes. Clearly, Mr Hattori Takeshi (in the linked article above) is narcissistic. So is he representative of Japan? Every country takes pride in its own achievements, and every government has a stake in promoting this pride. Can you imagine watching the evening news in country X, and hearing a national leader express shame, regret or opposition to everything that was reported for that broadcast? So there\u2019s a bit of vanity, at least some admiration of one\u2019s own country, no matter where you find yourself. Whether this is realistic or not depends on how far you accept the opinions of others in that country about the quality and quantity of those achievements. When we drop postage stamp countries like Luxembourg and San Marino, Japan\u2019s GDP per capita is among the 20 best in the world, and this without significant energy or mineral resources. Like Scandinavia, Japan has built a national economy based on adding value to its people, and there\u2019s much to be admired for that reason. Much of that building happened before WWII, otherwise there would never have been any collision with other colonial powers. So at least some of Mr Hattori\u2019s comments are not anachronistic. But does Japan go overboard in its own self-estimation? Overall economic performance regularly places Japan on par with Germany, Canada, the U.K., Italy and France- no one can argue can these results. And if you agree with some talking heads, that this Japan is at the end of a decade or two of an economic \u201cslump,\u201d you only reinforce the Japanese\u2019 own reason for pride in their national standings. We could go through other categories of national achievements since WWII: sports, art, literature, Nobel Prizes and other international awards, music, and so on, but the results will be the same. Japan compares extremely well with many countries, sometimes near the top. So unrealistic gratification from overestimating its own accomplishments is no more found in Japan than in any other country. You can debate whether narcissism in Japan is isolated or pervasive, passive aggressive or openly expressed. But you cannot debate whether Japan has the most narcissistic society in the world, not when many countries have reason to envy Japan\u2019s national record. ",

            "answer_text": "No, that\u2019s England. There\u2019s a difference. Japanese in general don\u2019t see themselves as a great world power. They see themselves as a uniquely unique and special place that is fundamentally different (read better) than other countries. In contrast, the English think they are a great, no, THE greatest world dominant superpower that together with their American \u2018\u2019allies\u2019\u2019 control the planet. Their delusionism is so abysmal, that even Angela Merkel, the leader of Germany said that quote: \u2018\u2019Some English politicians live on a parallel universe\u2019\u2019. I\u2019m not going to go into details, but if you look at what many English politicians, including members of their media says, you\u2019re not going to believe these people are actually for real. Probably one of my favorite characters is Daniel Hannan who wrote a book claiming Britain invented \u2018\u2019Freedom\u2019\u2019. Another character is Boris Johnson who said that, quote: \u2018\u2019Our foreign policy is to have our cake and eat it too\u2019\u2019. In reality, anyone who doesn\u2019t have a cabbage for a brain would see that England is just an American \u30dd\u30c1 with a massive, ultra massive superiority complex who have came to the painful realization that the only way for them to remain remotely relevant on the world stage is to glue themselves to America and pretend they are a \u2018\u2019team\u2019\u2019.  The truth is that everyone wants their country to be \u2018\u2019special\u2019\u2019, but at the same time, most educated people realize that their country is not special, but some people just refuse to succumb to reality, and take their delusions to a whole another level. It\u2019s called delusions of grandeur, there\u2019s no known cure for that. ",

Been here 18 years and they are very friendly and good people, but they do have a deep pride and arrogance for some things. But do you blame them, many countries have that in some way or another. I don\u2019t like when humans are like that, but we seem to be like that by nature, especially cause once we lose that we nothing to cling to. But because the Japanese are passive aggressive, it makes it a lot more easy to deal with as you can just ignore it and live your life in peace ;) Where as in some countries that are aggressive they will put their stuff right in your face..and I dont like that at all.

Some people love Japan, and they will tell you how everything from the water to manners are just better in Japan. They sometimes have really interesting reasons. The way the water gets filtered through the ground, for example, means that water in Japan is more pure. There are others who are a bit down on Japan. The are apologetic about Japan\u2019s role in WWII, the stagnant economy, and how crowded it is in Japan. The majority of Japanese have no opinion. ",
