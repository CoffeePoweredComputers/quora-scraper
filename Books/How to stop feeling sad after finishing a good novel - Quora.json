You\u2019ll sit forever, gluing things together, Cooking up a stew from other\u2019s scraps, Blowing on a miserable fire, Made from your heap of dying ash. Let apes and children praise your art, If their admiration\u2019s to your taste, But you\u2019ll never speak from heart to heart, Unless it rises up from your heart\u2019s space.\u201d \u2015 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Faust: First Part \"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.\" -- Dr. Seuss ",
