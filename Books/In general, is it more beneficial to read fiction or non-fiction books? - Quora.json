            "answer_text": "A2A In general, it's better to read whatever interests you, fiction or nonfiction doesn't matter as long as you get both in your library from time to time. In fiction, we still expand our knowledge. Vocabularies grow, pictures of what life was actually like during the time the author lived begin to form from that window the author left propped open for us to visit and today's fiction is tomorrow's fact. Asimov wrote about Palm Pilots 50 years before their creation, in detail and in fiction. Poe wrote about a way to hold oxygen for breathing where air doesn't exist. Scuba tank? 100 years before the scuba tank was invented. Fiction teaches us compassion, humanity, empathy and the importance of loving each other. Nonfiction helps us learn about real people and how they live/lived, which influences our lives in however we receive their choices or see how they reacted to situations. It teaches us about the mistakes of the past that we can avoid repeating. It lauds humanity's achievements around the world to give us mentors we admire and strive to emulate. It teaches us how to write fiction, govern, analyze, reason. Together, fiction and nonfiction grows our emotions and reasoning in a well balanced way that is necessary to functioning societies. Too much of one and not enough of another leads to fear, ignorance, chaos and unfounded hatred. That's how I see their importance anyway. Happy reading !! ",

            "answer_text": "It isn't, necessarily. That's like asking how a spanner is better than a screwdriver. They do different jobs. I have read wonderful fiction books, and wonderful non-fiction books, and I have read terrible examples of both, too. One thing you can say about fiction books in comparison to non-fiction books is that they are generally more focused on using well-written words to tell a compelling story\u2026 but for every example of that there are also examples of awful novels - hack-jobs, clich\u00e9d celebrity ghostwritten novels, experimental novels where the experiment failed badly - and there are examples of non-fiction where the words and the story are every bit as strong as the best fictional books - Richard Feynman's memoirs, for example, or William Dalrymple's White Mughals, or Donald Thomas's Cochrane (about the real historical person on whom CS Forrester based Hornblower - except that Forrester felt that Cochrane's exploits were too outrageous to be plausible as fiction and so toned them down). I'd count all of the above among my favourite books, along with fiction such as Joseph Heller's Catch-22, Connie Willis's Doomsday Book, more or less anything by Terry Pratchett, Iain Banks (with or without the M) and Neil Gaiman, and plenty of books by other authors. But I don't see any value in drawing a distinction in quality between fiction and non-fiction just because they are fiction and non-fiction. Make your distinction based on the words inside them, because that's the only thing that ultimately matters. ",
