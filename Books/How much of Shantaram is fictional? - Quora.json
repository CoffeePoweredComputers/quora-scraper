            "answer_text": "While I was reading Greg Robert's description of the movie \"Panch Paapi\" starring Chunkey Pandey and Kimi Katkar, I thought of finding its authenticity. I immediately searched for the song on YouTube that he had described in the book. Voila! Within the first two minutes of the song, I spotted him sitting there smiling as Kimi Katkar danced around him. From that moment on, I realised his accounts hold true of the events he had written. Yet, I was curious to know more. Found his interview where he says events are real but characters are fictional.  To be honest, I found the events to be exaggerated a tad bit too much than real ones that he might have encountered. Also, I believe that the characters cannot be entirely fictional. Definitely inspired from everyone he met during his journey. Also, I want to know that who inspired him so much to create the character of Abdel Khader Khan? Karim Lala? The reason I mention Lala here is because the character sketch of Khaderbhai closely resembles with what has been written about Karim Lala in Dongri to Dubai.  ",
