            "answer_text": "Reading used to be my favorite way to learn. I have been reading since I was 3 years old, and I have never stopped.  [1] When ereaders first appeared, I swore I would never read a book in digital form! Then one day, I saw that my library had ebooks available-in fact they had a whole separate library. I dove in and have been reading this way since. I still take out physical books from the library and buy new and used books from stores and online. For a long time, I relied primarily on reading to learn things online. It is especially helpful to be able to access academic papers, because it is through academic papers that real research on a topic or subject begins. There are extremely strict protocols that must be followed in order to get an academic paper published. I usually start there when I want to take a deep dive into a subject. It used to be that access to academic papers was highly restricted, but I have noticed in the past several years that host websites are making these papers more accessible. Sometimes you still have to pay for the access. Academic papers always have a long list of references at the end of the document. The references are a great place to start to broaden your learning on the topic. Academia dot edu and Researchgate dot net are both sites where you can access academic papers for free. Here is a sample page from Academia. You can see where the arrow points to the full document, which is accessible for free, information on the author on the right with suggested further reading under it, and the ability to download the paper (I am sure there must be fees for this). Free access to academic papers are a game changer!  [2] Sometimes I start my research with Wikipedia for the same reason. Many people pan Wikipedia, but I find it to be a very valuable resource. Every Wikipedia entry must contain citations, so at the end of every page, there will be a list of sources under \u201cReferences and Notes\u201d like this:  and underneath that you can also sometimes find \u201cFurther Reading\u201d for more sources. You can click the link below to see the full page. [3] In addition, I am a fan of video tutorials on YouTube. I also rely on online classes. I have been able to access many interesting topics for free on Coursera. I just choose the audit option and I don\u2019t do the homework. There are many other options out there, include EdX that has classes from Harvard and MIT. There are paid sites too, like Skillshare and Coursehorse. Many people also teach their own courses on sites like Teachable and Thinkific, and many colleges universities offer courses online. As you can imagine, online learning has exploded since the onset of the coronavirus.  [4] More and more, I have come to rely on audio for my learning. I am constantly researching, and I find it really exhausting for me to read online for long stretches at a time. I have turned on the gray scale on all my devices, because I feel like the bright colors have contributed to my exhaustion. When I take out books from my online library, I always choose the audio version of the book if it is availableAudible is also an option, but I am not a member. I am going to sign up for a free trial through Amazon to see whether the membership ($9.99/month) would be worth it for me.More and more, I rely on podcasts for information. I can listen to them while doing other things, like my art, cleaning, going for a walk, or cooking.The same goes for videos like Ted Talks, where I don\u2019t have to watch them. I work on other things or go for a walk while I listen.I have to be very careful not to rely too much on headphones, because I know that constant headphone and earpiece use can be a problem as well.

            "answer_text": "Back in 2002, I did a distance education (back in those days when it was called distance education or remote learning and meant courses for people located in remote locations where it is hard for them to travel out) course in Journalism and Newswriting. I write my essays and I get direct and personal feedback from the instructor, which was great. It was fun, but there was no interaction with other students from anywhere. Recently I took a couple of courses on Coursera. One was a writing specialization in Personal Essay and Memoir writing. The specialization comprised of 4 modules, 4 weeks each. Grading was based on peer review. I started in May and finished it two weeks ago. I uploaded the certificate and was able to get two freelance writing jobs in 30mins! I then signed up for another course on art and identity, non-credited and no certificate because I just wanted to know about it. It turned out to be really fun as well. What I found most gratifying was the feedback from the other participants in the courses. It was so fun to read their feedback and to know what they think. The art module turned out to be even more fun because we spoke and shared feedback on a common platform other than on the assignments. I was surprised that I enjoyed that interaction. I would have liked to have some contact with the lecturers though. I like Coursera because it is pretty much like school. There are \u201clectures\u201d in the form of videos every week, readings and weekly assignments. I like the rigour and the structure. I take all the assignments very seriously and I enjoy doing them. I do not do well with podcasts because I have a tendency to tune out when there is noise of any sort, including music! But Coursera has transcripted every video and all I need to do is read! Yeay! A friend suggested I look at Udemy and I did, but the podcasts were not always transcripted and there was no structure. Bascially you just pay a price for the course, and do it at your own pace; unlike Coursera, which sends you notifications for assignments due, and you have to reset your deadlines if you miss an assignment. With Udemy, you could take years to finish one course and that does not complement my tendency to procrastinate well, haha. ",
