            "answer_text": "There will be a total of 10 books in The Stormlight Archive, split into two sets of 5 books. As of this writing, the first two books in the first set have been released (The Way of Kings in 2010 and Words of Radiance in 2014). The completion of Words of Radiance was delayed because Brandon Sanderson had to finish Wheel of Time. The third book in the series will contain Dalinar's flashbacks and should be published around Christmas 2016. Calamity Is Done! If Sanderson is able to publish one book every two years (which would be an incredible feat given the length and depth of each book and his other commitments) then we would have this schedule: 2010, Aug \u2014 1: Way of Kings2011201220132014, Mar \u2014 2: Words of Radiance20152016, Nov \u2014 2.5: Edgedancer2017, Nov \u2014 3: Oathbringer2018 \u2014 3.5: Wandersail, hopefully2019 \u2014 3.5: Wandersail, maybe2020 \u2014 4, maybe2021 \u2014 4, maybe20222023 \u2014 5, optimistically202420252026 \u2014 6, optimistically202720282029 \u2014 7, optimistically203020312032 \u2014 8, optimistically203320342035 \u2014 9, optimistically203620372038 \u2014 10, optimistically 28 years is a long time to wait, but it's a rich and wonderful world he's building, and there will be lots of other Cosmere novels and novellas published along the way to keep people entertained between Stormlight updates.

            "answer_text": "Two important facts here: \u00b7 Sanderson is a consistent author who releases books when he says he\u2019ll release them. \u00b7 The Stormlight Archives will be divided into two sets of five books each, with a five year gap between the sets. The Way of Kings was released in 2010. Due to Sanderson\u2019s commitments completing Robert Jordan\u2019s books, Words of Radiance came out in 2014, and Oath Bringer in 2017. Rhythm of War is coming in November of this year. It would appear three years between each book is the standard we can expect. Therefore: \u00b7 The Way of Kings: 2010. \u00b7 Words of Radiance: 2014. \u00b7 Oath Bringer: 2017. \u00b7 Rhythm of War: 2020 \u00b7 Book 5: 2023. \u00b7 Five year gap. \u00b7 Book 6: 2028. \u00b7 Book 7: 2031. \u00b7 Book 8: 2034. \u00b7 Book 9: 2037. \u00b7 Book 10: 2040. Life happens, so give an extra seven years either way. It\u2019s not as bad as it seems. Sanderson does not engage in cheap cliffhangers. And from what he has said about the second set, I assume the first five books are a complete story with its own resolution. ",
