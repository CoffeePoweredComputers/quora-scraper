            "answer_text": "From the beer.  (Image Credit[1]) Seriously. It all started on the 10th of November, 1951, when a man named Sir Hugh Beaver (yes that was really his name) went hunting in County Wexford. Sir Beaver was, at the time, the managing director of Guinness Breweries, whose St. James Gate home had been pumping out the black Irish gold known as Guinness Draught since 1759. The story goes that, after Sir Beaver missed a shot and tried to excuse his miss on the speed of the bird he\u2019d been aiming for, a heated argument ensued. They were arguing about which was the fastest game bird in Ireland, the Red Grouse, or the Golden Plover (which Sir Beaver had missed). I will let you imagine what course an argument might take when waged amongst Irishmen after a few drinks when all of them are carrying guns and one has accused another of missing his shot not because the Golden Plover was the fastest game bird in Europe (which, for the record, it is), but rather because he was just shite at shooting. I feel content to say that it likely got a bit out of hand. Afterwards, Sir Hugh Beaver had a profound epiphany: people were getting into arguments in pubs and bars all over the world over which thing was the most whatever and some of those arguments were likely turning violent. This type of preventable conflict could be solved with one fell stroke: by a comprehensive compendium of what was the most at everything. Thus, Sir Hugh Beaver (are you still chuckling, because I am) set out to make the official pub-fight-ending grimoire for the whole damn planet. And thus was the record book born.  (Image Credit[2]) On a fun side-note, the Guinness World Record for \u201cBook most frequently stolen from public libraries\u201d was eventually held by none other than The Guinness Book of World Records itself. That must have been an interesting award ceremony.  Disclaimer: Elements of the aforementioned account have been subjected to the personal interpretation of the author.
