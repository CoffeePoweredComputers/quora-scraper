Please visit one innovative concept of library a successful business to know more Books on Rent, Movies on Rent, Plays on Rent, Doorstep Library, DVDs on Rent You can pick books online and from good book selling publishers. The space requirement depend upon the your catalog size and no of visitor to your library, but my suggestion you start with small but keep possibility in mind for expansion in future. Cost will depend on the nos, but my suggestion to you is please conduct survey in your area in 1 km range with some local resident and than decide about first purchases, when public start coming, keep a log for future suggestion for new items to be included. For design idea please visit Library | British Council   ",
