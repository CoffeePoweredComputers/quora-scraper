However, if you do not want to use Social Media, then I have a few suggestions for you: PAID TRAFFIC: Video advertising to generate traffic.FREE TRAFFIC:If you have a website with good traffic, you can use your website to get backlinks. SEO: Optimize title, description, keywords, tags, thumbnails. For SEO, it takes a long time and perseverance. SEO will be difficult with highly competitive topics. Comment strategy: You comment on videos of the same topic as your channel. You can summarize the video content you are watching from time to time. (Strategy 1). The channel owner can pin your comment, then there will be traffic on the YouTube channel.You and other viewers argue, for example between ANDROID and IOS. Of course, the goal is positive. (Strategy 2).Hope this helps. ",
