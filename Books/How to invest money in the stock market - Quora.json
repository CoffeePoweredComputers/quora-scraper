            "answer_text": "Remember this advice from Peter Lynch: It is better to earn money slowly than to lose it quickly. So what should you do? Learn a lot about investing. Then learn a lot more about investing. And plan to continue educating yourself. There are many good books out there such as those by John Bogle and Peter Lynch. For someone starting out, I highly recommend going to the Bob Brinker web site (bobbrinker.com) and looking at his recommended reading list. His newsletter or radio show is also worth considering, although it may be above your head at the start. Most of Suze Orman\u2019s books are easier reading for the newcomer, although her strong point is personal finance rather than investing. Edit on 5/30/2020 - Bob Brinker no longer does his radio show, but his web site is still active and his newsletter is worth considering. With that said, I recommend that you start by putting your money into a broadly diversified, no-load, low cost index fund such as a total stock market index fund or an S&P 500 index fund. These funds have very strong track records, beating most other mutual funds over the long run, and with relatively low risk because of their diversification. Specialization is the bane of many stock investors. For example I know people who invested in gold right after the the 2008 financial recession and who lost money in the ensuing 10 years, while the two funds I mentioned have quadrupled in that time. To start, open a brokerage account at one of the low cost mutual fund or brokerage companies such as Vanguard or Fidelity or Charles Schwab. (If you open an IRA or Roth IRA, you can probably start with a smaller initial investment. And if you cannot meet the minimum investment level for a mutual fund, you can buy an exchange traded mutual fund - the same funds as those mentioned above are available in this format, but you buy them as stocks [with a small commission)]in any amount you wish.) If you have a fixed amount to invest each month, just arrange to add it to your investment each month. If you have a large amount (say, $10,000 or more), don\u2019t invest it all at once. Instead, put the money in a money market fund, and transfer a fixed amount (perhaps 5\u201310% of the total) each month into the mutual fund. This is known as \u201cdollar cost averaging\u201d and has the advantage of reducing the risk of a stock market correction or a recession. Things to avoid: Any insurance product that is touted as an investment such as variable annuities, indexed annuities, and whole life policies. Despite the sales talk, they almost always end up costing more because one way or another a sales person will get a commission out of them, and the insurance company will also get a cut. Term life insurance is a great concept for young people to protect their families and Immediate Annuities are a great concept for retired people who want to, essentially, buy themselves a pension. Both products have low cost and are what insurance is supposed to be all about. All of the other products they try to sell you are high-profit, semi-insurance, semi-investment vehicles that you don\u2019t want to mistake for genuine investments. They don\u2019t make you as much money as genuine investments.Anything sold at a \u201cfree investment seminar\u201d. That free meal and the salary of the person giving the seminar has to be paid for somehow, and guess whose pocket it will come from!Anything that is too focused or specialized, such as oil or gold or whatever else someone is pushing this month.Anything sold with a \u201cload\u201d (a fee you pay for the privilege of purchasing)Anything that cannot be readily sold on the open market, such as many \u201cclosed end\u201d funds, many real estate investments, and so forth.Penny stocks. They sell for pennies for a reason.Anything that promises significantly higher returns than the prevailing returns from stocks and bonds. Remember Bernie Madoff? He and others like him stole a lot of people\u2019s money through such schemes. Also, watch \u201cAmerican Greed\u201d on CNBC to see other examples of how sly shysters steal money from people by promising them high returns.Hedge funds. Have you noticed how many public retirement funds are having financial trouble? Most of them invested in hedge funds.Anything sold by a relative or friend. If things go sour you will lose your friendship and possibly cause serious family disputes.Note that there are a lot of people out there who will try to sell you things that you don\u2019t need. They are out to make a profit and despite their well-honed sales pitches, they are not looking out for your best interest. If you want to see a financial adviser, get one who charges a fixed fee for the consultation, not one who charges you a percentage for managing your money. And, if you must see a financial adviser, make sure he is acting as a fiduciary and not as a salesman. A fiduciary must sell you things that are in your best interest. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are thinking of investments that could beat inflation and also give you good returns, one option might be to start investing in the stock market. If you have decided to do the same and go for it all by yourself, it\u2019s not a bad idea. The stock market, when properly understood, can help you make a lot of money, but you can also lose all your money if you are tempted to invest randomly without knowing the nitty-gritty of the market. Therefore, there are a few things you must know before you dive into the share market. Here they go: 1. Never jump blindly into stock markets Many a times it happens that while talking to your friends and colleagues, the discussion heads towards the stock market, and also how the stock market helps investors make big money. You might never have invested in the market, but after hearing about all those things you also decide to buy some stocks. However, if you entered the market just to remain in the mainstream fashion, you have landed in for the wrong reason. You should invest in the stock market after getting the basic knowledge about it and in accordance with your financial goals. 2. Stock market is not a money-making machine You must have heard the story about many investors who made their fortune through the market. Many believe that the stock market is like a money-making machine, which can turn them into millionaires over a period of time. Well, it is true that a lot of investors have made profits through the stock market. But it was only possible because they\u2019ve good market knowledge, made some really smart choices by adopting carefully thought of strategies, and are also much disciplined in their approach. Many people forget that a lot of people have lost their entire wealth, while some have been forced to sell their personal assets to cover the loss in the market. 3. Educate yourself, handle basics first Before making your first investment, take the time to learn the basics about the stock market and the individual securities composing the market. There is an old adage: It is not a stock market, but a market of stocks. Your focus will be upon individual securities which you are investing in and the relationship with the broader economy and the factors that drive your stock. Some important areas which you should be familiar with before entering the market are: # Understanding financial metrics and definitions such as PE, EPS, ROE, Market Cap and so on # Popular Methods of Stock Selection and Timing, such as fundamental and technical analyses # Trading basics, rules, compliances and terminology as market order types including market orders, limit order, stop market orders, stop limit orders, trailing stop loss orders, and other types commonly used by investors, margin money required if you want to trade in F&O. # Gain some understanding about the market and its relationship with the economy such as market relationship with inflation, GDP, fiscal deficit, crude prices, rupees values against dollar. People lose money in the markets because they simple jump to the market without understanding the economic and investment market cycles. 4. Invest only your surplus funds The biggest mistake newbie investors make is to invest money that they can\u2019t actually afford to lose. Investing in the stock market is risky, and that means that you can potentially lose everything. Like any investment, there are inherent risks associated with the stock market. Some are the risks related to the overall market as systematic risk that you can\u2019t avoid by diversifying your portfolio, while some risks are stock-specific that you can avoid. You need to decide your own risk tolerance considering your age, financial strength, retirement goal, etc, and accordingly should take the risk. If you want to take risk in the stock market, then only invest your surplus funds which you can afford to lose. Investment is done to generate more money, but do not invest all your emergency funds in the stock market. 5. Avoid Leverage Leverage simply means use of borrowed money to execute your stock market strategy. In a margin account, banks and brokerage firms can lend you money to buy stocks. It sounds great when the stock market is moving up, but consider the other side when the stock market or your stock goes down. In that case your loss would not only erode your initial investment, but you will also have to pay interest to the broker. Leverage is, thus, a tool, neither good nor bad. However, it is best used after you gain experience and confidence about your decision-making abilities. Therefore limit your risk when you are starting out to ensure you can profit over the long term. 6. Avoid herd mentality Unlike many investors do, you should avoid the herd mentality that is influenced by the actions of your acquaintances, neighbors or relatives without evaluating the current information and underlying stocks. Thus, if everybody around is investing in a particular stock, the tendency for potential investors is to do the same. But this strategy is bound to backfire in the long run if you have not chosen the stock by careful analysis. So, if you really don\u2019t understand about the stock, never step in. Before investing in a company, you should know about its business. It\u2019s important to only invest in businesses that are easy for you to understand, especially while you\u2019re just starting out. Never invest in a stock. Invest in a business instead. 7. Diversify, but refrain from over diversification Never put all your money in one stock. Create a well-diversified portfolio of stocks that can help you reduce the risk and save you from losing money if a few stock do not perform well. Also, avoid over diversification, as increase in the number of stocks up to a certain limit do help in diversifying the risk proportionately, but beyond a certain number of stocks your investment can\u2019t get the proper growth moment.

            "answer_text": "My start in investing goes back over 4 decades. I got interested in investing in stocks and played around on paper for a few months and then decided it was time to get my feet wet. Sometimes you have what many call beginners luck. I opened my account with an investment of $ 2,000.00. For my first stock I picked Westinghouse which was way off it\u2019s high and I bought 100 shares for $ 1,200.00. About 6 weeks later my broker called and suggested I sell since it was up to $ 16.00 a share. I said no and sold it 3 weeks later for $ 19.00 a share. Right after I sold it the stock dropped again so I bought it back for $ 12.00 and sold it a few months later for $ 19.00 again. There was a gas crisis at the time and Holiday Inn stock was down to about nothing since people couldn\u2019t get gas to travel so I bought Holiday Inn. Six months later I sold it for more than double what I paid. I also started investing in a company called Grow Chemical which was a paint company that was a leader in powder paint. They had a cash dividend and every year about May 1st they would declare a 5% stock dividend. I would buy extra shares before they declared the dividend and sell them after the dividend. I always got my money back and ended up with double the shares that I paid for. One year they announced they would spin off a subsidiary that made tags that signaled if someone shoplifted. They were going to give shareholders 20 shares for each 100 shares of Grow they owned. I bought enough to give me 100 shares and sold them after it went ex-dividend so I had 100 shares of the spin off company that started to trade at $ 1.50 a share. Two years later I sold that stock at $ 17.00 a share. That was probably a mistake since it later more than doubled. but that $ 1,700 was pure profit. When my $ 2,000.00 investment reached $ 10,000.00 I pulled my 2 grand back out so I was playing with other peoples money. A few years later I had to cash out because I needed the money to start a business myself and cashed out 13 grand. I was out of the market for a few years and then started again with two grand which later became worth 15 grand. On that second go round one of the stocks I bought was one called Discreet Logic which did special effects for movies. (Speed was one of the ones done with their software). I bought it for $ 6.25 a share and sold it 18 months later for $ 35.00 a share. The woman I was dating at the time saw how well I was doing and decided to take her son\u2019s college money and invest in stocks. She bought that same stock (against my advice) for $ 35.00 a share and sold it 6 months later for 6 bucks a share. She blew through nearly all his college money. I did a lot of things right but did make some mistakes. I did talk about this in another question here but I bought 100 shares of a niche computer company that had some strength with schools and graphic artists for $ 12.00 a share. A few months later it had moved up to $ 20.00 a share and I told a friend I was going to sell it. About 10 minutes after I sold it he made a frantic call to me not to sell my Apple stock. Steve Jobs had just announced he was coming back to the company. I did think about buying it back but had a hard time buying stock back at $ 30.00 a share that I had just sold for $ 20.00 a share. Had I known he was coming back I would never have sold it. Those shares today would be worth $ 625,00.00. My other big goof was back in the dot com bust. I had about $ 1,000.00 in my account in cash and debated about the stock in an online book seller that I liked or to buy shares in 10 companies that had been high flyers but were selling for a buck a share. i decided to go with the 10 companies hoping at least one would turn out to be a winner. None did and I about broke even. Buying the stock in Amazon would have been the right choice. I really didn\u2019t add anything past that first 2 grand until 2008 when the market crashed. I did start adding money then and bought DOW for $ 8.60 a share, M for $ 11.25 a share which I later sold for $ 50.00 a share (I still hold DOW) and more. Since then I have been adding quite a bit of money to the market. Now I am so diversified with about 35 different stocks that I can barely beat the market. I did make some bad choices such as expecting the oil downturn to be shorter than it was and buying stocks like LINE and SeaDrill. It has been a fun ride and I do think much of the good results I had was beginners luck. There really was little information to help investors in those early days. I picked stocks out of a guide book S&P published that had one line of information or buy getting annual reports that your could order through Forbes Magazine once each year. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, Should you be Investing? To find out check the following: Take a good look at your financial situation - (Money Crashers give the following 12 steps to analyse your financial situation: Decide to start a budget \u2013 The first step to solve a problem is to acknowledge that this problem exists!Know how much you have \u2013 You want to know how much money is in any saving, checking, or investing accounts and/or in any other financial instrument.Know how much you make \u2013 Write down what is your monthly income.Know what you owe \u2013 Understanding your monthly recurring debt it\u2019s the logical next step. You should also write down what is the interest in each debt (This is crucial for you so don\u2019t skip it!).Determine your net worth \u2013 Great moment! You are ready to determine your net worth. Subtract from what you have what you owe\u2026 FINANCE IS EASY! Do not worry if you have a negative worth, it is quite ok. Your net worth only accounts for what you own, not for your salary, while it accounts for everything that you owe, even if you owe it in 5 years. Do not stress!Determine your average recurring monthly expenses \u2013 First, your household expenses (utility bills, food, rent, pets\u2026), add your transport expenses (car insurance, bus ticket, metro ticket\u2026), add your health expenditures (health insurance, medications, gym\u2026), add extra expenditures such as clothing, entertainment\u2026Enter this information into a database \u2013 You can use Excel or online budgeting tools just like Mint, You Need a Budget, or Mvelopes.Look at the bottom line \u2013 When you subtract your debt payments and your expenses from your income you find out if you are living within your needs.Make adjustments accordingly \u2013 If you are spending more than what you are making you have a problem and you need to find ways of cutting your expenditures before you do anything else.Adjust categories based on reality \u2013 You must adjust when there is a change in reality (pay cut, pay increase, inflation\u2026).Pay yourself first \u2013 If your finances look good it might be good for you to add another line to expenses, this would be monthly distributions to a saving account. We will talk more in depth about this.Track, monitor, and be disciplined \u2013 It is as easy to do it as to say it\u2026 so, just do it ;).Pay off your high interest debt This table shows how much the major equity markets have return since 1900. We can use it as a gauge of what annual average return should you expect from your equity investments. As a rule of thumb, if I have a regional biased, I would payoff any debt with higher interest rate that the annualized rate of return of the equity markets in my region.  So, if I live in Spain, I would pay off any debt that is higher than 3.6% before I decide to invest. However, we are living in a world where global diversification is getting easier and cheaper to achieve. This is why we should forget our regional biases and invest in globally diversified portfolios. At the end of the day, I would say that any debt above 4-4.5% should be paid off before you start investing. Create an emergency fund After you: paid off your debt, and optimized your level of expenses to fit your income you can start building your emergency fund! An emergency fund is an account in which you set aside funds that will be used if an emergency occurs. What can be an emergency? A job loss, illness, injury, home reparation, car crash\u2026 The purpose of the emergency fund is to expand your financial security with a safety net that can be utilized instead of credit cards that would require high interests payments. Personal Finance experts do not agree in the amount of money that you should keep on your emergency fund, some say that you should keep the amount that will cover 3 months expenses, others 6 months and others 1 year. I personally think that it depends on each case. A person that has $5,000 monthly expenses will have to keep on an emergency fund of $30,000 (if he wants to have the 6 months option). While a person that has $1,500 monthly expenses only $9,000. The difference of these amounts is drastic, while the emergencies that these two individuals might have will, most likely, be similar in monetary terms. The only case that their emergency might be quite different is if they lose their jobs, in this case, the person with the higher paying job will suffer a bigger financial lose, of course. What can you get in clean from this? Well, that despite of the simplicity of the concept emergency fund, knowing how much to keep in it is not that straightforward. I would say that keeping at least 6 months of those expenses that you cannot instantly cut should be the lowest amount that you should have. Depending on where you live and the cost of those possible emergencies you should keep more or less above that initial minimum amount. After you find out if you should be investing you can go ahead move on into the next steps! You need to find the following What are you investing for?Are you investing to pay for your kid\u2019s university, to buy a new car, to take that around the world vacation that you have always dreamt of, to enjoy a nice retirement, to have a passive income? As you can see, there are a limitless number of reasons to invest. You need to understand yours because depending on what you want to invest for; you are going to use different investment vehicles to achieve your goals. Let\u2019s give a few examples to better understand it. If you have a sizable amount of money and you want to leave of it, or just have it produce some income for you, you can buy dividend stocks and bonds that will assure you a stream of cash. If you get the right mix, you can enjoy a steady income over the years in order to use as you please. If you meet the following criteria You are in your late 20s or in your 30s You have an emergency fund You have a salary You are debt free You don\u2019t have the need to pull money out in the next decades you should create a balanced portfolio with a high level of risk. Most likely it would include a high percentage of equities and a sizable exposure to emerging markets with a high growth potential. There is no return without riskNo one, wait I\u2019ll repeat: NO ONE is telling the truth if they say they can offer a return higher than the risk free with no risk. It is just not possible. In our post Risk in finance and the why of risk management we gave a comprehensive explanation of what risk is and how to measure it, so take a look to refresh your mind. You have an optimal risk target, find it!In the investment world, you should not aim for a particular return; it is never the right strategy. The process should start by identifying your level of risk, and only then maximize the level of return for that particular level of risk. The real key variable is risk because at the end of the day, if you risk too much you might go bankrupt and you don\u2019t want that! This is why we need to decide what level of risk is appropriate for us. How do we do it? We need to assess our risk profile. In most developed countries, registered financial advisers are required to assess the risk profile of their clients. These financial advisers will provide a questionnaire that will try to gauge the following characteristics of the investor: Time horizon Cash requirements Attitude towards risk Financial situation At the end of the day what the financial advisers are trying to find out is what amount of money are you willing and able to lose within a particular level of probability. You should try to find this number before committing any money to the financial markets. It will be truly dangerous to invest in a vehicle in which you can lose more money than the amount you are comfortable with losing. As you can see, you not only have to understand your level of risk but also the different investment vehicles in order to know what is the risk of investing in them. Diversification is keyIf you want to know more of why you should diversify check our post on diversification Yes we can\u2026 DIVERSIFY! In order to diversify you need to know about the different asset classes. We are currently building a database with as many possible investment vehicles that exist with their description and characteristics. For now, this are some of the most common investment vehicles, including alternative assets: stocks, bonds, derivatives, real estate, commodities, derivatives, hedge funds, venture capital, private equity\u2026 Economies follow boom/burst cyclesEconomies, as human emotions, rise and fall. Understanding how the economic cycle works, in which phase do we stand, and which type of companies and investment vehicles perform better in each particular phase of the cycle is completely crucial to perform in the investment world. Fidelity has a really nice paper explaining its Business Cycle Sector Approach to investment in which they explain how cycles work and how to benefit from them. Always question your investment selectionUnderstand that if you are selling, someone is buying and that if you are buying, someone is selling. So, there is someone in the other side of the trade that is, on average, as smart as you. Try to find out why that person is taking the other side of the trade. In other words, take your strategy and try to see how it could go wrong and with what probability. This reflection might show you that your strategy is not as robust as you thought or it might give you even more reasons to invest, regardless; it is a necessary and sometimes forgotten step. What is the cost of investing?Now that we know our risk level and that we should diversify we need to focus in which investment vehicles we are going to use to create our portfolio. We cannot tress sufficiently how important the cost of an investment is for its final return, and how many times these costs are completely neglected by the investor. The costs come from different sources: brokers, financial advisers, investment vehicle, and others. You can understand how to minimize these costs and control them, and only then, it will make sense to invest. You should always do the appropriate due diligence, find out how the fees of the different brokers, financial advisers and investment vehicles relate. This is substantial to realize the highest potential returns. Someone in the U.S. that deems himself as a great stock picker and only wants to invest in domestic stocks should use Robin Hood since it is a broker that charges almost inexistent fees. At the same time, another person that believes that market are at least weak form efficient should invest using a robo-adviser such as Wealthfront, Betterment, or Sigfig\u2026 since they offer optimized portfolios without the humongous fees that financial advisers charge.  The final, but not least important, type of cost that we should care about is the cost associated with taxes. Understanding the tax treatment of the different type of investment vehicles and their returns is key for investors. There will be ups and downsThe markets are not gentle, be prepared. You might see green from the moment you start your portfolio, but most likely it will be a bumpy ride. The best strategy is not to continuously check how your investments are doing. This might make you sell at lows and buy at highs. You invested due to some reasons, and while the reasons that make you invest in something do not change you should not care about the short and medium term price action. History teaches us that in the long run a buy and hold strategy in a diversified portfolio should enjoy significant returns. Just to put an example, there is no 20-year period in the history of the S&P 500 in which, after adjusting for inflation and accounting for dividend reinvestment, you would have had a negative return. I understand that the fact that this hasn\u2019t occurred yet doesn\u2019t mean it will never occur, but is just some nice food for thought. So, once you invest, stay patient and calm, try to keep emotions out as much as possible and only rebalance your portfolio once some change in the markets makes your portfolio inefficient. Stay current with what's happening in the worldThere will be economical, political, environmental, social\u2026 and many other types of events that are going to be affecting your investments. It is really important that you understand what is happening in the different fields that affect your investments in order to understand what can happen to them. An early identification of a future trend can save you or make you a lot of money. Imagine that you have a lot of your money tied up to oil related investments. If suddenly a new energy is discovered that can displace oil due to its better characteristics, cost, quality, power, availability, environmental impact, accessibility\u2026 you might want to start limiting your exposure to oil, and the only way to find out about this type of news is by reading what\u2019s happening in the world. I recommend to always read the news from different countries and also associated to different types of political affiliations because how some news are presented will be affected by the background of the news provider. I feel this is enough for now! I hope it is helpful. All these information comes from posts in - www.opseeker.com ",

            "answer_text": "I started my career as a financial consultant in 1998, right in the middle of the Tech Boom. I put together nice diversified stock fund portfolios returning 20%. A prospect would look at it and say, \"Ah, I can make 60% investing in a tech fund my barber recommended. Why would I invest in your portfolio?\" I reply, \"Because the Tech Boom may end. And your portfolio with it.\" \"Nah, tech is the future. Nothing can stop it. You can't lose money in tech.\" \"Sure tech may be the future. But the companies you're investing in may not be part of that future.\" The Spring of 2000 the prophecy started to come true. Many tech stocks imploded and portfolios concentrated in them collapsed. By 2006 I watched it again with real estate investments. Heard the same arguments, \"You can't lose money in real estate.\" Single family homes were going up in value 20% per year. Leveraged, people were making 100% or more return on their investment. They bought homes they couldn't afford, at mortage payments that were bleeding them. Then they'd refinance to pay off their debts, buy a motor home and start all over. In 2008 the music stopped. Loans dried up. Prices plummeted. And people walked away from their homes losing everything. Since then I've watched it with gold, oil, Bitcoins and bunch of others. Always the same argument, \"Well, you can't lose money investing in it.\" Yet, people always figure out a way to lose money in their fool proof investment. Because, well, no investment is fool proof. Successful investors affectionately call it, \"The Greater Fool Theory.\" You buy something speculative hoping there's a greater fool who will buy it from you for more. And it works. For a while. The problem is you just never know when it will stop. So what do you do? Stop trying to outguess what you never can outguess. Instead diversify broadly. Use some type of managed investments to get maximum diversification. Second, diversify those. Invest in funds diversified by size of the companies, where they are, industries they're in. Third, invest regularly. Don't try to time the markets. You won't. Just invest every month. Fourth, just keep on, good times or not. Let it build. Don't uproot it. In time you'll suddenly discover you've built wealth. A little at a time. Without really noticing. And find yourself suprised. Pleasantly. And lest you feel bad, realize I've personally proven there is no such thing as a fool proof investment. You build wealth, not through getting lucky but by creating your own luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Investing in stocks has never been easier, thanks to online brokers, investment apps and automated trading. That\u2019s good, because the stock market is one of the best ways to grow your wealth. But how do you actually buy and invest in stocks? How much money does it require? How do you limit risk? Below is a step-by-step guide for how to invest in stocks.  Before you dive into buying stocks, it\u2019s important to know that there are several ways to approach stock investing. Choose the option below that best represents your situation. Iam interested in choosing stocks and stock funds for myself.\u201d Keep reading; the steps below are for you. Or, if you already know the stock-buying game and just need a brokerage, see our round-up of the best online brokers. \u201cI know stocks can be a great investment, but I\u2019d like someone to manage the process for me.\u201d You\u2019ll want to check out our top picks for automated trading which offer low-cost investment management.All you have to do is answer some questions. They\u2019ll take it from there, investing your money for you in a way that makes sense for your situation.Choose between stocks and stock mutual funds For most people, investing in stocks means choosing between these two investment types: Stock (also called equity) mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. These mutual funds let you purchase small pieces of many different stocks in a single transaction. Index funds and ETFs track an index;for example, nifty 50 fund replicates that index by buying the stock of the companies in it.When you invest in the fund, you also own small pieces of those companies. You can put several funds together to build a diversified portfolio.Individual stocks. If you\u2019re after a specific company, you can buy a single share or a few shares as a way to dip your toe into the stock-trading waters.Building a diversified portfolio out of many individual stocks is possible, but it takes a significant investment.The upside of stock mutual funds is that they are inherently diversified, which lessens your risk. But they\u2019re unlikely to rise in meteoric fashion as some individual stocks might.The upside of individual stocks is that a wise pick can pay off handsomely, but the odds that any individual stock will make you rich are exceedingly slim.For the vast majority of investors \u2014 particularly those who are investing for retirement \u2014 building a portfolio composed primarily of mutual funds is the clear choice.Determine your budget New investors often ask this question in two parts: How much money do I need to get started? The amount of money you need to invest in individual stocks depends on how pricey the shares are. If you have Champagne tastes and a limited pool of money, a broker that offers fractional shares \u2014 pieces of stocks \u2014 might be for you.But, remember, we like mutual funds, right? If you want mutual funds and have a small budget, ETFs may be your best bet.Mutual funds (including index funds) have minimums of 1,000 or more, but ETFs trade like a stock, which means you purchase them for a share price rather than a fund minimum.That share price might be 10 on the low side and 100 or more on the high end.How much money should I invest? If you\u2019re investing through funds \u2014 have we mentioned this is our preference? \u2014 you can allocate a fairly large portion of your portfolio toward stock funds, especially if you have a long time horizon.A 30-year-old investing for retirement might have 80% of his or her portfolio in stock funds; the rest would be in bond funds. Individual stocks are another story.We\u2019d recommend keeping these to 10% or less of your investment portfolio. That\u2019s because trading in individual stocks carries more risk \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have the built-in diversification of a fund \u2014 and more hands-on effort.Top 10 share broker in india with highest number of active clients: Zerodha (7,47,501)Hdfc securities (6,68,170)Sharekhan (5,63,342)Axis securities (4,05,661)Angel broking (4,03,312)Kotak securities (4,00,177)Motilal oswal (3,29,329)Karvy (2,63,758)IIFL (2,34,364)Sbicap (2,11,467)Open an account If you\u2019re opening a new account, consider brokers that have low fees and low account minimums.Many of those on the list of best brokers for beginners require no minimum deposit.Most brokers offer a list of commission-free ETFs or no-transaction-fee mutual funds, which will allow you to avoid a charge each time you buy or sell.With individual stocks, you can expect to pay 0.01 % or flat 20 rupees per stock trade depending on the broker, though there are free equity investment services like the app ZerodhaWhen comparing brokers, be sure to consider: Research resources: Reliable data on leading companies can significantly streamline your stock-buying homework, and many top brokers offer it.Customer support: The best brokers offer real-time assistance through multiple channels, including by phone, email or chat.Educational resources: Broker-produced guides and tutorials can help beginners get up to speed on the stock-buying process much more quickly.Trading platform: You can buy stock through any online broker\u2019s website, but if you plan to nurture this habit, you may want to graduate to a more advanced and user-friendly system.Get the best broker recommendation for you by selecting your preferences At zerodha all stock investments are free a maximum of Rs. 20 is charged per executed order for Options, Futures, Commodities & Currencies.charges Equity & Mutual fund Investment - Zero BrokerageF&O and Commodity Trading - flat Rs 20 per order.Click here to open account in 2mins: open online account Happy Investing :) Regards, Gayathri Krishnan \u270d ",

            "answer_text": "Learn to invest stocks in 10 steps: Step 1. Determine Your Goals Before you get into investing of any kind, you first have to make sure that your overall financial situation is in a position to accommodate the new activity. Your financial baggage includes everything from income to debt, to your household budget. You can organize your finances for free with our favorite personal finance app, Personal Capital. Specific considerations include: Employment \u2013 make sure that both your job and your income are secure enough to allow you to begin investing.Debt \u2013 if you have a significant amount of outstanding credit, you may want to pay some debt down before you begin investing; you should never invest money you can't afford to lose, and that's the position you'll be in if you have too much debt.Family situation \u2013 if you just welcomed a baby into the world, you may need all of your available income to help with the new arrival; family situations should be stable before you begin investing.Your household budget \u2013 you should have some room in your budget to direct cash into your investment ventures.It's also helpful to consider your goals and ask yourself why you want to start investing:' Are these investment accounts for your retirement?Is this money for a shorter-term goal, more like 5\u20136 years away?Will anyone else have access to this money?Using these three questions as the starting point of your investing will help shape the decisions you need to make next. And they require no knowledge of the stock market! These are highly personal questions that each investor needs to answer for themselves. There's no right answer, just the correct answer for your life and goals. Certified financial advisors, like those at Facet Wealth, can help you figure those questions out. Investing makes the most sense for the longer term. You generally don't want to invest money that you need in fewer than five years, as there is a risk of losing that money in a downturn. Step 2. Put Some Money to the Side Before you put any of your money at risk, you should first have some put away that will not be subject to any risk whatsoever. A cash reserve equal to at least three months' living expenses should be the minimum, and it should sit in nothing riskier then certificates of deposit or money market accounts. The purpose of the cash reserve is twofold: Act as an emergency fund in the event of a temporary income disruption or other financial emergenciesKeep you from panicking should your risk type investments take a sudden dive.Step 3. Open a Retirement Account Once you have a well-stocked emergency fund set up, the best place to begin investing is in a retirement account. This retirement account can be a 401(k) plan (or its equivalent) through your employer, or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) if there is no employer plan. Retirement accounts are an excellent start because they represent long-term investing. Besides, they are tax-sheltered \u2014 and can produce immediate tax savings \u2014 and are typically funded through payroll deductions. You can think of them as patient capital, where you have decades to accumulate and grow your money. One of the best aspects of a retirement account is that you can build up money in the plan without actually investing any money until you're ready to do so. You can keep it all in a money market account within the plan until you feel comfortable adding stocks and funds to the plan. Here's a quick rundown of the most common retirement accounts you might come across: 401(k)403(b)Roth IRATraditional IRASEP IRAThere are a lot of differences between these accounts, and you may not be able to open and fund all of them. If you want to get professional assistance, consider using Personal Capital's retirement planner. We think it's one of the best retirement calculators out there \u2014 paid or free. Employer-sponsored Retirement Accounts Generally, your first step would be to find out if your job offers a workplace-sponsored retirements account like a 401(k) or a 403(b). Individual companies may have limits on what you can invest in or how long you have to work at the company before you can begin contributing to the plan. These accounts may also come with an employer match, which is when an employer contributes the same amount of money or a percentage of what you add to the account. It's free money for your investments! Reach out to your HR department and see what retirement plans are offered. Then get the ball rolling on signing up for one. And for our brand new investors, feel free to ask HR a lot of questions about how the plan works. You want to understand as much as you can about your plan when you begin to invest money in it. Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) After you sign up for a workplace retirement plan, you can open an IRA for yourself. IRA stands for \u201cindividual retirement account.\u201d Anyone over the age of 18 with income can open one for themselves. IRAs are not generally tied to an employer, making them appealing to freelancers and part-time employees. There are several options for IRAs, and they each have different details to them. There are income limits for a Roth IRA, for example. Do some research on which account is best for you before you open any of them. Step 4. Start Investing with a Low-Cost Online Service Once you have a retirement account up and running, it's time to start investing for your non-retirement investing needs. Use a Robo Advisor If you're not the type of person who wants to DIY their investing accounts, you might be happy using a robo advisor. Betterment is an excellent robo advisor choice for new investors because: There's no initial minimum deposit requirementYou can build the fund with periodic contributions as low as $100 per monthIts fees are among the lowest in the industryOne disadvantage of a robo advisor such as Betterment is that investing in the account is limited. You buy into either a basket of stock-related ETFs or a basket of bond ETFs. However, this is not a problem when you're first starting out. Still, when you're ready to spread your capital around the investment universe and particularly into individual stocks, you'll need to look for a full-service broker to meet your needs. If you want to find a financial advisor who can not only help you invest, but also help you plan for the future, you can use a service like Paladin Registry . This service helps you find a registered advisor who is legally required to act in your best interest. Use an Online Stock Broker As opposed to hands-off Robo advisors, online stock brokers let you do the trading yourself. That means researching, choosing, buying, and selling stocks, options, funds, etc., on your own. A great stockbroker choice for beginners is Merrill Edge. As a subsidiary of Bank of America, you can simplify your finances by having your bank and investing account in one place. Like other stockbrokers, stock trades are commission-free, although you will have to pay a small fee for more advanced trades like options and mutual funds. Merrill Edge offers a lot of account options, including IRAs, 529s, and taxable investment accounts. Step 5. Begin with Mutual Funds or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) When you begin investing, you'll be far better off with mutual funds and ETFs than plunging right into stocks. Funds are professionally managed, and this will remove the burden of stock selection from your plate. All you need to do is: Open an account with one of the many commission-free ETF trading apps available (such as Public.com)Determine how much money you want to put into a given fund or group of funds, and then you're free to get on with the rest of your life.Step 6. Stay with Index Funds To make mutual fund investing even more hassle-free, stick with index funds. For example, index funds that track the Standard & Poor's 500 indexes are invested in the broad market, so your investment performance will track that index precisely. While you'll never outperform the market in an index fund, you'll never under-perform it either. As a new investor, this is as it should be. Wealthfront is an excellent robot advisor to handle both your index funds and ETFs. Step 7. Use Dollar-Cost Averaging Dollar-cost averaging is the process of buying into your investment positions gradually, rather than all at once. For example, rather than investing $5,000 in a single index fund, you can make periodic contributions of, say, $100 per month into the fund. By doing this, you remove the possibility of buying at the top of the market. Instead, you're buying into the fund at all different times and continuously. This also eliminates the \u201cwhen\u201d question, as in when to invest in a given security or fund. Step 8. Get Some Investment Education We could have made this step number three, with the intention that you have some understanding of investing before doing anything at all. Fortunately, mutual funds and ETFs \u2014 with the help of index funds and dollar-cost averaging \u2014 remove that necessity. You can begin investing immediately, even if you're a novice. But if you want to move beyond funds, payroll contributions, and dollar-cost averaging \u2014 and into holding individual stocks \u2014 you'll need to learn all that you can about investing before you do. Come up with an investment strategy that works for you. Are you a risk-averse, conservative investor, or are you going to be aggressively trying to beat the market? Are you investing $5 and planning for the long term, or are you investing $1,000,000 and trying to secure wealth for generations? To become a good investor, you'll need to surround yourself with investment experts and learn all that you can. The idea is to become \u201cfluent\u201d in investments before you begin investing with real money. Step 9. Invest in Individual Stocks Gradually When you finally feel comfortable enough to begin investing in stocks, be sure that you do it gradually. You generally don't have the dollar-cost averaging feature when investing in individual stocks, so you'll have to develop your method for doing this on a gradual basis. Never overload in a single stock. When you are starting out, take a minimal position in one stock \u2014 generally 100 shares to take advantage of the best pricing \u2014 and then move into another stock. Repeat the process until you have several stock positions in your portfolio, in addition to your mutual funds and ETFs. Step 10. Don't Forget to Diversify! If you have set up a cash reserve, a retirement plan, and an investment account, and have begun stocking the retirement and investment accounts with mutual funds and ETFs, you've already taken a huge step toward diversifying your portfolio. Adding individual stocks will further diversify your cash and fund holdings. But while you are building your portfolio, you'll also need to spread your capital out among various equity sectors. ",

            "answer_text": "Two things you need to do: find a broker and start researching. For a broker, I am a big fan of M1 Finance. Check it out here: M1 Finance - Free Automated Investing M1 is a great place to start investing because it is a no fee investing platform. In other words, it doesn\u2019t charge a $5 fee (like most other brokers) every time you make a trade. That is especially helpful for beginning investors that often don\u2019t have a tremendous amount of money to invest. Additionally, M1 Finance - Free Automated Investing is a great site because with it you can either choose your own investments, or let it create a plan for you based on your age, risk tolerance, and the amount you are investing. That feature is especially helpful for beginning investors that don\u2019t have the time to research individual investments. To research a stock, here\u2019s what you need to do: First, learn about the asset classes: Cash: Cash isn\u2019t particularly volatile and is very liquid. You can store it and buy what you want when you want. But it doesn\u2019t appreciate in value at all. Instead, it loses value because of inflation (although there are a few savings accounts that will about keep it steady with inflation). You won\u2019t build your money passively with cash, you have to earn more to build your cash reserves.Precious metals: Sometimes they appreciate, sometimes they don\u2019t. Like cryptocurrency you are just gambling that someone will want to pay more in the future for it than you have paid for it. It is however a good store of wealth that generally keeps up with inflation. The saying goes that an ounce of gold will always buy you a nice suit. But it generally doesn\u2019t appreciate faster than inflation unless there is undue speculation in the precious metals market, generally caused by fear of a bear market or global crisis.Bonds: Bonds are a way to store wealth while also earning income. A well diversified bond fund generally won\u2019t lose too much value, and it will pay you dividends. They don\u2019t appreciate all that much though, so they\u2019re better for retirement income than building wealth. Also, they can be volatile, so you can have paper losses at some points.Real estate: Real estate will appreciate at a few percentage points per year, and sometimes more if the market is hot due to economic growth in the area. You will also make lots of cash through renting houses or commercial real estate. But costs of management can weigh it down and the average real estate investor only builds wealth at the rate of a few percentage points per year, not much better than bonds.Stocks and REITs: These are the wealth builders. Most appreciate and pay dividends, although some grow more and some pay more dividends. It depends on the underlying business of the equity. You will generally average around 10% annual returns if you hold a well-diversified number of equities for the long term and avoid high costs for brokerages or ETFs. These are the ways to build wealth.After determining what assets you can invest in, you have to decide what your goals are. If its to purely preserve your money, weight it more towards gold and cash. If its to build income, then bonds and real estate. If its to build wealth, then mostly stocks. Assuming you\u2019re a typical new investor, you want to build wealth. You\u2019re young and don\u2019t need the dividend income of real estate or bonds, and can handle on-paper losses in value of stocks. You\u2019ll want a 90/10 allocation of stocks and bonds. The bonds are to preserve some money in case any great stock opportunities come along due to a correction. To determine what stocks you should buy, you have to do a lot of research. First, read widely about what ratios, fundamentals, and values to look for when researching stocks. Usually you\u2019ll want to look at earnings, free-cash, debt, and dividends. Other variables will come into play, but those are some of the important ones. Then you\u2019ll use that knowledge to begin researching stocks. Once you\u2019ve found a well diversified group of 20 or so, it\u2019s time to buy them. After you buy them, hold onto them. Don\u2019t be a frequent seller, the taxes and brokerage fees will erode your returns. Buy and hold. Same with bonds; buy and hold until a better opportunity comes along. As you get older you\u2019ll slowly shift from stocks to bonds for stability and dividend income. Hope this helps!

            "answer_text": "First congratulations on making a positive step to invest for the long-term (please don\u2019t engage in more risky day trading as most people wind up losing money). There are 10 key steps to investing. Set money aside to invest - Ideally this will not be a one-time investment, but on a regular basis (monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.). Before investing in the market, make sure one has a reserve fund to help cover any unforeseen expenses (ideally 3 to 6 months). The key to investing in the market is to not to jump in all in at once as prices can go up and down. Ideally setting up automated investing where one puts a set amount of resources to invest each month or year can be great. Also make sure to see if you have tax beneficial investing options through work (401K) or on your own through an IRA or Roth IRA.Learn the Basics - Before putting your money into a stock or other investment vehicle make sure you do some basic learning about finance. For example what is the difference between a stock (usually means one has a small very, very tiny ownership of a company), bond (one lends money to a company or government institutions), mutual fund, exchange traded fund and more. There are many options where to park one\u2019s money and each has a different set of benefits and risks. It is also critical to always question the advice one can find in person and online and to look at potential fees (these can chip away at returns), why someone might be pushing a particular investment, etc. Finally to understand the potential tax implications of any investment is important. There are lots of great free resources to learn including:Financial Institutions - Many brokers (where one can purchase investments) have free tools and educational information where one can get the basics. Wikipedia has a useful list for brokers in the USFinance Websites - There are many, many out there. Some of my favorites include:https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/http://Quora.com - Follow investing and related topics.Sharper Insight. Smarter Investing.http://Finance.yahoo.comhttps://napkinfinance.com/Stock Market Insights | Seeking Alphahttps://www.greenamerica.org/socially-responsible-investingRead - There are tons and tons of amazing (and some not so amazing) books and magazines on finance/investing. A few great ones I would recommend include:MONEY Master the Game: 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom - Kindle edition by Tony Robbins. Self-Help Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com. This has lots of good advice and is a fun read.https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661https://www.kiplinger.com/Consumer Reports: Money | Personal Finance - Consumer ReportsInvesting - NerdWalletDecide on your investing goals and also your timeline - Are you close to retirement or in your 20s? Your age, your level of comfort with risk and your personality as well your current level of financial security will affect the type of investing that may be suitable. If one is younger than higher growth (and higher risk) investments may be a key part of your investment strategy. If one is older and closer to retirement than more conservative investments are often recommended where one\u2019s principal is much safer but the rate of return may be lower.Know that what goes up can do down. There is almost no 100% safe investment and this is critical to know. Historically stocks have returned between 7\u201310% on average What is the average annual return for the S&P 500? But this is never guaranteed and some years the stock market can go down 30% or more. Also some companies that may seem like wonderful bets can fail and it possible to lose all your money. Think of companies like Enron, WorldCom, even General Motors (which reissued stock after the financial crisis)  .[1] Again to repeat there is no guaranteed return, although safe bonds in government or select corporate bonds tend to be fairly secure as well as stocks in select companies.Understand how to read the financials of a company - Too many people buy investments without understanding the basic financials of a company\u2019s record. There are many things to look, some key ones include:Revenue and Net Profit - Is it increasing, decreasing or staying stable. One bad quarter may be okay but several should be a red flag.Price to Earnings Ratio - What is the value of each share of stock to overall earnings.[2]Earnings Per Shares - Ideally this should be positive.Who holds the shares - What type of individual and institutional shareholders are there and what % of stocks do they hold? Who is buying and/or selling a large number of shares in a given period?What do experts say? On many finance sites such as Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News one can find future forecasts of the potential price forecast as well as if experts recommending buying, holding, or selling a stock. These can be helpful benchmarks.Decide on what you want to invest in? Some people only want to maximize return without any consideration of the type of product a company provides. They might invest in tobacco, oil, arms or other companies in sectors that can contribute to harm to people and the planet. Others (I fall in this camp) seek to ensure (there are varying degrees of this) that companies are not only making a profit but seeking to have a positive impact on people and the planet. This is called Socially Responsible Investing. There are many criteria one can use to screen for SRI (some good resources are here The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment). There is also some research showing that companies that are more socially responsible do better in the long term.[3]Select a Brokerage - To buy stocks or other investment products it is usually necessary to go through licensed broker who serves as the middle man (and often custodian of your investments). There are many, many brokerages these days. In picking one make sure to look at fees (how much does the company charge for each trade, it should be very low and there are some companies now that have free trading), how secure is their platform, how strong is customer support, what type of educational resources do they provide and more. It is possible to move your investments from one firm to another, but it takes some paperwork. Thus do your research.Diversify your Investments - Please don\u2019t put all your investments in a single company or sector. As I already emphasized prices can go up and down. If one puts all of your dollars into a single sector or company and there is a economic downturn in this area this can have devastating results. Some would say also don\u2019t put your investment only in type of finance product. Thus while one may invest a lot in stocks, putting some resources in mutual funds, ETFs, bonds or other forms might be a smart choice. A lot has to do with how much research you want to do. If you like to learn and follow finance than individual stocks might be a good investment. If you want to just invest and not get too much into the details, than mutual funds or ETFs might be good (again always look at fees). Thus picking a diverse portfolio (many online finance platforms do provide recommendations) is important.Start Investing - Congrats!!!Do periodic Reviews of your Investments - There is a danger in looking too often at one\u2019s investments. But also not looking periodically (quarterly may be appropriate for many) can be dangerous. Sometimes it may be necessary to rebalance your investments depending on how the economy/stock market is doing or your own financial status (again always look at potential benefits and costs to do this. As there can be tax and other implications to selling investments).Footnotes[1] General Motors Stock History: Is the Automaker Doomed to Underperform? --  The Motley Fool[2] Price-Earnings Ratio - P/E Ratio[3] How to Drive Profits with Corporate Social Responsibility",

            "answer_text": "Investing in stocks is an excellent way to grow wealth. For long-term investors, stocks are the ideal investment, even when there is volatility. Whenever there is a market downturn, it means many stocks are on sale. The initial step towards stock investment is opening a trading and Demat Account. These should be linked to your bank account. You need to find the right broker for the same. I was associated with a discount broker for a long time of my life. It got tricky for me as I did not receive personalised and timely guidance. This led to the loss of my money. That is when I was suggested about full-service brokers, namely ICICI Direct. With their help, I could start investing for the price of a single share. Following are the other tips I would love to share through my experience \u2013 There are many ways of approaching stock investment. You could opt for DIY. These are the individuals who are interested in choosing stocks themselves. They are aware of how the game pans out. Here, they need a broker only for the brokerage purpose. Then you have those who know that stocks are a significant investment but need assistance as I wanted. This is where brokerage firms like ICICI Direct come handy as they have financial advisors guiding you at every step. As mentioned, you need the trading, Demat, and bank accounts for the transactions and trading to take place. ICICI Direct 3-in-1 deal is what you need for the smooth functioning of the process. Understand the difference between stock mutual funds and stocks. The former lets you buy small pieces of many stocks in a single transaction. Stocks is when you buy a single or a few shares of a specific company. Always have a set budget for your stock investment. How much funds you seek to spend depends on how expensive the shares are. Stock investment is all about intricate strategies and approaches. Yet, most of the successful investors have gone beyond sticking with the basics. If you have a personal advisor through the full-service brokers, you can be assured of maintaining a diverse portfolio. ",

            "answer_text": "Consider the following steps. First steps. Have enough money to begin investing. Consider reviewing at least some of the major tenets of personal finance, such as a multiple-month living expense safety net (rainy day fund) and paying off high-interest debt, e.g., credit cards, before beginning investing.Go to Moneychimp -- http://www.moneychimp.com/ -- and Senzu -- https://senzu.io/ -- and Smart About Money --https://www.smartaboutmoney.org/ -- for introductions, overview and basics of personal finance et al.Begin to set aside a sufficient amount of money to open a brokerage account (discussed below; note that most brokers require a minimum opening deposit). Consider $1,000 or more as a minimum amount to do so. Lesser amounts, e.g., $100, 500, are insufficient to invest effectively. (The entire initial amount need not necessarily be invested all at once or in one stock. Rather it allows diversity in stocks, both in types of companies and timing of purchasing stocks.)Consider investing as a lifelong learning experience.Consider investing only the money you can afford to lose. Risking monies set aside for other obligations, such as but not limited to safety net and college funds, is not recommended.Consider investing in stocks as part of an overall strategy that may include participation in employee retirement plans, payroll savings plans and IRAs. There may be tax advantages to be had; your employer's human resources department should be a likely first resource.If investing for retirement, consider using an Individual Retirement Account (iRA) as part of your strategy. Age and income, present and future expectations, and restrictions on early withdrawal may factor into your decision. Your broker (discussed below) should help sort out your options.As you study the \"how to\", be aware of and recognize there are differences in philosophies and approaches to investing (longer time periods) versus trading (shorter time periods). Definitions may vary, and the writer's choice of adjectives may be confusing.Be aware of and recognize that stocks are just one type of investment product. Other product types include but are not limited to electronic traded funds (ETFs), index funds, mutual funds and bonds; you may choose to include such products in your holdings. (I use the term \"stocks\" generically, where applicable, to apply to all investment products in the discussion below.)Be aware that trading stocks as a novice is most likely a recipe for disaster. Day trading is not recommended. The literature is replete with evidence that the vast majority of those new to the market quickly lose significant amounts of money. This piece -- https://www.quora.com/Why-are-so-many-people-against-day-trading/answer/Will-Caruthers -- illustrates the point. Do take the time to read and study (discussed below) first and reserve the exploration of day and short-term and options trading for later.I have no opinion of forex or cryptocurrrency trading. If that is what you seek, I would refer you to the Wiley and Dummies books (discussed below) before wandering off into the myriad of websites and chatrooms -- see the crypto channel in Hashtaginvesting below-- discussing same. Get a grounding and weed out those that would relieve you of your funds.And an aside. One sees numerous posts asking such variants of questions on doubling an investment in a short period of time, how to turn a small four-figure investment into a million dollars, a list of guaranteed no-risk stocks, the \"best\" stocks to buy now for the next some number of years, what is the easiest way to make money and other unreasonably outlandish ideas. In my opinion these all are just noise. While there is nothing wrong about asking questions, generally my impression is that the writer hasn't attempted even a modicum of research on the internet or in a bookstore or library. As you begin your own journey, I suggest you do not be distracted by such outlandish postings.Second steps. Go to (and bookmark for future reference) Investopedia -- http://www.investopedia.com/ -- for introductions, terms, references, dictionary, and encyclopedia. It has a Wikipedia-like format.Consider taking an introductory course or two at at an adult evening school or a 2/4 year college.Read a few introductory quick read \"how to\" investing books published by Wiley -- http://wileyfinance.com/ -- including their For Dummies -- http://www.dummies.com/ -- series found in most larger bookstores, where one can browse (and look at the author's writing style), and online. Well-indexed, these books also serve as a reference. (I prefer print books in hand compared to ebooks but that's me.) See a list of possible suggestions at the end of this post.Consider reading over time, as you continue with the steps below, at least some of the numerous books mentioned in similar question-and-answer (q&a) postings here; use search atop the page to find those q&a postings. Can't make up your mind on what books to read? Start with a non-inclusive list of recommended books on investment philosophies and concepts at the end of this post.Visit your local library; some libraries have online loans using software/apps like Overdrive.Use search engines (Google, Yahoo, et al). Have a question? Try typing the complete question into the search dialog box. The (Google) algorithms that parse a sentence or phrase as a search query are quite amazing.Don't give up. If these first two steps absolutely won't work for you, see \"Safety Valves\" below.Third steps: Visit at least some of these top 15 business websites -- http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/business-websites -- and read. My favorites for business news: Bloomberg, CNBC, Marketwatch, and Reuters Business (not included on the website).Watch Bloomberg, CNBC and Fox Business on cable TV or listen to them on SiriusXM radio. Bloomberg also has a domestic radio network that is also streamed on the internet.As an aside, my favorite TV show is CNBC's Fast Money airing at 5 pm Eastern weekdays. The traders provide insight as to why the markets moved that day, and much more. I DVR the show to ensure I don't miss it. The show also streams on the CNBC mobile app (and has video clips on its webpage), and airs on Pluto TV -- http://pluto.tv -- later in the evening; if outside the USA, use a VPN. CNBC and Pluto TV are on Roku -- https://www.roku.com/ -- as well.Consider signing up for Seeking Alpha (SA) -- http://seekingalpha.com/ -- and StockTwits -- https://stocktwits.com/ -- to track stocks of interest to you. These websites/mobile apps are alive with news, comments et al. Apply your common sense filter to all material read. I find the news releases posted by SA editors to be especially useful. (One way to gauge a SA author's credibility is to research them on LinkedIn; no guarantees but perhaps some insight.) To prevent information overload, optionally enter the stock tickers of the companies you wish to follow.Consider using a Twitter -- https://twitter.com/ -- account to follow investing news and reports from at least some third-party websites rather than clutter your email inbox. The link will take one directly to the story or report.Use Investopedia as a reference and dictionary to look up terms and vocabulary not understood.Consider joining an investment discussion bulletin board such as, but not limited to, the Bull Market Board -- https://www.bullmarketboard.com/ -- and participate.Consider joining an investment live discussion chat room such as, but not limited to, Hashtag Investing -- https://www.hashtaginvesting.com/ -- and participate. HI is a long-running chat room with a diversified group of members, mostly from North America and Europe and a lesser number from east Asia and Oceania. Stocks, bonds, funds, options, IPOs, sectors, the economy, the exploding crypto arena (including mining) et al.Fourth steps: Chose a broker. There are a number of websites -- exemplified by http://www.stockbrokers.com -- that review brokerage firms, but consider the timeliness and bias in reading reviews. Competition among brokers results in brokerage website and mobile app features changing rapidly, as do services and fees. Rather than accept such writings at face value, consider using such reviews and articles to formulate your questions to be asked when investigating opening an account.The cheapest or online-only broker isn't necessarily the best choice, especially for one starting out. For a number of reasons including face-to-face service and help with forms, applications and other documents requiring signatures, consider a broker that has a brick-and-mortar storefront (e.g., in the USA, Fidelity, Schwab, TDAmeritrade, etc.) near you.Consider visiting the broker's office to talk with a representative to talk about their services and website. Discussion items may include the features and usability of the website from both the perspective of a beginner and an advanced user, trading fees, research and analyst reports, education, training, banking services, IRAs and the like. Are you made to feel comfortable in the office? If not, move on to a different brokerage firm.Consider thoroughly exploring the broker's website, with special attention to the research section (including its stock screener, analyst reports and news coverage), to take full advantage of all the information within. The consistency of the presentation within the broker's website should be less confusing, facilitating comparing information across companies, than navigating the differing formats of the myriad of third-party websites.Do take full advantage of the training material, seminars, webinars and discussion forum offered by the broker of your choosing. Some offices have seminars on site, other brokers offer webinars on line, and some firms have both.Recognize that one only requires the broker's website or mobile (Android/iOS) app to buy and sell. Other third party websites and mobile apps only may provide news and prices of interest.If using a mobile device on a public WiFi network to access your brokerage account, recognize your account login information and security is at risk. Turn off the device's WiFi and use the cellular telephone network instead.Have trouble finding an office in your area? Use Google Maps and search for \u201cstock brokers\u201d or similar phrases. If that does not help, as telephone books are almost extinct, ask the manager of your local bank, Better Business Bureau, or chamber of commerce for references.Fifth steps: Consider putting as much additional money as you can afford into your brokerage account to buy more shares. Note that doing so does not necessarily mean one should immediately purchase shares; opportunities may take time to evolve.Consider your risk tolerance when doing due diligence on choosing a stock, ETF or other investment product.Are you interested in or own shares in a company? Go to the investor relations and/or press relations page(s) of the corporate website and sign up for the email notifications of interest to you. You should be among the first to receive notices of SEC filings, product and services announcements, earnings and dividends.Recognize the basic differences between fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Both methods are useful in doing your due diligence; one method to the exclusion of the other is not necessarily the right course of action.Investing for the long term? Consider dollar-cost averaging and automatic dividend reinvestment. The compounding quickly adds up.Assuming all continues to be well with your choices, don't necessarily be in a hurry to sell. (It is not to say one should not take profits if appropriate.) Short-term and day-trading is at best stressful and may well result in loss of principal. (As you gain experience, then begin to explore such trading if you feel comfortable doing so.)Consider paying attention to rotations among market sectors -- https://www.msci.com/gics -- and perhaps adjust your holdings accordingly if necessary.Be wary of \"sure fire\" and \"guaranteed\" investing strategies or methodologies or \"top\" stock picks surfacing on websites and in your email inbox. If it sounds to good to be true...Don't waste time with penny stocks. Penny stocks are akin to juggling sharp knifes while blindfolded. The road is strewn with pump-and-dump boulders rolled out by those who would relieve you of your funds. Save your money and invest wisely in stocks of companies with proven track records.Safety Valves: Are you confused, frustrated, bored, lack the time, over your head -- whatever the reason -- or just don't care about or like managing your money, investments, and retirement planning? Find a fee-based (not commission-based) financial advisor using a phone book, library resources, Better Business Bureau, or references from your bank. Interview for a good fit.Have the fee-based financial planner lay out a plan that meets your perceived needs and that you can follow with minimal stress and fuss.Recognize that a financial plan should not be static. The plan probably should be reviewed and perhaps changed or updated as one ages and significant life events, e.g., career changes, marital status, dependents, real property acquisition, occur.Should you also choose to hire an investment advisor, choose a registered investment advisor with a Series 66 license -- a person who has passed an exam by North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) designed to qualify candidates as both securities agents and investment adviser representatives -- working in a managed platform that charges a nominal annual 1% (or not much more) commission as opposed to commissions.Confused about types of financial specialists? FINRA (Financial industry Regulatory Authority) offers an unbiased explanation -- http://www.finra.org/investors/choosing-investment-professional -- and resources to help.As you may not pay attention to tax forms, end-of-year statements, and IRA options, you may want to hire a tax accountant (interview for a good fit) to protect yourself from making mistakes. Be prepared to show the tax accountant the last few years of your federal and state tax returns. Be prepared to possibly identify and track unusual business/work or medical expenses.Footnotes: Consider taking notes, including questions to be asked in a class, forum or chatroom or of your broker's customer support, as you advance your knowledge. Paper and pencil works, but a cross-platform (desktop and mobile) software solution may be a better choice. Obviously there are numerous organizer and note-taking products -- including a word processor or text edtior -- to choose from, and flexibility and breadth of capabilities vary. If you opt to try a few products, a hint: ensure there is a compatible file import and export capability so that notes can be moved to a different product without rekeying.I prefer and use the cross-platform Evernote -- https://evernote.com/ -- product for its note-taking, webpage (e.g., articles, email) and photo capture, tagging and so much more, but that's me. There is a limited free version; i opted for the full version that has a small (compared to my investments) annual fee. (These notes were assembled and now maintained in Evernote.)Suggested readings (not inclusive, not ordered) on philosophy, concepts, strategies et al.

            "answer_text": "Step 1: Learn the basics of finance and accounting. Make sure you know how to read a balance sheet and profit and loss statement. Make sure you understand key financial ratios like PE, PB, etc. Desired Outcome: You should be able to identify the financial health of a company by looking at the financial statements. For example, you should know the year on year and quarter on quarter revenue growth of the company, year on year and quarter on quarter profit growth of the company, some important financial ratios like PE ratio, PB ratio, etc. Time Required: Around 15\u201320 hours. Step 2: Now, you need to pick an industry of your knowledge or interest. Read all the recent news about the development in the industry. Desired Outcome: You should be able to understand the macro environment which is not within the control of the company but impact the company directly or indirectly. For example, government policies, crude oil prices, etc. For example, if you pick banking then you should know about Bad Debt and the impact of recent RBI policies on the banking sector. Time required: Around 15\u201320 hours to begin. This will be a continues process to keep yourself updated. Step 3: Shortlist the companies from the industry of your knowledge or interest 3.a) Shortlist the top companies/ market leaders in the industry. For example, HSBC in banking. Time required: 5 hours 3.b) Look around and identify the product/services you love. For example, a lot of people started wearing Jockey in last 10 years. We all love it. Now, look at the company which sell Jockey. Page industries share price was around 450 in the year 2008. Today it is around 30000 in 2018. That\u2019s around 70 times return in the last 10 years. Can you find any other company today with great future potential? Think about it\u2026 Step 4: Open a trading account with ZERO brokerage. Why pay a brokerage on every transaction when you have the option to invest your money for free. Time required: Few days from document verification to account opening. Step 5: Start slow. Do not invest a lot of money together. Keep following the stock and industry and keep learning. Observe how the stock behave when the market is good and the real test is when the market is bad. Nobody can make perfect decisions. Stock market investment is not a fixed formula but it is a combination of experience with knowledge. Things to keep in mind and mistakes to avoid Always go with blue-chip companies ( top companies with a proven track record). Do not but penny stock or cheap stock. Most of the penny stocks fail.Do not buy any stock based on advice from TV experts, friends, etc. Do not join those trading groups on Whatsapp and Facebook.

            "answer_text": "One of the Best Startegy for Stock Market Investing is to buy Current Salman Khan instead of Searching for new Salman Khan which may or may not happen. Also, below are few ways to find multibagger stocks. Page Industry gave 6000% return in past 10 years while RCom, Suzlon etc gave 96-98% losses in the same period. What is really going on? In reality, equity investment is more of a art than a science:- 1. In case of fundamentally strong shares, more you keep them, better are the returns. In case of many bad stocks, even in case of large caps and also in case of many good companies but in bad businesses, the more you keep them, the worse the losses become. 2. When you buy a stock going in downtrend for averaging out, it's called \"catching a falling knife\" which may simply double the rate of fall and will hurt like anything while, when you buy a fundamentally strong, high quality stock, at or around the trend reversal area after a good fall, one may get a multibagger return too. 3. Simply keeping high quality, fundamentally strong stocks for long is a great idea but even they have corrected almost 30-50% few times in history and thus booking profits once in a while is also a good habit. 4. One of the best ways to find quality mid cap/small cap stocks is to go by pedigree. For example, Mahindra CIE from Mahindra group started as a joint venture with some MNC to play as a nice company with consistent sales and profits, may make it a multibagger. 5. Another good way to find multibagger mid cap and small cap is to go for quality franchise businesses. Page industry is a franchise of Jocky Innerwears, Jubilient Foodworks is a franchise of Dominoes, Varun Beverages is a bottle distributer of Coke etc. 6. Key here is to try your best to keep profits above 20% in few good shares and then you may keep them for life too as it should surpass most losses/downtrends after that generally. 7. Being a art, you may do everything possible and still may go wrong. Don't regret and don't lose patience. Pls remember max you can lose at in any share is \"100%\" theoretically but you can always gain many times of \"100%\" in multibaggers and good shares for long term so gains are unlimited while losses are limited in equity investments. 8. Best way of making great return across all asset categories and across all locations, time periods etc still is and will always be \"Compounding Effect of Time\" hence buy a fundamentally strong fast moving stock and keep them for long term. 9. Best returns are generally obtained just after any major fall in the market similar to the fact the sunrise happens just after the darkest part of night is over. 10. Lastly, Pls avoid searching for next Salman Khan and Next Page Industries. The next Page in the story of Page Industry is nothing but \"Page Industry\" itself. If all the advantages are still the same, then there is no absolutely reason the company should not give multibagger even now. CMP means \"nothing\" in investments. It is only \"change in price\" ie profit or loss which actually matters. Hope it helps.

            "answer_text": "Read everything you can by Martin Armstrong. I was a novice investors, played with some subscription investment services when I came across Martin. He was making some claims very contrary to my beliefs that I had married to in regards to how markets function. When I realised his projections where true and the ideas I had clung to where losing money, I needed to understand why. This is when I started reading his work. Through this enlightenment period I got out of precious metals ten years ago and have been long blue chips ever since. It's been the most remarkable reverse of fortune. The best advice is actually simple. Find a market with a consistent reliable long term performance like the NYSE or HK. Buy index funds in it for long term growth 5 to 20 years. You can adjust your exposure through etfs which can be leveraged for more aggressive investors. If you had leveraged etfs over the last 5 years you would be looking at returns of 100% per year. It's really not rocket science. By reading Martin's Daily blogs and following his long term projections you can adjust risk as the climate requires to prepare for potential corrections and or crash. Use stops, know how to use them, requires some technical training but also not rocket science. Don't invest emotionally, markets beat like your heart, they have cycles and the more you look at them that way the more the cycles will emerge. Don't be tempted to day trade if you are a beginner. The odds are heavily stacked against you. I tell everyone this free advice. I took and aggressive stake in an ETF symbol known as UDOW around 5 years ago, despite some bad years at the end of Obama's presidency, it went from just under 25 per share to over 100. Udow is a leveraged 3x bull DJIA index fund which is sold as an ETF. If you don't know these terms take a few moments to understand basic investment lingo. There is no reason why the NYSE will collapse in the near future. I was stopped out in early 2018 during the last correction, this means my stocks sold automatically with a 4% loss. This is a very small loss compared to the gains of 4 fold. This allowed me to buy back into the market with discounts of around 10%. If you don't want to leverage then buying blue chips like Apple, Boeing, Cat, Microsoft, American Express are well know very stable performance stocks. Or you can buy non leveraged etfs that act as index funds. ",

            "answer_text": "Before you go out an open a broker account and buy a stock because someone told you to, you need to ask yourself some hard questions. The first is why are you doing this? Easy answer is to make money but what is your goal for all this. You want to grow your savings because\u2026. Next you need to decide how much time you are willing to commit to investing. You have to be really honest here and I will be honest. Investing, especially requires a lot of work, to analyze, evaluate and make decisions about companies and stocks. It\u2019s very time consuming and it is also quite repetitive. You need to be honest about answering if you really have the time and want to spend this time figuring out what stocks to buy and sell. The other factor is where you are in your life. When I started investing in my early 20\u2019s, I was single and had a lot of time on my hands and I was motivated to analyze companies and crunch numbers. I spent hours upon hours. Now I\u2019m married with 2 little kids and my time is much more limited. It\u2019s harder but I\u2019m committed and passionate about investing so I try to make it work. Are you willing? For a lot people, from my experience I would can\u2019t be bothered with investing. The good news is that\u2019s totally OK as there are strategies and products out there that can give us exposure to investing in stocks with minimal work effort. The key here is to define your investing path that is compatible with your lifestyle. I see a lot of people getting into investing with the default position of having to buy stocks and then getting into trouble and falling off their investing path and into a ditch. The great news is you don\u2019t have to go off to the Himalayas to find and define your investing path. A simple 30\u201345 minute conversation with someone like an investment coach can quickly define an appropriate investing path for you. It\u2019s critical to first define your investing path as it will give you focus on what types of investing you need to understand and what types of strategies you will deploy in your investing playbook. Once that is done, you then need to begin the ongoing journey of developing your investing competencies. From my experience, the people who I\u2019ve seen that are very successful in investing possess 3 core competencies: Competency 1: They are educated Successful investors have a baseline level of financial literacy. They understand the mechanics of evaluating, buying and selling stocks and ETF\u2019s. They also understand the behavioural aspects of investing. They are very aware of the various emotional biases that can cloud their decision making. I need to be clear here. I am not talking about having an Ivy League education or some upper echelon form of financial training like an MBA, or pHD or CFA. You don\u2019t need that. You do need to have a fundamental understanding of principles of how stocks work, how stocks behave and how to analyze and evaluate them. You also need to be aware of the behavioural biases that were are all in conflict with on a daily basis that can cloud our judgement when we make investment decisions. Competency 2: They are engaged People have a hard time with investing because they simply just don\u2019t do it enough. At the most, people are actively looking at how their money is working when they receive quarterly statements and even then they have a hard time understanding if they are going in the right direction. We don\u2019t commit the time to learn and practice investing. If we\u2019re not engaged in the investing process, we will not receive meaningful feedback (which is ironic because technology gives us real-time feedback on the progress of our portfolios) and we will be less likely to improve our development. Competency 3: They are empowered When we increase our education and literacy level and when we start practicing and engaging in the process of investing, another competency will develop which is empowerment. The more we engage and practice making decisions in buying and selling investments, the more experience we will get and that leads to confidence. Confidence does not mean chest-thumping and bragging. Confidence implies you develop a comfort level for the process and a process that works for you. When you make decisions, you don\u2019t hesitate. The great thing is I strongly believe that these competencies can be developed by anyone. The key is making a commitment to learning and practicing investing, which for a lot of people is not high on their priority and that\u2019s OK as there are other investing paths available. So the advice I would give you in terms of how to go about investing in the stock market is before you open that broker account to first define your investing path. Then build your competencies. Educate yourself about key principles of investing, then practice it and engage in the process. Show up. If you can make the commitment to develop these competencies, it will serve you well and will bear great fruit for you in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Select your investing style There are several ways to approach stock investing. Choose the option below that best represents your situation: \u201cI\u2019m the DIY type and am interested in choosing stocks and stock funds for myself.\u201d Keep reading; this article breaks down things hands-on investors need to know. Or, if you already know the stock-buying game and just need a brokerage, see our round-up of the best online stock brokers.\u201cI know stocks can be a great investment, but I\u2019d like someone to manage the process for me.\u201d You may be a good candidate for a robo-advisor, a service that offers low-cost investment management. Virtually all of the major brokerage firms offers these services today, which invest your money for you based on your specific goals.2. Open an accountGenerally speaking, to invest in stocks, you need an investment account. For the hands-on types, this usually means a brokerage account. For those who would like a little help, opening an account through a robo-advisor is a sensible option. We break down both processes below. Worth noting: A 401(k) is a type of investment account, and if you\u2019re participating in one, you may already be invested in stocks, likely through mutual funds. However, a 401(k) won\u2019t offer you access to individual stocks, and your choice in mutual funds will likely be quite limited. Employer matching dollars make it worth contributing despite a limited investment selection, but once you\u2019re contributing enough to earn that match, you can consider investing through other accounts. 3. Know the difference between stocks and stock mutual funds Going the DIY route? Don\u2019t worry. Stock investing doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. For most people, stock market investing means choosing among these two investment types: Stock (also called equity) mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. These mutual funds let you purchase small pieces of many different stocks in a single transaction. Index funds and ETFs are a kind of mutual fund that track an index; for example, a Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 fund replicates that index by buying the stock of the companies in it. When you invest in a fund, you also own small pieces of each of those companies. You can put several funds together to build a diversified portfolio.Individual stocks. If you\u2019re after a specific company, you can buy a single share or a few shares as a way to dip your toe into the stock-trading waters. Building a diversified portfolio out of many individual stocks is possible, but it takes a significant investment.4. Set a budget New investors often have two questions in this step of the process: How much money do I need to start investing in stocks? The amount of money you need to buy an individual stock depends on how expensive the shares are. (Share prices can range from just a few dollars to a few thousand dollars.) If you want mutual funds and have a small budget, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) may be your best bet. Mutual funds often have minimums of $1,000 or more, but ETFs trade like a stock, which means you purchase them for a share price (potentially $10 or less on the low end).How much money should I invest in stocks? If you\u2019re investing through funds \u2014 have we mentioned this is our preference? \u2014 you can allocate a fairly large portion of your portfolio toward stock funds, especially if you have a long time horizon. A 30-year-old investing for retirement might have 80% of his or her portfolio in stock funds; the rest would be in bond funds. Individual stocks are another story. We\u2019d recommend keeping these to 10% or less of your investment portfolio.5. Start investing Stock investing is filled with intricate strategies and approaches, yet some of the most successful investors have done little more than stick with the basics. That generally means using funds for the bulk of your portfolio \u2014 Warren Buffett has famously said a low-cost S&P 500 index fund is the best investment most Americans can make \u2014 and choosing individual stocks only if you believe in the company\u2019s potential for long-term growth.

            "answer_text": "Actually investing in stocks, are way more easier then you can think about it. And to start that journey you need to open brokerage account. Personally I can suggest to use GTO Markets, for that purposes. To invest in stocks, the second thing you need to do is put together a list of stocks that you want to invest in. This is the harder part of stock investing. While some suggest that you only invest in what you know, it's actually not that simple. You should also understand if the company is profitable, and most importantly, what the future looks like for that company. Top get started, we strongly suggest you subscribe to a reputable stock advisory service. When you subscribe to that service, you will get a few picks each month. Read their analysis and then use your own judgement. Some different styles of investing include: Swing Trader A swing trading position is held longer than a day trading position, but shorter than a buy and hold investment strategy that can be held for months or years. Typically, a tradable asset would be held for days at a time in order to profit from price changes or 'swings.\u2019 Profits can be attained by either buying an asset or by short selling. Value Investing A value investor believes that the market overreacts to both good and bad news. He/she would look for stocks that they believe the market has undervalued; thereby profiting by buying when the price is deflated. Growth Investing Growth investors invest in companies that show above-average growth. Growth investing focuses on capital appreciation. Growth investing kind of contrasts with value investing. Great chess players don't sit at a board and just\u2026play. Masters of the game have a very concrete plan of how they intend to play. They decision-making that can adapt to whatever their opponents throw at them. Investing is no different: you need a plan to guide your investment decisions! ",

            "answer_text": "Read my answer carefully which will definitely help you to grab some knowledge. First of all, everyone knows it game of long term so you will have always best return on longer run as compare to short time period. Buy and hold strategies work too good on blue chips company and midcap firm which have high probability or good earnings growth. In this kind of company your you might be getting return in terms of multiple. On the shorter side if you have good knowledge about stock market than you can try to find fundamentally good and also technically strong firm which will give you best return compare to index of any others for short term period only. Or else you can take a help of advisory firm which will help you identify good company and make you profitable. Investing in stock market can make people rich and it can make you poor also. Stock market is like Ocean. It looks beautiful and it\u2019s scary too. As you know we have to learn everything before entering into the Ocean, here also you have to learn everything before investing. If you are not aware about the risk involved and you don\u2019t have sufficient knowledge, you may loose your entire capital. If you want to be rich or wealthy from stock market, you have to learn how to earn. If you are not earning after learning, you have to change the way you think and you have to improvise yourself. There are 2 major ways in Indian stock market which makes us rich. InvestmentTrading.If you are thinking that earning few thousands for few days or few months is not calling a rich. When you earn in millions on consistent basis and fulfil all your dreams out of that, it is called rich. And yes I know those people who became rich from stock market as I am born and brought up in Mumbai, I know and I have seen this stock market very closely and I know hundreds of people who earned lacs of rupees and lost too. I know many people who does 50 Cr to 100 Cr turnover in a day in day trading and 10 lacs to 20 lacs they are earning or loosing. So everyone has their own definition of becoming a rich. Few people are happy with some extra monthly income and few people are not even satisfied after earning 5 lac per month from stock market.I know many Traders/Arbitragers/Investors who earned huge money from stock market and their routine is to gain something everyday by their talent. Mumbai is full of traders and investors who makes money out of stock market. See knowledge and skill in trading can give you best results in stock market and it comes with experience. You have to learn everything in order to make money consistently. If you are capable enough to devote time and you have patience to learn everything by investing time, you should learn everything to be self dependent. But if you don\u2019t have patience and time and you want to earn without waiting, you should take guidance of some SEBI registered advisors who can help you in day trading. Trading by yourself without having proper skills and knowledge can ruin your capital and through you out of this market.I can\u2019t say that I became Rich from stock market because dreams are endless and there are no limits of expectations specially when you are living in Mumbai but yes I earned good money from stock market. Reason for that is I have given more than 10 years to this market to learn everything, I tried and followed many people and advisory companies but never give up. Investment: Investment in stock market for long term can make you rich. It requires large capital to be invested as well as time frame. Getting rich with investment needs patience. Impatient people can\u2019t get money through investment.Suppose you have invested in metals like Tata steel, JSW Steel, Hindalco, VEDL when they were at 52 week low before 2 years, you must be getting 100% to 500% returns in 2 years. But it requires patience. I bought VEDL around 68 but I was impatient and booked at 95 only thinking that I am getting 50% return in 15 days. so main thing is patience which required in order to generate huge profit. Also you need to invest your capital for longer term. Trading: Trading is what we do for short term which involves risk but also generate large profit if you have talent to use momentum of market. Whether market is bullish or bearish, trading can be done on both side in F&O segment which requires less capital compared to investment for long term. Trading can be beneficial in case you don\u2019t have large capital or you can\u2019t hold for long time. Conclusion is that we can make good money from stock market if we are passionate about this. This market gives us huge money if we are capable enough to take that. We have to be capable enough to earn in millions, explore different options and keep on trying until you are succeed.You can read my previous answer to improve your skill in trading.

            "answer_text": "This is not investment advice. You should seek a licensed financial advisor for advice. Blah blah  Ok, why do you want to invest in stocks? Do you mean individual stocks or are you willing to buy an index fund, for instance, which includes many stocks? If your goal is just to get rich, then I suggest reading \"The Automatic Millionaire\" or \"I will Teach You to be Rich,\" as they are a more comprehensive blueprint than this answer. If your goal is to learn how to beat millionaire money managers on Wall Street at a zero sum game which they have fixed in their favor, then all I can say is 'best of luck.' If getting rich is your goal, that's pretty simple. 1. Start saving and investing consistently from a young age. 2. Don't lose money- this is Warren Buffett's #1 rule, but I think it's more important to just get started so you can learn as you go, even if it means losing a little bit. 3. Automate everything possible- use automatic pay deductions to fund both pre and post-tax IRAs. Automatically rebalance your portfolio, if possible. 4. Put your money in stock indexes, and 'blue chip' stocks which are undervalued (read \"The Intelligent Investor\" for more on this). Hold onto these for the long-term, just invest and forget about them. 5. Practice incremental money management to avoid devastating crashes by moving, say, up to 40% of your money out of stocks and into cash and/or bonds at the top of the market (judging by historical highs). Liquidate those you expect to perform the worst, i.e. those which became the most overvalued when Mr Greed ruled the markets. 6. Liquidate bonds and incrementally plow all cash into indexes and blue chip stocks when the market reaches historical lows. Buy those stocks which are fundamentally sound but got beaten up the worst when Mr Fear took over the market.  5 and 6, in other words, are saying to 'get greedy when the market is fearful, and get fearful when the market is greedy.' This is how to buy low and sell high. Don't get caught up in the hype.  All this is easier said than done, but really shouldn't take more than 10 minutes per month once it's set up and you get the hang of it. My #7 is start an investment club with some friends. This strategy will help educate everyone in the group, improve accountability, and give you more confidence in your decisions. Check out my club at Five Luther College grads investing in the future\u2026 to learn how we run ours. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "As you have said, you don\u2019t know anything about the stock market. It is not an easy field to venture, unlike what you might hear from others. So I suggest you do a lot of research first. You can start by understanding how the stock market operates. If you are still determined to invest, here\u2019s how you can start making money through the stock market: Research about the marketBefore investing your money on random stocks that you aren\u2019t even sure if they\u2019ll appreciate or depreciate their value, you should first research on the current market trends. There are a lot of websites that regularly update investors on market reports. You can use these to see which stocks are likely to increase their value. Once you have a solid choice of stock, then you can start investing in it.Choose an online broker siteNow that you have a stock in mind, the next step is to find an online broker site that offers trading on the stocks you want. Choosing a trading site requires a lot of research. Make sure to read reviews of the site you want before you create an account with them. The trading site should always be trustworthy and have high integrity based on their past transactions to make sure your money will be well taken care of.Practice on a demo accountOnce you have picked a reliable online broker site, you can now create an account with them. Most of the time, these broker sites offer the creation of a demo account which you can use to practice your trading skills and formulate trading strategies. The good thing about a demo account is you can experience how trading really works with virtual money so gaining or losing money is not a problem as it is simply a simulation of a real trading process.Create your trading accountNow that you have practiced your skills and developed your trading strategies, you can proceed to creating a live trading account where you can invest real money. Trading sites usually offer several different types of accounts. Make sure to choose one that fits your trading plan or lifestyle. For example, if you are a beginner, you can start with the minimum account to try out your trading strategies first.Choose and buy reliable stocksBuying your first stocks is also a crucial part in trading as this would test your analytical skills. You should buy stocks from dominating companies that you positively think will increase value. Make sure to read about the company\u2019s previous stock records to make sure you only invest in a profitable company. In case the stocks you have brought depreciate, do not be afraid because the market usually fluctuates a lot and there is still a possibility that your stocks will regain its value.Monitor the market dailyNow that you have your own stocks, you should always monitor the market and make sure they are always in a profitable favor. You should also be updated on the stocks that enter the trend so you can invest in these and gain more profits. Also, set a stop loss to make sure you have full control of your assets. This is important so that you can make sure not to lose more than what you can afford to.Consider reinvesting your profitsTrading doesn\u2019t end in buying and selling of stocks once. Of course you can always withdraw the money you have accumulated in your account. But also consider reinvesting them into other stocks so you can have a higher chance of greater profit. This is a way to make a stable living through online trading. Just make sure that even though you are handling several different stocks at the same time, you can monitor each stock to ensure they are still creating bigger profits.Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll need to go through a mutual fund company or a broker. But before you do that, you want to make sure you\u2019re knowledgeable about the subject of investing. First off, you want your investments to be: Low-cost (increases your potential return)Well diversified (reduces your risk)Focused on long-term results (removes emotional behavior)You also need to realize that whenever you invest, you can potentially lose all that money. Don\u2019t invest with money you can\u2019t afford to lose. Instead of picking stocks (leave this for the experts - even they struggle with it!), I suggest investing in index funds. Index funds are collections of stocks (or other investment types) that mirror major indexes (like the S&P 500). They\u2019re a low-cost, well diversified option for you right off the bat. But how do you know which one(s) to pick?  That\u2019s where your education comes into play. Instead of spending countless hours teaching yourself how to invest, find an expert or two that can make good use of your time and present information in an easy-to-digest manner. The How to Invest Money Wisely Course is a 30-minute animated video course that comes with loads of excellent supplemental materials. It\u2019s designed to teach beginners how to go from step 1 to being a knowledgeable investor. Upon completion, you\u2019ll be able to: Evaluate and analyze stocks/mutual funds/ETFs like the experts do.Build your own investment strategy for achieving your long-term financial goals.Manage your own portfolio without paying an advisor.Take advantage of both bull and bear markets.Put your plan into action and start investing right away!It does cost money, but given the long-term value of the information you\u2019re absorbing (how to minimize costs, look for good investments, cultivate winning behavior, and maximize returns), I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t regret your decision. For people that want to just dip a toe for now, The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Investing Like a Pro Webinar is a free way to learn: Key investment principlesThe benefits of investingWhat you\u2019re giving up by not investingI love when young people are interested in investing.

            "answer_text": "I am going to explain one of my successful investing strategies that may help my fellow investors. This strategy is super simple to understand and very easy to implement but has extraordinary returns. The idea behind this strategy is quite different than that of fundamental analysis, technical analysis, value investing, growth investing, etc. It\u2019s similar to momentum investing. Here is the backtested results of a similar strategy for the past 13 years from 2006 to 2018. The compound annual growth rate or CAGR of this strategy is 20.38% while the CAGR of Nifty50 is 10.88%. This strategy has outperformed the Nifty50 index by CAGR 9.5% for 13 years.  Note:This is a rough estimate due to some constraints while backtesting.I have not considered the dividends.I have not included the interest on the idle funds that result at some times.I have not considered the brokerage and other charges. By considering the brokerage, other charges, dividends, and interest on idle funds the actual returns will be more than the backtested results. I believe that the readers here understand the effect of compounding of returns more than 20% CAGR . Just to illustrate the difference, with 20.38% CAGR Rs. 10 Lakh will grow to Rs. 1.1 Crore while with 10.88% CAGR Rs. 10 Lakh will grow to only Rs. 38.3 Lakh. Here are the live positions (as on 25 June, 2019, one year old) of stocks owned by me based on similar strategies.    Based on the back tested results for 13 years and real investing results for few years, I expect this strategy to beat the market returns in the long run. Now I will briefly explain my way of shortlisting the stocks and managing them till their exits. For this strategy I have chosen Nifty500 as my stock universe. I chose the stocks from this Nifty500 index. Sort the 500 stocks based on the recent 1 year performance from highest to lowest returns. Here, the top 10 stocks are my pick. It\u2019s as simple as that. Buy all the 10 stocks the next day. Divide the total investment equally among all the 10 stocks. The most vital part of this simple strategy is managing the exits. I have 2 simple exit rules. The first exit rule: Have a stop loss of 25% from the entry price. The second exit rule: If a stock doesn\u2019t get stopped by its stop loss then exit after 1 year. In this strategy, I don\u2019t have a price based target. I am not putting any cap on the growth of the stock price. This means a stock can deliver 5%, 70%, 180%, 950%, etc. kind of returns. I am limiting the loss to 25% of every stock. In case of a loss, this comes down to 2.5% of the total investment. I believe that it\u2019s a very good risk management practice.  This was my super simple strategy. It believe that I have implemented all the qualities of a good investment strategy as per my knowledge and experience. I have seen huge success this simple strategy and I have applied in my investments now. I have explained this strategy in the video Super Simple Strategy to Beat the Market Returns. Watch it for better understanding of this strategy.  I have built a portfolio of stocks (in the last week of May 2019) based on this strategy and here the list of stocks. Adani PowerAdani TransmissionAstrazeneca Pharma IndiaBalrampur Chini MillsBata IndiaDCM ShriramInfo Edge (India), the stock symbol is NAUKRIMerck, now it has become Procter & Gamble HealthTube Investments of IndiaVinati OrganicsI first disclosed these stocks in the video Top 10 Stocks to Invest in 2019 (with Live Stock Portfolio Tracker)  I track all these stocks from entries to exits. I want my my fellow investors can also see the performance of these stocks at any time. So I have put them in an online live portfolio tracker: Top 10 Stocks Invested in 2019 - Live Stock Portfolio I understand that there are many ways to succeed. This is one of my successful strategies. Thanks for reading! ### Disclaimer: All information provided by me is intended to be used and must be used for informational and educational purposes only.

            "answer_text": " I got into investing a number of years ago because of Google. This was a while after the IPO, sadly, but I knew that it was going to be something big. Because of the commercials, Etrade was the first broker that came to mind when I finally decided to buy some stock. I went to the site, set up an account, and bought myself a couple shares. From that point on, I was hooked. Since I follow the tech world closely, I\u2019d make some speculative bets every once in a while but not on a consistent basis. At least not until Robinhood came out with its free trades. The trading fees at Etrade were always holding me back. I just couldn\u2019t stand the thought of taking such a loss right at the beginning of a trade. The free trading with Robinhood means I\u2019m able to buy more stocks in smaller amounts without worrying about the effect on my returns. I still invest in tech stocks every once in a while, but a few years back I switched most of my attention to dividend investing. Building up a large portfolio of dividend paying stocks means a passive income for life. There is a lot less speculation, too. Focusing on dividend paying stocks means you\u2019re typically focusing on value stocks. Companies that have been around for a while and are well established. It\u2019s a methodology that Warren Buffett has used to smashing success. If you\u2019re just starting out, the one recommendation I\u2019d make is buy stocks with the intent to hold for years and years. Having a long investment horizon means you\u2019ve got better odds for success. Plus, it\u2019ll keep you away from speculative day trading and penny stocks which are both VERY risky games. ",

            "answer_text": "As per my experience I would give you one best advise before going into investment in stock market please acquire some good knowledge of stock market like How stock market is working ,what are the possibility etc . if you are thinking investment by own and not taking any financial advise. Secondly apply some strategy or trial error on paper not in actual investment for some time or by making small investment not like I will put my all money on starting path.Keep in mind some basic principal Money Management,Risk Reward ratio and Emotional Attachment.One of my favorite line is don't love with stocks if your stock going beyond your strategy or not working please book loss that will protect you from big loss and same capital you can use in some other stocks. One of the big challenge in stock market is to book losses on my journey I find that peoples are afraid to book losses they all think stock will recover we will exit in inner mind they also know there is nothing in stocks to recover.Trader or investors making their mind fools like I am sure stock will not go down from this level or it will recover within this sure shot time.One of the best example is RCOM I know public are saying nothing will happen because it's Reliance there is Mukeesh Ambani stock will bounce back but they don't understand company is not related to Mukesh Ambani or Reliance Industry RCOM is totally different product and their business also gone and in last they understand and made huge loss In this example I want just learn to booking losses otherwise your capital will erode and not invest in stock because one person or some support look at overall position because if that supports or person exit company business will go down there lot of example of like this company. Another things regards to strategy is on which price we will booked profit.On which price we booked profit only one strategy on what basis you invested on stock if that basic not remain in stock you can exit that level.Supposed if you invested in company by product if that product not making participation in business and no further growth you can exit. Don't do a investment like Gambling .If you lossed on some stock that doesn't means you will do averaging or again investing money on that stock by thinking I will sure shot recover losses from same stock you go for other stocks also. Do some research before investing in stock market like Quantitative analysis and Qualitative analysis if you are not able to do that please take some good financial planner advice just about little bit fees but they will protect from financial problem in long term instead of doing just by flow of public and making losses ***********THANKS FOR READING*********** If you have any other questions or queries you can send me a message I will happy to reply.

            "answer_text": " Investing styles are similar to religions, only slightly less combative (although I\u2019ve seen some discussions get quite heated). So after having decided that commodity trading was not where I would hang out my shingle, I decided to focus on something a little simpler: equities. Within equity investing there are two main schools of thought. One is the \u201cvalue\u201d camp and the other is the \u201cmomentum\u201d camp. They basically represent fundamental vs. technical analysis at the core. Value investors tend to be fundamental bottom up investors who enjoy doing financial analysis and looking for investments that are trading below their intrinsic value to make their returns. Value investors use a variety of screens or tools to search for mispriced assets always including a \u201cmargin of safety\u201d before entering a trade and oftentimes sitting out of markets in the absence of opportunity. It\u2019s classic Warren Buffett style investing and it requires a certain type of personality to be good at. Most importantly it requires patience and independent critical thinking along with emotional balance. Momentum investing, on the other hand, is more trading oriented. These investors are market technicians who look at charts all day and are able to trade based on patterns and signals. They use technical analysis, a method of using past prices to forecast future action with the claim that all of investor psychology, money flow and market information lies within the charts (price). Momentum investors usually try to capture the middle 80% of a trend instead of necessarily trying to call the tops and bottoms and they usually use trailing stops to ensure they take profit on large moves. I now tend to veer towards the \u201cvalue\u201d camp when looking at investments but it is important to respect the fact that the markets are indeed abundant and really one should not let their ego get in the way of considering technical analysis as well when making investment decisions. It is important to consider the trigger points of technical traders such as the 200 day moving average, or key resistance/support levels since these things do matter and affect price action whether you believe it or not.

            "answer_text": "Investing in stock market has always been one of my favorite ways to grow my money. If you are a beginner looking for tips to make money in stock market, here\u2019s a detailed step-by-step plan to get you started in your investing journey the right way.. But before that, I want to share a story with you. A friend of ours recently said to us, \u201d I want to invest in stocks. Any good stocks to buy? \u201c He is a doctor and makes good money, but he has never invested in stocks before. His original plan was to just save enough money and buy another property for rental income because his mum is a seasoned real estate broker and has made quite a lot of money from investing in rental properties. So, when he told us that he wanted to get into stock investing, we were a bit surprised. Although we are not sure why he suddenly wants to start investing in stock market, that is not important right now. What is important is that he is approaching stock market investing the wrong way. Why? Because you should not put your hard earned money in investments that you know nothing about. Of course, we didn\u2019t give him any stock recommendation. Here\u2019s the problem with buying stocks blindly based on friend\u2019s recommendation or tips. Possibility #1: The stock your friends recommend is a winning stock. That\u2019s good for you. But it\u2019s possible that the stock price could go down first and stay down for a prolonged period of time before it goes up eventually. During this downtrend, do you have the conviction of holding onto the stock to capture the long term gain? As the only reason why you bought the stock is that your friend thinks that it is a good stock, you would not be able to stay calm in the face of increasing paper losses. Possibility #2: The stock your friends recommend is a losing stock. This is a very real possibility because no one can predict where the stock price will go in the future. In the case that the stock goes south, do you have the knowledge and experience to recognize the warning signs of a losing stock? And also have the discipline to cut your losses short? Chances are not. Because the only reason why you invested in the stock in the first place is that your friend told you to. So, instead of giving him stock recommendations, we suggested that he should learn about stock market investing first. Basics About Stock Investing Now let\u2019s talk about some basics about stock investing. What Is Stock Market? And How It Works. \u201d According to Wikipedia, a stock market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses.\u201d So, how does a stock market work? Companies who need to raise money issues shares. These shares, in turn, are being traded on stock exchange such as New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Trader and investors buy and sell these shares based on how much they think the shares are worth or which direction the share price will go. Four Different Ways To Make Money In Stock Market Buy low and sell highThis is quite straight forward. You buy a stock at a low price and sell it at a higher price for a nice profit. It works the same way as you buy goods at wholesale prices and re-sell it for profit at much higher retail price. If you have a strong conviction that the stock price will go up over time, you can buy it now and then sell it off when the price has gone up to your take-profit price. Short sell high and buy back at low priceYou can also make money by short selling the stock at a high price, and then buying it back at a lower price later on. When you short sell a stock, you will need to borrow the stocks first before you can short sell it. This is a regulatory requirement. There is one exception. If you are doing day trading, you are not required to borrow the stocks because you will have bought back the stock before market close. Note: The regulatory requirements regarding short selling differ from country to country. So, you will have to check and make sure that you comply with it. Earn dividend income from the stocksThere is a group of stockS called dividend stocks in the stock market. The underlying companies of these dividend stocks pay out dividend payments to shareholders once or twice a year based on their dividend schedule. Examples of dividend stocks are The Coca-Cola Co, Philip Morris International and IBM. Sell options on stocksOption is a contract where the seller of the option contract agrees to buy/sell the underlying stock at a pre-agreed price (i.e. strike price) at a pre-agreed expiration date from the buyer of the option contract. When you sell option on stocks, you collect premiums from the option buyer. In other words, you get paid upfront when you sell options. If the option contracts expire worthless, you keep the money for free. A Step-by-Step Plan To Make Money In Stock Market Step 1: Understand your investment objectives First, you need to understand your investment objectives. What goals do you want to achieve through your investments? Do you want long term capital appreciation? Or would you like to generate stable dividend income from your investments every year? Or are you interested in short term investment gains? Or are you looking for monthly investing income? The reason why you need to figure out your investment objective is that you will be able to find an investment strategy that can help you get the results you want. Step 2: Learn the fundamentals about stock market investing Now, you have identified your investment objectives. What you do next is to learn the fundamentals about investing in stock market. So, what fundamentals do you need to know? Here\u2019s a few important topics: Basics about stock marketStock market behaviorInvestment strategyRisk managementMoney managementInvestment psychologyWithout the necessary knowledge, you will find it difficult to understand the hows and whys. Step 3: Choose an investment strategy that suits your objectives and your profile There are many different investment strategies for you to choose from. Let say, you want to generate stable dividend income from your stock investments year after year. Based on that, the best investment strategy for you would be dividend growth investing strategy. Here\u2019s its definition from wikipedia: \u201cDividend growth investing strategy involves investing in company shares according to the future dividends forecast to be paid. Companies that pay consistent and predictable dividends tend to have less volatile share prices.\u201d By investing in dividend growth companies specifically, you will be able to build a portfolio of dividend stocks that pay out consistent dividend income year after year. Step 4: Build a portfolio With your chosen investment strategy, it is time to build your stock portfolio. Here are some questions to help you with your portfolio construction process: How many stocks do you want to include in your portfolio?What sectors do these stocks come from?What is the weight given to each sector or each stock in your portfolio?When you build your portfolio, you don\u2019t want to have just one stock in your entire portfolio or just stocks from one particular sector. Why? Because you are putting all your eggs in one basket. Doing so will give you high concentration risk. To avoid high concentration risk, the key is to have a diversified portfolio. Similarly, having too many stocks is not good either. Because it will not help optimize your portfolio performance. 100 different stocks will give you average returns that match the stock market index performance, while 15 to 20 hand-picked good stocks could give you exceptional returns. When it comes to portfolio construction, you always have to strike a balance between performance and risk. Step 5: Risk management Money and risk management is one of the most important aspects of investing. Without good money and risk management, it\u2019s certain that you won\u2019t succeed in investing. So, what is good money and risk management? Good risk management means that you should always set the maximum risk you are taking on the individual stock level, sector level and portfolio level. For example, your entire investment account is $20,000. The maximum risk you want to take on the individual level is 5% of your entire account. If your loss is about to exceed 5%, you will cut loss. Many people end up losing a lot of money mostly because they don\u2019t cut loss when they should have. Here\u2019s the Risk to Ruin table. It helps you understand why managing your risk and controlling your risk is vitally important to your investment success.  Step 6: Review your portfolio Once you have built your portfolio, your job is not over yet. You still need to periodically review your portfolio. Sometimes, some stocks in your portfolio might go up substantially while other stocks never really move much or might even go down. In cases such as this, you might encounter a situation where your exposure to a particular stock or a particular group of stocks is too high. What you would need to do is to re-balance the portfolio by reducing your holding in this particular stock or this particular group of stocks and increasing your holding proportionally in the other stocks. Another reason why you need to re-evaluate your portfolio regularly is that your investment objectives might change over time. When this happens, your current portfolio might no longer be appropriate.

            "answer_text": "The mechanics are quite simple. Open an account with a broker or an online trading platform. Put in money and place your orders. There will be paperwork to do along the way but none of this is terribly complicated. The more important consideration implied in your question by the use of the term \u201cinvest\u201d, rather than \u201cspeculate\u201d, is more involved. Investing is buying productive assets and holding them for their income and growth potential. This requires understanding of business, finance as well as market behaviour. You want to be able to identify investment-worthy businesses, and evaluate what a reasonable price is to buy their shares. You don't worry about daily price movements because your focus is not on price but on value. It\u2019s about returns on investment. Investing is totally different to speculating. When you speculate, the value of what you speculate on is secondary to the price movements, It is all about trying to profit from price differentials. Buy low, sell higher. You can even make money on bankrupt companies (like Hertz). Understand the difference, then learn the fundamentals. There is no easy way to make money consistently on the stock market.

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re looking for the easiest way to get started investing, I would highly recommend checking out Robinhood. There are a few different routes you can take, and I\u2019ll talk about them below, but Robinhood allows you to invest as little or as much as you like and do it with zero transaction fees for buying or selling. Essentially, they\u2019ve smashed the barrier to entry in investing and have made it so that anyone who wants can begin investing even $5 or $10. Traditionally people will start investing in the stock market via a brokerage account like E-trade or Merril Lynch. However, with these bigger accounts, it really only makes sense to be investing thousands of dollars, because you will pay a $5 trading fee most of the time every time you buy or sell. This makes it harder to get started, because of the thought of losing out on your money. If you have a lot to invest, there\u2019s nothing wrong with going that route, but again, why not go with Robinhood and get absolutely free trading. And you have access to it on your phone so you can keep close tabs on it and trade anytime you want during trading hours. The next way you can and should begin investing is through your retirement account. You can pick something like a Roth IRA and invest into every month. Within your IRA account you should find an index fund to invest into, not a mutual fund. Mutual funds charge fees to manage your money and trade your investments. This eats up your growth potential in the long run. Instead, it\u2019s useful to find a free Index fund that matches the market. You\u2019ve got a great start with those tips. From there, just start doing research, reading books, developing a strategy, and find a way to enjoy it. If you\u2019re interested in getting the Robinhood App you can sign up here, and you and I will both get a free stock worth between $2 and $200 which is pretty cool. There's A Free Stock Waiting For You ",

            "answer_text": "If you have never invested in the stock market before, it can be an intimidating process. If you want to get into investing but don\u2019t feel like an expert, read on. A 5 - step guide to stock investing: 1. Determine your goals: Before you get into investing of any kind, you first have to make sure that your overall financial situation is in a position to accommodate the new activity. Specific considerations include: EmploymentDebtFamily situationYour household budget2. Put some money to the side: Before you put any of your money at risk, you should first have some put away that will not be subject to any risk whatsoever. A cash reserve equal to at least three months\u2019 living expenses should be the minimum, and it should sit in nothing riskier than certificates of deposit or money market accounts. 3. Open a retirement account: Retirement accounts are an excellent start because they represent long-term investing. Besides, they are tax-sheltered and can produce immediate tax savings and are typically funded through payroll deductions. 4. Start investing with a low-cost online service: If you are not the type of person who wants to DIY their investing accounts, you might be happy using a Robo advisor. As opposed to hands-off Robo advisors, online stock brokers let you do the trading yourself. That means researching, choosing, buying and selling stocks, options, funds, etc\u2026, on your own. 5. Begin with mutual funds or exchange traded funds ( ETFs ): When you begin investing, you\u2019ll be far better off with mutual funds and ETFs than plunging right into stocks. ",

Source: Brandes, https://www.brandes.com/docs/def... First: Make sure you truly have a long-term, 5+ year time horizon. For more, see How and Why to Be a Long-Term InvestorDon\u2019t expect something as unrealistic as having amazing returns every year. Value investing works over the long-term in part because it doesn\u2019t work all the time!Value Investing works as follows at a high level: Find companies that have sufficiently predictable long-term economic characteristicsUnderstand their fundamentals, including performing a structural industry analysis, understanding the nature and magnitude of any sustainable competitive advantage, assessing the management team and the balance sheet.Estimate a range of intrinsic values for the businessInvest in companies trading with a meaningful margin of safety to your estimate of intrinsic valuePut together a portfolio of such investments that is sufficiently concentrated so that you are not diluting good investments with mediocre ones, but sufficiently diversified so that no one mistake can permanently impair your portfolio beyond recoveryThe above is not easy to do, and most people are better off not doing this themselves. As a matter of fact, a good number of people are likely to be better off with a simple dollar-cost-averaging strategy using low-cost index funds from a reputable firm such as Vanguard. Unfortunately, as I wrote in The Low Cost of Inaction: Don\u2019t Just Do Something, Stand There! right now the market is not offering either attractive overall returns or plentiful individual opportunities (see charts below), so you should be careful regardless of the path that you choose.

            "answer_text": "Here I have some tips for the beginner that how to invest in the stock market. Read it carefully it will help you to grab some knowledge about this. First of all, everyone should get that this game is for long term so you will have always best return on longer run as compare to short time period. Buy and hold strategies work too good on blue chips company and mid-cap firm which have high probability or good earnings growth. In this kind of company your you might be getting return in terms of multiple. On the other side if you have good knowledge about the stock market then u can try on you own by trading in intraday or positional. Or else you can take a help of advisory firm which will help you identify good company and make you profitable.Investing in stock market can make people rich and it can make you poor also. As every coin has to side. You have to expertise in the stock marker to trade as it\u2019s the scariest game. You have to be patient. InvestmentTradingThese are two main things when you are planing to invest in stock market. Investment:Investment is a basic thing you need. First you must have to know that this is a side income dont consider this income as your main income. If you have spare money then only think to invest in stock market. As stock market is the place where you can loose your all money even in single day only. Some people borrow money from the relatives or some took loan as well to invest but in this if u loose all your money that will be most difficult situation for you as well as for your family. There are many cases of suicides as well after loosing all the money as stock market can never be predictable. Trading:Trading is what we do for short term which involves risk but also generate large profit if you have talent to use momentum of market. Whether market is bullish or bearish, trading can be done on both side in F&O segment which requires less capital compared to investment for long term. Trading can be beneficial in case you don\u2019t have large capital or you can\u2019t hold for long time. Things to keep in mind Always put stop-lossDon\u2019t get greedyDon\u2019t do harsh tradingSafety of capitalDon\u2019t trade if market is too volatilekeeps readingDon\u2019t do multiple tradesRemain disciplined and don\u2019t get panic in any situationChoose stock according your capital onlyOnly invest in a business which you understandThese are the points you must keep in mind when investing to avoid mistakes that I made. Making loss should never effect your path to success. That\u2019s how you will be able to rectify your mistakes. If you enter stock market with only profit expectations, that is a very wrong mindset. No one in the market have earned only profit without some loss. Always be ready to face unfavorable situations from the market which will grow your experience and make your strategy efficient. After making a some loss of my capital I decided to take service from best research analyst firm and found SEBI register firm named Eqwires research analyst who I personally think is the best in the market. Also want to recommend to all of you who are tired of making losses in the market. I took Mercury Trading Service from them. I have acquired their quite few profit making strategies which makes it easy to invest even in unpredictable market like this. I would like to attach my recent trades with them.   Here is a statement for that. I have made good amount of profit which you can see in minimum time. I hope my answer helps you understand investing in stock market a bit better. Thanks for reading ",

            "answer_text": "Step by step guide to self-investing Step 1: How much to invest? To decide how much money you want to invest into stocks, you should first create a financial plan. On the basis of your income and your expenses, you determine the amount you have left to invest. A cursory overview is often enough in most cases, but it could also be a good opportunity for a complete analysis from a financial adviser. Once you have determined the amount available for investment, consider where your money may already be invested. You may already have a private retirement or pension plan. Where are they investing your money. Do you own a home or other real estate? This is the only way to prepare a sound financial plan and know how much is available to invest in stocks. Step 2: Safe stock investing We are conservative investors. We do not believe that we can beat the market. Therefore, we adhere to two important principles. The first principle is: Slowly in, \t\t\t\t\t\t Slowly out, That\u2019s what safe investing is all about. Your investment is not simply made from one day to the next, but over a longer period of time. Think long-term. Decide on an investment time table (once a month, quarterly, etc.) and stick with it. This is how it should also work when you want to sell your stocks. In no case should this happen all at once, but you should only sell so many shares until you have reached your desired goal. The second principle is: Do not put all your eggs in one basket Look for a broad-based portfolio. Economists have shown that 20 to 30 stocks are the most beneficial for the diversification advantages. We also recommend to spread these two to three dozen shares across countries and industries. This way you will have even broader diversified than a typical equity index fund, which is weighted according to the total value of the shares (market capitalization). If one sector is disproportionate, then it is time for the \"slowly out\" strategy. Also: Slowly enter into \"green\" areas and slowly move out again of \"red\" areas - because no one knows where the ups and downs will actually occur. Use the free Obermatt Google Spreadsheet as a helpful guide to see where your stocks are at a glance. Step 3: What stocks to buy Subscribe to the Obermatt Stock Update to receive our latest Top 10 stocks based on your selections each week. Each Obermatt Top 10 stock list shows four strategies: Value (equities measured at their intrinsic value), Growth, Safety and the Combined Investment Strategy. We recommend the Combined Investment Strategy for long-term, conservative stock investments for retirement, since it places the highest value on the price of the share (Value) and the financing of the company (Safety). We buy stocks for the Obermatt stock portfolio utilizing this strategy. If you are still undecided, after reviewing our Top 10 stock lists, you can also check our Obermatt Stock Analysis, peruse the website of the company or conduct your own research. Once you have purchased a stock, the next question that arises is when to sell the stock. Historical price developments are not the reason or basis for the sale of the stock. That is only a reflection of where the stock is valued today. To verify this, it is worth looking at the combined or value rank. It indicates whether the valuation is too high (low rank) or too low (high rank). ",

            "answer_text": "In times of market downhill, have you ever hit the sell button in the panic? Have you ever regretted any of your investment decision? Have you ever purchased any stocks to follow the market herd? If your answer to any of these questions is yes, then it is time to wake up! You are a victim of \u2018emotional investing\u2019. Very often, many investors connote success in the stock market with the high proprietary model, complicated technical charts, continuous monitoring of the stocks and avaricious reading about all the stock market updates. However, that is not the only formula to stay ahead in the investing game. During the 2017 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett\u2019s partner) highlighted the importance of logical thinking with a simple yet thought-provoking statement. He said, \u201cA lot of other people are trying to be brilliant and we are just trying to stay rational. And it\u2019s a big advantage.\u201d Investing in the stock market is both an art and a science. It is an art not to let emotions sway our investment decisions, which only a few investors are proficient at. It is a science as you need to follow a systematic process while spotting the stocks that are trading with a wide margin-of-safety and at the same time exhibiting strong fundamentals and growth potential. Your prowess as a successful investor will depend a lot on your research skills to identify strong stocks and rational decision-making skills. While it is comparatively easy to learn the nitty-gritty of the former, it is difficult to achieve emotional maturity. Emotions are universal and there\u2019s no way you can halt them. But what happens if your investment decisions are based on your anxiety in times of market stress or driven by euphoria in times of market uphill? All you would be doing is hitting the \u2018buy\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019 button. Taking decisions that are free from anxiety, panic, haste and greed is a tough row to hoe, but this is where the wealth creation secret lies. Understanding the science of investing is easier than learning the art of separating your emotions while taking investment decisions. Consider two investors: Investor A, who either invests on his own or follows the stock advice of his financial advisor. However, this investor is anxious about the market\u2019s daily movements and is obsessed with the stock\u2019s daily opening and closing price. He follows all the news and market updates and frequently churns his portfolio based on the daily fluctuations. Meet Investor B, who also invests in the equities. However, this investor doesn\u2019t spend much time on tracking daily stock price, media news or market updates. Rather, he carefully picks his stocks and takes calculated risks. Which investor you think would be able to create more wealth in the stock market? The answer is obviously Investor B. Behavioural biases can derail your long-term plan, which can sabotage your wealth creation journey. Behavioural biases are ubiquitous and it\u2019s difficult to control your temperament. With few exercises, one can learn to mitigate risks associated with emotional investing. Here are four simple yet effective ways to avoid the costs of emotional investing: Accept the volatility Markets were always uncertain, and they are going to remain so. The worst part is you can\u2019t do anything about it, except for embracing it with open arms. Don\u2019t predict, prepare a plan Once you come to terms with the uncertainty in the stock market, it is easy to minimise its impact. Allow some time for introspection before you chart out your plan. What is the purpose of your investments? Why are you investing in a particular stock? Ask such questions before you prepare your plan. This plan will help you to stay focussed even in times of a bear run. A successful investor doesn\u2019t predict the market but prepares himself for the future. Don\u2019t just trade, invest in solid businesses Invest in stocks which display strong fundamentals. Instead of following the markets fashionable trends or continuous flow of market noise, focus on knowing the stocks and the management behind it. If you know what you are owning and why you are owning it, it will help you to stay level-headed when the markets go berserk. Don\u2019t time the market, allow time in the market Instead of trying futile attempts of timing the market by analysing daily fluctuations or checking every market update, try focussing on improving your investing methodology. Capitalise on a sale in the stock market We all love shopping during a sale, but when there is a sale in the stock market, we are in fright and horror. The best investors are the ones who are not perturbed by daily randomness, but the ones who stick to their process and use market corrections to add value businesses to their portfolio. And most importantly, remember these wise words by Benjamin Graham: \u201cThe investor\u2019s chief problem\u2014and even his worst enemy\u2014is likely to be himself.\u201d Sometime the smart move is the stay positive and wait calmly. There are some ways of making money by investing, while sitting peacefully. In india there are some advisory companies and research analyst companies who reasearch the market and provides tips and advise for invest in right stocks. EQWIRES RESEARCH ANALYST is one of the best research analyst company. They are legally registered in SEBI and have great experience in the market.

            "answer_text": "Well there is two questions here. How to invest in stocks from a practical point of view, and how to invest in stocks in a productive way. In terms of practicalities, you need: To find an online broker, platform or advisor that can accept you based on your local area and account minimums. Different platforms and advisors have different account minimums, and some can\u2019t accept specific nationalities, like Americans living overseas or whatever.Point of address dated in the last three months and proof of identity, to satisfy international anti-money laundering requirements.Fill out an online or paper application formsThen you can usually trade online.However, that doesn\u2019t answer the following questions: Should you DIY or use an advisor?How should you invest in stocks?In terms of question 1, DIY investing is a bit like a surgeon\u2019s knife. It can be great or can cut you, depending on how you use the instrument. The evidence shows the average investor only gets 4%, vs 10% for the S&P, and this is mainly due to behavioral reasons like buying and selling too much, panicking when markets are down and so on.  I am sure most people here have known somebody who panic sold in 2000-2001 or 2008, or have done a number of other silly things. As Vanguard\u2019s founder has said, the more you trade, the more you lose. However, financial institutions make their money from trades. Saying `trades from $2` sounds cheap, but if you are making 2-3 trades a month on a small account, that adds up. The best thing people can do is buy, hold and rebalance index passive funds, especially on the equity side, but few people do that, as it goes against human nature in many ways. Who wants to be passive when they can be active? Who, even if they are a humble person, wants to admit they can\u2019t beat the market with stock picking, even if they do 2 hours of research a day, due to the fact all the information is publicly available? Being a good investor is a bit like being super healthy. Few doctors are super healthy, despite knowing the evidence inside out, as it goes against human nature to be so disciplined. I remember listening to Warren Buffett\u2019s employee, being interviewed about him. They asked her, `what makes him such a great investor`. She said `he keeps emotions away from the process`. He just stayed invested for 70 years plus. He never got out of markets. Now Buffett is in a position where he can stock pick. He is one of the few people who have shown they can do that, but I have yet to meet a person who can market time with consistency over 20-30 years. Certainly people need to have some `checks and balances` to stop them doing negative things with their account, and an advisor can help with them. I remember in 2014, I convinced several people not to sell out when US Markets were 15,000-16,000. These people were panicking about the fact that markets look `overvalued` at these prices. I received so many thank you notes after markets hit 26,800 last year, even though I made it clear that nobody could predict markets, but that they have always gone up long-term in the US or some other key markets. What convinced these people to just buy, hold and rebalance? I regularly sent them articles, information. Real evidence based on peer-reviewed research, not some sensationalist stories from the media. So in summary, invest asap. Don\u2019t try to time markets or speculate, and consider how you can put a check on natural human impulses to speculate, and let negative emotions like fear and greed has.

You might never have invested in the market, but after hearing about all those things you also decide to buy some stocks. However, if you entered the market just to remain in mainstream fashion, you have landed in for the wrong reason. You should invest in the stock market after getting the basic knowledge about it and in accordance with your financial goals. The stock market is not giving you always profit:- You must have heard the story about many investors who made their fortune through the market. Many believe that the stock market is like a money-making machine, which can turn them into millionaires over a period of time. Well, it is true that a lot of investors have made profits through the stock market. But it was only possible because they\u2019ve good market knowledge, made some really smart choices by adopting carefully thought of strategies, and are also much disciplined in their approach. Many people forget that a lot of people have lost their entire wealth, while some have been forced to sell their personal assets to cover the loss in the market. Best technical expert:- If you want to do the intraday trading you must follow the technical expertise and also you will take the service from good SEBI register adversely company. They will give me the best trades with Stop-loss. Use your own capital:- Never take a loan or borrow money from a friend to trade in the stock market. Many times I have seen that people borrowed money or took loans from someone on high-interest rates and then lost capital and they caught in trouble. Control your emotions:- Intraday trading is completely risky so if any person is coming with only profit expectations or with sentiments, he/she should not trade because the market will never understand your emotions. Realistic target:- Hoping for the \u2018best\u2019 from your investments is not wrong, but you could be heading for trouble if your financial goals are based on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, lots of stocks have generated more than 100 % returns during the great bull run of recent years. However, it doesn\u2019t mean that you should always expect the same kind of return from the stock markets. If you feel that stocks in your portfolio are overvalued, it is better to switch to a relatively low-value good stock. If you follow the above points properly, you can definitely have a good start. Also, I have shared some more answers regarding the stock-market if you want to know about the stock market. Thank you for scrolling down! ",

There are bunch of books on this. I personally love Howard Marks\u2019s The Most Important Thing.Whatever you plan to buy, make sure to write down what you plan to buy, why you\u2019re buying it (your thesis), and the fundamentals that need to hold true in order for you to add more to your position (if those no longer hold true, you\u2019d sell\u2014your exit strategy).Go in with the mindset of learn from both your successes AND your mistakes. Sometimes, you will make money from something without being right about why you bought it. And sometimes you might lose money without being wrong on your thesis. So it\u2019s important to distinguish between being right versus\u2026 being right and making money from being right.Get a brokerage! I use Robinhood (if you sign up, we both get a free stock!), Merrill Edge, and Interactive Brokers.Learn from people who has had consistent success in achieving the results that you\u2019re aiming for. If your goal is to spend the entirety of your life working and retiring at 65, then follow what everyone is doing, but I personally learn from fund managers who have retired in their late 20s. If that\u2019s your financial goal, I recommend this Telegram channel, where successful hedge fund managers talk about their money management decisions and what each are doing in their own funds. Success breeds success, and if you do what successful people are doing, your chances of success are higher as well.",

            "answer_text": "Making mistakes is part of the learning process. However, it's all too often that plain old common sense separates a successful investor from a poor one. At the same time, nearly all investors, new or experienced, have fallen astray from common sense and made a mistake or two. Being perfect may be impossible, but knowing some of common investing errors can help deter you from going down the well-traveled, yet rocky, path of losses. Here are some of the most common stock buying mistakes. 1. Using Too Much Margin Margin is the use of borrowed money to purchase securities. Margin can help you make more money; however, it can also exaggerate your loses - a definite downside. The absolute worst thing you can do as a new investor is become carried away with what seems like free money - if you use margin and your investment doesn't go your way, you end up with a large debt obligation for nothing. Ask yourself if you would buy stocks with your credit card. Of course you wouldn't. Using margin excessively is essentially the same thing (albeit likely at a lower interest rate). Additionally, using margin requires you to monitor your positions much more closely because of the exaggerated gains and losses that accompany small movements in price. If you don't have the time or knowledge to keep a close eye on and make decisions about your positions and the positions drop, your brokerage firm will sell your stock to recover any losses you have accrued. As a new investor, use margin sparingly, if at all. Use it only if you understand all its aspects and dangers. It can force you to sell all your positions at the bottom, the point at which you should be in the market for the big turnaround. 2. Buying On Unfounded Tips We think everyone makes this mistake at one point or another in their investing career. You may hear your relatives or friends talking about a stock that they heard will get bought out, have killer earnings or soon release a groundbreaking new product. Even if these things are true, they do not necessarily mean that the stock truly is \"the next big thing\" and that you should run to the nearest phone to call your broker. Other unfounded tips come from investment professionals on TV who often tout a specific stock as though it's a must-buy, but really is nothing more than the flavor of the day. These stock tips often don't pan out and go straight down after you buy them. Remember, buying on media tips is often founded on nothing more than a speculative gamble. Now this isn't to say that you should balk at every stock tip. If one really grabs your attention, the first thing to do is consider the source. The next thing is to do your own homework. Make sure you \"research, research and research\" so that you know what you are buying and why. Buying a tech stock with some proprietary technology should be based on whether it's the right investment for you, not solely on what some mutual fund manager said on TV. Next time you're tempted to buy a hot tip, don't do so until you've got all the facts and are comfortable with the company. Ideally, obtain a second opinion from other investors or unbiased financial advisors. 3. Day Trading If you insist on becoming an active trader, think twice before day trading. Day trading is a dangerous game and should be attempted only by the most seasoned investors. In addition to investment savvy, a successful day trader needs access to special equipment that is rarely available to the average trader. Did you know that the average day-trading workstation (with software) can cost in the range of $50,000? You'll also need a similar amount of trading money to maintain an efficient day trading strategy. The need for speed is the main reason you can't start day trading with simply the extra $5,000 in your bank account: online brokers do not have systems fast enough to service the true day trader, so quite literally the difference of pennies per share can make the difference between a profitable and losing trade. In fact, day trading is deemed such a difficult endeavor that most brokerages who offer day trading accounts require investors to take formal trading courses. Unless you have the expertise, equipment and access to speedy order execution, think twice before day trading. If you aren't particularly adept at dealing with risk and stress, there are much better options for an investor looking to build wealth. 4. Buying Stocks that Appear Cheap This is a very common mistake, and those who commit it do so by comparing the current share price with the 52-week high of the stock. Many people using this gauge assume that a fallen share price represents a good buy. But the fact that a company's share price happened to be 30% higher last year will not help it earn more money this year. That's why it pays to analyze why a stock has fallen. Deteriorating fundamentals, a CEO resignation and increased competition are all possible reasons for the lower stock price - but they are also provide good reasons to suspect that the stock might not increase anytime soon. A company may be worth less now for fundamental reasons. It is important always to have a critical eye since a low share price might be a false buy signal. Avoid buying stocks that simply look like a bargain. In many instances, there is a strong fundamental reason for a price decline. Do your homework and analyze a stock's outlook before you invest in it. You want to invest in companies which will experience sustained growth in the future. 5. Underestimating Your Abilities Some investors tend to believe they can never excel at investing because stock market success is reserved for sophisticated investors. This perception has no truth at all. While any commission-based mutual fund salesmen will probably tell you otherwise, most professional money managers don't make the grade either - the vast majority underperform the broad market. With a little time devoted to learning and research, investors can become well equipped to control their own portfolio and investing decisions - and be profitable. Remember, much of investing is sticking to common sense and rationality. Besides having the potential to become sufficiently skillful, individual investors do not face the liquidity challenges and overhead costs large institutional investors do. Any small investor with a sound investment strategy has just as good a chance of beating the market, if not better, than the so-called investment gurus. Never underestimate your abilities or your own potential. That is, don't assume you are unable to successfully participate in the financial markets simply because you have a day job. 6. When Buying a Stock, Overlooking the \"Big Picture\" For a long-term investor one of the most important - but often overlooked - things to do is qualitative analysis, or \"to look at the big picture.\" Fund manager and author Peter Lynch once stated that he found the best investments by looking at his children's toys and the trends they would take on. Brand name is also very valuable. Think about how almost everyone in the world knows Coke; the financial value of the name alone is therefore measured in the billions of dollars. So pouring over financial statements or attempting to identify buy and sell opportunities with complex technical analysis may work a great deal of the time, but if the world is changing against your company, sooner or later you will lose. After all, a typewriter company in the late 1980s could have outperformed any company in its industry, but once personal computers started to become commonplace, an investor in typewriters of that era would have done well to assess the bigger picture. Assessing a company from a qualitative standpoint is as important as looking at the sales and earnings. Qualitative analysis is a strategy that is one of the easiest and most effective for evaluating a potential investment. 7. Compounding Your Losses by Averaging Down Far too often investors fail to accept the simple fact that they are human and prone to making mistakes just as the greatest investors do. Whether you made a stock purchase in haste or one of your long-time big earners has suddenly taken a turn for the worse, the best thing you can do is accept it. The worst thing you can do is let your pride take priority over your pocketbook and hold on to a losing investment, or worse yet, buy more shares of the stock since it is much cheaper now. Remember, a company's future operating performance has nothing to do with what price you happened to buy its shares at. Anytime there is a sharp decrease in your stock's price, try to determine the reasons for the change and assess whether the company is a good investment for the future. If not, do your pocketbook a favor and move your money into a company with better prospects. Letting your pride get in the way of sound investment decisions is foolish and it can decimate your portfolio's value in a short amount of time. Remain rational and act appropriately when you are inevitably confronted with a loss on what seemed like a rosy investment. The Bottom Line With the stock market's penchant for producing large gains (and losses) there is no shortage of faulty advice and irrational decisions. As an individual investor, the best thing you can do to pad your portfolio for the long term, is to implement a rational investment strategy you are comfortable with and willing to stick to. If you are looking to make a big win by betting your money on your gut feelings, try the casino. Take pride in your investment decisions and in the long run, your portfolio will grow to reflect the soundness of your actions. Happy trading!! ",

That's not possible. Learn technical and fundamental analysis. Learn how to read balance sheets and analyse financial statements. Learn the key financial ratios and technical indicators. Watch videos on YouTube and read articles on Investopedia.com Read books. The perfect book for you is Dollars on Cents (my book). It'll teach you everything you need to know. Step #2. Demo trading/investing. Open a demo account on sites like money control or apps like stock trainer. Get a basic idea of the market. Check stock prices and trends. Look for news articles about various stocks or industries. Do this for a month. Step #3. Open a demat account. You can either open a 3 in 1 account (high brokerage) or a trading and demat account. There are a ton of videos on YouTube about it. Have all the necessary documents ready. This process can take 2-4 weeks depending on your speed and efficiency. Step #4. Allocate funds in the demat account. When you first start investing /trading, allocate only a little money. Don't go all in. Learn how to operate the account and use little money for the next 1-6 months. You'll soon get the idea. Buy some shares, analyse companies and hold \u2018em. Look at your portfolio after 6 months. Step #5. Analyse your mistakes. You'll have lost about 50% after 6 months. Write down all the mistakes you've made and what can you do to avoid them. Step #6. Learn more. When you practically invest your money, you understand better. You'll be more cautious and learn deeply. Reread old concepts and learn more. Step #7. Diversify. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

            "answer_text": "These are the basics that every beginner should know and implement when they invest their money. Firstly, to learn the basics about the investment spectrum - Subscribe to books on investments and basic reading material which are freely available on Google. Understand the concept of savings, financial planning, goals, compound interest, monthly investments, volatility, and risk. This will form a foundation on which you can build your knowledge, at the same time also start investing so as to put your theoretical learning into practice. Now our tip before you start investing is understanding why you are investing. For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. This is an important step as it has a bearing on how much risk you can take. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully, and then decide how much to invest, which stocks to invest in, and how much of potential downside you can absorb. Ideally these should be the first steps for investing into any investments.  Secondly, for a proper financial management - Create a financial plan for yourself first. The first step towards creating your financial plan or towards achieving your financial success begins with noting down your financial goals. Next quantify them. Take the help of an online platform or a calculator to calculate the future values of your goals. Next prioritize them not by their chronology, but by how important they are to you. After you've done that bring in all your savings (ideally 30% of your income every month) and all your investments. Leave nothing out. Get them linked to your goals, either manually or automatically. That way you'll get clarity on how much the gaps are in achieving your financial goals. Now once you see the gaps, again use an online platform or a calculator to figure out the amount of money you need to save starting now to bridge the gap. Fine tune it to adjust for the risk you want to take, and there you have it. Your financial goals will be secured and your financial success will be in your grip.  Thirdly -  Now, before one starts investing the basic concept one should understand is why you are investing. For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. This is an important step as it has a bearing on how much risk you can take. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully, and then decide how much to invest, which stocks to invest in, and how much of potential downside you can absorb. Ideally these should be the first steps for investing into any investments. Managing investments for more than 2000 customers I saw these are the most common problems that beginners face in this market and they do not even have a clue of the mistake they do until it is too late. Also, join the whatsapp group of Bloomberg Quint for daily podcasts on the market and specifically for the do\u2019s and dont\u2019s in the market.  Since you are exploring a system, the most important system you need to follow first is a financial plan. What's the purpose of your investments if not to be able to achieve goals? Hence define and document your goals, you'll get the fundamental purpose behind the investment. Accordingly you can decide to apply long term or short term strategies based on when you'll need the money to achieve that specific goal.

I would advise a) Reading suitable books preferably by authors from the region where you plan to trade. b) Attending live workshops/seminars to understand the basics of stock trading. 2) Once you are comfortable that you have understood the basics of stock markets and what this investment is all about, you will then need to find yourself a suitable online broker to  open an account.  For this you will need to: a) Shop around amongst the various online brokers available and find one which offers you the services and products you require cost-effectively. For e.g. you might opt for a broker who allows you to place trades by calling in to them, instead of online at the same rates. b) Ideally, if you are beginner, I would advise familiarising yourself by using a demonstration online stock trading account (no real money). Again, you would have to shop around for this feature. It is something offered by a number of stock brokers at no additional cost. 3) Ensure you keep yourself updated with what is happening all around the world, in relation to the companies you propose to trade in and specifically issues related to the economy of the country where you live and where you will be stock trading. National newspapers (business section)  and the correct stock trading or investment weekly magazines are the best for this (Check out the magazine section in your  local bookstore / online to get a feel of what the investment magazines offer). 4) Ensure you keep yourself updated with all the news concerning the companies you are interested in and how the news could potentially affect the stock price of these companies. 5) Finally, before you are ready to start trading using 'real' money and moving onto to the online account from a demo account: a) Have a high-level strategy which guides your stock trading. b) Break it down into a weekly plan and ensure you stick to this plan. c) Establish your risk profile. If you do not establish the levels at which are comfortable to trade and the maximum losses you are willing to incur right at the start, you will have a very steep learning curve and possible monetary losses too. Setting up a stop loss for every trade either on your online account (using an automated 'stop-loss') or a figure you have on paper (at which price you will sell) is very important. d) At the same time, establish a selling price and stick to it. Good-luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Great that you wish to invest in stock market! Many people invest in stock market, some of them earn good returns while others earn not so good returns. You might be wondering why? Successful investors follow certain strategies to invest. To start investing successfully, you might follow them too. Firstly, lets\u2019 start with some basic things you must do- Basics of Investing- Open a Demat account, and keep your essential documents like PAN card, aadhar card ready for opening the account.Then, you have to deposit some amount of money in your demat account to begin investing. Whenever you begin to buy or sell an asset, the same amount will be deducted. If the amount limit increases, you will be asked to submit more cash, if not submitted, the stocks will be taken as a leverage and a basic interest would be charged.Lastly, install a trading client to begin trading in stock market. You can select a stock, the desired amount to buy and sell here.There is a very thin line between investing and smart investing. Once you learn to be in the line of smart investors, no one can stop you from earning good deal of money in the stock market. Tips of Investing in stock market Understand your investments Investing without knowing the investment is a big NO when investing in stock market. If you want your investment to work for you, you must know your investment in and out. Be it Mutual Funds, Fixed Deposits, Gold Bonds or Stocks, understand them well and then invest. Be patient with your investment Once you have made your desired investment, wait for it to grow. Don\u2019t be in a hurry to withdraw money. The longer you stay invested in the stock market, the better it is. Follow this once, and you will see how your money grows. Manage your asset allocation well Warren Buffet rightly said- \u201cNever invest all your eggs in one bucket\u201d. One should never invest all the money in a single instrument(be it equity or debt). It is suggested to invest in a mix of assets, so that you earn good return even if the market is low. Remember: High Risk = High Return This is the most important thing to keep in mind. In order to attain good returns, you have to take some amount of risk. Risk can be managed as per individual\u2019s risk taking capability. Preferably add equities to your portfolio Equity investment is the best option for investors who wish to make good amount of money in stock market. As per your risk capability, you can add equities to your portfolio. For example: if you are not willing to much risk in investment you can add 20% equities to your investment and dividing the remaining 80% among fixed income instruments. Similarly, if you are willing to take risk, you can allocate 80% to equities and the reaming to fixed income instruments. Also, I would suggest you to invest in equities via a SIP so that you avail the benefit of compounding as well. With a SIP, the cost of your units is averaged out & the returns are good even during the falling markets. Invest in tax saving investments When you invest in tax saving instruments, you not only make money you save money as well. ELSS is one of the best tax saving investment, as it invests in equities to offer good returns while providing tax benefits under section 80C. Stay invested for long As a matter of fact, the longer you remain invested in stock market, the better returns you get. Investors are advised to invest for long-term and avail the benefits of low market as well. How? Buying the units when the market is low and redeeming the units when price increases. So, longer the investment duration, better the returns. Keep monitoring & re-balancing your investment It is highly essential to review and re-balance your investment regularly so that you do not lose out on any investment. This keeps your investment managed and reduces the possibility of loss. How to begin investing? Analyse your financial goal Each one of us have a different goal when it comes to investing in stock market. It is advised to have a clear picture of your goal and then as per the same. This will help you yield your desired output. Determine your Risk Profile This refers to the risk taking capability of an individual. Investors should determine their risk profile and then invest accordingly. For example: if you are not the one who takes risk in investment you come under the category of a conservative investor. Similarly, if you can take some risk in investment you are an average investor and if you can take high risk in investment you will fall under the category aggressive investor. The investment options vary of each of them. The investment options are mentioned below. So, analyze your risk profile first and then invest accordingly. Diversify your assets & invest wisely Invest in a mix of assets as per your goal and risk profile. Never invest in a single instrument. Doing allocation of assets will ensure that the different asset classes perform over time and give good returns on the overall portfolio. Best Mutual Funds to invest For High-Risk Investors, the suitable investments include- ELSS or Equity Linked Savings SchemeEquity fundsDebt FundsHybrid Funds or Balanced FundsStocksFor risk-averse investors, the suitable investments include- Fixed Deposit or FDNPS or National Pension SchemePublic Provident FundRecurring Deposit or RDFinally, I would like to end by an inspiring quote by Robert Kiyosaki- \u201cInvesting is not risky, not being in control is.\u201d Happy investing!

            "answer_text": "Long haul slow grind investing can yield good results over time. Invest what you can afford. Some recomend 10 percent but that is a general allocation. I love to buy direct purchase plans using discount brokers or transfer agents. Direct no fee drip plans are generally good low cost plays to build over time. Top 10 Dividend Stocks That Offer No-Fee DRIPs https://seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4154298-best-drip-stocks-15-fee-drip-dividend-aristocrats-video I love hands free auto pilot type plays with a saddled turtle that crawls to profit repetitively. The age, income, debt level, and current savings of an investor are all factors to consider. The markets are high at the moment but some values are still out there in the resturaunt, utilities, tech, and finance sectors. Stock Market & Sector Performance Retirement type investments in mid and large cap stocks are good long term bets on average returns. The ideal savings and investment is as much as possible. The markets should be seen as long term alrernatives to bank intrest. People view the market with the idea of beating the average market return. Yes it is possible to do so even for small investors choosing thier own stocks but it is not a common outcome. The markets are a place to put money with the desired outcome of beating the alternative fixed deposit outcome. You should invest non debt after savings dollars that will be placed for ten years or so. Shorter timespans are fine if you are harvesting profits, due to acquisitions, buy backs and the like. Thinking long-term is investing. Short term speculation will eventually cost you. Why would you buy what others fail to deem a worthy long term hold? If the stick isn't worth owning for 10 years it isn't worth owning because the acquisition, buyback and return value isn't there. The idea is not to buy what everyone wants to own today but what they will wish to own in three to 5 years. You win on share price appreciation, dividend payments, and have time to build a position. Sonic is the best and most recent example. Two years ago while McDonald's was going comet like I simply thought sonic was too cheap. The idea is to look for this type of scenario. ",

            "answer_text": "I trade the market instead of investing but the following points should be similar. Before you start investing, you must understand the following first. 1. Your Character - this determines whether you will be chasing dividends, putting money into growth stocks or even adopt a trading strategy. Too many people didn't understand what they want before jumping in and they constantly change their methods according to how they feel. You must know what kind of person you are and what you want. 2. Risk appetite - I used to be risk averse and adopted a strategy that reflects it. Eventually I got affected by a friend who makes much more money in the stock market than me and I changed my strategy to his. Needless to say, I suffered substantial losses when market conditions changed and I couldn't stomach it anymore. I fell back to my original strategy and recovered the lost amount over a period of 1 year. The lesson I learnt is that my risk appetite wasn't that much and I couldn't stomach the movement well. 3. Method - As mentioned in point 1. Your character affects this. Study a couple of different methods. Don't put your money in immediately. Find a method that is suitable first. 4. Capital - How much capital you have can determine the kind of stocks you can invest in. Think about the proper capital allocation as well. Don't put everything you have into 1 basket unless you are very very very sure that's what you want to do. 5. Others - opening of brokerage accounts, understanding the different commissions each broker charges, attend free seminars, read investment strategies off Internet etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Besides fundamental analysis, which is mandatory to invest in any business. Here are few strategies that I learnt from my experience and reading about investing : 1. Invest in businesses that have high operating margins, niche player and near monopoly in their businesses. ( High moat businesses). 2. Identify the risks associated with the businesses. i. e. Chemicals, auto, commodity,metal, pharma, IT, oil, cement based businesses are cyclical in nature and carries significant risk. Make sure you don't enter in the wrong cycle. 3. If you find a fast grower company having high RoE and growing profits, investigate about the debt levels. Leveraged balance sheet is a big no! 4. Promoter buying is a positive and if stock price is moving upward and still promoter buys regularly it is a double positive. If you find a stock where multiple promoters buy with stock price moving higher overall with strong balance sheet getting stonger everyday i.e. Debt reduction, release of pledge, interest payment going to zero and improving prospects ; that is a real gem. Hold on to it! 5. Use stock volatility to your advantage. Make sure that all your buys are on the dip and sells are on the highs.Following this tip can provide margin of safety of additional 3- 5% to your investments. Also, never sell your winners early. 6. Do not buy any stock that you aren't comfortable averaging it. No matter how good you are at picking your stocks if you can't buy more when it falls, you will never beat the market. 7. For cyclical business, i.e. Auto, pharma, infra, IT, commodity \u2026if you find inventories piling up, interest payments going up, ATR, cash reserves falling quarter by quarter that is a big red flag and you are probably too late. Use euphoria and fake news to sell and minimize your losses. 8. Do not invest in capital intensive businesses. i.e. Airlines, infra. Those are quite profitable when economy is booming but for a long term they rarely create wealth for their shareholders. 9. If you find a company who does almost unbelievable things i.e. Finding drugs to treat cancer, Aids etc. Or does fancy things like cloud and artificial intelligence ; those are too good to be true. Stay away from those companies. Always choose businesses that are so simple that any idiot can run those businesses. 10. Buy only based on earnings, balance sheet and insider buying. The more you know how to analyze financial statements the better are your decisions. Earnings conference calls and balance sheet reveal vital information. Read or listen them like a detective novel. Same goes for balance sheet. Don't buy anything from the tips provided by media. Don't buy based on news. 11. Banks, Insurance, Manufacturing all the different businessses have different balance sheets. Identify your strength and make your portfolio basing on your strength of identifying the good businesses. 12. Moving from one stock to another kills your long term wealth. The less decisions you make, the better it is for you. 12. 20\u201325 % grower in non-growth industries with little institutional ownership is an ideal investment. 13. If you want to buy a mid cap company and you know your company better then most people, then observe mid cap index trends and use index\u2019s lows to enter that particular stock. That is sure shot strategy to make 5% more of your normal investments. 14. I will conclude with the famous quote by Mr. Buffett : Be greedy when others are fearful. ( This is important when you want to average your fallen stocks) Your queries are welcomed!

            "answer_text": "You can jot down these steps to facilitate your entry into the stock market and the world of investing: 1. Choose a broker You need someone to facilitate your investments in shares. Here\u2019s where a broker comes in. So, you need to get a good broker to invest in the stock market. There are two types of brokers. One is the online broker and the other is, of course, the offline one. Usually, the online broker works on the discount model and their charges are way cheaper than the offline ones. But note that they may or may not provide the best of services. Also, offline brokers who have an established practice and have a wide network of offices, might have an edge on newer online brokers when it comes to expertise. If you are a novice investor, an online broker might be better for you as they will have experts that you can talk to. 2. Open a demat account All listed shares in India are in dematerialised format, that is, they are held electronically. So, to invest in shares, you need to open a demat account. Most brokers do not charge for opening a demat account. Even if they do, the charge is usually very nominal. 3. Take advice Never start investing on your own. Take the advice of an expert. It is best to approach a financial planner who will tell you how you should invest based on your financial situation and risk appetite. Talk to friends and family members who invest. Read books, journals and newspapers for guidance. You can talk to your stock broker for advice but don\u2019t listen to everything he says. 4. Consider Mutual Funds Mutual Funds invest in stocks on your behalf. Investing in a Mutual Fund is the best way to start your journey into the stock market. Equity diversified funds are the ones you should start with. These funds invest across different companies so your risks are lowered. You can even opt for an Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS). This will help you save tax. ",

If you use Merrill, depositing 100k qualifies for 100 free trades every month.Once the money is in your brokerage account, enter buy orders for stocks. You can use market orders for liquid stocks that you must have, but generally it is best to use limit order to avoid execution at too high prices. Quotes may not be accurate or current.Tip: If you know nothing about how the stock market works, it is best to invest in stocks via a low cost total stock market index fund. Most investors underperform the market, and that includes most professional money managers. If you invest in the entire stock market, you will capture the total stock market return less fees, and automatically outperform 80% of all investors. All total stock market index funds are the same except for cost, so look for the one with the lowest expense ratio. Right now, Fidelity offers zero expense ratio index fund, FZROX, which charges nothing. Fidelity is using it as a loss leader hoping to get customers into its door and buy other (costly) products. But you just need to invest your all money into FZROX and do nothing else. Just let it ride through thick and thin and you will enjoy the total stock market return. ",

Now few points for your start in the Investing world: Start with an amount that you are comfortable with. Even 5000\u201310000 is a good enough amount to start withInvest in a business you understand - Dont follow herd mentality or tipsters. Try to learn the knitty gritties of one industry first and then invest in a company whose business you understandInvest in uptrend and not in downtrend - As a beginner never invest in a market which is going down. If the Nifty has been going up for past few days then its a good time for you to invest. Pick a basket of 4\u20135 stocks and invest.Realistic Expectations - You would have heard the story of Eicher Motors going 100 fold and Infy making many rich. But don\u2019t start with expectations of getting rich overnight. Greed is the biggest enemy in financial markets.First Buy - Ideally invest in a stock which you know about and see in daily life. For example- Maruti Suzuki, HDFC Bank, ITC, Yes Bank, HPCL, Bata, Coal India, Colgate India, Hindustan Unilever etc.There are tons of companies whose products/services you already have been using and might be more than happy with them. Find out those companies and investigate them. Lets say you want to invest in automobile industry. Try to find out which car company has growing sales and revenue. Which car company has been coming with new models which have been successful. Absolute no no for Penny stocks - Dont invest in any stock which is priced less than 20 Rs or have a market cap of less than Rs. 100 crores. Although you might double your money soon in some rare scenarios, but most probably you will end up losing most of your money if you invest in any penny stock.We have a group of traders discussing trades and markets daily on Slack.

            "answer_text": "Before you start your investment journey, it is necessary to get the hang of the share market. The stock market is the place where shares of different companies get traded. They are under the purview of two stock exchanges in India \u2013 NSE and BSE. Investment in the age-old instruments may not be adequate, especially in the era of inflation and other share market-related activities. Share markets are lucrative options where you can purchase and trade securities such as options and stocks. When I started my investment journey, I was guided to ICICI Direct. They empower every eager investor to understand the working of the share market by offering necessary share market information, how to trade, types of financial instruments, and successful strategies. There is no minimum requirement to invest in the stocks. You can even invest in one stock of the company. So, if you purchase the stock for a market price of INR 100 and you only buy a share, then you only need INR 100. Brokerage and statutory charges are additional. But remember, you need to start investing in the stock market with the funds you would not need in the immediate future. Most of the time, it also depends on the objective of investment. The best advice would be to save at least 10 to 20 per cent of your monthly income. Divide your funds into five parts and buy-in equal parts the top 5 stocks, which pay high dividends. The two aspects to remember is \u2013 \u00b7 How much are you willing to lose? Start with an amount you do not mind losing. The initial few years of investment are going to be nothing less than hiccups. How much do you want to make? It again depends on what kind of market or strategy you deploy in trading. You should be willing to invest as much time and effort possible in investments. ",

            "answer_text": "For a new investor it is very important to first of all learn about the basics of stock market. The stock market is the place where someone sells and someone buys the stock. When a new investor starts investing in the stock market it is quite obvious to make mistakes. But, as it is said \u201cFailures are the pillars of success\u201d, but what I think is \u201cFailures are the pillars of success, if rooted at the right place\u201d. Similarly, if an investor does not learn from the mistakes, then it really is failure of the investor. Here, in this article we will be discussing in this article.  So, without wasting much time let\u2019s start discussing about the mistakes and some ideas: 1. AVOID HERD MENTALITY: Buying a stock just because your neighbour bought it or your friend suggested you to buy it, will just make you lose your money. One should never buy a stock without doing a proper research work on it. How can someone solve algebra without knowing about the variables. So one should know whose value to be found. Similarly, investing without knowing about the stock, will leave you with very low chances of earning a good amount of profit. 2. NOT HAVING A PLAN: If someone does anything without proper planning, everybody knows what kinds of situation are seen. I guess everyone of us knows that. To avoid such situations one should have a proper plan laid out in one\u2019s mind. One should know what kinds of returns can the market give over a period of time. 3. GIVING MORE IMPORTANCE TO EMOTIONS: It is quite a common saying in the market that one should think more logically in a business. Or before making an investment, rather than thinking emotionally. In stock market many investors overlook the analysis and falls into emotional pits. They just want to get rich quickly. 4. DIVERSIFICATION IS GOOD BUT NOT OVER DIVERSIFICATION: It is good to have a diversified portfolio, but it is bad to do over diversification. Consider an example where there is a basket with apples, oranges, pears and cherries. Now, you want to add mangoes to it. But the mangoes you are getting at this time is not of good quality and not at its right price. But, your desire of getting mango in that basket will force you to do the mistake of putting the mangoes of bad quality and that too at a bad price, will spoil the other fruits of the basket. So, an investor should diversify the portfolio but within a limit and in good and at right time. 5. BUYING SCRIPS AT 52 WEEK LOW: This is the most commonly observed mistake being done by the investors in the stock market. Buying a stock just because it is trading at its 52 week low price does not make it a good buy. There are many reasons which drive a stock to its 52 week low. The stock might be undergoing through some fundamental problems. It might be available at this price due to any other bad news regarding the stock being circulated in the market. Or it might be so due to the over going phase of correction. One should buy stock at 52 week low only if the stock is available at that price due to some correction phase, which is very common in stock market.

            "answer_text": "When attempting to assess to what extent it is a good idea to begin investing in the stock market, and how best to go about doing this, I have focussed on 2 different techniques used to pick stocks (\u2018Value investing\u2019 and \u2018Growth Investing\u2019). Growth and value are two fundamental approaches in stock investing. Many growth stock fund managers look for stocks of companies that they believe offer strong earnings growth potential, while value fund managers look for stocks that appear undervalued by the marketplace. The first of the two stock picking methods I have analysed is that of Value Investing, an investment principle co-founded by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, both of whom went on to be mentors of Warren Buffett (the second richest man in America) at Columbia Business School. The meticulous manner in which Buffett picked his stocks demonstrates a key factor necessary to thrive in the stock market; hard work. Painstaking analysis of all variables is required in an attempt to calculate the true value of a given company, the aim of this is to capitalise upon cases whereby the \u2018true\u2019 value is are more favourable that what\u2019s being offered by the marker market and thus leads to long run success. In simplistic terms, when faced with a fair dice, if one were to be continuously offered odds of 10/1 on rolling a 6, it wouldn\u2019t take long until a profit was made. The key to value investing, therefore, is to able to accurately value companies to allow you to quickly spot a \u2018market error\u2019 and capitalise on it. In Buffett\u2019s case, this was made easier being somewhat of a mathematical prot\u00e9g\u00e9 but also when considering stocks Buffett would look at the underlying business, as thoroughly as he would were he buying the whole company, and often spent week after week scrutinising a company\u2019s business plan, assessing the quality of management team and carefully picking his way through past financial records only to turn down the chance to make an investment. Within his overriding principle of Value investing, it\u2019s possible to consider other factors that undoubtedly contributed to Buffett\u2019s success. In the same manner taught by Graham and Dodd, he would always build a \u2018Margin of Safety\u2019 into his calculations, meaning he\u2019d avoid picking stocks in cases where he deemed only a small undervaluation to have occurred. \u201cIf you understood a business perfectly and the future of the business, you would need very little in the way of a margin of safety \u2013 but you don\u2019t, so you need it\u201d (W. Buffett 1997 Berkshire Hathway Annual Meeting). As a further precaution to improve his chances of success Buffett would only even consider investing in companies that operated in sectors he knew well and thus fell within his \u2018Circle of Competence\u2019. This is an investment principle for which Buffett has been heavily criticised, many analysts have formed the opinion that Buffett greatly missed out on the opportunities presented by the technology sector as a result of being too cautious. In response to his critics Buffett remained unwaveringly confident in his abiding principles, \u201cinvestment success is not a matter of how much you know but rather how realistically you define what you don't know\u201d (W. Buffett 1994). These meticulous tenets, designed to play just as important a role in the decision to turn down and investment, as they are to highlight a lucrative opportunity, are far from the only way an individual may choose to go about selecting their particular stocks. Another extremely popular strategy for investment is that of Growth Investing. As a growth stock investor \u201cyou are paying a premium value for the fast growth of the company\u201d in the hope that the expansion will continue for long enough to vindicate the premium price. This mechanism forms the basis of the most widely recognised advantage of growth stocks. In principle, an investor buys into a company with exciting prospects, the company then rapidly grows, the valuation of the company shoots up and the investor sells his stocks prior to the price falling again. In the case of growth stocks well-defined topping patterns that can be detected by the experienced investor making it easier to know when it\u2019s the right time to sell and thus make a profit. Despite fundamental differences between the two stock picking methods, they are often combined by mutual fund managers looking to spread risk by pooling investments together. By spreading your money across different investment types, you can reduce your overall risk - this is what is known as diversification and in the case of the growth and value stocks, this pooling technique attempts to cherry pick the advantages of both methods to one safer composite investment opportunity. When analysed individually, rather than finding a universal endorsement of one method over the other, it\u2019s widely believed that both can be highly lucrative depending on the wider state of the financial market at the time. Roaring stock markets tend to be led by growth stocks, as in pre-crash 1987 or 1999. But more reasonable annual rises often see value outperform, as in the recovery of the early 1980s or most of the 2003-2007 boom and this appears to have consistently been the case over the past 35 years as the graph below suggests.  In the context of the overriding question, when attempting to assess the overall returns investing produces, this graph also highlights a key feature which can\u2019t be overlooked. It\u2019s true to say that over short periods one method may have out-perform the other, however what is also apparent is the way in which both Growth and Value investing returns have traced each other for the past 3 decades. This comes as a result of them both being heavily impacted upon by the state of the wider financial market (displayed most strikingly during the financial crisis of 2008), thus throwing a vastly unpredictable variable into any calculations regarding a company\u2019s true value. In conclusion, within the stock market there are a number of methods that can be employed in an attempt to be successful but regardless of your chosen strategy, my research has highlighted the need for three key traits. Hard Work, Intelligence and Luck. All of these are crucial if success is to be achieved over a long period of time, with luck possibly playing the more significant part of all. ",

            "answer_text": "Ask your your self what you are trying to achieve from investing. Having this clear would be the most important step. If you are beginner, open an account with a full service broker like Motilal Oswal, ICIC Direct etc. Go for a full service broker because of the services they provide, a stable platform, personal advisor and 24/7 customer service support. Also full service brokers are more value for money compared to discount brokers. Just for saving a few bucks you would end up losing more money due to lack of guidance and support. I have been trading with Motilal Oswal for quite some years. Below are some of the features. Suggest Me: (It answers the following questions)1. I have cash, tell me where to invest. 2. I want 15% annual returns, tell me what to do. 3. I want higher returns versus my investments in FDs or Gold. 4. My portfolio is not performing, how do I improve it?

            "answer_text": "As a serial investor, one very good investment strategy that has made me millions and has a huge impact on my portfolio is investing in the financial market.  Just so you know, the forex market alone is a $5 trillion a day market which means $5 trillion is traded in the forex market on a daily basis. Just a fraction of that to yourself is a lot of money. The good news is that anyone can benefit from what I have just stated above. But how? I would explain below. Not a lot of people know about this but there is something called a social trading platform. A social trading platform is a transparent community where investors/ traders can interact and share information among themselves. Here is where its gets interesting, In a social trading platform, there is a feature called copy trading. The name simply says it all, copy trading is a trading feature which helps traders in the financial markets automatically copy trades and positions executed and managed by a selected investor. There are a couple of social trading platforms out there, but the best of them all is the Etoro Social Trading Platform which is the platform I have been using for over 6 years. More especially, they are the innovators of copy trading and are the best overall which explains why they have over 10 million users from 140 countries. How To Get Started With Copy Trading Using Etoro If you're using the Etoro Social Trading Platform, which I highly recommend you use, here is how you can get started. The platform is user friendly and easy to navigate, but I would be explaining briefly what you need to do. Sign up to the Etoro social trading platform - You can easily do that in a few minutes using a mobile device or PC. Click Here To Sign UpDeposit the amount you are willing to invest - This can be anywhere from as low as $200 or the equivalent in your country.Do a thorough check on the trader you want to copy - Etoro is a very transparent platform and would allow you check detailed infomation on investors you want to copy. Some of the information you can access using Etoro while doing your Research include -The trader\u2019s past performanceTrades Per WeekProfitable WeeksAverage Risk Score, etcThe traders are also given a star rating by the platform based on their experience which makes it easy for you to find the top and most experienced traders to copy. After doing your own proper checks, then you can can allocate some funds to the trader and copy them which is just a click of a button of you\u2019re using Etoro ",

STOCK MARKET is a place where all companies come together to trade their stocks.Stock is basically a piece of company ,if you own a stock you actually own a piece of company.Like any other business if our business makes money you can take the profit,but in this case since you own the part of the company ,the part of the profit of the company will be yours and that is called as \u201cDIVIDEND\u201d For ex: If you buy the apple stock for $20 and then it becomes successful and the stock price increase to $30 that means you have made the profit of $10 ,this is also the way to make money but also you can lose money through this way!If the stock price decrease to $10 then you will face loss. In stock market you make money only if you make right predictions except that the stock are predicted on the basis of their performance,not always of course but usually. For instance,The company like COCA COLA that worth $700 billion and increasing for last 30 years of cousre it may had its own ups and downs but overall its very unlikely to go down . You can invest money through Sharekhan! All you need to do is open a demat account and there you go! ",

            "answer_text": "Oddly, you\u2019re probably better off asking the opposite question - \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst strategy\u201d may provide better opportunities for you to consider. Let me explain why\u2026 Most people equate the \u201cBest Strategy\u201d as the one that has produced the largest returns over a given period of time (often the last several years). This is logical. But, this logic is exactly what leads to the poor results that most investors experience in financial markets.  Successful investing requires you to do the opposite of what human nature encourages you to do. Your goal as an investor is to buy low, and sell high. If you simply look at those investments that have done well recently, you are definitely not buying low. On top of that, it is common to see those high-flying investments run out of new buyers that are needed to continue pushing prices higher. Inevitably, prices fall, you end up regretting your decision, and ultimately you decide to sell. The Tech Bubble in the late 90\u2019s, and the Housing Bubble in the earlier 2000\u2019s, are both good examples of people pouring into what has worked the best. After all, tech companies were going to change the world, and home prices never fall - until they did. The chart below shows some of the most notable bubbles over the last 40 years. The red line represents the current run for Amazon, Google, Netflix, and Facebook. They are also amongst the top stock holdings for most retail investors (either through owning the shares directly or through a mutual fund or ETF). Are there many likely investors left who haven\u2019t heard about these companies? Eventually, there\u2019s not enough new buyer to keep prices rising.  At Prepared Capital, we take a very different approach to increase our clients\u2019 chances of meeting their goal of buying low, and selling high. When the economy is expanding, corporate earning rise, and stock prices generally rise as well. However, when he economy contracts due to a recession, the reverse occurs; earnings decline resulting in a decline in share prices. Rather than trying to pick the perfect investment strategy over the last five years, we focus on forecasting and predicting recessions. Over the last 90 years, the average decline in the S&P 500 during a recession has been -32.5%. Our CycleWise Portfolios use a unique Business Cycle Indicator (blue shaded areas) to provide a warning of when a recession (shaded grey) is imminent.  Our portfolio\u2019s invest in low-cost index funds across various asset classes. However, when our research indicate that we are entering a recession, our portfolios shift to more conservative investments.  This process has produced far better results than what the average investor has experienced over the last 20 years. But admittedly, it will likely never be \u201cThe Best Investment\u201d over any given time period - that is, if you\u2019re measuring it based off of past performance. There will always be an investment that performs better. However, there will be many many more that perform far worse. If you\u2019re dead set on trying to find the investment that will produce the best results, you are better off looking for investments that nobody is telling you about. ",

The best and most popular advice is likely to be - the amount that you can lose and calmly survive this loss. But I think this is wrong, since you initially prepare yourself for failure and they will haunt you. The simplest, but no less effective advice would be: try to save 10-20% of your income every month or week. Divide the deferred amount into 5 parts and buy in equal parts the TOP 5 shares or ETF, which pay the highest dividends. Use only cash account. Never buy with margin. Re-invest the received dividends into the purchase of the same shares from which the dividend was received. Try this for a year. During this time, while you will accumulate your portfolio, devote time to training and education in order to learn more about investing in the stock market. Try stock trading with its multiple methods, but only on demo accounts. Try to study options and options trading strategies and also during the year try trading on a demo account. Believe me, by the end of the year you will have enough money to invest in the stock market, but most importantly, you will understand what your goals are and what are the expectations from investing in the stock market.

In other words, before investing in a company, you should know what business the company is in. Constantly expand your knowledge, but be realistic with your investment choices by identifying what you do and do not know. Always keep your shelf up to date with daily market news.  Investing is never easy, and every company has complex elements to it, but it helps to at least stack the deck in your favor by focusing on companies that you feel you can rely on.

            "answer_text": "Just by simple registration through the people who are affiliated to stock markets. They are Stock Brokers. Firstly, you\u2019re supposed to open an Online Demat account and Trading account for investing. Both of them have their own purposes, like Demat account stands for dematerialized account where it holds the shares and securities in electronic form. And trading account is for trading transactional purposes. These accounts can be done through online also. Later, on creating and registering from a specific broking house, a broker from them would eventually come and meet you up soon and get signatures and other KYC forms done physically. That's it, you'd be given an investor's license and you're registered under SEBI norms and eligible for investing and trading. As soon as you\u2019re done with these registrations, you can make your first investment immediately depending upon your choice. If you're unable to do all these things of your own, you can just directly contact a person from any stock broking house you want and ask them to help. Those hunger cats would be always looking for such new entrants. Picking up the right stock broker and making wise investments is the things that you need to do well in gaining profits. For this, you need to do your homework of tracking various companies financial records and other factors constantly to keep up updated. Finally, when it comes to stockings, learning is the only thing that helps you to make your strategies. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Recommend you start first with a virtual portfolio, Yahoo! finance or Google allow you to set something up like this. After reading a number of books in this area the one point many made was you should set up some kind of rules for your trading that you use consistently, and adapt these rules later. The reason for this is that you need to be very careful about not letting emotions drive what you do. A rule could be something as simple as when you buy a stock also decide for how long, what minimum threshold you would dump it at, what top value you might cash in at. Now you can open an account at one of the discount traders, there are quite a few http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_brokerages_in_the_United_States And you can decide how much money you want to spend, in many you can buy small amount of different stocks, even fixed amount of value. You should not expect to do many transactions as each time you do, you usually lose a little to the broker. Keep in mind that you do not have the same access to information that others do so you should not expect very short term gains. Be careful of jumping onto a stock that everyone is buying, you are likely to not manage to get out of it in time when it falls. When you buy try to think about whether you are buying the company at a good deal and whether it will grow. Read many books but always keep a bit paranoid as everyone else is reading the same stuff, sometimes better to almost do the opposite of what others are doing... Have fun gambling! ",

If you have access to a 401k then contribute at least enough to get any employee match. Pick a few (say 4) funds offered by the plan. Get a mix of large and small, growth and value funds. That way you will be able to see how they respond to different economic conditions. Anything left over could go into an IRA. Amazon has some basic primers on how to pick stocks based on fundamentals. Become familiar with the various ratios that analysts look at, e.g., P/E, P/B, P/S, etc. You may also want to investigate some of the free charting tools and become familiar with looking at stocks, ETFs, etc on different time frames (Month, Week, Day, 4hr, 1hr, etc). This will give you an idea on how stocks these things move. Look at some of the free technical analysis indicators to get an idea what technical analysts look at to time buys and sells. Read a good book on Risk in the markets. Always be comfortable with the risk you are taking on and think about an exit strategy if things look like they are starting to go south. ",

Create an account with a brokerage firm such as Fidelity, TradeKing, Motif Investing, orOptionsHouse to name a few. Each firm offers different benefits and pros and cons. If you are going to be buying stocks, a primary factor to consider is cost per transaction for each.You will need to decide what kind of account to create, a comparison can be found atFidelity. A Roth IRA is typically a good choice when investing for retirement since it protects you from paying taxes on earnings.Once you have created an account, you must fund your account, each site should provide instructions for doing so.At this point buying a stock or mutual fund can vary widely by site, but each site should provide helpful instructions and support for doing so. Just think of it like buying a product on Amazon.Most sites will have an option or tab somewhere labelled \u201ctrade,\u201d or something similar, that should take you to a screen to enter the info of the stock or fund you want to buy. If you ever have any questions as you are getting started, be sure to call the online broker you are using for help. They will be able to give you any specific assistance relative to their system.Key information you will need to provide will be the stock symbol, number of shares to buy or sell and if you want to make a market or limit order. A market order simply means the stock will be bought at whatever price it is at the time of purchase. A limit order allows you some protection, whatever amount you enter for the limit price is the maximum you will pay for the stock. In the case that the price jumps before the trade goes through, the limit order will protect you from paying more than you want. This is rarely an issue to be concerned about, but still a nice feature.You can find my current favorite investments here: Portfolio - Investor in the Family LLCFinally, please be cautious as you begin investing.

            "answer_text": "Doing basic fundamental valuation is quite straightforward; all it takes is a little time and energy. The goal of analyzing a company's fundamentals is to find a stock's intrinsic value, a fancy term for what you believe a stock is really worth - as opposed to the value at which it is being traded in the marketplace. If the intrinsic value is more than the current share price, your analysis is showing that the stock is worth more than its price and that it makes sense to buy the stock. Although there are many different methods of finding the intrinsic value, the premise behind all the strategies is the same: a company is worth the sum of its discounted cash flows. In plain English, this means that a company is worth all of its future profits added together. And these future profits must be discounted to account for the time value of money, that is, the force by which the $1 you receive in a year's time is worth less than $1 you receive today. (For further reading, see Understanding the Time Value of Money). The idea behind intrinsic value equaling future profits makes sense if you think about how a business provides value for its owner(s). If you have a small business, its worth is the money you can take from the company year after year (not the growth of the stock). And you can take something out of the company only if you have something left over after you pay for supplies and salaries, reinvest in new equipment, and so on. A business is all about profits, plain old revenue minus expenses - the basis of intrinsic value. ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest that one of the first things you is to educated yourself about securities, work toward having understanding of them. Question why we even have this system of investing in, supporting enterprises, the system of pricing stocks, Question why if a company is profitable as is there is such a dramatic difference between book value and market value. Why does it make sense to price stocks at multiples of earnings which are not basically and fundamentally justifiable. In other words know what you are contributing to while seeking to gain or achieve increased wealth through participation. From my point of view the those in government do not give a f\u2026\u2026.. about any of us or our country and evaluate what this whole market system which is established, supported and even pushed toward a monopolistic control of who is allowed to invest. Why are new enterprises, private enterprise investing, so controlled in favor of the rich on the premise that the government wants to protect the public yet anyone at all is allowed and in fact encouraged to risk losing everything, getting wiped out, suffering financial losses and do irreversible damage to their life through the public markets. Study about the actual money system involved, why do we just accept that the banking industry is allowed to print money and buy treasuries having a zero balance account, out of nothing they create debt that we will always have to pay back through our income tax payment yet have nothing to do with any of it but risk as much as being imprisoned and fined heavily should we refuse to cooperate? When you invest in the stock market you are supporting a fraudulent money system. Any time anyone wants to take a company public the rich are guaranteed to take a profit. Why? Because they are said to be the only ones to be able to take those monetary risk but I ask myself what risks? Not that there aren\u2019t any but they are reduced for the rich. They are the first to be able to buy any stocks whatsoever in the primary market and profit yet you and I we are allowed to buy stocks only at a much higher price in the secondary market yet the government swears that is in our own best interest, the economies interest, and the promotion of free enterprise, free markets. Heck if I was always guaranteed a profit before anything went public I would be wholeheartedly in support of the free market. I am guaranteed a profit at the lowest possible risk while the rest of the county is not but hey! I can justify it because it presents a way for people to gain, to profit, to become financially wealthy and off the same systematic method of profiting from nothing because stock do not go up in value in proportion to a company\u2019s profits but simply from the thin air people will into existence by bidding prices higher and higher and higher based on nothing but will. So can do finger pointing if we prove to be willing participants in the very same system and we all do it because as long as we benefit the one next to us can just crawl up and die for all we care. We get into a position where we say and show to accept the attitude that, \u201c I took my risk\u201d so f\u2026\u2026 him and f\u2026.. her they took their risks too and I won ! It\u2019s survival of the fittest, and competition among companies generally leads to better products and lower prices. Through investing we cast our votes for who and what will be successful and survive, be around to serve us. We also get rewarded for taking part in the decision making and selection process. We also get punished for being wrong. I am not implying you should not invest. What I am saying is,\u201d educate yourself, know what you are doing and why, for what purpose? You want to begin to have more to save, execute a lifetime plan for financial security and to improve the chances for you to improve the qualify of life you may be able to live. I was once a fighter, never professional, never got paid for it but I knew it was competition, I had to do endurance and strength training. I spared for hours and hours and hours a very long time, simulating every strike that could come at me and from any and all angles and build my ability to effectively defend against it as well as train to quickly take advantage of any and all opportunities I might have to deliver the most effective and strongest strikes of my own. I had to prepare as best I could in the time I had before a fight. You should prepare in the same manner for investing because you have to know it\u2019s a serious life changing competition. You can get ahead or you can get crushed beyond recovery. There is a tremendous amount of free investing training all over the internet you just have to research it and you will find it. There are also books you can buy so search in the public libraries or in bookstores for such. There are also free trading accounts which are essentially investing accounts you can use for practicing virtual trading or virtual investing. Most modernday brokers offer such programs and get you started as well, with simulated starting account balance but know that in the real world investing and trading do not work with such efficiency as a computer program regardless of how realistic is may seem. Consult with licensed and registered investment advisors but do not get started with any immediate recommendation until you have had time to educate and train yourself as best and as completely as you reasonable can.

            "answer_text": "How lucky do you feel?  Real lucky, open a TD Ameritrade or similar brokerage account.  Pick a company you think has good prospects and buy the stock.A little luckier than most, open a Vanguard account and buy an index fund tilted at a specific slice of the market, ex. small capitalization, growth or value stocks, foreign markets.As lucky as the next guy, open a Vanguard account and buy an index fund for the entire market or the large-capitalization sector. I suppose there is one other question, do you have a job where you have inside information but would not be arrested for insider trading?  Assuming the answer is no, the reasoning behind the above is simple.  The stock market, using a technical term, is fairly efficient.  What that really means is that most information is already reflected in the stock price.  All movements in the price are based either in random fluctuation (i.e. luck) or new information.  And even with new information, it is not easy to predict how the market will respond short term (i.e. measured in days to weeks).  Long term (measured in years) new information is just the performance of the company.  So, if you feel lucky and want to bet on random fluctuation, buy an individual stock.  By buying a basket of stocks (i.e. mutual fund) that random fluctuation on average goes away unless you buy and sell it real fast.  When you invest in that mutual fund for the long term you are buying the market return or the return based on the average company performance.  Certain sectors, like small capitalization firms, have historically had higher returns.  That might be due to risk, it might be due to perceived risk, it might just be a historical accident.  So if you feel a little lucky, you might pick a sector you think will return more than the entire market.  If you don't want to gamble, buy the broadest market you can.  And then forget you bought it until you need the cash.  Index funds outperform something like 85% of stock-pickers and they do so with very small costs to own.  You trade the big wins and big losses of gambling for the market return.  And if you buy and forget you won't do what most stock pickers do, buy high and sell low. ",

            "answer_text": "My technique is for al my investment more or less the same. I buy for max $250 a investmentvehicle. If the vehicle can go to zero, like stocks, I will never buy more if the price go down and I do not sell with loss. If the vehicle cannot go to zero, like physical silver I will buy every month more of it for a small amound of money. If the price go up, I will sell for $250 and have some stocks for free. An other advice I always give is to buy each month 1 ounce of PHYSICAL silver and keep it until the day you retire. In the long run you will have profits. You will not easely sell the silver for other purposes (very important), so you will have your own retirement capital, even if it is a relatively small sum of money. If you are 20 years of age, you have lived for 240 month and you should have 240 ounces of physical silver. One ounce of silver cost now more or less $20, so you should not feel the buy in your budget, even if you have to buy two ounces for the next 240 month, because you start to late with that idee. I each month one stock for very little money. Most invester laugh in my face when I say howmuch I spend on a stock. I bought 70 Novo (CINGF) for 3 CAD or 2 EUR (you have to calculate to your common currency) I device the buyingcost with the number of shares. I payd \u20ac39, but for the example I will use \u20ac35. \u20ac35/70=\u20ac0.5 per share. So I have bought each share for \u20ac2.5. If the future price does not go higher than \u20ac2.5 I do nothing. If the price go to \u20ac2.9 (the CAD can go up or down in EUR to, so I have to calculate carefully in the future) than I will sell 90% of those 70 shares. That is 63*2.9=\u20ac182.7. I will have to pay \u20ac35 sellingcost. 182.7\u201335=\u20ac147.7. So I keep 7 shares Novo (CINGF) for the price of \u20ac2.3 or \u20ac0.33 for one share. From that moment on I keep those 7 shares as \u201cfree\u201dl shares in my possession. How do I choose my shares? Almost as Jacko, the stockmarketgorilla (find out on the internet) I only will by if the price/profit is low enough (nowdays one can buy stocks wiht a price/profit of 35. That is way to high. Should atlist be under 20 and better is under 15. I do not give financial advice. You will have to act on your own responsbility. Mijn techniek van beleggen is min of meer voor alle beleggingsproducten hetzelfde. Ik koop voor een relatief klein bedrag. 100 euro in aandelenwereld is een heel klein bedrag. De meeste beleggers halen hun neus op voor zijn kleine investeringen. Ik niet. Ik koop bijvoorbeeld 70 Novo (CINGF) aan 3 CAD of 2 EUR. Ik deel de aankoopkosten door het aantal aandelen en voeg ze toe aan mijn aankoopprijs. Ik betaal 35 euro (fictief getal) aan kosten. Aankoopkost per aandeel is 35/70 of 0,5 euro. Ik tel het op bij mijn kost van 2 EUR. Elk aandeel kost mij 2,5 EUR of een totaal kost van 70*2,5 of 175 EUR. Nu \"vergeet\" ik die aankoop tot de koers van Novo boven de 3 EUR staat. De koers in CAD is voor mij minder relevant. Dat kan later hoger of lager staan dan 1,5 CAD voor 1 EUR. Het is dus telkens opnieuw even uitrekenen, wanneer ik controleer of de koers mijn gewenste niveau heeft bereikt of niet. Bereikt de koers niet mijn gewenste niveau, dan doe ik niets. Ik verkoop niet met verlies. Dat is de reden dat ik met kleine bedragen werk. Bereikt de koers mijn gewenste koers, dan verkoop ik bijv 90% van mijn aandelen. 90% van 70 aandelen is 63 aandelen. 63*3=189 EUR. Daardoor krijg ik mijn aankoopbedrag volledig terug \u00e9n heb ik nog 7 aandelen in bezit. Dit zijn vanaf het verkoopogenblik \"gratis\" aandelen. Deze methode kunt U ook toepassen op uw edelmetaal. Ik geen geen financieel advies. U belegt op uw eigen verantwoordelijkheid en eigen risico. ",

            "answer_text": "Investing in stocks is an exceptional way to build wealth due to the power of the compounding effect. For long-term investors, stocks are a good investment even during periods of market volatility. First, You need to question yourself before investing, what kind of investor you want to be? Some investors want to take an active hand in managing their money's growth, and some prefer to \"set it and forget it.\" Also, you need to decide what kind of investing you want to do: Trading or Value Investing. Well, Value Investing in the stock market is the most common way for beginners to gain investment experience. Later on, once you gain proper knowledge and tenacious discipline, you can start trading.  Let's say, you are a DIY kind of a person and interested in managing your investment. Here are some steps for you: Learn to Analyze: You need to have a little knowledge of finance. You should be able to distinguish the financial health of a company. This is generally done by examining the company's profit and loss account, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. This can be time-consuming. Also, you need to understand key financial ratios like P/E Ratio, P/BV Ratio, PEG Ratio, etc.  Purpose of Investment: You need to be very clear on your purpose of investment. Before you get into investing of any kind, you first have to make sure that your overall financial situation is in a position to accommodate the new activity. You must consider the present as well as future needs. You must list your incomes and deduct all your expenses along with debt obligations (if any) to find the investible amount. Everyone's purpose for investing is to make money, but you may be focused on generating an income supplement during retirement, on preserving your wealth, or on capital appreciation.  Each of these goals requires a very different strategy. So, this will help you determine your investment strategy. Selection- Industry & Stock: You have to select an industry of your knowledge or interest. Then, you need to read the financial news and development of the industry. You can have this passive research by keeping up with industry blogs by writers whose views interest you. You need to understand and study the macro-economic situations which impact the company directly or indirectly. So that, you can shortlist the stocks for your investment whose business perspective is conceivable by you. As for the beginners, my suggestion would be that you invest in a variety of assets. By doing so, you will diminish the risk of your investment's performance severely cutting the return of your overall investment. You could think of it as financial jargon for \"don't put all of your eggs in one basket.\" Now, for those who don't have much time or energy for these things mentioned above, I suggest you find the best and appropriate Full-Service Traditional Brokers whose services include financial advice for retirement, healthcare, and everything related to money. Or you should go with the Stock Research Analyst if you only need guidance for the stock market, who follows the movement of publicly traded stocks, analyzes market trends, and other drivers that influence stock prices. I for one, have experienced both kinds of services. Firstly, I opted for the Full-Service from Arihant Traders, which was quite a good experience. But, as I wasn't using all the offered services, I discontinued. I wanted to solemnly concentrate on Stock Market so I tried Research Analyst firm Eqwires who typically generate financial reports about market trends or individual stocks for you according to your strategy. Now the only thing left for you is Demat Account. A Trading and Demat account is a must to start trading in the stocks. Few essentials required to open Demat Account are as follow: Bank accountBrokerAADHAARPAN CardBank StatementPersonalized chequeWell, It\u2019s not a cumbersome process and it can be opened online and quickly with no trouble. You\u2019re all set now. Hope, it helps you in your investing journey! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, Most of the answers would be either about SIP\u2019s , Mutual funds and learning fundamental analysis for selecting a share like MRF which can generate great returns, well my answer is different. I will share some of screenshots of profits that i made. First of all, you have really asked a million dollar question whose answer is sought after by almost everyone who wants to earn. Having said that, please read my below answer, I hope it helps: To put it simply, the best way is to earn in Stock Market is through BTST Trades and Options. How, you ask? Well, because Options are too risky. Yes, indeed, they are but only if you buy naked options. So to avoid that kind of risk taking, the best way is to implement option strategies. Let\u2019s talk about Option Strategies first, shall we? Now, what are option strategies?To put it in the simplest of words, strategies are combination of buying and selling calls and puts made in such a way that there is a pre-defined risk and the earning potential is huge. Are strategies safe?Yes, of course they are because of the pre-defined risk. You can only lose a limited amount of money which you can afford, if that isn\u2019t promising, I don\u2019t know what is. How can you identify which strategies to implement?There are two ways: one, you can do your own research if you are interested in the market, and also, if you have got time at your disposal. Two, you can simply follow a Telegram Channel that suggests these strategies and how to go about them. I personally follow Finroot Telegram Channel and I have to say that they have 100% success rate when it comes to Option Strategies. It is tried & tested. Now, talking about Buy Today Sell Tomorrow, or BTST. How does it work?The concept of BTST is fairly new. It is about buying a share after 3:15 pm and selling the next day at 9:15. Of course, timings are just as per NSE/BSE. What about its accuracy?More than 80% if you follow the right call service. What type of risk exists in BTST?As against the option strategies, BTST has a little more risk involved. One being huge gap-down or gap-up opening which may not always be predictable. Secondly, if you are rather new to the market and do not have fast fingers, you may miss the rates at which you are supposed to buy/sell. Whom should I follow?Like I mentioned above, I follow Finroot Telegram Channel for almost 1.5 years now, and I am greatly satisfied with their calls. About Finroot: Fee: Free Channel, no fee Join: Search Finroot on Telegram and you should be able to locate them easily.Join the channel which has more than 6000 subscribers. Services: BTST, almost daily, based on market conditions.Option Strategies- 3\u20135 in a monthThanks for reading. Well i am attaching some of screenshots of BTST trades and option Strategies.

            "answer_text": "I have been associated with the stock market for almost three decades. It is my job to research and invest for a longer period. I never speculated. I always stay away from daily selling, future options, coal-proofs and so on. I want to tell how I invest in the stock market. The price of shares in the stock market rises to the highest share of the company. If there is a possibility of growth in the company, then I read annual reports, research report etc. of those small companies. I also look at the company's website. You get it on the Stoke Exchange website.For me in research, it is most important to see what the company's management is, how the product market is, how much dividend payouts are, how much the plant utilities, and how much the loan is on the company.To see the company's stock's valuation is low or to see more, see the company's earnings on the stock, price earning ratio, book value and return on capital employed. All this information is available to you from stock exchanges that are related to the stock market related to the data bank. You can also use money control if you wish.When everything is fine, I invest in that company's stock with at least two years' perspective. Sometimes, for the national or international reasons, the market continues to decline for months, I consider it an investment opportunity and keep adding to that company's share of every fall.Along with this I see quarterly results of the company which show the company's sales, margins, profits. It is also necessary to see the company's quarterly shareholding pattern, which shows that the promoter is not selling its shares. Do not pledge share? Or which fund or big investor is buying it in large quantities? You can easily see it on the stock exchange website like BSE, NSE. The disclosure sent by the stock exchange to the company must also be seen.If all is well, I set a price target for myself. And if I sell that stock in most stocks, I sell the remaining 25 fissile shares with the staples, and increase the price target.Sometimes returns can be found early and sometimes it takes patience. Sometimes, if the company does not give its performance accordingly, then the stock has to be sold even after losses.For the monthly housekeeping, the stock should not be dependent on the market, so I am related to another business for him.Finally, the most important thing is to understand the risks of investment in the stock market. Investments in small companies remain extremely risky, big companies offer less returns, but the risk is very low.Do not invest your Hard earned earnings on anyone's say or market tips.

            "answer_text": "You can go your whole life without ever buying a single stock. But until you do, you won't really understand the full potential of investing -- and the rewards that come with it. For beginners, mutual funds give you a great way to get your feet wet. With just a few hundred dollars, you can invest in a mutual fund that will give you instant access to thousands of different stocks. The diversification that comes with broad-based mutual funds brings with it a measure of security. You may still lose a lot if the whole market goes down, but if one particular company gets hurt, it won't have a huge impact on your overall portfolio. Conversely, though, buying individual stocks can be a lot more rewarding. You can earn far greater returns from individual stocks than you'll ever find from a diversified mutual fund -- if you pick the right stocks. So how should you pick? Investing, like most other things, requires that you have a general philosophy about how to do things in order to avoid careless errors. Would you make a souffle without a recipe? Would you play cello in the London Philharmonic Orchestra without sheet music? Would you aim a shuffleboard disk without figuring out whether you're trying to knock off your own color or your opponent's? We hope not. So before you dig deeper into some specialized investing strategies, you should first understand the various methods people use to analyze stocks. While investing is not nearly as difficult as these other challenges (especially the souffle), you certainly need a considered plan before investing your hard-earned savings. Fundamental Analysis -- Buying a Business (Value, Growth, Income, GARP, Quality) Many people rightly believe that when you buy a share of stock you are buying a proportional share in a business. As a consequence, to figure out how much the stock is worth, you should determine how much the business is worth. Investors generally do this by assessing the company's financials in terms of per-share values in order to calculate how much the proportional share of the business is worth. This is known as \"fundamental\" analysis by some, and most who use it view it as the only kind of rational stock analysis. Although analyzing a business might seem like a straightforward activity, there are many flavors of fundamental analysis. Investors often create oppositions and subcategories in order to better understand their specific investing philosophy. In the end, most investors come up with an approach that is a blend of a number of different approaches. Many of the distinctions are more academic inventions than actual practical differences. For instance, value and growth have been codified by economists who study the stock market even though market practitioners do not find these labels to be quite as useful. In the following descriptions, we will focus on what most investors mean when they use these labels, although you always have to be careful to double-check what someone using them really means. Value. A cynic, as the saying goes, is someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. An investor's purpose, though, should be to know both the price and the value of a company's stock. The goal of the value investor is to purchase companies at a large discount to their intrinsic value -- what the business would be worth if it were sold tomorrow. In a sense, all investors are \"value\" investors, in that they want to buy a stock that is worth more than what they paid. Typically, those who describe themselves as value investors are focused on the liquidation value of a company, or what it might be worth if all of its assets were sold tomorrow. However, value can be a very confusing label as the idea of intrinsic value is not specifically limited to the notion of liquidation value. Novices should understand that although most value investors believe in certain things, not all who use the word \"value\" mean the same thing. The person viewed as providing the foundation for modern value investing is Benjamin Graham, whose 1934 book Security Analysis (co-written with David Dodd) is still widely used today. Other investors viewed as serious practitioners of the value approach include Sir John Templeton and Michael Price. These value investors tend to have very strict, absolute rules governing how they purchase a company's stock. These rules are usually based on relationships between the current market price of the company and certain business fundamentals. Examples include: Price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) below a certain absolute limit.Dividend yields above a certain absolute limit.Book value per share at a certain level relative to the share price.Total sales at a certain level relative to the company's market value",

            "answer_text": "Stock prices fluctuate over time. These fluctuations are unpredictable. With progressing time, these fluctuations may accumulate in an uptrend or downtrend. During recessions and financial crises, these downtrends may go down to about half of your original investments if you are well diversified. If you are betting on only one or a few stocks, you may go down as much as -85%. The upturns in the stock market usually last longer than the down turns, so that your long-term annual returns may vary between 5% and 40%, depending on how clever your trading system is. There are ways to minimize drawdowns, but you need a fair understanding of the underlying mathematics and hedging techniques of the statistical fluctuations to design trading systems that will do that for you. When you just buy ETFs, you track certain parts of the market and with it the drawdowns. Just realize the following. Suppose you start with $1000, and you would have invested this in a tracker of the S&P 500 on December 31, 2018. Yesterday, on November 20, 2019, you would have made 24% in not even a year\u2019s time. Your account is now worth $1240. For all standards, that is a very good return for not even a year\u2019s time. In Euros you would have added another 4.5%! But suppose that the market will turn into a bear market, and in 1.5 years time you loose -56% of your current investment like in the past Global Financial Crisis. That would imply that in May, 2021, your account may be worth $546. In the following year, you will do very well if you add 25% and do that 3.5 years in a row. So after 5 years from today, you would be back at your investment level of today. That is what you may choose for when you track the market. Just sit tight for 5 years and loose about 10% of the purchasing power of your wealth. It may take some additional years to catch up with inflation. I would only start in the stock market when you understand how to maximize your odds to prevent to get stuck in a 7 years stalemate. There are several ways to prevent that, and one way may be more successful than another. Search the Internet of how the investors do that. Last year, the S&P500 lost -6.2% and had a drawdown of almost -20%. A handful of hedge funds still produced double-digit returns. I made 3.5% on my private fund using my own software, DigiFundManager. The actual performance is shown on my site as is the mathematical modelling. You may freely access the risk-management module of the software with your favorite device using you browser of choice. It is a pretty unique algorithm that publicly can be accessed for free. It helps you to manage your drawdowns by simulating past performance through a couple of recessions. Past performance is your best predictor of success, but no guarantee. ",

It is well known that stock market is one of the most complex thing to understand where most people lose money and few people who know the game well get richer.I have studied many years and always tried to understand the pattern that makes a stock price to move higher.Here is those foolproof patterns that never fails to provide best buying opportunities most of the time.Buy a stock at 52 week high. Buy a stock if it has touched its 52 week high recently. But dont buy if the stock has already given more than 200% return in last 1 year or more than 100% return in last 6 months. Avoid buying from a sector which already has a huge run up for last 1 year.Buy a stock after quarterly earnings. Buy a stock when its last quarterly earnings (both sales and profit) is better than earning over same quarter last year (year on year) and previous quarter (quarter on quarter). And last quarter (read latest) earning is highest among last four quarters.Earning visibility or Good news impacting revenue. Buy whenever there is a positive news that has positive impact on companys revenue.Of course these three patterns are not ALL, one need to check other indicators and perform analysis before investing into any stock.Note: It is not as easy as it may seem to find a stock fulfilling these three criteria.

            "answer_text": "Stock market is a market place to buy and sell shares. A share entitles the shareholder to a part ownership of the company. The amount of money made through stocks is directly proportional to the money made by the company or simply said earnings of the company. Even though there are several financial parameters that are used to value stocks, earnings are the most important. So, whether you make better return through stocks than the fixed deposit depends on how patient and skilled you are as an investor. The returns in stock market depend totally on your hard work and analysis. To achieve the best possible results, it is advisable to stay invested for the long term and stay calm during the upheavals in the market. Another interesting opportunity presented by the stock market is the option to use compound interest to maximise our returns. Perhaps, a business is the only activity that beats stock returns over long term. To start investing, I advise you to take the bottom up approach and not to be troubled by the macro-economic factors. Be as specific as you can be about the prospects of your company. Avoid companies that are very sensitive to the market volatility like oil exploration companies where there is little to do with the company if oil prices crash. Although there are opportunities in such sectors, make calculated investments. Think creatively in such situations, like investing in companies that provide pipes to these oil companies instead of directly betting on the business. It is a fact that many quality companies are available cheap during recessions and crashes, so it makes sense to build a small fund from your savings specially meant for investing in dirt cheap stocks in terms of valuations, not penny stocks. When everybody is running away, you run towards the market. However, do not sit out for such opportunities, keep investing within your means. Another situation where you must keep your calm is when ram,shyam, pappu and seeta are making more money than you in the market. Do not fall prey to hot sectors or hot stocks. There is no shame in underperforming your \u2018peers\u2019. Instead, if the textile sector is buzzing, invest in good speciality chemical companies supplying to the major textile players or manufacturers of synthetic fabric. This will insulate you from the wild fall that follows such unwarranted optimism and at the same time you will not lose out. If you cannot do it or do not have the time, no problem. You are not losing anything. Let your company generate you those \u2018meagre\u2019 20% returns consistently. Just make it a point to stick to what you know and be a responsible investor. If you believe something is wrong with the company, raise your voice, you OWN the company. If you do not bother to to protect your interest, why should someone else do. So, there is a need for investor participation here. You can do your part by regularly questioning the company and attending all the meetings that you are invited to. If you aren\u2019t, just gatecrash. Don\u2019t try it with the company\u2019s board meeting though:) Happy Investing!!! If you feel any of your questions remain unanswered, just let me know, since I found the details little confusing. ",

            "answer_text": "In the uncertainty of stock market it is good to have certain tips, which are helpful. No one wants to incur losses in trades. It is due to this reason they book profit immediately. But hold on their loss generating stocks, in the hope of prices going up. So, let\u2019s look at the tips which will help you making money in stock market:  1. SET LONG TERM GOALS: Investing in any stock is like planting a seed. As the planted seed needs time to grow, in the same way our investments needs time to grow. The more time we will give our investments, more will be the return. But, be cautious as every tree has its own life, in the same way every investment also has its own duration. It is better to wind up your investments, when you observe a change in the business model of the company. Also, in long term goals you get the benefit of compounding. Compounding helps you in earning interest over your interest. It is the principle of compounding which makes long term investments more profitable. 2. BUY WINNERS: It is a commonly observed mistake of the investors, bottom fishing. No one really can tell about the bottom or top of a stock. Imagine a case, a stock has become a ten-bagger, and there is another stock which has seen a downside of 34% from its high. Which one will you go for? What many do is that they buy the stock which has fallen by 34%. I don\u2019t really understand what makes them do so. But, for the ones who are buying the ten-bagger have to be extra cautious to find its right valuation. So, what should be done in such cases? It is good to for the ten-bagger only when the company is showing good performance and the big investors are still interested in the stock. To know more click here. 3. SELL LOSERS: If a company is showing a bad performance, then it is good to stay away from those stocks. If one goes for investing in that kind of stocks, will undoubtedly end up making losses. 4. DON\u2019T CHASE RETURNS: According to a very famous book, \u201cIt is good to study for knowledge, then for marks\u201d. The same is implemented in stock market. If you look the chart of a multibagger stock, you will observe that before becoming a multibagger. It shows a very flat movement for a long time interval. The flat movement is due to the consolidation of stock, which gives support for bull movement. Many return chasing investors, sell their stocks during this consolidation period. The reason behind their selling is the stock not moving up. And thus lose the bull movement. So, look out for the fundamentals of stock, not the returns. 5. FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS: Don\u2019t buy a stock just because your friend bought it or someone advised you to buy it. Before buying or selling a stock do proper research about it. Check its results and management. The management of a company plays a very significant role in its performance. For more information about fundamental analysis click here. 6. BUY AT GOOD PRICE: Will you buy onions @ 300 rupees per kg? I will certainly not buy it. But, in stock market many investors buy overvalued stocks and then end up in losses. The valuation of a stock is a very important factor to look for before making an investment. According to WARREN BUFFETT, \u201c Price is what you pay, value is what you get\u201d. 7. CONTROL YOUR GREED: When a stock shows a very good up move, then the investors start increasing their expectations. And, this increase in expectations without any proper reason becomes the reason of their loss. Nothing in stock market happens without a reason. It depends on the capability of the investor to forecast the reason early. So, be greedy only when there is a reason to be. According to WARREN BUFFETT, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful\u201d. 8. FUTURE OF THE COMPANY: Will you ever apply for a job in a company, which has the possibility of sinking the very next year? I guess no. Same should be case with your investments. Before buying a stock of any company it is important to check out the future prospects of a company. Investing requires making informed decisions based on conditions that are yet to happen. Past data can indicate opportunities or problems to come, but it\u2019s never guaranteed. While large short-term profits often help the traders, but long-term investing is very important to achieve big in stock market. Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "Hey!  In order to be able to invest in share market in India, the following procedures need to be followed. Get a PAN or Aadhar cardPAN card or an Aadhar card is a mandatory requirement for investing in India. It is required for KYC (know your client) procedure while opening an account with the market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Besides this, the government has mandated six-month bank statement along with a cancelled cheque, under the new rules to open a demat account. Get a brokerA person cannot go directly to the stock market to buy or sell shares. Buying and selling of stocks has to be done through brokers. They are individuals, companies or agencies registered with and authorised by Sebi to trade on the stock exchanges. Brokers will charge a brokerage fee or brokerage for the assistance they provide. Get a demat account Once you have a broker, the next step is to open a demat and trading account. This account will hold the stocks that you have purchased and will reflect them in your name. Shares cannot be held in physical form and they form part of the dematerialised or demat account. Buying and Selling In order to buy or sell shares, one needs to inform the broker the quantity to be bought or sold along with the price at which you wish to carry out the transaction. While investing in the share market, these are the ways to invest: 1. Understand your investment requirement and take decisions accordingly.2. Decide your goal and plan the investment strategy accordingly. Find out the stocks that are likely to align with your investment objectives.3. Enter the market at the right time. Try and buy the share at its lowest cost especially when the market is weak and sell when it rallies. This would yield higher returns.4. While trading you should communicate the requirements to your broker. Ensure that the broker does accordingly and cross-check to avoid any errors.5. Monitor your portfolio regularly. Instead of keeping all eggs in one basket, have the best possible mix of stocks. It helps to avoid unnecessary risk.

            "answer_text": "First, you don't invest.  This step seems counterintuitive to your goal. But if you need to ask this question, I'm assuming you're new.  Second, read quality books.  Don't read the books with flashy titles. Read Security Analysis by Ben Graham. It's textbook like title should signal to you it's the real gritty stuff.  Third, start low and be patient.  Don't invest your life savings. Don't do any speculative plays. You're not gambling, you're investing. There tends to be confusion on what's actually investing. A speculator calls himself an investor, but he is still purely a speculator.  Investors tend to be overzealous when they start out and think they're invincible when the stocks go up, when in fact they are just lucky in a bull market. You only truly know your skill when you've had a track record in a recession. Start small and get the hang of it first. When you've lost a significant amount of money, but not too much, then start consider investing substantial amounts, but tread lightly.  ",

While it's certainly possible (even easy) to make money investing in the stock market, it's also possible to lose really quickly if you don't know what you're doing because it most certainly involves Risk and usually risk comes from not knowing what you're doing. (I stress on It!, It's very important)   Be aware of your decisons. While your question lacks details and I certainly  can't make it where you wanna invest or but I'll try to answer your doubts step by step. There are so many ways to invest in stocks.  Individual Stocks.Mutual Funds.Index Funds.Diversified Funds.ETF's. , Domestic , Foreign.how can you decide what is exactly right for you? First things first, ask these questions to yourself? It will generally tell you how can you decide what is right for you?  Do you wanna involve Risk? Have much time and interest do you have for investing?Do you want your eggs in one nest or do you wanna diverse your portfolio?Most people are aware of a stock's price. Investors and analysts talk about a company's price going up or down on the market in a given day. However, out of context, a stock price gives very little information about the health or value of a company. To truly understand how well a stock is doing, you need to look at a variety of factors.  EPS (Earning Per Share), It is usually the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It serves as an indicator of a company's profitability.P/E Ratio ( Price To Earning ratio), or simply valuation ratio of a company's current share price compared to its per-share earnings. Calculated as: Market Value per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)Market capitalization, It is the valuation of the company based on its current share price and the total number of outstanding stocks. i.e  current share price multiplied by all outstanding shares. This gives you a general idea of the size of a company.Outstanding Shares, This refers to the total number of shares of a company held by all its investors. It is useful in calculating P/E ratio and Earning Per Share.Dividend, This is the only topic which doesn't need deep introduction. It is usually a sum of money paid regularly (typically annually) by a company to its shareholders out of its profits (or reserves). Once you've perfectly understood the above terminology and you know how they function , it is time to invest.  Find a broker you are comfortable with, either an online broker or one with a local office or both. Ameritrade, E-Trade, and Sharebuilder (Equivalent Indian Brokerages- Kotak Securities, Reliance Money, India Bulls) Call and talk with the person, if necessary. Then, fill out the paperwork, Deposit some money,Open a DEMAT account or a trading account whichever stock market your broker deals with,Investment Tips / Advice: *imp*  If you plan on investing in only stocks, make sure to spread the funds across different sectors such as healthcare, technology, small cap and big cap.If you are naturally not someone to take risks, and feel uncomfortable doing so but still want to invest in stocks, the best bet for you might be mutual funds or index funds.Before you jump into the stock market, spend some time thinking about what you want to accomplish and how to do that while staying within your risk tolerance.Buying for Short Term is much more dangerous than Long Term Investing.After all, it's your money - you should know what you are doing with it.

            "answer_text": "The stock market can help you make a lot of money, but you can lose all your money if you are tempted to invest randomly without knowing the nitty-gritty of the market. Here's what you need to know about the market.  X Before making your first investment, take the time to learn the basics about the stock market and the individual securities composing the market. If you are thinking of investments that could beat inflation and also give you good returns, one option might be to start investing in the stock market. If you have decided to do the same and go for it all by yourself, it\u2019s not a bad idea. The stock market, when properly understood, can help you make a lot of money, but you can also lose all your money if you are tempted to invest randomly without knowing the nitty-gritty of the market. Therefore, there are a few things you must know before you dive into the share market. Here they go: 1. Never jump blindly into stock markets Many a times it happens that while talking to your friends and colleagues, the discussion heads towards the stock market, and also how the stock market helps investors make big money. You might never have invested in the market, but after hearing about all those things you also decide to buy some stocks. However, if you entered the market just to remain in the mainstream fashion, you have landed in for the wrong reason. You should invest in the stock market after getting the basic knowledge about it and in accordance with your financial goals. 2. Stock market is not a money-making machine You must have heard the story about many investors who made their fortune through the market. Many believe that the stock market is like a money-making machine, which can turn them into millionaires over a period of time. Well, it is true that a lot of investors have made profits through the stock market. But it was only possible because they\u2019ve good market knowledge, made some really smart choices by adopting carefully thought of strategies, and are also much disciplined in their approach. Many people forget that a lot of people have lost their entire wealth, while some have been forced to sell their personal assets to cover the loss in the market. 3. Educate yourself, handle basics first Before making your first investment, take the time to learn the basics about the stock market and the individual securities composing the market. There is an old adage: It is not a stock market, but a market of stocks. Your focus will be upon individual securities which you are investing in and the relationship with the broader economy and the factors that drive your stock. Some important areas which you should be familiar with before entering the market are: # Understanding financial metrics and definitions such as PE, EPS, ROE, Market Cap and so on # Popular Methods of Stock Selection and Timing, such as fundamental and technical analyses # Trading basics, rules, compliances and terminology as market order types including market orders, limit order, stop market orders, stop limit orders, trailing stop loss orders, and other types commonly used by investors, margin money required if you want to trade in F&O. # Gain some understanding about the market and its relationship with the economy such as market relationship with inflation, GDP, fiscal deficit, crude prices, rupees values against dollar. People lose money in the markets because they simple jump to the market without understanding the economic and investment market cycles. 4. Invest only your surplus funds The biggest mistake newbie investors make is to invest money that they can\u2019t actually afford to lose. Investing in the stock market is risky, and that means that you can potentially lose everything. Like any investment, there are inherent risks associated with the stock market. Some are the risks related to the overall market as systematic risk that you can\u2019t avoid by diversifying your portfolio, while some risks are stock-specific that you can avoid. You need to decide your own risk tolerance considering your age, financial strength, retirement goal, etc, and accordingly should take the risk. If you want to take risk in the stock market, then only invest your surplus funds which you can afford to lose. Investment is done to generate more money, but do not invest all your emergency funds in the stock market. 5. Avoid Leverage Leverage simply means use of borrowed money to execute your stock market strategy. In a margin account, banks and brokerage firms can lend you money to buy stocks. It sounds great when the stock market is moving up, but consider the other side when the stock market or your stock goes down. In that case your loss would not only erode your initial investment, but you will also have to pay interest to the broker. Leverage is, thus, a tool, neither good nor bad. However, it is best used after you gain experience and confidence about your decision-making abilities. Therefore limit your risk when you are starting out to ensure you can profit over the long term. 6. Avoid herd mentality Unlike many investors do, you should avoid the herd mentality that is influenced by the actions of your acquaintances, neighbors or relatives without evaluating the current information and underlying stocks. Thus, if everybody around is investing in a particular stock, the tendency for potential investors is to do the same. But this strategy is bound to backfire in the long run if you have not chosen the stock by careful analysis. So, if you really don\u2019t understand about the stock, never step in. Before investing in a company, you should know about its business. It\u2019s important to only invest in businesses that are easy for you to understand, especially while you\u2019re just starting out. Never invest in a stock. Invest in a business instead. 7. Diversify, but refrain from over diversification Never put all your money in one stock. Create a well-diversified portfolio of stocks that can help you reduce the risk and save you from losing money if a few stock do not perform well. Also, avoid over diversification, as increase in the number of stocks up to a certain limit do help in diversifying the risk proportionately, but beyond a certain number of stocks your investment can\u2019t get the proper growth moment. 8. Don\u2019t try to time the market, follow a disciplined investment approach A majority of investors try to time the market, something that financial planners have always been warning them to avoid, and thus lose their hard-earned money in the process. No one is able to successfully and consistently time the market by catching the tops and bottoms over multiple business or stock market cycles. You can invest over a period small amounts of money to average the market and can get the benefit in the long term. Investors who put in money in right shares systematically over the long term generate outstanding returns. Hence, it is prudent to have patience and follow a disciplined investment approach besides keeping a long-term broad picture in mind. 9. Don\u2019t let emotions impact your investment Separate your emotion from any particular stock as many investors end losing money in the stock markets due to their inability to control emotions. Get rid of the fear and greed cycle. Do not invest in any speculative unknown stock lured by its past fabulous return without understanding the risk involved that will lead you to suffer loss. In a bear market, control your fear and don\u2019t panic and sell shares at rock-bottom prices. Thus, fear and greed are the worst emotions to feel when investing, and it is better not to be guided by them. 10. Have realistic expectations Hoping for the \u2018best\u2019 from your investments is not wrong, but you could be heading for trouble if your financial goals are based on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, lots of stocks have generated more than 100 per cent returns during the great bull run of recent years. However, it doesn\u2019t mean that you should always expect the same kind of return from the stock markets. If you feel that stocks in your portfolio are overvalued, it is better to switch to a relatively low value good stock. Lastly it\u2019s important to monitor your investment and review it periodically as any important event happening in any part of the world does have an impact on our financial markets. Also, any news or financial event related to a particular stock or industry impacts that stock. ",

Thus the best \u201cstrategy\u201d is to know WHY you are doing, what you are doing, before, not after, you start doing it. Be at cause, not at effect, with the universe. When done correctly the investment process is no different than the process of planting a tree. In both cases all of the really hard work is put in before, not after, the investment is placed into the ground. Inactivity, not activity, will take care of the bulk of the rest. Learning not to disturb something that will only be worth a great deal more later is the key. Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "This is one of those questions where anyone with knowledge of the market could write a dissertation. You\u2019re also going to get a myriad of answers. James P. O\u2019Shaughnessy wrote a book on this topic called What Works on Wall Street if you\u2019re interested in reading it. I\u2019ll save you the trouble of reading it by sharing one important finding he highlights in the book\u2026  ***Spoiler Alert*** Using P/S ratio in combination with relative strength was found to be the best way to invest in stocks. You still needed to have a diversified portfolio, however, of around 20\u201330 stocks. You\u2019d also have to repeat the search process every year and select the lowest P/S stocks with the highest relative strength. I heard that O\u2019Shaughnessy himself couldn\u2019t even stomach the strategy. The volatility is high. One year you could be down 40% or more. Most people don\u2019t have the discipline or the stomach for such a strategy. Long story short, if the strategy you pick doesn\u2019t work for you it doesn\u2019t matter what the best way to invest in the market is. Buffett made a ton of money with his strategy (value investing) but many people don\u2019t have the discipline to do that. For some, investing in low-cost index funds might be the only option for which they have the discipline and the stomach. So, rather than thinking about what the best way is, think about your own psychology and what you can stomach. By all means do the research on what has worked in the market but then make sure to use a strategy you can actually implement. If you still find you can\u2019t implement the strategy you attempted, find one you can. In the end, I\u2019m guessing that the vast majority of people will find investing in low-cost index funds is the only strategy that will actually work for them. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, it is very good that you are investing in stocks. The returns that you can gain in stocks is in no way comparable to any other investment today. Right now India is the best country to invest because of it's rapid growth. There are so many foreign investor who are buying Indian company shares and taking advantage of India's growth but the average Indian is still saving money and putting it in FDs for as little as 6%. By buying shares you'll definitely gain a lot of returns but it is also contributing to the society. The money you give to buy shares is the money that company uses to grow and provide better services. In this way you're actually contributing to the economy.  Now, coming to the question, If you want start investing in shares then you need a Demat account. You can open a Demat account in banks like ICICI or independent institutions like Zerodha, Upstox etc. In my opinion go for Zerodha they provide free brokerage for delivery trading and only rs.20 or 0.01% of the trade for Intraday trading If not Zerodha go for other independent institutions but, Never open a Demat account with a bank. They will charge crazy brokerage!! One prerequisite is that you need to have a Bank account, Pan card and Aadhar card to open a Demat account. Once you have chosen where to open an account, you have to submit some documents or photocopies to them. Like your aadhar card, Pan card, Photo, your bank account details etc. Once you submit these documents they will open your account and give you a generated id and password. You can change this once you receive it. Log on to your account, buy shares and contribute to the economy of India. India is proud of you for your contribution to the growth of this developing country!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there, This question is similar to the one I have answered before here. In order invest in the stock market, you need to open trading and demat account with a broker. These are registered SEBI representative who are given the authority to buy and sell shares for their clients from the stock market. For there services the brokers charge a brokerage. Brokers are of two types: Full service traditional brokers: These are the names you have probably heard of. They are established brokers that provide research and advisory services along with trade execution. Here a person takes cares and oversees your account personally. These brokers have been running for a long time due to the relationships they have with their clients. Due to the luxury you get, the brokerage you pay is quite high. Some examples include HDFC Securities, ICICI Securities, Motilal Oswal.Discount Brokers: Discount brokers is a what is new in the industry. It is as of yet fairly new concept in India but is growing rapidly. These brokers have almost 95% less brokerage than the traditional big names. Discount brokers do not offer the luxury that full-service brokers do, but discount brokers do offer all of the tools and services you need to place trades as an individual investor at the comfort of your home. Some examples include Fyers, Zerodha, Upstox.As you are considering brokers, you might wanna have a look at Fyers. It is a new company but is growing rapidly and organically. The trading platform that the company is offering is best in class, and the brokerage is one of the lowest in the industry. Hope this helps!! -Sushrut Sadana ",

            "answer_text": "First select a good broker. Then don\u2019t follow tips or calls given by anyone even from your broker. Check the following points for investing into stocks I follow these in selecting stocks. Avoid government run companies as they don\u2019t work to maximize profitAvoid sectors where government policy changes will drastically impact business environment (Metals/Mining/Oil&Gas/Telecom/Power)Select sectors that will have business forever (atleast you shouldn\u2019t be able to think of a scenario where that sector won\u2019t exist say 20 years later)Select leaders from the chosen sectorsInvest no more than 10% of your total capital to a single stock and no more than 25% of your total capital to a single sector.Invest into 5 sectors at leastBy doing the above, you need not do much research on stocks. But when you buy stocks in bulk, you need to time the entry, but if you are going to invest regularly, you need not time as well. If you are looking for simple ways to check financials of a stock, then see if the following helps. Profit and Loss StatementSales should double every 5 yearsNet Profit should more than double every 5 yearsOperating Margin should be improving historicallyBalance SheetNo debt is idealEven if debt is there, it should be decreasing over the yearsSundry debtor and Sundry creditor is proportionally increasing with respect to sales, nothing to worry.Cash FlowCash from Operations should be increasing and should be a positive figureCash from investing should be negative (meaning company is investing to growth business further)Cash from financing should be negative (meaning company is paying their debt and/or giving away dividends)These simple points should be enough to screen a company at high level. Also compare these factors of the company\u2019s competitors as well. For example, if you are checking Berger Paints, check these with Asian Paints ",

            "answer_text": "STEPS TO INVEST: I bet you\u2019re too excited to start investing or trading in Share market. If you have that feeling, you are in relationship with Stock Market. If you need their attractive attention to you, you need to give more attention to it. Like every relationship do. So I\u2019m going to write down 5 major steps to begin investing here: STEP-1 : Mandatory document PAN is the basic requisites to enter share trading. Aadhaar is now optional from the previous mandatory. But the process through Aadhaar make it faster and smoother. Make sure your Aadhaar details are all correct. Moreover, mobile number and email address needs to be updated and corrected to proceed further for KYC documentation and DEMAT Account (2nd Step). In case if you don\u2019t have PAN card, go to NSDL website to create one. And if you don\u2019t have Aadhaar card or incorrect details in it, then go to nearest centre for Aadhaar Enrollment or nearest eligible banks/post offices. In case of correction, if you want to update online, it can be done only if your Aadhaar-registered mobile number is with you. STEP-2 : PICKING UP RIGHT STOCKBROKER This is very critical step and difficult one. It requires your thoroughly research. There are some brokers out there who don\u2019t care about trading issues, other brokers who are charging you more than the specified ones (called hidden charges), and there are also other brokers who don\u2019t comply with the SEBI framework guidelines which could lead broker to shut down. Nevermind, we have made it easier for you to review brokers. You can even check the best brokers by lowest brokerage here, or you can do your own research. But these basic things below you have to look at and compare each and every broker: Brokerage ChargesTrading PlatformsCustomer ServiceTransaction costsRegulationsRange of trading segments availableNumber of complaints by BSE/NSEOnce you have picked the suitable stockbroker for you, clap or yourself. As it\u2019s one of the toughest step to work you\u2019ve done. Now you deserve next easy steps. STEP-3 : DEMAT ACCOUNT The stockbroker is there to guide you to create demat account. Make sure you understood that there are two different charges for Demat: Account opening charge (One-Time) and Annual Maintenance Charge (Yearly). There are few brokers who exempt the DEMAT fees. The documents required are: PAN CardAddress proofOne Recent PhotographCancelled ChequeBank StatementIn case if you\u2019re NRI user, no one can stop you from trading Indian stocks. But additional documents are expected from brokers. The documents required for NRI investors are: Copy of valid visaPassport copyProof of foreign addressPIS Permission Lettre from the respective designated bankPAN CardPhotographer of InvestorProof of respective bank accounts & depository accounts.After documentations reach to stockbroker, it generally takes 2 business days to open a demo account. STEP-4 : STUDY AND ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE FROM PROFESSIONAL ONES Google is place where you can get all the resources but we understand the main problem: lack of sequence. To have proper sequence for your learning process, it has to be a cost. Recommended Amazon books here below: English _ How to Make Money in Stocks, A Winning System in Good Times and Bad by William O\u2019NielEnglish _ Everything You Wanted To Know About Stock Market Investing CNBC TV 18English _ Guide to Indian Stock Market by Jitendra GalaEnglish _ The Winning Investment Habits of Warren Buffet & George Soros by Mark Tier Hindi _ Bhartiya Sharebazaara Ki Pehchan by Jitendra GalaHindi _ Kaise Stock Market Mein Nivaise Kare by CNBC TV 18Hindi _ Intraday Trading Ki Pehchan by Ankit Gala & Jitendra Gala Don\u2019t miss to read business newspapers and journals. The best trading journals are Business Standard, Economic Times, Financial Times and Wall Street Journal. Also watch Youtube Tutorials, but don\u2019t get involved in meeting with scammers. Do your trade by yourself and watch video for learning purpose only. Keep it going even when you\u2019re trading. STEP-5 : STICK TO MARKET EVERY DAY Understanding the market is very important step to pick some stocks. After analysing where the market/stocks stand, pick some large cap stocks or small cap stocks based on your suitable risks. Have them in bucket list. Wish-list them in any of financial sites like Moneycontrol, Investing.com, Economic times, etc and track their behavior along with news and index like Sensex and Nifty. Make your strategy based on your own. Many traders made mistakes by copying from others\u2019 strategies. Of course, you must learn from their strategies. But never copy from their strategies. It\u2019s because their targets, funds, lifestyle are completely different from yours. Therefore, the best way is to create your own strategy which suits your trading life. I know you\u2019re nervous to create one or struggle to make profit in between but you will make it.  ",

If you want to open a margin account, the minimum at most firms is $2000. In terms of how much you can invest in one stock, you could technically buy one share of a one dollar stock. For the more expensive stocks, some companies have capital purchase plans which allow you to invest small amounts towards a stock. These plans are usually handled by the stock\u2019s transfer agent.

            "answer_text": "You can learn stock market investing in India through NSE or BSE without any problem. First thing that I wanted to enquire , \"How do I learn stock market investing in India?\" is you have to gain proficiency with the distinction between [trading in stock market] and investing in stock market. Presently the Stock trading is tied in with particularly buying and selling stocks for term benefit, with an attention on share's current pricing. Investing is about buying stocks for long-term gains. Trading and investing both involve seeking profit in the stock market. There are two major methods of how you can actually execute them: Intraday Trading: Intraday trading is basically nothing but buying and selling of stocks on the same day, during the trading hours that are stipulated by the exchange.Positioning and Holding: It is conventional way of trading you just buy a stock or a counter and you keep it. Majorly when you are looking for a long term investment.Trading requires minimum practice of 3 to 5 years to get a decent grip - In this period it\u2019s best to operate with as minimal capital as possible. The first step that is involved here is opening a demat account. Now, I\u2019ll explain to you how I started my journey here. I used to ponder over various youtube videos and all the crappy content online until I came across this channel called Bse2nse. You can search for them on Youtube and I must say, I got all the information that I needed to start from there. Apart from that they have this book named \u201cArt of Stock Investing\u201d It\u2019s available free of cost on their website. Give it a read. It will surely clear up most of your doubts. They also add you to their WhatsApp group where you will stay updated about the movements and also You can ask all your doubts there and they are always happy to help. It helped me a lot. Hope it helps you as well. ",

First of all, set a budget. Never invest all of it at the same time. Start with a small amount. Invest in blue chips. Make your portfolio diverse. Invest in companies from different sectors like Banking, Manufacturing, IT, etc. Carefully study the stock you are investing in. Visit any business news site and look at the performance of stock in past 5 years or so. Study the latest quarter results and keep a watch on the board meetings, because that's when new policies are announced and that's when the stock prices move swiftly.  Don't believe entirely on the suggestions of stock brokers and news channels. Most of times, these are speculations. Remember, this is a game and no one can predict accurately. It is upto you to decide. The profit.The most important point while investing in a stock market is knowing when to get out of it. Don't be too greedy. Set low profit targets at first. Then increase gradually when you get a hold of it. Do not hold on to a stock for a long time thinking to make a bigger profit.  There are cases when the prices tumble in a blink of eye.

            "answer_text": "There are numerous ways to invest in stocks. However, generally there are two core approaches: Active investing (e.g. picking stocks); orPassive investing (e.g. investing in an index fund).Active investing is hard. Most investors and even professionals fail to beat the returns of passive investments. A recent report (Your mutual fund manager has probably failed for the past 15 years) demonstrates the extent of the failure: \u201cthe latest report on active management performance, in the closely watched SPIVA U.S. Scorecard from S&P, paints an even bleaker picture over the long term. For the first time, the scorecard tracked 15-year performance to capture what it considers a \"complete market cycle.\" In that period, 92.2 percent of large-cap managers missed their marks, while the number was 95.4 percent for mid-caps and 93.2 percent for small-caps.\u201d In light of the difficulty involved in active investing, it is not surprising that even Warren Buffett (arguably one the best stock pickers of all time) advises: \u201cBoth large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds\u201d (see Warren Buffett's Single-Best Piece Of Advice). Accordingly, if you are consider investing in the market for the first time, index funds is a good place to start. ",

            "answer_text": "Caution: These three simple (not easy) patterns may change your stock investing strategy forever! There are number of factors that affect a stock price movement. There are hundreds of strategy out there to choose best stock for investment. It is well known that stock market is one of the most complex thing to understand where most people lose money and few people who know the game well get richer. I have studied many years and always tried to understand the pattern that makes a stock price to move higher. Here is those foolproof patterns that never fails to provide best buying opportunities most of the time. Buy a stock at 52 week high. Buy a stock if it has touched its 52 week high recently. But don\u2019t buy if the stock has already given more than 200% return in last 1 year or more than 100% return in last 6 months. Avoid buying from a sector which already has a huge run up for last 1 year.Buy a stock after quarterly earnings. Buy a stock when it\u2019s last quarterly earnings (both sales and profit) is better than earning over same quarter last year (year on year) and previous quarter (quarter on quarter). And last quarter (read latest) earning is highest among last four quarters.Earning visibility or Good news impacting revenue. Buy whenever there is a positive news that has positive impact on company\u2019s revenue.Of course these three patterns are not ALL, one need to check other indicators and perform analysis before investing into any stock. Note: It is not as easy as it may seem to find a stock fulfilling these three criteria. You can add in the comment section if you happen to discover one.

            "answer_text": "So Investing means you are going to hold the stocks for long run than i would advice you to go for this checklist before investing in any stock.  Companies future should be long run i.e. the company must not be a sudden boom.Check for their PE (Price earning) ratio it says a lot. In long run shares of a company with high PE ratio (Over valued) are gonna come at normal level so invest in Undervalued companies with low PE ratio.The Demand for the product of the company must also be checked as the product isn't obsolete and is the company coming with new and better ideas.The Band name of the company also matters a lot. ex: AppleIf you are investing Big mount of Money than also watch out for the management of the company Coz they are the one who will take the company. Suggestion given by Warren BuffetDon't Check any stock daily if you are investing as the Upside movement may make you greedy and downside may make you afraid and you can sell at a wrong time.There are Many other points for which i would suggest you to read Intelligent Investor by Graham Bell. It covers possibly everything.If you are investing small amount of money then i would advice you to go for Mutual Funds. Since currently the Market is going good and they can also give good return in long run. ",

            "answer_text": "These are not \u201cstrategies\u201d but rather a philosophical perspective on investing. I'd recommend that you tattoo the following on your brain: Previous performance is no guarantee of future results. (Just because it has a great track record doesn't mean it will continue.)Do not risk what you are unwilling to lose.Do your \u201cdue diligence\u201d and research the fundamentals of a stock. Then recognize that even though things look great on paper, you can still be stuck with a stock that goes down or stays flat. The price of of stocks are not always (or even, mostly) rational. Businesses with negative earnings may rocket while those with steady income growth plummet. It\u2019s a tough game. Wear a metaphorical cup and disabuse yourself of the notion that the stock price is tied to the health of the business.Corollary to above: However much research as you do, you only have a limited perspective of what is really going on with a business. 90% of the information you are analyzing comes from people who have a vested interest in the company doing well. Remember that and weigh the value of your analysis accordingly.If anyone tells you that they know what a market/stock/security is going to do, they are lying and you should remove yourself from their influence immediately.Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered. (Don't let greed get in the way of informed decision making.)I know these sound glib but they provide a fundamental way of looking at personal investing that will serve you well. ",

However, if you feel it necessary to invest at the moment, I would as a beginner invest my small amount in one of the safer mining stocks like Barrick simply because the gold and silver shares are so undervalued.  Gold and silver have been held back by the Big Banks but will soon break out to the upside as the value of the dollar slides and the world's economic system deteriorates even further. These may slide a  little at first as the stock market bubble bursts but will inevitably climb back up fast as people and the banks themselves turn to gold and silver as a safe haven. If you want to be a little more speculative you could choose Aurico Gold, or First Majestic Silver. Your safest bet however would be to buy the physical form either in gold or silver coins. Silver is expected to even outreach gold in the coming years. ",

See what they say, how the market reacts, find out why it reacts that way. 5) investing is a long term game. Don't put in anything that you need in the next 5 years. 6) listen to people about personal finance. Like Suzy Q or Dave Ramsey or both.

The professionals at large firms have quite a few  advantages over you, not the least of which is experience and technical knowledge. It's not impossible to become one of the pros, but  it's not a quick or easy process. For example, try reading Security  Analysis by Ben Graham. See how far you get.  In the meantime, here's a strategy for busy amateurs that I strongly suggest*:  - Find a cheap online broker like  Sharebuilder or Etrade - Open a Roth IRA (IIRC, you can contribute up to $5,500 a year)- Put your money into an S&P 500 index fund with low management fees. Try to put in as much as you can at once to  minimize the transaction cost.  That's it. Do this every year and don't touch it. Until you are much more savvy, I believe this is your best bet.  *Note: this plan presumes you are American and many years away from retirement. ",

Indirect via equity mutual funds and ULIPSDirect ie investing directly into the markets, which is carries higher risks and some times erodes big chunk of capital in case you dont have proper experience. I am giving you few points to safeguard yourselfMake sure that company has sufficient number of customers and its business is not dependent on small number of people. Invest in stocks (companies you have heard and you understand their business model example,ITC, Hindustan Uniliver (HUL), Dabur, you know all of these are FMCG companies and you hear their name every day, you also know what all products these companies own and their business is spread all across India.Maruti, Hero Honda, Mahindra and Mahindra: Maruti is the market leader in car manufacturing in India, you know it has largest share in car sales in Indian market and it is always full of orders and when people dont get Maruti cars they go to other car companies.Go for fundamentally strong companies: how do you know the company is fundamentally strong?",

            "answer_text": "It is a good decision always to invest in the share market. However, investing directly in the share market will be a very stupid decision. Start from basic investments like FDs and then move onto advanced investments. Share market are not the only option to invest. But it is one such option that if you do it right you can change your financial conditions. But you should choose the right option to invest according to your financial goals. At the beginning of your share market investments, start with investing in blue-chip stocks. Blue-chip stocks are shares of big companies that occupy a good amount of market share. Stock market conditions are always volatile and can change anytime but these shares do not get affected by small changes like that. If you invest in such stocks you should invest in the long term it can be a profitable asset. Remember to focus on managing portfolios and risks associated with the portfolio more than individual investments. You can opt for a trusted investment and stockbroking company to help you in managing your investments. ",

            "answer_text": "First look at the stock market daily if it does well for 2 weeks then go start investing. Invest at what you could afford dont invest all your money because if the first day it goes down you'll be in debt so for instance let's say you have $5000 invest with first just 2500-4000 because if the first day it goes down youll have something in your pocket. Set realistic goals if you for example plan to invest 10 000 make your goal to earn just 1\u20132 percent on that which is 100-200 daily which is 261 days because Saturday and sunday its closed so then you'd make 26 100- 52 200 then back to what I said use that money but invest what you could afford and then build up from there. Invest in companies that are trustworthy like Berkshire Hathaway, apple ,coca cola ,wells Fargo etc. I hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you are a beginner and have no prior experience investing in the stock market. Otherwise, this answer would be too elementary for you. One of the first things for a beginner to learn about the share market is to read good books on investment. There are countless investment books sold online and in bookstores- so which should you choose? Here are 3 investment books which are suitable for beginners. 1) \u201cThe Successful Investor \u201c by William J O\u2019Neil 2) \u201cInvestment Psychology Explained\u201d by Martin J. Pring 3) \u201cRich Dad, Poor Dad\u201d by Robert Kiyosaki Another thing you can do is to just search the Internet for videos and articles written by some experienced investors who are willing to share workable ideas with the public for free. There are plenty of short articles on \u2018mistakes that new investors make and how to avoid them\u2019 and many, many others you can easily find by just typing in some key words using Google search. I will not suggest to you to pay for expensive courses, no matter how much they promise you. You can never learn to be a good investor overnight or over a short period of time. So if you\u2019re tempted to take some kind of \u2018crash course on investment\u2019, don\u2019t. Be patient to learn at your own pace and only when you\u2019re ready, then start either with virtual money or step cautiously into the investment arena by nibbling with a small amount of real money that you are prepared to lose. No one becomes a successful investor without losing a single cent. That\u2019s a fact but don\u2019t let that discourage you. It\u2019s just a caution. I was once a newbie in investment and hope to just share some simple tips with you. Good luck and have a successful journey into investing. ",

It\u2019s free money into your retirement If you\u2019re investing on your own, open an IRA through a low cost broker (Vanguard,etc.) Contribute pre-tax dollars to a S&P 500 index fund. After you have a sound base, add to the mix with a global fund, mid and small cap funds. Although it\u2019s standard advice I would not invest in bonds if you are very young. After all, if you invest for 40 years you don\u2019t need the hedge; if the stock market totally crashes we\u2019ll all be living under bridges anyway. After you have maxed out your IRA contributions add a Roth account. By now you should have been studying the market for a few years and have some pretty good ideas about growth stocks that you want to make long-term investment in. Use your Roth for holding individual stocks. Make small purchases and spread your risk. If you hit it big on just one you\u2019ll be ahead of the game. All the above assumes that you have no credit card debt and that you have an emergency bank account for cash in short-term crisis. I know, I know, I\u2019m no fun! ",

You can now do this online. Zerodha is a discount broker that allows you to buy stocks without charging you a transaction fee.Risky since you are directly picking stocks and you are relying on your ability to predict the future of a stock/company.Investing through mutual funds A fund manager picks stocks for you for a certain service charge.Less riskier than directly picking stocks since the fund manager\u2019s job is to pick stocks.You need to first do a KYC application (Know Your Customer) for any investments totalling more than INR 50,000 in a year.Then you can invest in mutual funds of your liking.There are various asset management companies offering you a range of mutual funds. HDFC and Franklin Templeton are good AMCs that manage the funds responsibly. There are a lot of other AMCs that are available as well.You pick a fund based on your risk tolerance. Aggressive funds bet more on equities and conservative funds bet more on corporate bonds and debt market.You buy units of mutual fund measured in Net Asset Value (NAV). The NAV is the price of one unit of a mutual fund.If you can\u2019t pick what MFs to invest in, you can seek the services of an MF distributor to guide you but this will incur more service charge.Misc The stock market consists of large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap companies.In terms of market capitalization, large-cap companies are bigger than mid-cap companies which are bigger than small-cap companies.In terms of risk, large-cap companies have lower risk than mid-cap companies which have lower risk than small-cap companies.In terms of growth potential, large-cap companies have lesser growth potential than mid-cap companies which have lesser growth potential than small-cap companies.In terms of stability, large-cap companies have more stability than mid-cap companies which have more stability than small-cap companies.A balanced/hybrid mutual fund invests about 60% in stocks and 40% in debt. It is safer during times when the stock market is falling.A multi-cap fund invests across large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks.The term \u201cBluechip\u201d is used to refer to the large-cap companies. So a bluechip fund primarily invests in large-cap (well-known and well-established) companies.",

            "answer_text": "Moving averages are one of the core indicators in technical analysis, and there are a variety of different versions. SMA is the easiest moving average to construct. It is simply the average price over the specified period. The average is called \"moving\" because it is plotted on the chart bar by bar, forming a line that moves along the chart as the average value changes How this indicator works SMAs are often used to determine trend direction. If the SMA is moving up, the trend is up. If the SMA is moving down, the trend is down. A 200-bar SMA is common proxy for the long term trend. 50-bar SMAs are typically used to gauge the intermediate trend. Shorter period SMAs can be used to determine shorter term trends.SMAs are commonly used to smooth price data and technical indicators. The longer the period of the SMA, the smoother the result, but the more lag that is introduced between the SMA and the source.Price crossing SMA is often used to trigger trading signals. When prices cross above the SMA, you might want to go long or cover short; when they cross below the SMA, you might want to go short or exit long.SMA Crossing SMA is another common trading signal. When a short period SMA crosses above a long period SMA, you may want to go long. You may want to go short when the short-term SMA crosses back below the long-term SMA. ",

You can see the real power of compounding money through trading or investing in stocks. This was possible after a month long of training and a month long of paper trading ans practice. The reason why my training works so well is because it's simplified. The majority of people who trade the market jump from one system to the next, one advisor to another, one shortcut to another. There's no shortcut to success. Learn and then invest or trade. Invest after learning, because invest means you're expecting returns on that particular investment, and returns will be only when you trade or invest correctly. ",

In fact, everyone \u2014 including beginners \u2014 should be invested in stocks, as long as you\u2019re comfortable leaving your money invested for at least five years. Why five years? That\u2019s because it is relatively rare for the stock market to experience a downturn that lasts longer than that. But rather than trading individual stocks, focus on stock mutual funds. With mutual funds, you can purchase a large selection of stocks within one fund. Is it possible to build a diversified portfolio out of individual stocks instead? Sure. But doing so would be time-consuming \u2014 it takes a lot of research and know-how to manage a portfolio. Stock mutual funds \u2014 including index funds and ETFs \u2014 do that work for you.

I only advise you to invest in incremental amounts over a sustained period of time to generate relatively good returns. Primarily, as the old saying goes: \"Diversify your portfolio\" by investing in varied asset classes- equities, bonds-- they are relatively safe instruments provided you don't invest very heavily into equities. Bonds guarantee a sustained return on the income invested over a period of time in the form of coupons. (Zero Coupon Bonds also exist) There's no wise way to invest in the stock market-- you have to lose some money to gain some money but make sure you don't loose too much by indulging in day-trading and the like-- these are meant for sophisticated investors with loads of cash. \"The Stock Market is essentially a zero-sum game: one party wins whilst the other party loses.\" Best Regards,Srinivas.

The crucial question when investing money in the stock market is not \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhere\u201d - instead it is \u201cwhen\u201d. My experience with the Danish stock market is that it is always too volatile in the autumn. What looks like a good deal now, may turn out to create a deficit. The stock markets are most stable in the spring.An experienced investor has advised me to buy stocks on Fridays rather than Mondays - because the stocks are always at their cheapest level just before a weekend - probably because the sellers need money and are willing to make a discount in order to obtain money.Astrological statistics show that on average stocks are cheapest 5 days before a New Moon and most expensive 5-7 days after a New Moon.

There are several funds which fall into this category, lending to added stability that comes with portfolio diversity.b) Invest as much money in that asset as you can comfortably afford to lose and hold it, reinvesting all dividends back into that stock. Think of it as compound interest.c) If the price per share dips 10% below the 200-day moving average, buy more shares.d) Ride out the market swings. This strategy will almost certainly result in the purchasing of fractions of shares. However, most consumer-level trading platforms (E*trade, for example) don\u2019t allow you to trade fractionals directly. But this strategy is really more about passive accumulation rather than active trading. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a million dollar question!! Most people keep figuring this out, whole of their life. Stock market is a very fascinating thing and everyone thinks they know it, like cricket and politics. I mostly recommend to people that don\u2019t do stock market investing if it\u2019s not your daily job. Their are professional people who are paid to do research and stock market investing. You should let them do it, hence I recommend to invest in Equity Mutual Fund. That would be the best strategy for investing in stock market. If you still want to do it on your own, then learn about fundamental research and research company\u2019s businesses And read their balance sheets. Understand the sector and find the best player in that sector. Then buy that stock and invest for long term. Track the company and stay put and exit only once you have met your target returns in 2\u20135 years, or else if the company isn\u2019t not performing well. Hope this answer helps.

            "answer_text": "If you want to properly invest in stocks and start growing your money have a balanced approach. The first $10k that you invest should go into an index fund! I like investing in a fund that mimics the technology heavy Nasdaq. Invest in QQQ or if you need a mutual fund Fidelity NASDAQ Composite Index (FNCMX) is great and carries a low expense ratio (.29%). Next, if you want to start picking high quality holdings think of investment trends that will be going strong for the next 10 years. Financial technology, exposure to China\u2019s booming economy, cloud computing, blockchain, artificial intelligence. Balance your growth holdings with non-cyclical consumer stocks such as PepsiCo (PEP). Always consider stocks with a competitive advantage and try to avoid fads. Contribute to your investment holdings monthly and stomach volatility. In 5\u201310 years you will look back and be amazed with the growth in your portfolio. I hope this clear cut answer helps!

Never buy a 52 week low stock till this criteria maintained.Exit fully from a stock which is trading 20% below its 52 week high.Stock price rises through stairs and falls through elevator so always be prepared for quick exit.Retail traders have absolutely no control on stock price. It is under control of big houses those who are hiring best brains including Doctors, Engineers to analyse the trend of market well in advance.Buy on rumour sell on news. A stock moves vehemently upwards on rumour and falls on news. Infosys moved on the rumour of good result now result declared, it is time to fall.Never listen to the analysts which you are seeing in the TV, you are better analyst than them. Marketing is required for bad products and the reason is mentioned in point no 4. Even Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is badly trapped in Lupin.Don't try to use lot of charts sometimes they are contradicting each other if not minutely interpretated. Only price and volume is enough. For price action my favorite is Point&Figure chart which is the oldest and simple, for volume you can see anywhere. The third one moving average crossover should not be ignored.Take position on a stock which has made golden crossover means 50 day moving average crossed above 200 day moving average. Don't exit till it is not making dead cross or as mentioned in point no. 2.Exit a position which made dead crossover means 50 day moving average crossed below 200 day moving average.Last but not least, never give any consent to your broker to trade on behalf of you. Their goal is not to make you rich but to make themselves rich. So they will use margin to increase the numbers of trading to increase their brokerage. If you are not confident handover your money to Mutual Fund Manager.",

Stock market investing is complex and it takes time and effort to become a savvy investor. Investing an hour a day is what i would recommend for fundamental analysis. O Over the course of the year you will be a much smarter investor than today as incremental knowledge is most beneficial when it comes to improving your investing skills. Further more. Inorder to invest and do fundamental analysis I would urge to follow the Value investing philosophy. As over the years value investors have outperformed momentum or growth investors. Now this is a very lengthy topic. Fortunately I had created a Webinar on Advanced value investing on my website. Its a bit lengthy and detailed as it foes on for 90 minutes. But i promise you it will be worth it. Please check it out here. Grow Your Investments - EquityLion Also please share and like with others to spread financial wisdom.

            "answer_text": "You learn before you earn. At the starting you will incur losses, better keep those losses small. Don't think to be rich quick, your mentality should be to grown rich slowly and steadily. Decide the capital that you can invest, with the defined time frame. Don't be in a hurry to get in the action or get out of the action. Follow a systematic approach, make small and equal buckets of the total capital you want to invest. When you find the right stock, invest 1\u20132 buckets, and if you feel opportunity is too good go for 2\u20133 buckets, don't invest all at same time and in same stock. Always diversify. Have a system driven approach rather than a emotional driven approach. Don't rush, opportunities keep on arising, have patience, trust your system more than your emotions and listen to your instincts not fear. And keep on learning, learning should never stop.! ",

            "answer_text": "There are two ways of investing in stock markets- active and passive. Passive investment is more popular in which one invests his money into the stocks through a mutual fund or through any professional trader who manages one's account on his behalf. For investment through mutual fund it's very simple where one just needs to register on the websites of any mutual fund house and start making lump sum investment or start an Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) . SIP allows to invest in small amounts at regular intervals. Now there are professional traders who can manage the account on the investor's behalf. Pros- The fund is managed by some one else while the investor can focus on his own professional life. The fund is also managed by professional people rather than novice investor who is just starting his journey into the world of investing. Cons- The charges are generally high compared to active method. Specifically for mutual funds the charges are deducted even if the portfolio is in loss. The investor doesn't gets to know the logic behind the investments made by the manager and in some cases may not suit the risk appetite of the individual investor ( this was the case when fund houses invested in risky bonds of ILFS ). Investors has no say on entry and exit timing in the markets . Active investment means managing one's own money. The very first step to do so is to open a deemat account from any brokerage house registered with Nse and Bse. Pros- The investor is in full control of his fund and take independent decisions. The charges related to trading are minimal with zero fund management fees. The investor can make allocation according to his risk appetite and needs. The entry and exit is solely his decision. Cons- Beginners with no prior experience may face initial loss due to poor allocation of funds . The annual maintenance charge of deemat is suitable only if one invests at least 50k and above. Active investing may hamper one's professional working as the market are open during day time only. Some investment options are available to professionals only which are not available to individuals.

            "answer_text": "There are two way to enter the equity markets for investment , one through mutual fund and other direct investment through a SEBI approved broker. All you need to do is open a trading and a de-mat account with your broker by filling the forms and KYC as mandate by SEBI, once your document is as per requirement than the broker opens the account and gives you a client ID number and the same is registered with the exchange . Once your account is opened you can call the broker on their dealing desk and buy or sell , you can also use online trading facility where by you can trade on your own gadget, upon trading a contract note is generated and sent to the client on their Email ID and details of the trades are given on the mobile as well. This is the procedure to start investing. If you are a high net worth investor say 25 lacs rupees plus, than you can invest your money through PMS (portfolio management services). There are many brokers who have this facility , after doing some research about which are good PMS scheme you can invest . I suggest the individuals not to put all eggs in one basket, hence once can put partly in mutual funds and partly through direct investment through a SEBI approved broker. I further suggest to take guidance and advisory from a reputed consultant registered with SEBI. This would certainly help you to curtail your risk and take advantage from their research, avoid tips floating in the markets as they are often misleading and given when the story or the theme is over and too many people chasing few particular stocks will never achieve the desired results.

Thats how we all can start investing in stocks, easy? The TOUGH part is making money from stock investing consistently. Why? Because to make money consistently from the stock market requires us to not only be logical and understand the business behind the stocks we invest in, we need to also be able to value it and control our emotions. So i think that most of us should not think of starting to invest in stocks - instead, start to read more and learn more before we think of putting a single penny in the stock market. Remember, its better not to earn money that to lose money. With love & respect, Chris Lee Susanto ",

You need to keep in mind all the parameters of the shares and the company. You need to have a Demat account to trade in stock Market. If you are a beginner in stock market and trading then it is advisable to do it with the help of an expert.

PAN card.A Savings Account with internet banking facility activated.Money.So when you have all these, contact your nearest broker house or securities company. DO NOT FALL FOR THE CHEAP BROKERS WHO TELL YOU EVERYTHING IS FOR FREE HERE. YOU SEE, YOU DO NOT GET ANYTHING FOR NOTHING. So basically choose a broker house which has a perfect charge to service ratio. And then, fill up the forms, submitting the necessary documents and a cheque with desired amount, applying for a demat account (where your shares get stored) along with a trading account (where your money gets stored). so after your account gets activated and you get your client ID and Demat profile ID, or if you have already, Contact the broker house and tell them you want to apply for online trading facility too. and make sure that you mention that you want to link your bank account to your trading account and for that you need to submit a photocopy of the last page of your bank passbook and a cancelled cheque. EASY. They will make you fill up another form, and then after 7 days or 14 days(varies by broker houses), you will receive your online trading account login password, just like you get for a new ATM card from bank. and then you have to activate your ONLINE TRADING ACCOUNT for the first time by entering your name, date of birth DPID and Client ID, to the mentioned web address, provided by your broker house. and then, you have to make your own desired LOGIN ID and have to make the first login with the password sent to you. After you have successfully logged in, change the password as you desire. Just make sure you do not forget it. Its a big hassle resetting it again. So congratulations, 80% of your work has been done for getting started with online trading. Now, you can login to your online trading account anytime and check your current net worth and holdings any time you want. To purchase and sell shares online, Login to the online trading website provided by your broker house during market hours, and then, if you want, you can transfer funds right away from your bank to your trading account, by going into funds section of the online trading plat form and then click on add funds and then select the option of bank to equity. and then enter the amount, select your account number and then it will redirect you to your bank\u2019s internet banking website. confirm the transfer and guess what, its free of cost, no NEFT charges are there, and now ready to purchase some bomb stocks. and then the purchasing part is the easiest. just go to order (purchase or buy/sell) section, select weather you want to sell stocks from your present holdings or you wish to purchase/buy, and select from whether NSE or BSE you want make the purchase/sell, and then enter the stock symbol on the search box and when it appears, select it and enter the number of the shares you want to purchase/sell. Then you have to confirm it twice and its done. if you purchase it, the money will get debited from your trading account balance within T+3 days, and the stocks will get added to your portfolio on the next day(T+1). if you sell, then the money will get credited to your trading account within T+3 days, and the stocks will be removed from your portfolio on the next day. And as I have mentioned earlier, the transfer process of savings account to trading account, now you just have to perform the action vice versa. Select Equity to Bank, and then confirm it twice and the money will be transferred to your bank account instantly. PS: if your broker house provides an official mobile trading app, you can do it all of these right from your iPhone or samsung or whatever smartphone you have which will support the app. But its better to do the fund transfer from a MacBook or a computer whatever you have. See, I told you it was easy. So, I hope you find my explanation helpful. :) ",

For the same, keep 20% of your amount for trading. If you want to be a trader, you need to have a strong instinct about market movements. Before you invest your 100% corpus, do a test trading with 10% for at least 6 months. If you are able to make money, increase to 25% for the next 6 months, 50% after a year and 100% by the end of two years. This was you would have enough time to learn the trade hands-on.

Stock picking is very risky, even the world\u2019s most successful stock picker, Warren Buffet has advised his family to invest in an S&P index tracker upon death. There are ways to make this investment even safer, by also investing in bonds or treasuries as well for safety. This can help in years where the stock market crashes. So, instead of waiting a year and a half or longer for the stock market to recover, your portfolio bounces back quicker. In fact, it is possible to make money during stock market crashes. The easiest and safest way at the moment is probably investing in a roboadviser. Try FutureAdvisor or Wealthfront in the USA or Nutmeg in the UK. If you are elsewhere in the world, try TheMoneyPouch.

Considering you are a beginner; it can be scary as to how to go about with the process. Being associated with ICICI Direct, their courses through the Centre for Financial Learning, the process has been seamless. These are what I learnt \u2013 Select the right broker. You should be aware of the two kinds of brokers available in the market. You can either go for discount brokers, who charge low commission and offer minimal services or full-service brokers who provide everything at the drop of a hat. ICICI Direct has never disappointed me. They have affordable brokerage charges and plans that suit your needs. Once you have selected the broker, decide which medium you want to open the account with. Nowadays, mobile and internet banking help us. Once you fill the application, an agent from the firm reaches out and explains the entire process. Understand the trading platforms. The agents typically give a demo for the same, their tools, and access to other resources. Beginners should take up this demo. You will find information on the website as well. Now that you are set for trading, make sure you have the Demat as well as the trading account in place. You can opt for ICICI Direct\u2019s 3-in-1 account for a hassle-free transaction. Same service providers mean you could gain some discount on the brokerage charges. Once you have these accounts in place, get the hang of the basics of the stock market. It is ideal to avoid investing by selling assets or borrowing. Investors should begin with small amounts and avoid timing the market. It is seen that beginners tend to make the mistake of selling soon as the price starts to decline. ",

Armed with this knowledge, you can venture into the world of trading. There are two primary ways to do this.

In my opinion, if you are completely new to trading, it\u2019s advisable to hire a stock broker as they give you services such as research recommendations, stock picking tips, advice on asset allocation, current market insights, safe ways to grow your wealth and many more. These broking houses have survived tough times and have handled the market for long. Before you start investing in the stock market, you have to open a Demat Account with a broker which is free of cost. I personally recommend Motilal Oswal based on my experience with multiple brokers and I think these guys are very strong when it comes to research recommendations and stock picks. ",

So even if the SL is hit client get very small loss. LEVEL TRADING gives more clarity then trading randomly. LEVEL TRADING is backed by more tuned research and deep analysis. LEVEL TRADING also helps the client save time as the client can put levels in terminals like entry-exit and SL and can enjoy profit at the end of the day. ===== Limit order is in fact kind of instruction that lets you put your trade at your desired levels only.

            "answer_text": "Good for you realizing you need to invest to have a great future.First you need to open an account with a stock broker. I have my account with TD Ameritrade who gives me low commissions and great service. Second you need a good strategy that will make you profits consistently and for the rest of your life. Remember there are many different ways to invest in the stock market - you can buy stocks AND you can buy options. I have found you can make much higher profits buying the long-term options (LEAPS) on a stock than the stock itself. If you would like to see how I invest send for my free investing book & newsletter by emailing me at jeffee13@hotmail.com In my newsletter you will see 7 very profitable portfolios including one up 922% since 1993 & another one with LEAPS that is up 496% in the last 11 years. even better half of all the profits is in cash so my investing method automatically creates an emergency fund - you remember how everyone tells you yopu must have 6 months of your salary in an emergency fund!!! Well my investing method gives you the cake and lets you eat it too!! ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly it's a great that you have started thinking about investing early in your life. Stock is indeed a better instrument as compared to other financial intruments available in the market, however the risk involved here is also very high.  I am an active investor and have my investments in equity. However I would personally suggest that you start taking exposure in equity market through mutual funds and sips then directly investing in stocks.  Such funds are usually managed by top fund managers and could fetch you an average yearly return from 10-60% depending on the market.  Once you have studied how mutual fund operate , type of companies they invest in etc etc. Then you must gradually start moving towards investing directly in stocks/equity. Start with bluechip shares for long term returns and than gradually built in your portfolio.  Also take some time to understand how to analyse these stocks , though it doesn't matter these days :)  I can go on :)   All the best    ",

            "answer_text": "You should initially gain proficiency with the fundamentals of stocks and shares and the essential working of the Indian Stock exchange. Equipped with this information, you can jump into the world of stock markets. There are two essential approaches to do this. It is possible that you choose your own research for investing or recruit an expert to do it for you. The most ideal path must be a blend of both. You can put resources into both MF and stocks. if you are new to investing, it's prudent to enlist a stock broker who can give you good recommendation and guide you with stock ideas, suggestions, research, and knowledge of markets. Choose reputed broking houses who have been around for a while, I for one suggest Motilal Oswal as i have used it personally and have been happy with involvement of expert advisors. ",

At the same time, live life but try to save as much as you can. Do not be in a hurry to invest until you have sufficient cash reserves that can tide you over should one of life's unexpected turns occur. While doing the above, read every financial book and web site that you can. Some of them will make sense, some will not. Over time, your knowledge will increase and in time, more and more of it will make sense. You will get an idea of what interests you (options, stocks, mutual funds, etc.) and then you should focus on those areas. Understanding financial markets is like learning a foreign language. It takes time and effort, something most people don\u2019t do and as a result of failing to do so, they often lose their money. All markets take the money from the inexperienced and uninformed. ",

Stock picking and keeping track of markets is a full time business. Don\u2019t risk your hard earned money by giving it in the hands of an inexperienced person :) Over many years of being in the market and learning and reading tons of material, I can tell you most people lose money in the market. So, what should you do to make your money grow ? Spend time to understand asset allocation. Get comfortable with the amount (%) of money you should invest in the market, based on your risk profile. Then invest 90\u2013100% of the money in any index fund. Doesn\u2019t matter which index fund, just try to ensure that it indeed is an index fund.If you want to really learn, play only with 10% of your money in the stocks that you pick yourself or other\u2019s advice for many many years.Keep track and compare the % gains made on your 10% portfolio vs the money you put in the index. You will yourself get an answer if and when you should depend more on your instincts rather than the index.We get blinded by the VERY FEW success stories ignoring the vast majority who lose money investing on their own.

            "answer_text": "Hi To trade in India you need a trading account and demat account. Trading account is to start trading (picking stocks) and demat account is Dematerialized account number is quoted for all transactions to enable electronic settlements of trades to take place. Every shareholder will have a Dematerialized account for the purpose of transacting(no physical copy of stocks you bought)So getting them is very simple find a broker like Sharekhan ,Zerodha etc . They will ask you some proofs (aadhar ,PAN etc) .They will open your accounts and provides you with account details.You can start trading with whatever money you like. Share market include 4 different types of markets 1)Equity 2)F&Nos 3) Commodity 4) Currency In Equity market you can buy intraday it means you can buy and sell in the same day. If you get loss in intraday you can extend them for couple of days called swing trading. In here, you may have risk of losing money Ex:if u bought a stock with 100 rupees expecting to increase 5 rupees but if stock price fall to 95 you will extend it for couple of days (swing trading) eventhough stock price fall to 90 then you should face the loss. Coming to F&Nos (futures and options) it is similar to Equity but it works on contract basis.Ex: Today(25/12/2017) you can buy Feb 2018 contract of any company so you have enough time to cover your 90 rupees to 110. Coming to Commodity market it is similar to F&Nos but it deals with Gold,silver, crude oil, dhaniya etc. Currencies deals how dollar is changing every second bit risky. I found commodity market is low risk of losing money so you can start invest in commodity (just a suggestion). Happy investing. ",

However in times like this you need to look at growth stocks that will do well and continue to do so, ones that are ingrained in our society and able to innovate - NOT ones that are related to Covid, as this will pass, sure it may not be this year or next, BUT it will be resigned to the history books at some point. At that point will people stop drinking Starbucks? Eating Chipotle? As the world becomes more socially aware long term holding of Beyond Meat looks attractive. All the time people will still be talking on their Apple phones, working on their Imacs and jogging with the Air pods\u2026. you see where I am going here? If you are a passive investor, and don\u2019t mind tying up some money for long term then go for things that you use, that society uses\u2026..Boeing? Risky, but there is no chance they will be allowed to go bust, especially with their defence contracts, so long term I actually bought some. Will they make you rich overnight? Of course not, but you wanted to make an investment. That is a long term proposition. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Before investing in stock market you need to first understand how stock market works? You must research about stock market and then choose a stock. You must also keep certain things in mind so that you can avoid losses while investing. Here are some of the tips which will help you to choose the correct stocks: Do not time the market.Do not invest for the sake of investing. First learn about stock market investments. Read about the same in books, internet, etc.Do not invest in stock just because it is popular. A stock has done good in past that does not mean it will do good again. So research about that particular stock and then invest.Do not invest in a stock because everyone is investing. As I said stock market is volatile so even if everyone is investing then too it is possible that the stock might fall.Don't bring emotions in between. Don't be greedy, angry or don't trust anyone while investing.You have to open a demat account before you start investing. Demat account is an electronic account to hold your stocks. To open a demat account you need an Aadhar card, PAN card, etc as proof. You can apply online as well as offline. I am investing in stock market since last 5 years through Sharekhan and I am so satisfied with the services they provided me. That\u2019s all ! ",

If you have a larger amount or a windfall, you should definitely consult an expert. Studying yourself and educating yourself is the best way to safeguard your money. I have been thinking of putting some money in Berkshire as it is basically a group of companies and they are good at not paying any taxes. I also like options, especially selling out of the money puts to make income, mostly they have expired worthless. Only thing is stick to well established companies that wont disappear. I stick to FB mostly. Studying is super important before you invest a dime in the market. Never take high risk as 1 dollar invested properly and safely will be 40\u201360 in 40 yrs. ",

            "answer_text": "Step 1: Learn the basics of finance and accounting. Make sure you know how to read a balance sheet and profit and loss statement. Make sure you understand key financial ratios like PE, PB, etc. Desired Outcome: You should be able to identify the financial health of a company by looking at the financial statements. For example, you should know the year on year and quarter on quarter revenue growth of the company, year on year and quarter on quarter profit growth of the company, some important financial ratios like PE ratio, PB ratio, etc. Step 2: Now, you need to pick an industry of your knowledge or interest. Read all the recent news about the development in the industry. Desired Outcome: You should be able to understand the macro environment which is not within the control of the company but impact the company directly or indirectly. For example, government policies, crude oil prices, etc. For example, if you pick banking then you should know about Bad Debt and the impact of recent RBI policies on the banking sector. Step 3: Shortlist the companies from the industry of your knowledge or interest 3.a) Shortlist the top companies/ market leaders in the industry. For example, HSBC in banking. Time required: 5 hours 3.b) Look around and identify the product/services you love. For example, a lot of people started wearing Jockey in last 10 years. We all love it. Now, look at the company which sell Jockey. Page industries share price was around 450 in the year 2008. Today it is around 30000 in 2018. That\u2019s around 70 times return in the last 10 years. Can you find any other company today with great future potential? Think about it\u2026 Step 4: Open a trading account with ZERO brokerage. Why pay a brokerage on every transaction when you have the option to invest your money for free. Time required: Few days from document verification to account opening. Step 5: Start slow. Do not invest a lot of money together. Keep following the stock and industry and keep learning. Observe how the stock behave when the market is good and the real test is when the market is bad. Nobody can make perfect decisions. Stock market investment is not a fixed formula but it is a combination of experience with knowledge. Things to keep in mind and mistakes to avoid Always go with blue-chip companies ( top companies with a proven track record). Do not but penny stock or cheap stock. Most of the penny stocks fail.Do not buy any stock based on advice from TV experts, friends, etc. Do not join those trading groups on Whatsapp and Facebook. They are all speculators and not investors. Always do your own research and buy on your research.No not get greedy and never go for day trading. Always invest for long term. Always remember that you can\u2019t double your money in a few months. You need to have PATIENCE.Read good books on investing: Start with \u201cAvoid Loss and Earn Consistently in the Stock Market by Prasenjit Paul\u201d. An excellent book for the Indian context.Do not invest all your money in one company. Try to diversify your investments. However, do not diversify a lot.Only invest in a business which you understand.Hope it helps. Earn, save, INVEST !! ",

You can start of with as little as capital you can manage with, but do remember, that you need to invest in stock markets with the amount that you would not need in the immediate future. This is, because you would not want you to park your funds in the markets and when you would want to purchase something for which you collected the amount, you might be in for a rude shock that the markets have actually fallen and you are looking at a negative portfolio. The next step is which stock to invest in and how much in those stocks. For that, you can read the articles I have written on various stock market investing patterns. Hope this brings in some clarity. Happy Investing !!! Regards, Kabir Chadha ",

Second said that \"Trade more and book small\". With my experience this is only one strategy by which you can make money. I saw lots of time where people waiting for given target but after few times prices reverse from tgt price...and traders who is already in profit after few hours close his position in loss. Mean to say that avoid greediness during trading period. Understand profit is always profit. Thanks and Regards, ",

They give high returns bcz they come with a high risk. As a newbie to investment, I am pretty sure you won't be knowing how to manage risks.The more knowledge you will gain before putting your money, more will you ensure your profits.How to get started ? Start with little money, that you can afford to lose ( You can begin with virtual money trading in order to gain experience).Register with a good, reliable Stock broker(Zerodha is a good option).Start with equities. Don't jump onto futures and commodities just because they give exciting returns.Do your own research before putting your money.Slowly with time, learn how to analyse a stock both fundamentally and technically.Keep learning.That's enough for a newcomer I guess. Happy trading :) ",

If there is a company you believe in and have done your research on and are bullish on for the next 5+ years, then I would suggest buying some now and then if you really have a bad case of loss aversion, buy some later if another dip happens, but just realize that some companies that dip may never happen.

Yes, in this great business if you want to make money then you have to follow your own strategies & dicipline\u200b. If you search on internet you will find tons of strategies, suggestions, trading plans, Investment plans but the big question is , are the strategies suit for you ?  Because in this risky Business there is no fixed & unique strategy or plan. Just keep in mind , only one thing you need to do is \u201c don't loose your money \u201c. That's why intraday or very short term trading or Investment may not work for everyone. If you have the ability to invest your money with a minimum of six months time period then only you can see a regular profit. Here I want to say another important thing that is don't invest your all money in a single stock and don't enter at a single Investment. Always try to make your portfolio diversified and put some of your money at every down Market which is down more than 5% because in this way you can make your Investment risk free. So Best of luck.

As you have mentioned about your job, I would suggest you not to enter the stock Markets as you wont be able to give enough time to the markets and eventually end up losing your savings.

In terms of books you can start by reading the intelligent investor or one up on wall street. You may also learn a bit about technical analysis. Once you get started along these lines, you will naturally develop some interest in these areas, I would suggest you to pursue those further. But I understand that you would be keen to start investing immediately, but since you don't have much knowledge I would suggest to invest most of your funds through equity mutual funds, and invest some funds using your own analysis and learning. But keep investing most of your funds through mutual fund until you get reasonably confident about your understanding of the stock market. Best of Luck! ",

Then start following business channels everyday. As your money would play in the market, you would get some interest also. In this way follow market everyday(literally). If you are keen to earn money, i am sure you would fall in love with market and would start investing in market. Actually if you see one thing, if in first 6 or 8 months you lose 10k or 15k it hardly matters because the loss would teach you a lot which would help you to earn thousands of money latter. Life is long and the best way to invest in shares is to invest for lifetime.    Happy investing Kaushlender.. All the best.. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi I won\u2019t go for big definitions and big financial terms which you can get from all over the internet from many resources By English definition Pivot is a central point. So, from a market perspective it\u2019s a price or a wall. Let\u2019s first understand how the market makes the pivot point in simple language There is a stock A currently 100 and in a downtrend. So most of the traders will place sell at price at 100 and for safeguarding themselves according to their position size and risk and reward ratio they will place their stop-loss order at 110 some will place 120. So, take it average at 115 and that\u2019s become a pivot. and the majority of the orders are there on buy-side and that average price become a pivot and work as resistance for the price to go up. So when the price starts moving towards 110 to 110 it will face huge orders. And when it breaks people with stop loss and creates more panic and it breaks that price and now buying pressure increase people say it\u2019s a pivot breakout. So in a simple language pivot is the price where more people are looking to buy and sell as the whole volume. But this indicator is highly manipulated. Market makers create these pivots to trap small retailers For deep-down details, it\u2019s a big topic itself. if you what to know more can contact me PS: I am a trainer and provide personalized training one on one basis.
