            "answer_text": "I think if you want to get different effects from the words, the cadence that the author intended and the emotional tone, you need to read it in as many different ways as you can. I'm currently reading a book called The Ode Less Traveled by Steven Fry and it talks about how dwelling on certain words and lines and coming back to a poem several times, can enable you to savour its complexity. I recently sent one of my poems to a friend for some feedback and asked him to read the text first before listening to my very energetic performance. After checking it out, he felt that the written word of the poem read completely differently to how I performed it. In his view, most people are taught to read slow and steadily in a way that can miss the beat of the poem. I encourage you to check out my poem. It's called \u201cEmerging Economies\u201d. The second rendition has floored many! Check the text and audio out on my site. \"Emerging Economies\" ",

            "answer_text": "it\u2019s a political or an aesthetic question. my opinion is in the aesthetic, and i think a poem is a song without music \u2014 that everything except pitch duration is in a poem \u2014 rhythm and accent and lyric conjunction \u2014 that is in a music piece. so, yes, i think a poem should be read out loud. especially reading out loud is a way to get yourself as poet and the reader or listener into hearing the connections between the words in a poem. hear how the connections make the poem have sense and seem like a poem at all.
