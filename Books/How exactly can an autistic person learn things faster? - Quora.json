            "answer_text": "I think we can learn things rather quickly if it's logical and serves a purpose. The problem we have, particularly on the high functioning end of the spectrum, is that we are sensitive to criticism of judgement of our lacking of social skills. Whereas, often those lower down the spectrum avoid socialising to prevent such criticism. This is not a statement written in stone; I am well aware, but for the purpose of this answer I'm speaking generally here. We are often in a state of conflict between what we feel is right and what is socially acceptable/neccessary, so we feel pressured to fit in and keep up with everyone else, which involves forcing ourselves to process everything quicker. The problem there is that we aren't wired to process things as quickly because we are supposed to be more considerate of our actions. It isn't natural to us. We aren't here to fit in, we're here to make positive changes to society but that requires embracing our feelings, not fearing judgement and trying to encourage others to see our viewpoint. This is difficult for neurotypicals to perceive because it's not natural to them so this is where the clash and conflict derive from. The interesting thing I find is that the older people get, usually the more mature they get and I find I can relate better with older people for this reason because they see more sense. I think this is a common thing with autism. We want to keep things simple and are usually very intellectually mature for our age and see no point in competing in mundane, material things or fitting in with the herd. We just struggle more emotionally because our peers can't see our viewpoint and need to act immature and make mistakes to learn. They can force this behavior on us. We're less naive in this area and more aware of consequences, however, we can fall into the trap of mimicry to feel more comfortable; again due to the conflicting emotions. A lot of what is expected of us as humans on a whole, is unnatural and motivated by stress rather than love. Today's society is too dictating. The difference with an autistic person is that we are less capable of tolerating these expectations because of hypersensitivity, but this makes us smarter because we're less interested in chasing the wrong things just to fit in and serve the system. Neurotypicals are more obsessed with serving the system and they try to project it on anyone that doesn't fit the box by judging and criticising, rather than being empathetic and encouraging. The fact that you don't want to conform to this system-or even if you feel like you do, it's all a facade fed to you by society and not what you truly want-shows that you are more advanced and you're here to change the system to make it more eco-friendly, not submit to its idiocies. So if you want to learn things faster you have to change your mentality to a more neurotypical pattern of thinking, which is unnatural and forced for us, or you can tell yourself you feel it's important to you that much that your brain begins to accept it is natrual and then it will come naturally. But this is a long process because we aren't wired that way. A lot of neurotypical expectations of us are illogical and aren't meant to be learned because we're not here to fit into the system. That's why we struggle to learn it, or take longer. What we have is something spectacular and unique that should be embraced and allowed to flow naturally, so the choice is yours. Embrace what is natural to you, or force yourself to fit in and risk burnout. Life is a journey, not a competition. Progress is progress, no matter how fast or slow and if you're being pressured, you're not the one at fault. Everyone else is for being too demanding and inconsiderate. ",

            "answer_text": "Well there\u2019s obsessive repetition. There\u2019s also (when they really want to learn it) the ability to grimly focus on it to the exclusion of all else. The more unique way is connective tangents. If you\u2019ve ever been in conversation with someone with autism you might realise that they constantly explore avenues of though that are not either apparent or don\u2019t seem to make sense right away. They quickly form connections to things. It works the same way with learning. Someone on the autism spectrum learns things by LEARNING them, not just memorizing some useless to be filed away until the brain deletes it. Knowledge is quickly picked up, associated with their life, other facts, contrasts and comparisons, and integrated into the matrix we call a brain. On the flip side though you hand someone with autism information for which there IS no base, no comparison, no preformed structure to attach it to, you\u2019ll see them struggle HARD. Its like a computer, they have to set aside a segment (partition) of their head, Format (organize it to hold unique information) and then start adding information to it. This is one of the reasons social issues are so hard for someone with autism. Each person is viewed as their own unique format, because they painful learn early on that there are no generalities that apply to everyone. ",
