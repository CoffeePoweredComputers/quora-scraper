            "answer_text": "To create the ebook version of an old book, publishers layout and typeset the text of the printed book, in a form that is fit to be used for an ebook format. Having said that \u2014 how they get that text can be different between books and publishers. In an ideal world, the publisher still has the original files that were used to layout and typeset the old book. Not too much of a problem there; they can convert the file format, extract the text, and go ahead with layouting and typesetting. Often they only have the printed book, as the original files can no longer be opened with current software versions. They will scan the pages of the printed book, and use optical character recognition software to identify the words in the scanned files. Here is where the major challenge appears: The OCR software will misinterpret some of the scan. An impurity in the paper structure may be interpreted by the OCR software as a dot. Many OCR programs have problems with reading ligatures (Orthographic ligature), so a \u201efi\u201c ligature can be interpreted as \u201eA\u201c. Good publishers know the limits of OCR, so \u2014 if the budget for the print-to-ebook conversion allows it \u2014 they hire a proofreader to catch errors in the text output of the OCR. This will help finding the two errors in a sentence like \u201eHe Alled the cup with.water\u201c. The OCR program misinterpreted the ligature in \u201efilled\u201c, and assumed the contamination in the paper between \u201ewith\u201c and \u201ewater\u201c was a dot. Publishers who need to create the ebook on a shoestring budget will not hire a proofreader, and only run the text through correction software instead, hoping the program will fix all errors. So, in a shoestring budget ebook production, you will find \u201eHe Alled the cup with water\u201c in the ebook. Removing an erroneous dot is within the power of correction software, knowing about the possibility of misinterpreted ligatures is not. Ho-hum publishers and publishers who overload their editors with tasks like \u201ecan you please convert this pile of books into ebooks, should not take longer than an afternoon, right\u201c will not bother with any corrections and just stuff the OCR\u2018s text result into a pre-fabricated standard layout, resulting in ebook treasures like this section: \u201eHe Alled the cup with.water. Ste phen looked @ him doubtfully.\u201c Poor Steve probably looked as doubtful as I did when I read that novel on my Kindle, but I took it as a friendly challenge, marking each OCR, typesetting, and layout error in my copy of this ebook. At least until I grew tired of marking half the text, by a dozen pages later. As you can probably tell, nobody ever accused me of being a great proofreader. ",
