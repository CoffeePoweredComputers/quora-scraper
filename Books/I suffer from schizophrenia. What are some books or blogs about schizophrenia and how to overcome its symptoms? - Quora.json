            "answer_text": "[edit 2017\u201304\u201317: I\u2019m not sure if the question changed, but I will just answer the question specifically first, and then leave the old answer, which might not be as helpful in some ways. Dr. Abram Hoffer\u2019s work, including his book \u201cHealing Schizophrenia\u201d, is one of the pioneering works into orthomolecular medicine, or essential understanding how micronutrient excesses and deficiencies can create wellness or sickness\u2026 like say not enough of certain minerals or vitamins. One of the best, most comprehensive guidebooks I\u2019ve seen for specifically dealing with particular mental health disorders, is some of Eva Edelman\u2019s works, specifically \u201cNatural Healing for Schizophrenia and Other Common Mental Disorders\u201d, which has information on tests you can do to find out your specific biotypes, discovering underlying root causes of biological imbalance and some of the regimes that may help correct them (copper toxicity, or really high copper levels, was one for me), and some of the alternative, natural treatments one can use to heal the disorder. There is another book for bipolar disorder, and I think there is a work book on recipes and foods you can make which can help manage schizophrenia better as well available. I can tell you that the food I eat, taking certain supplements, and certain lifestyle practices (getting some exercise, and getting enough sleep being two really big ones) can really affect how I experience my wellness. \u201cNutrient Power\u201d by William Walsh goes into more depth in terms of the microbiology of a number of disorders, discerning common links (like oxidative stress and an inability to get certain nutrients from food any more sometimes because of oxidants breaking down important enzymes before they are digested and absorbed, etc- probiotics may be one thing that can help with this\u2026 let our gut flora help compensate for such problems) and the biophysiology that is going on in some cases. It is useful food for looking for a real cure, I think. Some of these authours have blogs, youtube videos, or otherwise have made some of their helpful work available. I find vitamin c a very helpful supplement as well- the linus pauling institute has done some research on that. The Home - The Weston A. Price Foundation may have some good research as well\u2026 Dr. mercola has some good research on general health things, dr hyman has some good research on the importance of fat in the diet and the \u2018myth\u2019 that eating lots of fat necessarily makes you fat\u2026 paradoxically, possibly the opposite, and when schizophrenics lose fat, like healthy fats in the brain, the excitotoxicity depletes the energy of the cells more, and damage and hallucination etc is more likely to occur. Schizophrenics may sometimes also be low in b vitamins, like vitamin b6, which in particular is a precursor for some neurotransmitters, and some in between states might include tryptophan and 5-htp - a woman doing anti-gmo work mentioned that gmo foods that include bt toxin or pass the gene on to either your gut itself or the gut flora you have, basically means your body creates a pesticide in your gut that kills off all your good gut flora as well, including ones that make tryptophan (and so many other important things as well). Certain fermented foods to restore gut health, may be helpful for many people, - live kefir, yougurt, kombucha (is a less natural one), and things like kimchi, sauerkraut\u2026 miso soup\u2026 essentially the bacteria that normally break down the food we are eating that we can\u2019t completely digest ourselves, and that these little guys give all the nutrients from to us.Some people have been doing research on healing autism with probiotics, and you may find their are similarities between schizophrenia and some other mental disorders (similar symptoms occur when different systems go out of wack in different ways, etc, and chronic infections are among these). Autism Linked to Stomach Bacteria, Suggests CalTech Research: Probiotic Treatment A Potential Cure Jess Sherman Jess Sherman - Nutrition For Families - Jess Sherman RHN wrote a book called \u201cRaising Resilience\u201d which goes into how some of these different problems, not necessarily full blown into schizophrenia or the like, but common similar problems parents often encounter, can be dealt with using healthy lifestyle choices, and she shares how to do this with healthy food, including probiotic food and recipes\u2026 there\u2019s a good 50 pages on the practical things you can do, like food, beyond the theory and so on, in her book\u2026 which is geared towards mothers and caregivers. Disclaimer, I have not read all of these books, or put everything in them into practice, or challenged and tested everything, but I do presently own them all and I am hoping to find the time, energy, and mental fortitude to seriously explore them and apply what is in them, beyond just what I\u2019ve learned from the internet so far, and so on. You could say\u2026 some of these are good at being\u2026 solution focussed\u2026 so understanding yourself, your own mind and heart and body and spirit\u2026 is an asset\u2026 to shaping your wellness, and a lifestyle that supports that wellness\u2026 there are many different tools, but you may find some are simpler and easier and will give you more mileage for less input\u2026 meditation might be another one in this regard. ] I wrote this answer about the biological basis and complementary healing techniques of the label for the collection of symptoms commonly called 'schizophrenia'. Michael Goguen's answer to What is the best complementary schizophrenia treatment? if you want to know about the side effects of the medication, dr peter breggin has written some good books critical of the psychiatry industry. for instance, reducing dopamine levels, which is the basis of operation supposedly the atypical antipsychotics work on (which has been disproven as the cause but helps in relieving some of the positive symptoms (meaning added) according to the book nutrient power on p53 where it lists the 4 main current theories of the biological basis for schizophrenia) Lower feelings of social connection, creativity, romance, and motivation are all linked to reduced dopamine activity, which is a side effect of the medication... in fact, it is known in some conditions that the medications can create the symptoms they were supposedly created to treat.

            "answer_text": "I interned in a state mental hospital for two years. In that time I worked with many people suffering from Schizophrenia. Though most experienced doctors and psychologists told me that psychotherapy wasn't very helpful with schizophrenics, I managed to get two of my patients released after they had spent years in locked wards. Many of my clients learned to distinguish their real memories from their delusions... all with talk therapy. Sadly, decades later, this remains unexplored territory. I still see books published proclaiming that psychotherapy is of no use with schizophrenia... only medication. While medication is VITAL to your normal functioning and symptom relief, psychotherapy CAN help with the personality symptoms the medication doesn't treat. Perhaps other Quora members know of books that address these issues. I hope so. The need certainly exists. Best of luck. ",
