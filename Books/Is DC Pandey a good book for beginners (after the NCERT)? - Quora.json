They are necessary too but many fail to do them. Do not go beyond them or you will mess up. For JEE Advanced aspirants, I would recommend DC Pandey books and NCERT Exemplar books only for building your foundation if you think it is weak for very high level books like Cengage, especially if you do not study at a coaching institute.
