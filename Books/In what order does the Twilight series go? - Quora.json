            "answer_text": "Okay - spoilers for the entire series (because I can\u2019t think of how to explain it otherwise) . . . . . . . . . . . There are two orders in which you can read it. First - the order in which it was written :- Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn. This tells the story from start to finish and - if you are reading it for the first time, it is the best idea. But - and this is the fun order - if you want to get a more interesting version :- Breaking Dawn Book 1, Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn Book 2. Because what if Twilight, New Moon & Eclipse are just Bella\u2019s life flashing before her eyes at the end of Break Dawn Book 1? As the venom flows through her system, and the life drains out of her, she thinks back over the decisions that lead her to that point - starting with her move from Phoenix to Forks. Then - after we see the events of Eclipse come to an end, we return to her and see her turn and become a vampire. Don\u2019t you think that would be fun? ",

            "answer_text": "Twilight, then Breaking Dawn part one, then Breaking Dawn part three. If you're talking about the books. There is no real need to read the stuff in between. I speak from hard-earned experience. If you mean chronologically, I guess it goes: Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, The Short Second Life Of Bree Tanner, Breaking Dawn. If you want to include Midnight Sun, shoehorn it between Twilight and New Moon. It's just Twilight from Edward's POV \u2013 but then you get spoilers for New Moon, but if you're a semi-observant reader you got those from Twilight anyway. Similarly, if you want to read the take-outs, you may want to insert them into the books they were taken out of, just as if no editing ever took place. If you want to Include Life and Death, it doesn't really fit in, so you want to read it either before you read Twilight or after you read Breaking Dawn. ",
