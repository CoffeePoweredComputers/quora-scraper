            "answer_text": "Vatican City certainly has some gold. But why the center of the Catholic Church possesses it involves its ministry and not for its own wealth.  When you\u2019re a ministry that\u2019s been around for two millennia, you might find yourself given a lot of gifts. Artists create grand works and are donated to or bought by the Vatican for a modest fee. Followers donate to the Church, which uses the funds to buy the necessary and appropriate tools for the liturgy: Clothes, candles and candle holders. Censers. Chalices. Books and the like. Every church has expenses, and the seat of the Catholic Church is no exception. But Vatican City, the smallest country in the world, often has incomes that are less than their expenditures. And, surrounded by other European countries, they have to endure many of the same issues as their neighbors. First: Why all the gold? There\u2019s really not that much there. Much of it is likely on adornments as plating, with a few solid items. But again, should the Church have this? Why do they? To adore God is one reason. A proper church reflects our love of God. Remember that tragic fire that nearly destroyed Notre Dame Cathedral? Do you realize how much time and money were used over the centuries to build it? Why was it so lavishly built? For the same reason that some gold is used to honor God. If we build a shoddy church, we foster a shoddy attitude to God. This is reflected in several areas of Sacred Scripture rather well. One story tells of the woman that breaks a very expensive jar of oil and anoints Jesus, which shocked and confused the Twelve. When he was in Bethany reclining at table in the house of Simon the leper,b a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfumed oil, costly genuine spikenard. She broke the alabaster jar and poured it on his head. There were some who were indignant. \u201cWhy has there been this waste of perfumed oil? It could have been sold for more than three hundred days\u2019 wages and the money given to the poor.\u201d They were infuriated with her. Jesus said, \u201cLet her alone. Why do you make trouble for her? She has done a good thing for me. The poor you will always have with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them, but you will not always have me. She has done what she could. She has anticipated anointing my body for burial. Amen, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed to the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.\u201d It is fitting for a church\u2014any church\u2014to use materials that have workmanship and reverence. As long as who benefits from the work is for those that the ministry supports and not the clergy or staff themselves, that\u2019s fine. The Catholic Church is very not-for-profit. Those who attempt to gain personal wealth are often identified and matters corrected. Everyone and everything is adorned appropriately, but not for personal opulence that would be sinful and immoral. Despite what gold appears to be there, the Church is a bit poor. It is a ministry that donates much of its time and funds to aid the poor, after all. Much of that gold is part of the many works of art that are in the museums. Other priceless items aren\u2019t gold at all but one-of-a-kind documents from notable people of antiquity, like a letter to the Pope from President Lincoln. Documents that cleared the name of Jeanne d\u2019Arc (Joan of Arc). The most ancient of Bible writings. Stuff like that. Such works of art could be sold to a private investor for huge sums. The Church could spend every cent it receives of that sale for the poor\u2026once. And then there\u2019s nothing more to give, and the art may never be seen again. Better to use the art to make a modest sustaining income that can help the poor and the city\u2019s expenses to perform its work\u2014and let anyone enjoy the history of the artworks. The museums, the stamps, the tours in Vatican City create revenue used to keep the ministry going. Once a year, other parishes from around the world form a collection that goes to the Vatican (\u201cPeter\u2019s Pence\u201d) to aid the general worldwide ministry. ",

            "answer_text": "Back in 2013 the Vatican publicly announced that they have gold and other precious metal reserves in excess of 50 million US dollars. Some of that, around 20 million, is stored in the USA. However, this amount only takes into account the actual precious metal reserves held by the Vatican Bank. The Church also has, literally, tonnes of gold in liturgical objects and art, which is not included in this amount. So, the simplest way to answer your question is \u201cquite a bit\u201d. ",
