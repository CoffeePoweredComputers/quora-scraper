            "answer_text": "First, your intent to open a publishing biz is a whopper. I have a friend who went that path for several years and found the demands so varied, 24/7, and expensive that he retreated by returning to his native real estate. The publishers I\u2019ve dealt with for my books (as author or ghosting) have been large enough to do all the work from editing to marketing, with the ton of steps inbetween. There must be many self-publishers out there such as BookBaby and many others who are anxiously awaiting your call! I applaud you for your guts & wishes that you find your glory! ",
