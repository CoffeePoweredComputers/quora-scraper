            "answer_text": "NO & this question has been asked and answered previously. The problem is that oil may enter places and passages meant for the refrigeration gas and if the compressor tries to pump this oil substantially it may be damaged as the compressor is not designed to pump a liquid which is incompressible - the compressor is NOT practically repairable and would need replacing > = EXPENSIVE. If the refrigerator has been laid horizontally then it should be placed vertical prior to being switched on - the time varies from at least 4 hours to the same length of time that it was horizontal - a day should be enough. Despite the 'prophesies of death' for a refrigerator in these circumstances I have never heard of a mortality . ",

            "answer_text": "Yes .Refrigerators have a closed system so nothing will leak at all But when the time comes to put it to use again you have to put it upright for at least 24 hours Why ?
