            "answer_text": "Surprisingly little. An average book weighs less than 1 kilogram. Even if all of this was wood, it would still be a very small portion of a tree. According to OneOak Project \u2022 following the life story of one oak tree a 23m high oak tree has about 5 cubic meters of timber, and about 7.86 tonnes of dry mass. This is not your avarage tree, of course, so lets assume that a tree used in paper production has a quarter of this. This would mean that a book uses a maximum of 1/1965th of a tree. One tree has enough wood to produce 2000 or more books. And it gets better: most pulp (>80% according to Paper recycling) used to make paper is created from wood that would otherwise go to waste: branches cut in landscaping, shavings and sawdust in a furniture factory, etc. etc. with added waste paper, possibly de-inked.  And even the trees that are cut down specifically for the purpose of making paper are in most cases from renewable forests, using fast-growing trees.  There is no need to feel guilty reading a book on account of the trees.  (Paper production does use a lot of fresh water, though...) ",

            "answer_text": "You do not save trees by saving paper, at least if your trees come from North America or Western Europe. Most paper comes from small diameter trees. You need to cut these out of forests, because if you do not the forests are more subject to insect attack and disastrous fires, as happens in the West. If you do not thin, the smaller trees die for lack of sunlight So thinning is good for forest health. So let me give a glib - but accurate - answer to your question. How many trees are cut every hour to print books? None, or put more correctly, if you stopped using paper to print books, no trees would be \u201csaved\u201d. One more technicality - when people talk of cutting trees, they are often confusing forestry harvesting with deforestation. Deforestation happens when a forest is converted to other uses. You build a mall or a parking lot. A harvest keeps the land in forest. Another paradox is that if you want to keep land in forests, you need good markets for forest products, else land is put to other uses. So, it is not exactly true that you save a forest by using paper, but it is closer to the truth than that you save trees by not using paper. ",
