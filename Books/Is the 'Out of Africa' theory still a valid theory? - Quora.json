            "answer_text": "No it's not valid a theory means something that could be true there's no evidence to show that any of this stuff is true and this theory came from Charles Darwin and another guy who made up all this BS that humans came from apes just because they happen to have opposable thumbs and fingers and walk on their legs like humans do there's never been any evidence to show that we are or have ever been related to apes there's only people who say we are and the fact that people think all humans came from Africa is just racist because most people today who use it are racist and just wanted to try to make it seem like white people don't have their own history or their own ancestry. All humans came from different parts of the world there were seven tribes of different people who created the different nationalities and cultures we have today so no not everybody came from Africa I have evidence of this because I don't have any African DNA in it at all my ancestry is native American Mohawk Indian and in German Dutch my family came from what was once Eurasia technically my culture is Eurasian.

            "answer_text": " Much of the evolution of the Hominin clade has taken place in Africa, including Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo sapiens until about 60,000 years ago. However there is increasing evidence that Homo sapiens arose in a broad swath of Africa including the drier more open landscapes of the Mediterranean (Jebel Irhoud Morocco 300,000 years ago), East Africa and South Africa. So it is possible, but doubtful that the very first humans arose in some non-African part of the Mediterranean. This seems doubtful, because the conditions to adapt to more open habitat certainly existed in Africa, and that is where the fossils are. An interesting earlier geographic note is that late Miocene apes (say 7 MYA) flourished in Europe and Asia. David Begun and some others think it possible that the earliest Hominini (human line as distinct from Panini, chimp line) arose say in Greece: Graecopithecus. The evidence is underwhelming for this particular genus. Graecopithecus - Wikipedia . But it is remarkable how common Miocene apes are outside of Africa. However later Hominins are all African until Homo erectus colonized Eurasia. ",
