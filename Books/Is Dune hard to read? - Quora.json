            "answer_text": "Like all of Herbert\u2019s Dune series, I found \u201cDune\u201d hard going, but I persevered and it became easier with repeated readings \u2013 I had the series on my shelf for many years \u2013 but not *that* easier. Eventually, I gave away all of the Herbert books that I had, keeping only \u201cThe Dosadi Experiment\u201d. I never bothered with any of the later Dune books that were not written by Frank Herbert. When David Lynch made the first movie version of \u201cDune\u201d, I had misgivings, all of which were confirmed within fifteen minutes of the movie starting. It was an utter disaster and a later, extended version, which Lynch rightly disowned, was an even bigger train wreck. There have been made-for-television Dune stories, none of which I have seen. ",

            "answer_text": "I found it very hard to read. It took me three attempts to get through. The ideas are absolutely wonderful but the dialogue and the way things are minimally shown can make the story hard to get through. showing a concept like a human whose mind can process data faster than a modern day supercomputer is difficult. Describing someone who has such perfect control over their bodies they can make choices at the cellular level is incredible. Showing these people and not making them look like cheesy superheroes when in reality these people could probably kick the X-men\u2019s behinds is a measure of great talent. But seeing that talent might take a couple of tries to read. I found it much easier to read Brian herberts earlier books. Mega fans don\u2019t like his books but I appreciate how much clearer his writing is compared to his father. ",
