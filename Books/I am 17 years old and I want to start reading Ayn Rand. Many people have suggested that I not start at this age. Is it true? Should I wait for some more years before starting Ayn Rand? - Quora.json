            "answer_text": "17 is the absolutely PERFECT age to read Ayn Rand. I only say so because I was your same soulful, soft-headed age when I first picked up that dog-eared paperback of Atlas Shrugged. I went to town on it like a champion chomper of pure pop literature. It was glorious! I needed an infusion of intellectual energy, and by golly I got it in the form of John Galt\u2019s hundred-page speech. Who is John Galt, pray tell? Don\u2019t know! Sounds like an arrogant asshole, honestly, but also kind of awesome - dude thinks for himself! He discovered a new alloy, built an engine, and stayed up late with his college classmates talking ideas. They smoked cigarettes too! Atlas Shrugged was bequeathed to me by my big brother, who was pure punk back then. He had a reverse mohawk that looked absolutely terrible; listened to Crass, Circle Jerks, and the Dead Kennedy\u2019s; and was an amazing athlete. Weird, right? He\u2019s now a software engineer and uber-liberal, but here he was handing me the world\u2019s sweetest hardcore hyper-individualist porn. Dandy Randy has taken quite a few clubbings and drubbings over the past couple decades. People say she\u2019s a terrible writer and a worse philosopher. They say her sexual politics are retrograde and her characters smoke cigarettes! They say she accepted social security payments in her golden years while remaining staunchly opposed to public assistance. They say she ignored the public taxpayer\u2019s role in funding the technological innovations and entrepreneurial juggernauts. They say so many terrible things! And about a successful woman! Maybe they\u2019re the real misogynists, these liberals - only adulating women when they don\u2019t color outside their little box of acceptable beliefs. Maybe? Maybe! Whenever I hear a liberal taking down a conservative woman in the most vile terms, I can hear the sounds of them masturbating to climax while they spout their venom - but perhaps it\u2019s merely an aural hallucination only I am prone to - a curse! Perhaps they\u2019re not really cumming the moment they hit SEND on their Twitter and Facebook accounts. And yet, I can hear their gruntings and their groans! Earplugs, please! \u201cHypocrite!\u201d they scream. \u201cCult leader!\u201d they shout. \u201cOh Rand, you devil!\u201d they cackle. But\u2026. Here is what\u2019s so great about reading Rand, and at such a sweet, succulent age as 17. Whether you come to think her prose is drivel, or her philosophy simple-minded, or her politics abhorrent, she will teach you how much fun it is to think in a CONTRARIAN way. That alone is worth the price of an eBook. I grew up in one of the most educated populaces on planet earth. You couldn\u2019t spit into the wind without it blowing back and hitting a PhD in nuclear physics in the face. Many of these scientists were pretty conservative (much to the dismay of liberals who think brilliant minds and left-wing politics are eternally coupled). Many of these scientists were also religious. I didn\u2019t get it, and still don\u2019t. My family was very Catholic, very conservative, and very patriotic. My teachers were infinitely liberal, privileged, effete, and underminers of belief in America as a grand project, culture, or population. It was all so clearly ideological rhetoric decoupled from reality, so spiritually corrosive, and so priggish. I found it utterly suffocating, because i was spiritually and intellectually independent. All I wanted was for someone to speak to me like an adult, and trash all these taken-for-granted platitudes, whether religious or political. And that\u2019s the beauty of ol\u2019 Battering Rand. She will give you a perspective you will almost never encounter in another writer: an unbridled attack on Christianity and religion. A patriotic assessment and defense of the American way of life. An expat insider\u2019s view on the dehumanizing affect of authoritarian socialism. An unafraid woman willing to take on her critics. A hostile critic of liberal propaganda. Ayn Rand has it all! The point is, reading Ayn Rand will let you sit back and think: \u201cHoly crap. It just might be really fun, inspiring, motivating, and invigorating to think for myself.\u201d You will move beyond Ayn Rand, no doubt. You will recognize that if you really want to understand epistemology, you will have to read more serious writers and thinkers. If you want to understand politics, you will have to read and understand more connected individuals. If you want to experience the pure beauty of fictional prose, you will have to seek out better stylists. If you want better economics, you will have to seek out someone less inclined toward romanticism. Rand, in these ways, may be a mediocrity. HOWEVER! To repeat, she will be one of the only people in modern American culture who will show you that it\u2019s okay to think differently, confidently, and independently. She will show you that you can indeed shed your clueless religious baggage and your liberal educational baggage. She will at least introduce the question: can human beings, men and women, achieve heroism in our modern world? She will give you the courage to think, \u201cHey, maybe all these people trying to indoctrinate me are full of shit!\u201d She will introduce CONTRARIANISM. She will show you that, Hey, wait a minute! Capitalism DOES offer its own unique modes and myths of heroism - and they\u2019re an amalgam of heroism, rugged individualism, confidence, scientific thought, rationalism, and contemporary warriorism! And to we Americans, but really to people in general, she will allow us to ask ourselves: Are we capable of more, of being better, of reaching our maximum potential? And we will scream YES! YES!! YES!!!!  ",

            "answer_text": "When I was in late high school and early college, I would regularly encounter fellow students (always white, always male) who had contracted what I began to call \u201cFountainhead Syndrome,\u201d though it could just as easily be provoked by Atlas Shrugged. Upon reading one of these books, there is a strong chance that your young, American white man will turn into an insufferable and smug jackass. Luckily, the effect is usually temporary. But sometimes it\u2019s not: Speaker Paul Ryan, etc. Now, this isn\u2019t to say that you shouldn\u2019t read the book. Books aren\u2019t dangerous: they\u2019re made out of paper. Issues sometimes arise out of the interpretation of books, in almost all cases the uncritical interpretation of books. Ayn Rand was a forceful and influential thinker and her ideas are worth engaging with, as a result of that influence if not on their own merits. Ayn Rand was not, however, much of a philosopher, historian, economist, or prose stylist. Her \u201cphilosophy\u201d of Objectivism can be, at first blush, quite appealing to a young, intellectually inclined man. Every 17-year-old views himself as an \u00dcbermensch with an incisive mind and a clear-eyed view of the world, and quite naturally so. The perfect moral system for such a young brave is, of course, the pursuit of rational self-interest. Her ideas about metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics are challenging enough to make one feel rewarded for having understood them, but approachable enough that one can achieve that understanding without having any background in philosophy, history, or literature. But a good rule of thumb is that the more somebody claims their beliefs to be clearly objective or obviously rational, the more skeptically we ought to treat those claims. The smartest men and women in history have wrestled with these philosophical problems since the beginning of history, in a millenia-long conversation stretching from Confucius and Socrates to Ibn Rashd and Thomas Aquinas to Kant and Hume to Wittgenstein and Heidegger and many points in between. If things are so objective and rational, how did these folks miss it? And we might also pause before we throw out those thousands of years of dedicated pondering. Nietzsche might have killed God, but he damn sure read the Bible first. A major failing of Ayn Rand as a political or moral philosopher is her lack of engagement with previous thinkers. It seems lazy, at the very least, to construct a situation where selfishness is the greatest good and altruism is a great evil and not even name-check John Stuart Mill, for example. If you want to read the book, you should read the book. But Ayn Rand wanted her ideas to be taken seriously, and taking an idea seriously means trying to tear it down by the roots. So read other books with different points of view: Emma Goldman would have been absolutely thrilled by the capitalists of the world going \u201con strike,\u201d since from her perspective this would remove the barriers to a free, rational anarchist society. Read the most scathing critiques of Atlas Shrugged that you can find. The strength of ideas are proved in argument. Gore Vidal\u2019s review is one I would recommend: This odd little woman is attempting to give a moral sanction to greed and self interest, and to pull it off she must at times indulge in purest Orwellian newspeak of the \"freedom is slavery\" sort. What interests me most about her is not the absurdity of her \"philosophy,\" but the size of her audience (in my campaign for the House she was the one writer people knew and talked about). She has a great attraction for simple people who are puzzled by organized society, who object to paying taxes, who dislike the \"welfare\" state, who feel guilt at the thought of the suffering of others but who would like to harden their hearts. For them, she has an enticing prescription: altruism is the root of all evil, self-interest is the only good, and if you're dumb or incompetent that's your lookout. Comment, July 1961 So read it, but read it critically. ",
