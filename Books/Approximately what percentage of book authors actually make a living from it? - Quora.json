            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been working in the editorial, publishing and printing trades for 35+ years. I\u2019ve also worked with world-class authors. I have to say a great majority of book authors (all genres) don\u2019t make a living from their writing. Indeed, nearly all of the authors I\u2019ve worked with have had to hold down conventional jobs and careers \u2014 lawyers, accountants, doctors, advertising types \u2014 and even one janitor. Only a very tiny minority of book authors actually reach the stellar heights of making a livable living from writing. The only workable writing area with a livable living is journalism \u2014 but that\u2019s nearly always salaried employment. It\u2019s a steady monthly salary in exchange for NOT writing stuff that you like. ",
