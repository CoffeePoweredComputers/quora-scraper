            "answer_text": "The Pew Research Center released its latest data on American reading habits, and the results show some interesting \u2014 and somewhat surprising \u2014 trends. Roughly 72 per cent of American adults read a book in 2015, continuing a gradual decline over the last 5 years (from 79 per cent in 2011). However, these stats include people who reported reading \u201cone book\u2026in part\u201d, so it\u2019s unclear how many made it all the way through. The average number of books each person read over the course of a year was 12\u2026but that number is inflated by the most avid readers. The most frequently reported number was 4 books per year. Of course, there\u2019s plenty of variation among demographics. ",

            "answer_text": "See , it depends on that person . Some people like to read and they do and some people who like to read but after some time they get tired so they leave half way and there's high proportion of those people . According to a research , not even 70% of any country population reads 1 book in a year . But actually reading books is good , we get to learn new and new things and also it increases our reading skills and knowledge , everyone should read atleast five or more than that books in a year :) We should take some inspiration from Bill Gates the owner of Microsoft . He reads nearly 50 books in a year although he has a lot of workload . So yeah , it totally depend on the person how much he can read . Hope This helped uh ! ",
