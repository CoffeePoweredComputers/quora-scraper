            "answer_text": "Ok, so I want to preface this answer by saying that I am not an artist or a programmer. I can't draw, or animate, or do any of the things that would be necessary to actually make a game. That being said, I have been playing games in general for almost 30 years, and visual novels specifically for almost 20. In addition to that, I have spent a lot of time over the past 10 years learning aboutgame design on a broad conceptual level. Ok, so you want to make a visual novel. The first thing to understand is the \u201cnovel\u201d aspect. VNs are very much a narrative-driven experience. They do provide a level of interactivity that would be impossible in even the best choose-your-own-adventure novels, but in the end, they are still novels. This is going to limit the amount of agency you can give your players. The most common form of agency in VNs is achieved through the \u201cbranching path\u201d, choices that the player makes which lead them along one route or another to reach one of multiple endings. The more choices you give your players, the more \u201cbranches\u201d your path has, the more difficult it's going to be to create. Let's say you're writing a novel, not a VN or a choose-your-own-adventure, just a regular novel. You can create fully fleshed out characters, settings, and story arcs. Now, imagine that at the very beginning of the novel you gave your readers the choice of whether the main character should be male or female. You have literally just doubled the amount of work you need to do to write your novel, because every instance of \u201che\u201d becomes \u201cshe\u201d, every other character will have to treat the protagonist differently based on their gender, and the protagonist themself will likely react differently to the same situations. Every time you give the player a choice in a VN, you have to write separate outcomes for each of those choices. Let's take an example. Many VNs are dating sims, so that's an easy place to start. You introduce your protagonist, your setting, and for the sake of argument let's say there are only 2 romanceable NPCs. Also for the sake of argument, let's say that the protagonist is always male, and both romance options are female. This is an extremely simple setup for a VN. So, your story is rolling right along and we come to our first choice, which girl is your protagonist going to talk to? In a VN, making one choice typically precludes making the other, but you still have to write both outcomes. Even if your story comes back to a single point after the \u201cscene\u201d the player chose, you still have to write 2 scenes instead of 1. And, in order for the choice to be meaningful to the overall storyline, the game has to have some way to keep track of which scene the player chose. Ok, second choice. This time, our protagonist has to choose which girl he's going to ask out on a date. He still only has two choices, but in order to keep the first choice meaningful, you pretty much have to write 4 different outcomes. Let's say he spoke to Girl A during the first choice, and decides to ask out Girl A during the second choice, that's one path. But what if he decider to ask out Girl B? Maybe she says no because he didn't pick her the first time, but you still need to write a scene for the rejection. Every choice you add increases the amount of work you have to do exponentially. Now imagine that you have not 2, but 3, or 4, or 7 romance options\u2026 you see where I'm going with this. So, from our example, we can see that writing our visual novel is a huge undertaking, especially if we want our player to have lots of choices, and for those choices to have lasting consequences in the overall storyline. And we haven't even started to work on the art or the programming. This is why visual novels typically have very simple visuals, consisting of static backgrounds and a few variations on static sprites for characters. The more complicated you try to make your visuals, the more difficult they are going to be to integrate with your story. Backgrounds should be static images, and characters should be sprites that can simply be layered on top of those images. You can make variations on the character sprites to give them different facial expressions, outfits, or poses, but you should keep in mind that the longer you spend creating these assets will either decrease the amount of time you can spend on writing and programming, or will increase the overall time it takes to develop your game. Ok, enough about what makes it so difficult. How can it be done? Well, there are a number of different ways, but one possibility that I have seen used effectively many times is the use of a \u201cpoints\u201d system. Did you pick Girl A when presented with the first choice? Congratulations, you just earned 1 point for Girl A. In this way, each choice becomes an island. Yes, you have to write two separate scenes for each choice the player makes, but it's then easy to return to a central line and continue telling your story. Choose Girl A again when presented with the second choice? Awesome, now Girl A has 2 points. At a certain point in the story, the game will stop, calculate how many points the player has, and then shift to what is essentially a straight shot to whatever ending corresponds to their point total. Yes, you'll have to write separate ending paths for each possible outcome, but it's easier than the exponential growth you'd see if you tried to make each choice meaningful in and of itself. Now, there are a lot of different kinds of visual novels. I have used dating sims as an example because they are an extremely common example of the genre. But the same kind of rules apply to just about every kind of visual novel you could make. Every choice you give the player increases the amount of work you have to do. Every character you add, every location the player can visit, every detail the player can customize, these things all make your game more difficult and more time consuming to develop. The best advice I can give is to go out and play as many visual novels as you can. Play each one over and over and over. If the game offers a save function, save before each and every choice, then load and choose the other option. Make notes of how different each choice is, and how much it influences the overall storyline. How long does it take to return to the central path (if at all)? Does the choice influence the story beyond the initial \u201cscene\u201d that choice initiates? Try to figure out for yourself if the game is using some kind of \u201cpoints\u201d system, or some kind of complex branching path? How does the game incorporate its visuals? I really hope this helps you with your project. I will leave you with one final piece of advice, more from a general game design perspective. Start small. It seems like such a simple idea, but it is staggering how often first time game developers bite off more than they can chew on their first project. Take my first example, one male protagonist, two female NPCs, and two choices (who to talk to, then who to ask on a date). Then, make the game. Yes, with so few characters and so few choices it's going to be short. But your first and most important goal should be to make something fully playable as quickly as you can. Once it's playable, make people play it. Put it on Gamejolt, itch.io, Alpha Beta Gamer, and anywhere else you can think of. Get people to give you feedback. A small project like this will teach you so much about the process, what works and what doesn't, and what you alone are capable of. I, for one, would happily play such a game. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's back wayyyyyy up. \u201cNo experience.\u201d While this doesn't mean you can't make a game, it does mean you need to consider reducing scope and starting small. No one successfully makes a content-rich video game on their very first go. Requirement #1: skilled artist Are you a skilled artist? If so, cool. But\u2026 it doesn't sound like you are, based on the question. So how will get your art? It sounds like this will require a lot of art, and that quality will be very important. Are you going to spend a few years developing that skill? Do you have a money to contract it? We can talk about animating art when having art at all is on the radar. Requirement #2: skilled writer If it's gonna be a visual novel and not really a game, the writing better be really fucking compelling, just like the art. Have you written a novel? Might wanna try something linear like that before managing a multi-branched storyline that the player can affect. Requirement #3: data structures It's gonna display dialogue on the screen right? A lot of it? How will you organize that? If you've never done any kind of programming (doesn't have to be hardcore like C++) that involves fetching specific data from a large data pool, you'll quickly find yourself struggling. Recommendation: make something else right now, that's smaller Download some animated sprites and background. Get a dialogue system too. Unity has a trillion assets and plugins on their marketplace. Choose something familiar, like a fable or short story, and make an interactive version of it. Nothing fancy. Your art doesn't even have to match what's happening, as far as visual style and characters. Study the assets. Look at how the sprites are being animated. Try it yourself from scratch. Look at some tutorials for assistance. Do it again from scratch without tutorials. Make your own dialogue system. Do it with tutorials, and again without. Then you can consider tackling something like this, assuming you have skills and/or money for the art and writing. Otherwise, if you're really passionate about this, take a couple years drawing. Take another couple years writing. And then comes the actual learning-how-to-make-games part. Sounds like a lot of work, but that's because making games is a lot of work that involves a lot of skill sets. If you're going solo, you have to work within your skill sets. In general, I\u2019d say you'd need to spend about 3\u20134 years at 60+ hours a week or 8\u201310 years part time making games to become good at making games. 10,000 hour rule applies. Get a mentor or a few too. You can make and release stuff during that. Just giving you an idea of long-term. If this stuff discouraged you at all, just don't even try it. You'll fail. Spend your time on other things. If you're pumped up reading all that, you're the kind of person the industry needs. Raw passion is what keeps people around, as the general instability of the industry pushes a lot of people out after a bit. ",
