            "answer_text": "As I don\u2019t have children yet, let me tell you how my hunger to read more books increased from my childhood. I used to stay a lot with my maternal grandparents during my childhood. My grandfather is a retired employee of Railways. As he used to have a lot of time in his hands, he used to read a lot of books ranging from mythological books to literature. From age of 2 years, I used to sit in his lap and he used to tell me the story what he was reading then. That's how I was introduced to books.  And similarly, my grandmother used to tell me a story while I am sleeping beside her.  Both of them tried to inculcate reading as a habit from my childhood. And trust me I used to wait for this time of the day to hear stories from both of them. So you need to keep books as an integral part of their daily routine which grows their hunger towards reading more books. Pick some interesting stories from our mythological books, Panchatantra or tinkle and narrate them in such a way instead of plainly reading it to them. Happy narration to your Kids :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, as they are children we can't easily make them imbibe things. When coming to the concept of reading it should completely come from their side. As we all know that children love stories, start from basic things such as story books according to their level of standard. You can also get most the story books and children books at free of cost in Mypustak website and you need to pay for only the delivery and handling charges.  If they are so against to reading books, intially you start reading stories to them and slowly make them read stories. They will gradually develop an interest in reading. Slowly turn them to read books related to their favourite fields. And gradually they themselves find reading as an interesting concept to explore. This track really works and I have seen many children start their reading journey in this manner. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cBooks are the best friends. They will support you all time. You can read them anytime, anywhere. They will teach you in your own way.\u201d Encourage your children with these type of common phrases. Tell them how the books will benefit them in their life, how they can find solutions to their problems. Try to create a atmosphere of books in your home, like create a separate corner as Library; start discussing about different books; relate novel characters in your daily conversation (for example you are behaving like Tom of XYZ book). They will get curious to read books and know more about the character. Provide them with interesting books at starting which gives a lesson, like hitopadesh. Then you can provide them with books of Geronimo Stilton which are funny books with lots of pictures in between. They dont have such lessons but these develop a interest. Personally, my library teacher provided me with books of Geronimo and constantly I developed a habit to read books. Then you may refer to book series of Famous Five. These are books of 5 cousins who deal with different tragedies together and give us bundles of treasure of morals. Hope it helps you! Thanks :) ",

            "answer_text": "Ok well, I started reading when I was really small as my parents encouraged me to read books. They are avid readers and I followed in their footsteps. To try to make children read more often, I would suggest decreasing their device time and putting limits to the amount of time they use their devices. For me, when I was younger, me and my brother were not allowed to use them on the weekdays and we would use them only after finishing our homework and studies on the weekends. I understand kids can make a fuss about it but eventually they will appreciate it. Lol some of these points are from a poem by Roald Dahl called Television\u2026 You should read it. The embellishment can be quite humorous. ( Also I\u2019m learning it as one of the chapters in the board syllabus so lol.) And even if your children don\u2019t use their devices that much, try to incorporate more books in their lives. ",
