            "answer_text": "as someone who makes art on the side, i am not going to tell you that \u201cno art is bad.\u201d that\u2019s false in my personal opinion. there are some adults who make awful art that should be within the skill level of two year old, but they aren\u2019t doing it on PURPOSE. in my opinion, bad art is defined by intent - if you didn\u2019t mean for it to look crappy (unlike picasso), then you\u2019re bad. anyway, i think the best way to tell whether your art is no good is to look at it is to look in the mirror if there\u2019s no one else to judge. mirrors normally point out more imperfections than our naked eye is capable of. don\u2019t use a camera to look through though - perspectives can be very skewed. but you can\u2019t go wrong with a mirror.how many (random, previously un-asked) people compliment you or stop to look at your work is a good indicator. the thing is, if you draw at the lunch table or something and your art is really good, people will stop and tell you this. if your art is terrible and catastrophic, only your friends will compliment you. not a random person walking by your table.granted, sometimes people will compliment an amateur artist. there are many people who study art for a long time, so they have good technique with color or design or whatever, so a non-art invested person may believe that the art is fantastic. however, the actual skill could be shit - and yet many people would be fooled by the beautiful colors, decorations, details, etcetera. in this case, i would just recommend talking to a learned art professor/teacher. you can\u2019t go wrong with them - they\u2019re always looking for ways to improve students\u2019 work, so you\u2019ll improve even if you can\u2019t ascertain whether or not you have good artistic ability.remember that your art can be \u201cbad\u201d as compared to an expert who\u2019s been practicing for forty years! but that doesn\u2019t mean it is actually bad. badness really is subjective, although my first paragraph still stands - there is just some wretched art out there. like said, intent.honestly? just ask anonymous people how good your art is. anons won\u2019t lie, unless you post on social media. social media is VERY subjective and people tell bad artists they are good all the time. additionally, some popular artists are\u2026not actually good. no youtube, no tumblr, no instagram.it\u2019s really all about character. people who are self-aware and lack arrogance know how good (or bad) they are at art. however, sometimes you just can\u2019t tell if your art was good or not till you come back to it like a year later. age is important, ofc, because a year can make a huge difference when it comes to skill and ability, but if you want to judge your art based off of your own standards, you will have to look at your piece(s) after a long time of not seeing them in order to judge more clearly.remember that all art looks good when you\u2019re done with it, unless you really did such a bad job that even you yourself hate it (lmao). after staring at something for so long, it\u2019s extremely difficult for our vision to discern whether something is actually off/incorrect or not.p.s. people can actually be \u201cgood artists\u201d and yet still lack talent or skill. e.g. someone who produces really good abstract art should be appreciated, but if you define skill as realism or whatever, this may not adhere to your standards. that\u2019s okay. art is very subjective. a lot of people would not agree with my opinion that bad art exists, but that\u2019s okay too.

            "answer_text": "The word \u201cgood\u201d is always applied within a context. My grandchild\u2019s art is fabulous - to me, but to no one else except her mother. The art world, were you to chart it, would look like a honeycomb, filled with tiny little niches of various tastes and media in art. Cowboys, Indians, Eastern, Western, Contemporary, Modern, Traditional, Avant-Garde, Oil Paintings, Watercolors, and on and on and on and tediously on. Each one of these, and within each category, each medium, each artist, has their supporters and their detractors. Each price range has its separate standards, its own criteria. Your art fits somewhere in the honeycomb. You can be content with what the other answers have told you - \u201cif you like it yourself, it\u2019s good\u201d - but no artist I know would be content with that. Every artist I have ever met is like the child who makes a drawing and races in, full of excitement, to show it to their mother - \u201csee Mama, see!\u201d And they wait for praise. We all want our work to be seen and acknowledged, even if we don\u2019t admit it. And by the greater number of people, the better. The whole world is good. But how do we get that input? Well, I\u2019ve written this before, but a longtime artist I know told me that the \u201conly feedback you can trust is someone buying your work. Everything else is your mother telling you it\u2019s nice.\u201d And to a great extent I think that\u2019s true. If someone forks over that precious \u201cextra\u201d money for some kind of art you created - the money that doesn\u2019t go for housing or food, well then, that counts. It\u2019s real. It means that for them, your art is good. In fact, it\u2019s very good, worth something concrete and valuable. Now in order to discover this - and to potentially discover the opposite, that your art is \u201cno good\u201d - you have to do two things. You have to put your art in a position to be sold, and you have to price it appropriately - for its context, and for its qualifications. Clearly, a work of art online or on a street corner is not priced the same as a work of art in a serious gallery in uptown New York. A sketch is not priced like an oil painting. And a painting by a beginning artist is not priced like a work by Rembrandt. All of these considerations must be taken into account. But once they are, and you allow enough time (remember, you are looking for ONE person who loves that work of art), then perhaps, you could get a real answer to your question. But remember, even if you did set this kind of experiment up, there are a lot of famous artists who had many paintings that never sold\u2026. and as an art dealer, I can tell you that it really is a kind of needle in a haystack thing. It can take a really long time to sell a painting - or, the right person can come along in a flash. There really is no telling. Therefore, you would really have to have a large body of work in order to discover anything. And a lot of determination - and faith. And then you could begin to find out about this \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d stuff. It would be a process, and meanwhile, of course, you would keep trying to improve. So maybe it would be a sort of pointless proposition\u2026\u2026 might just be better to either keep doing or quit depending on whether you were happy or not. ",
