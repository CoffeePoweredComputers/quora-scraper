            "answer_text": "Well, it really depends on how objectively you're looking at reading as an activity. A lot of people read for fun, for learning, for relaxation, for curiosity, etc! So, by productive if you mean only gaining knowledge, then the process takes a different take.  You could maintain a reading list or set targets for completing books. You can always keep a notepad and pen nearby do jot down anything and everything that you find interesting and then dig deeper into the topics that you find interesting. You could also channel you reading into those genres where your interest lies. For example, if you love reading about the world of finance, check up Goodreads/Amazon/Google and read a wide range of books like theoretical books, biographies, autobiographies, books based on real life incidents, etc. The more you read, the more knowledge you gain and the more interested you become in that subject Cheers! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Read what you like. First calculate the interest. Dont jump on books with high level English. After you get used to reading try any book whether high leveled or light book. Give atleast 1 hour to reading. Make reading a habit. It is a fact.. if u practice any work for 21 days it becomes a habit. For positive outcome related to knowledge you should surely try manorama year books, encyclopedias, etc for novels related to fiction and non fiction its your taste! Try any of them. For self help you can try books of Robin sharma, Shiv khera, Anthony robins, etc  All the best! Enjoy reading! ",
