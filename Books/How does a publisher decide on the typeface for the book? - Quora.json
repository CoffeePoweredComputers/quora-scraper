            "answer_text": "They hire a book designer. For important books, they hire and pay a designer to design just one book. For series, there will be a series design that brings the per-book cost of the design down. Either way, it\u2019s the job of the book designer to specify the typefaces and provide sample layouts, guided by their analysis of the elements that are present in each manuscript, or the likely elements that could appear in the series. Ordinary text, levels of heading, extracts and captions, etc. The orientation of any art plays an important role. So a book about people tends to have images in portrait orientation, taller than they are wide. And a book about places tends to have images in landscape orientation, wider than they are tall. Reviewing the manuscript and art program for the book allows the designer to work out how long the figure captions can be for readability. And the average word count of the captions. That will influence the choice of typeface. Some publishers have in-house book designers on staff. A university press or a publisher of art and design and coffee table books has an Art Director who manages the work of the book designers and artists working on projects. The biggest factor in the choice of a typeface for ordinary text is probably length, because that directly affects cost. And the length calculation is called a castoff. An estimated page count for a particular manuscript assuming a particular book design. The publisher needs the page count in order to get manufacturing estimates. Those are necessary to determine the price of the book. And all that is needed many months before publication for marketing purposes. Nowadays there\u2019s software to do it, but the old way started with a chart that showed the CPI (characters per inch) for each point size in a typeface. And you need to be using book typefaces, designed for readability. A bad design will fatigue the eye of your readers. They may not know why but they won\u2019t enjoy reading your book. They\u2019ll put it down and not pick it up again. They won\u2019t recommend it to their friends or review it on Amazon. Bad design will kill your sales. So the typeface decision is important. Important enough to leave to the professionals. ",
