            "answer_text": "Unfortunately the answer is yes! Be it a high school love story or a mature one, all end with tears. Would mention regarding LDR type of relationship only, cz know a bit about it. Thanks to hostel diaries. All love stories are peculiar with same storyline. Initially, things go well. There are lot of cute things people do when in relationship. From waking up to falling asleep, you share all happy/sad moments of the day with them. Love, love and only love is what you feel in this phase. So much attention both the parties receive from each other. Tag line for initial phase of relationship : Baby, I love you. My life isn't possible without you.In middle of the story, both know each other well and their living. Frequency of calls and texting reduce as no more topics are left to be discussed. Now quarreling starts and creates bitterness in minds. Still love is there to shield it. Tag line for middle phase : No need to tell you that I love you. You know it already.In last phase i.e. towards the end, none of them pay attention to what's wrong and what's right between them. The only thing one sticks to is proving himself / herself right. Quarreling is followed by not talking to each other for days. People feel there is no need to contact the other as it will only add up to the fight. Time travels and the cute love birds fly their own sky with a lot of memories and guilt in their minds. Tag line for last phase: We aren't made for each other. It was him/her who created this mess. I was always right on my part. He/she doesn't deserve me.Guys and girls, it's really fortunate to find your better half, who understands the inner you. Others just spend their life, finding their soulmate. ",
