            "answer_text": "As a distributor of eBooks, I can say with confidence that it can be quite profitable. It takes a lot of work, though. It doesn\u2019t typically happen with the first book. Most authors fail to make money on their eBooks for any number of reasons. If you are self publishing your eBooks, you need to have the mindset of an entrepreneur. You will invest money up front to get a professional product to market (your book) and build an audience for that book. You will spend more money than you make in the beginning. Your first few hundred sales will be your most difficult. You will make mistakes. If you are dedicated, you will learn from these mistakes and get better at both the craft and business side of publishing. If you don\u2019t want to do both, you\u2019re doomed. Profitability in eBooks also depends a lot on the type of book you\u2019re writing. Some genres are dominated by eBook sales. Other genres do better in print. Can you name 10 popular books in your genre (and subgenre)? If not, you need to do your research. I tell our authors to make a list of 10 popular books in their genre and study EVERYTHING about those books and authors \u2014 pricing, formats, titles, synopsis, marketing channels, metadata, genre, subgenres, categories, keywords. This is the type of market research entrepreneurial authors and publishers do all the time. It\u2019s a great way to learn about the marketplace for your book, so you can position it correctly and get it in front of the right reviewers and readers. If you\u2019re willing to write great books and commit to an entrepreneurial mindset, you\u2019ve got a great chance. So the real question is: is selling eBooks going to be profitable for you? Only you can answer that question. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on each author. Some have an e-book or electronic book available on Kindle Direct Publishing - making the electronic book available for download on Amazon.com. Typically you need an Amazon books account. Then in terms of accessing the account, you have to go to the Library. Then you can view the document or book in a computer-friendly http://format.In my case, I write a book or publish an e-book quite often. Sometimes I only make the book available on my website. Here is an example of where I am offering an e-book on Messaging for your business on my website only: H&T Design Media, social media & LMS e-learning. This is just an example, but I hope it helps answer your question. In this case, you can see that I have placed a PDF that they can grab and read through about how to send out a consistent message about your business or offering. My e-book is only .99 cents, but volume helps. Write your e-book once and you can sell it for years!! Some are free to grab attention. My average e-book is 30\u2013100 pages with the average being close to 30. It is not the length that is important, but the content value to the reader. I have sold through a publisher and self-published several softcover and e-books. By far, the downloadable e-books are still the most profitable. I have not made huge income, but it is great for paying bills. Feel free to check out my link above as an affordable example! I also give away several documents on my company website too. ",
