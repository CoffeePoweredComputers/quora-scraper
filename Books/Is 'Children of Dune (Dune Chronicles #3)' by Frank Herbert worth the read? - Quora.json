            "answer_text": "A few spoilers. All six of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune books are worth the read. In fact, you can think of them as one big 6-part book. The Children of Dune is required to understand Leto II\u2019s motivation for becoming the God Emperor in the next book. After the first four books, we learn how the Bene Gesserit are carrying out his Golden Path. At first, they think of him as the Tyrant because how he restricted everyone\u2019s freedom. But then, after the discovery of the Stolen Journals a few millenia after his death, they come to understand his actions were to prevent the extinction of humankind. And even though they still call him the Tyrant because of how he restricted the Bene Gesserit, took the power away and took over their breeding program, they avowed never to interfere with his Golden Path. This is especially important as humankind faces another threat. Centuries after the Famine Times and Scattering, Honored Matres come swarming back with the idea of conquest and to enslave everyone. The Bene Gesserit come to realize that these horrible women are fleeing an even worse entity, and we get a peek at them through Duncan Idaho, who is the only character to be in all six books. There is evidence that Frank Herbert intended to write a seventh Dune book, and his son Brian Herbert said he used his father\u2019s notes when writing his books. Brian\u2019s books should be read with a huge grain of salt. I have found his books to be poorly written and a betrayal of his father\u2019s work. In the first of his \u201cDune\u201d novels he portrays the Bene Gesserit who flee Chapterhouse to be amazingly stupid. Now, here is an order of women that has existed for millenia. To become a reverend mother, a Bene Gesserit must undergo the same test of humanity as Paul Atreides did. Those who survive the test become endowed with Other Memory and women of penetrating insight and knowledge. Yet, they make one dopey mistake after another on their No-ship. There is no way that Reverend Mothers would not control the situation and know every inch of their No-ship, and yet they inexplicably cannot control the ship and allow face dancers to infiltrate. That\u2019s just one of the mistakes, but it\u2019s a big one. I can\u2019t stand contrived idiocy, especially when it appears to stray from the original author\u2019s definitions and intent. Brian had the right to make a living off his father\u2019s work, but I wish he had treated it with more respect. ",
