            "answer_text": "Contrary to what most are stating in answer to this question: The obliteration of Terra would have zero impact on the Sol System! Ever wonder why all the NASA images of our solar system are CGI and cartoons? You are about to find out why. Former governmental insider William Tompkins, considered an expert on extraterrestrials, said before he died that Terra is in deep space, has been for thousands of years. He speculated that we might eventually get tugged by gravity into a nearby galaxy. The reason why Terra is in deep space is due to a nuclear war between Atala/Atlantis and the Anunnaki (Zetan-Reptilians) twelve thousand years ago. The latter won when they unleashed their far more powerful antimatter weapons. The resulting holocaust caused widespread earthquakes, The Great Flood that is documented in various ancient cultures, and hurled Terra out of the Sol System and into deep space. Tropical Atala became frozen Antarctica! Ancient cultures documented that we had a much warmer climate. This was due to the much larger sun created for us by The Intelligent Designer. To save the farm realm that they did not create, The Reticulan Empire constructed a sophisticated antimatter reactor, an artificial star, and a monitoring station (the moon); both hollow, both the same size (about 32 miles in diameter), and both inside the atmosphere.  High Altitude Flat Earth : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive The Reticulans/Zetans and their space empire fear The Intelligent Designer, who created our realm, eventually emerging (in the works). For even with their advanced machines they have absolutely no defense against advanced telekinesis. Paul Richard's answer to Are reptilians real? Paul Richard's answer to If God does exist, why doesn't God appear and seem to be silent to us? What does all this mean? ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIf the Earth was destroyed, like it was in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, what effect would it have on the solar system?\u201d We have this \u201chistorical record\u201d on the destruction of Earth by the Vogons:  It seems that the particular method employed by the Vogons simply made most of the mass of the Earth \u201cgo away\u201d with a small firework where the planet\u2019s core used to be. That seems to mean that there would be no bombardment of other planets by fragments of Earth, no ring around the Sun, just a little bit of cooling ash from the firework. What happens to the ash? We do not see the Moon destroyed- since it also orbits the Sun, it would likely continue to do so with the kinks in its orbit currently caused by Earth\u2019s presence smoothed into a nice circle. Oh, you didn\u2019t know the Moon orbits the Sun?  Image showing correct and incorrect illustrations of the Moon's orbit from Young's Manual on Astronomy [7]. Figure 66 in the image correctly represents the Moon's orbital path always concave toward the sun. Figure 67 incorrectly represents the Moon's orbit with a shorter period and always concave toward the Earth. Figure 68 incorrectly represents the Moon completing loops around the Earth. (researchgate) Since we know that the Vogons were conned into destroying Earth by a psychiatrist who feared his profession would be made obsolete if The Question were known, it stands to reason that he wouldn\u2019t bother specifying that the Moon be destroyed (since it wasn\u2019t part of the computer that was built to deduce The Question. Anyway, the firework ash remaining from Earth\u2019s destruction would quite naturally obey the laws of gravity and fall toward the nearest gravitating mass, the Moon. As for the rest of the Solar system, it was once thought that the Earth and Venus were in a sort of resonance in which Venus orbited the Sun 13 times for each 8 times Earth did. This is not quite true because the orbital periods of both planets aren\u2019t in perfect ratio. If they were, it would be possible that removing the Earth could destabilize the orbit of Venus. The Earth and mars are in a similar \u201cnear-resonance\u201d of almost 15:8 (15 Earth years per 8 Mars years. Hence removing Earth could destabilize Mars\u2019 orbit if Earth were removed if the orbits were in perfect ratio. But they aren\u2019t, so it won\u2019t. Orbital resonance - Wikipedia All the other bodies, with the exception of a few asteroids which cross the orbit of the Earth as they orbit the Sun, are always too far from Earth for its absence (or presence) to have sensible effect on them. There are a few asteroids in resonance with Earth and Venus, like 1685 Toro, that will have to find a new orbit with Earth removed. 1685 Toro - Wikipedia Other than that, removing the Earth will have no effect on the rest of the Solar system.
