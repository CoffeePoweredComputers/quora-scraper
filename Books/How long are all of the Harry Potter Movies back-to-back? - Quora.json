            "answer_text": "All together, back to back it's about 20 hours. So in real time, factoring in sleep & food breaks, it's about a 2 day marathon in a healthy normal way. If you want to power through it, without pausing to eat, bathroom breaks or to even so much as nap, it's basically 1 very long day. This also doesn't take into account that if you're watching them back to back (to back to back\u2026) you're probably not watching the credits, but you can flex that additional time for food & potty breaks. Of course this is assuming that the versions you are watching are the official theatrical releases released on DVD/BluRay and not extended versions. SOURCE: me, one who has done both options ",
