            "answer_text": "This is tricky but marketing mostly. What a lot of authors don\u2019t realize is marketing before your book is released is the best way to generate a buzz about your work. Also, you can submit your manuscript to certain websites so that people can download and review a proof copy of your novel so that you will get a genuine review of your book before its release. This makes for great publicity and boosts your overall professionalism as an author. Also, free book promotions, discounted signed copies and having your novel uploaded to IngramSpark increases the exposure of your book which makes it easier for your readers to find. There is a lot more to it then that, but that\u2019s it in a nutshell. You can learn more about IngramSpark and publishing / marketing your book below if you like.
