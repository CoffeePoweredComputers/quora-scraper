            "answer_text": "I was trawling through Ibsen stuff online and laughed long and hard about this one. One should note that this poem is not an Ibsen though. The date says it was published in 1945, and Henrik died in 1906 (you can't fool me, date!) Anyways: Babygulrot Liten Stygg Lever I gulrotens skygge Babygulrot. Whoever wrote this (not Henrik) probably wanted to address that people grow up in another's shadow. \u201cLever i gulrotens skygge\u201d (lives in the shadow of the carrot) shows that you will always be overshadowed by someone bigger. 'bigger' because the poet writes 'baby carrot' to juxtapose against \u201ccarrot\u201d. Babies grow up too, which is why I thought that this poem shows people growing up in shadow. I'm not sure about \u201cStygg\" (ugly), but my assumption is that this makes the baby carrot insignificant, and nothing compared to the bigger carrot. In short: the poem addresses the fact that you will always grow up in another's shadow. Being small, insignificant, and ugly. It would make more sense if Henrik (or even his son Sigurd) wrote this poem as it fits the lives they led VERY well, but they didn't. I still wonder who did. ",

            "answer_text": "When I think of Ibsen I tend to think of his play Peer Gynt play and, more particularly, the suite by Grieg that was inspired by it. Oddly enough, baby carrots are more often perfect, much simpler and cleaner than their more bulbous fully grown forms. Perhaps Ibsen is making a hint of youth, how young people grow up in the shadows of their parents and, despite being newly grown, he considers them ugly compared to their parents. The interesting thing here is the contrast. Being smooth and more perfect is less desirable in this poem than being knobbly and aged. There is a character in an older carrot that is missing in the young. Perhaps the baby carrot is the hint of something trollish and underground within us all. The parts that are hidden away and don\u2019t see the light of day. I\u2019m not a speaker of Norwegian, so anything I contribute is really just guesswork.
