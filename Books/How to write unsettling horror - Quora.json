            "answer_text": "Unsettling horror is based off an idea. Take \u201cthe music of Erich Zahn\u201d for instance. A quick summary: A poor college student in Paris starts renting a cheap room in an antiquated part of town. He discovers a strange, wholly unique music coming from the tenant above. This leads to a short friendship between the narrator and the German musician Erich Zahn where Zahn would play all these original pieces in front of a window that was always curtained. But none of them were the piece the narrator heard at night. He asks Zahn about it but he refuses to play that otherworldly piece. He even offers to pay for a better apartment for the narrator to get him further from that music. Later on, Zahn promises to write down his tale regarding that music, since his French isn't great. As he does so, both he and the narrator hear the otherworldly tune emanating from the window. Zahn immediately abandons his pen and paper and takes up his cello, furiously playing piece after piece, of those he's composed and even others\u2019 pieces. A wind flies into the room, sending the papers and curtains flying. The narrator looks out of the window and instead of a city scape, he sees a black void. As he flees the apartment, he touches the furiously playing Zahn\u2019s arm and feels the chill of a corpse. The narrator flees the building and even though he tries, he can't find his way back. So this is unsettling because it relies on the climax very little in terms of horror. It instead invites you to ask questions: \u201cwhat was Zahn\u2019s story?\u201d \u201cWhat was playing the music?\u201d \u201cIs Zahn dead?\u201d \u201cHas an entire neighborhood been wiped from existence or did it ever exist?\u201d The honest answer is that you don't and will never know. Any question you ask will be met with this answer. And as you ask more and more questions, the answer becomes more and more unsettling. So, let's make a quick list of ingredients: Mystery. The more you know about something, the less scary it becomes. There's a beautiful middle ground of information that makes things unsettling. Give enough info to make questions form, then make it impossible to get the answers.Uncertainty. The more potential horrors a question implies, the better.Groundedness. This may seem contradictory but keep your characters and most circumstances grounded. This makes it more believable that the reader could experience this themselves. Make a few of the issues something mundane like being unable to find a place you've been before.Use the written word. To achieve an unsettling feeling, you need to use concept horror. It's a motif describing the terror of an idea over the terror of an object. The best place to do this is the written word since that is where you have the most control over what not to show",

            "answer_text": "Horror is a function of our deepest darkest fears. The fear of the unknown, the fear of death, fear of pain, and the fear of the unexplained. Things that are unsettling to you are going to resonate with a great number of people, but not everyone finds the same thing unsettling. If there is a scene where something menacing runs behind the main character, then they are facing the fear of the unknown. \u201cWhat was it? Is it dangerous?\u201d In The Ring, they establish a very simple premise - watch the video and a short time later you will die. (Fear of death) If you have an evil Freddy Kruger-like character that is going to skewer on of the teenage characters there\u2019s the anticipation of pain\u2026 and the more sensitive the area, the more afraid we are of that pain, the greater the \u201cick\u201d factor. For example\u2026 If Freddy cuts his victim on the arm we may think \u201cOuch\u201d\u2026 but now, have the victim tied to a chair, their eye held helplessly open as one of Freddy\u2019s razor sharp talons approaches the eyeball\u2026 Anticipation, fear of pain, and the heightened \u201cick\u201d factor all go for giving us that squirm in our seats uneasy feeling. Beyond the creation of heightened fear what makes a story creepy and unsettling falls into purview of the writer\u2019s craft. The way the story unfolds, the stakes and what is at risk for the main characters, the tone of the story and so forth. All go into the mix of making a horror film that makes the audience uneasy while taking them on a memorable roller coaster ride. ",
