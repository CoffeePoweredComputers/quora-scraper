            "answer_text": " The best way to promote a book is to start before you finish the book. At least the very least, during the final editing process you will need to consider who exactly is this book aimed at? If you have done this, kudos! You are one of the select few in the self-publishing market that has done their homework. Promotion should be easy. If not, it is never too late to start asking these questions. The very next question you should ask yourself is who is already reaching my target readers? Make a list of outlets that cater to your target readers such as: PodcastsConferences or eventsBlogsYouTube channelsOnline news outletsInterview showsSocial media influencersYour next task is to build a relationship with the influencers who create content for these outlets, and provide their audience with a TON of value in a way that also promotes your book. The best way to do this is to follow them on social media and comment positively on their articles, videos, Instagram posts, etc. When people do this consistently with my content, of course I cannot help but notice them. Obviously, the longer you have established a relationship with journalists and influencers, the more likely they are to respond when you ask for the next step. However, I am guessing that you need this done quickly. In which case, move to step two: reach out by email to pitch an idea for content that relates to your book. Make sure your email pitch is short, and to the point. First, personalize your email with a quick insider compliment. This is something that you cannot just find out with a two second glance at their website. A little research goes a long way. Then, in one to two sentences, talk about your idea and why it will be beneficial to their audience. Next, talk about who you are and why you are an expert. Example: Let\u2019s say your book is about how to make money in real estate investing. Your email to the host of Epic Real Estate podcast will go something like this: Hi Matt, Congrats on your article in Forbes! My wife and I must have read it three times each. In episode 396 you mentioned you wanted to talk more about investing in rental property in Austin*. I happen to talk about my pitfalls with investing in the Austin real estate market in my newest book, Treasures of Austin. I have some pretty strong warnings for listeners like me who want to make the best decisions when it comes to how to invest wisely. Is there a time this week, say Thursday or Friday where we can chat and see if this is a good fit for your listeners? Cheers, Roland Faulks Real Estate Investing Coach Author of Treasures of Austin You can follow a similar format to ask to be a speaker at an event or to ask a writer to interview you for an article. Another quick and effective way to get in front of your target readers is to guest blog. Since you have already written a whole book, why not summarize one of its most interesting points in a blog post? Most online publications allow guest posts, because who does not want free, high quality content? That said, you will need to follow each outlet\u2019s specific guidelines for contributing. Most of these outlets have a link on their site called \u201cwrite for us\u201d or \u201ccontribute.\u201d It is often at the very bottom of the home page. One last thing: a short cut to bi-passing the whole pitching process is something called Help a Reporter Out (HARO). It is a newsletter whereby large outlets request experts for their stories. Check it out and sign-up as soon as you are done reading this post. That was a lot of information so here\u2019s a quick summary: Consider who your target readers areThink about who reaches those target readersPitch an idea for content relating to your book to these outlets and influencersGuest blog for outlets that reach your target readersSign-up for HAROAnd of course, do not forget to follow me on Quora. Now go forth and make that book a success! *Disclaimer: I have no idea if Matt brings up Austin real estate in episode 396, nor is there a book that I\u2019m aware of called Treasures of Austin. I am just using this as an example to demonstrate how pitching works. ",
