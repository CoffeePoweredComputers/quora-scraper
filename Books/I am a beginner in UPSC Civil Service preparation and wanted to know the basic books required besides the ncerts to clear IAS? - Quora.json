            "answer_text": "Well, considering the new pattern of CSE, the demand is not only about reading basic books and learning new concepts. Now everything is about learning new concepts and applying them at the same time through answer writing.You can get the required book list from any of the websites or from your friends. However, you should start doing 'smart-work' rather than just reading books. Few points: 1. Link to whatever you're reading/studying with the UPSC syllabus. Let's say, if you're reading any article about 'Smart City' then you should link that with the required syllabus. Your mind should work like 'Smart City' -> GS1 -> Urbanization. This way you can integrate your studies effectively. 2. Use internet websites like Insightsonindia, IASBABA, Vision IAS, Mrunal, Unacademy, etc. these websites provide quality content which will help you to understand the concepts well. 3. Don't just restrict yourself to reading books and newspapers. Start writing answers on InsightsonIndia. The moment you feel a little confident then join a decent test series. Testing yourself through 'test series' is indispensable these days. 4. Align your studies for both prelims and mains. Never prepare only for 'prelims' considering that you'll cover the required syllabus of 'mains' after clearing the prelims. 5. Have patience and enjoy this process. Stop talking to those who discourage you. It's all about perseverance. So, work hard and try to strengthen your strengths and weaken your weaknesses. Last but definitely not the least, remember the idea of 'Nishkama Karma' of Bhagwad Gita -Actions are our sphere, fruits are not our concern. All the best! ",

Vinayak Manoji's answer to How do I prepare for the civil service exam while working a 9am-7pm job? ) Some general instructions 1.\tGo through syllabus and get familiar with it. 2.\tList down the subjects like, history, geo, economy, polity etc 3.\tList down the books for each subjects. (keep book list as minimum as possible, don\u2019t read multiple  books for same source of information) I have seen many people will read multiple books to get wide information but as we are working we don\u2019t have that much flexibility. What we can do is read same book multiple times.  4.\tGo through previous year prelims/mains questions before starting any subject, extend it for all subjects. Here is my book list; I feel it\u2019s decent enough to have these books to get minimum information what UPSC expecting  1. History:   2.   Art & culture + Indian society     3.  Geography  4. Polity: Indian polity by Laxmikanth (single book is sufficient) 5. Constitution:    6. Economy   7. Environment   As of now i have these books, for IR and  Ethics i have to plan, i will share once i am done with these two parts.  ",
