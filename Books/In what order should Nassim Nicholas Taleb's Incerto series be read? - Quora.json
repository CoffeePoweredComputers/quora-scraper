            "answer_text": "Fooled by Randomness was the one I first read and it was before NNT becoming well-known. I've read all the others by the order that they released, yet I'd still call FbR the most entertaining and original work. The other works are an extention of the original idea, they delve deeper, they develop denser yet they revolve around the same basic concept: how to conduct oneself in case of incomplete or even outright misleading information. The Bed of Procrustes is not in the same series, it's more like a bonus that makes sense when one's already been exposed to uncertainty. To summarize, Fooled by Randomness is slightly raw, highly entertaining and it is struggling to get to a clear point about how to act \"rationally\" in light of uncertainty. Black Swan is the same book, only more cooked. If you like your steak medium, you wouldn't mind by you'd still prefer FbR. Antifragile is on the other hand a well-cooked and downbeat version of the series. There Taleb has already introduced the concept, has worked it up and now is viciously applying it to even graver practical problems. Lastly comes Skin in the Game which literally takes things up from the last chapter of Antifragile, yet this time it's now a pleasant rehash and a more liberate style tackling the same problem but in a few newer and entertaining ways. The book assumes you're already in the game and understand the concepts and it goes on to a wide diverse of topics and addresses lots of real existing people such as Steve Pinker or Hillary Clinton. You can sense a subtle inclination that Taleb has intentionally sacrificed literary for the sake of practicality, the book is entertaining sure, but the entertainment is not purely for amusement's sake but to ease the transition of \"modern naive mentality\" into a truer, rational one. If I wanted to pick my favorite it'd be Skin in the Game, as itnhas all the ingredients of the previous works but in a refreshing and bold fashion. ",

            "answer_text": "I read Antifragile first, followed by Black Swan, Bed of Procrustes and did not finish Fooled by Randomness. My advice about reading these books is to read each of them more than once except Fooled by Randomness. NNT has even said that BS is a re-write of FBR and that AF is a re-write of BS. It is true. AF by far has the most well-developed ideas and he is seemingly unconcerned about insulting everyone so it is my favorite. In BS, he focusses more on why Gaussian thinking is useless in most of the modern world (extremistan), which is a crucial concept that was not entirely clear to me the first time I read AF. Answer: Whatever order you read them in, make sure you read and understand Antifragile. ",
