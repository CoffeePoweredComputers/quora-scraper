            "answer_text": "Fans have been blowing out because of something the author wrote. Since it has been a while since I last read this, the recollection may not be correct but its vague innonation was that \u2018people like us\u2019 will only be able to feel/understand this book. Fans are feeling \u2018left out\u2019, and even \u2018downright insulted\u2019 and accuse Patrick Rothfuss of being \u2018inconsiderate\u2019. Some even left long comments about how this hurt them and how they will abandon the story (and the author) all together. In my opinion\u2026 they don't have a point. Don't listen to them. Listening to other people's opinions about certain things will just make you view something with biase. Those people will do what they want and read what they want but that is none of your business. The Slow Regard of Silent Things is a novel where the protagonist (Auri) doesn't talk. It is a process of how she survived down under the ground with her own set of friends and amusements. It is a very interesting novel that most readers of today's fiction will probably see as a clear stream or fresh breeze. This novel is lighthearted and very hopeful. It just strikes me as hopeful. It is also very interesting to know Auri\u2019s thoughts and her circumstances and how she deals with them. This novel is Very worth your time in my opinion. The sugary joyful outside and the melancholic sourness of the inside makes a splendid blend of realism, fantasism, and lovely innocence. ",
