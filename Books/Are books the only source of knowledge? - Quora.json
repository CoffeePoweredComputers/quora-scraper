            "answer_text": "Not at all. The internet can be just as useful. Same goes for TV documentaries. Only difference is, when reading a book, your brain is automatically concentrating. So most of what you read will be stuck in your mind. But if you read random facts on the internet, you will barely remember any of them the next day, because the facts weren't profoundly discussed, and the brain didn't have to switch the \u2018focus so you can understand\u2019 mode on, especially if you spend most of your time using the internet on social media. (Thats why some people have no problem reading 900 tweets in one hour, but will struggle to read a page of a book. the hard part is focusing = getting things stuck in your head, and not the actual reading ;) ) ",

            "answer_text": "No, there are also films, magazines, articles, videos, and actual classes. I also love learning by experience. Many of the skills I'm proud of\u2014for example, being able to milk a goat, assisting a chick hatching, juggling, and everything I do as a nurse assistant\u2014I would never have mastered if I'd just studied out of books. (If I could even find a book on milking goats.) But books are still my preferred source of information, and I instinctively turn to them when I'm curious about something. Books aren't the only source of knowledge, but they're one of the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Take a pair of nail clippers. Clip off a sliver of a fingernail. Go to a map. Find the nearest large university. Go there, and ask to see the academic dean. Tell the dean, you want to glean all there is to know, all the knowledge contained in, that sliver of fingernail. Say, never mind the cost, direct me to the departments where I can learn the methods and tools by which I can mine for myself this sliver of fingernail for all the knowledge, all the information, it holds. In the entirety of your remaining natural life, you would likely only barely begin to extract the knowledge, the information, contained in that sliver. And even if you could \u201cread\u201d that sliver so carefully and fully that you had gained vast sets of knowledge, you would, as you proceed, also have learned there is much that we cannot yet know about the sliver, and precisely how vast is the library that would document both what is known and unknown about that single tiny sliver, is one of the unknowns.
