            "answer_text": "I want to emphasise Julian Diamond\u2019s point that scholarship has moved on in the 200+ years since Gibbon wrote. Most importantly, Gibbon had no access to the wealth of archaeological information that is available today. He relied almost entirely on Roman historians (mediaeval and early modern historians for his treatment of the Holy Roman Empire and the later Eastern Empire), because that was what there was in his day. Gibbon is a wonderful writer, in my view the best writer of non-fiction prose in the history of English literature, but he shouldn\u2019t be relied on as a historian today. Come back to him when you\u2019ve done a bit of basic reading and luxuriate in his language and humour. That said, there are a lot of good recommendations here already. The Oxford History is a good place to start, though it is more or less a text book. Mary Beard\u2019s SPQR is a great, and I thoroughly recommend it, but it only goes up to 212 CE (Somebody else has written or is writing a book that picks up there and goes on to late antiquity, but I can\u2019t remember who). If \u201cThe Decline and Fall\u201d is the period that interests you, you need to know that there are nearly as many interpretations of what happened as there are historians. Tim O\u2019Neill recommends Bryan Ward-Perkins, which I have some reservations about because BW-P\u2019s agenda is to push back against recent work that emphasises continuity from the later Western Empire into the early middle ages, which is OK, but you need to be familiar with some of the stuff he\u2019s arguing against to understand and evaluate what he\u2019s doing. Also, he seems to me to walk back a lot of his argument in the last chapter, which left me feeling a bit dissatisfied. Other people who takes you might want to consider include: Chris Wickham- The Inheritance of Rome (the first half covers late antiquity) Peter Heather- The Fall of the Roman Empire Guy Halsall- Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West These guys are British. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of people working on the period in other countries, but can\u2019t offer names. Happy reading! ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of things that you should read before the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire but not primarily because it is over your head. Gibbon wrote more than two hundred years ago. What was believed about Rome then, is pretty different than where scholarship is today. There have been countless discoveries of new primary sources, archaeological sites, historical developments, and other important factors that would lead you to have a mistaken understanding if you just read Gibbon. You should ideally already have a good knowledge base before diving into him, ideally to the point where nothing you read seems really new to you and you can recognize the differences between how events are described today and how Gibbon described them.
