            "answer_text": "Spoilers for books and movies ahead Basically Teresa betrayed Thomas (and the others). In the books, after they all got out of the Maze, Teresa and Thomas\u2019s telepathy was suddenly \u201cswitched off\u201d which was suspicious in itself for some. Teresa wasn\u2019t with the boys in the Scorch, but Thomas and her did briefly meet up the day before they got to the \u201csafe haven\u201d which turned out to be where Teresa and Aris supposedly teamed up and betrayed Thomas\u2019s trust. I won\u2019t go into the details, but basically it was a mega shock for poor Thomas who had a really hard time sorting out his feelings towards Teresa (he still really liked her and wanted to trust her, but was very unsure if he could). In the end she saves him and kind of redeems herself, but personally I still think she wasn\u2019t a very good friend to the Gladers. Oh yeah, and she never had her memories erased so she lied the whole time. In the movies, it was a little different. Teresa arrived in the Glade and everyone was suspicious etc. just like in the books. However, the first inkling we get of her not being who she says she is comes at minute 26 of the Scorch Trials movie when Teresa is found in a hospital bed (separated from everyone else) with a lot of medical equipment around her so it\u2019s clear she\u2019s getting special treatment. Everything\u2019s fine while they\u2019re crossing the Scorch, but another suspicious moment comes at 1 hour 7 minutes, after Brenda shoots the man who was trying to hand them over to WICKED (or WCKD as they\u2019re called in the movies). While the boys follow Brenda out, Teresa is seen looking down at the man\u2019s dropped walkie-talkie, however the movie cuts to Jorge preparing his \u201cfavourite song\u201d before we see what happens. It\u2019s later revealed that Teresa picked up the walkie-talkie and used it to communicate with Janson as the group travelled to the Right Arm, where she gave WCKD the location and was subsequently responsible for the deaths of many of the Right Arm\u2019s people and Minho, Aris, and Sonya\u2019s (among others) capture. Like in the books, she saves Thomas at the end of the Death Cure so that\u2019s a point in her favour, but like I said before, she\u2019s still not exactly an A+ friend. ",

            "answer_text": "After acting generally suspicious in the second book (disappearing and reappearing, and disappearing again), Teresa appeared with group B, demanding the Gladers give them Thomas. They kidnaped him and planned to kill him, and Teresa had told them something terrible about Thomas that made them all hate him. When group B decided there must have been some mistake and decided not to kill him, Teresa and Aris came to take him to the execution site anyway. Teresa said some hurtful things and kissed Aris, pretending that she had liked him all along. They then shoved Thomas into a room where he thought he was going to die. He didn\u2019t die, and Teresa explained that she\u2019d had to make him think he was. She was sorry everything she\u2019d done, but Thomas didn\u2019t trust her after that. He forgave her after she sacrificed herself for him in the third book. ",
