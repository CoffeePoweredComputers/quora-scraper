            "answer_text": "It's really difficult to answer this question. Because it's true that Bangalore has given lot of things to outsiders as Mumbai has given lot of things to outsiders. If I say truth outsiders will see at it in the mean way. Most of the companies have come from outside. The employees 70 percent outsiders and 30 percent may be Karnataka people. Also one point to be noted that the top posts are in the hands of outsiders as most of the companies are from outside. That 30 percent of Karnataka people are in the middle and lower cadre posts. Another important point to be noted in Bangalore is that the outsider who is in top posts will appoint his own people from where he has come. There are some exceptions no doubt. This fact applies to Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi speaking North Indian people. But the same fact is not going to happen with Kannada speaking people. It's difficult to accept this but it's true in most of the cases. That's why local people feel very difficult to reach the top posts. This is one face of outsiders which is not acceptable. Another face is still worst. That's outsiders never want to respect local people and their culture. They are doing whatever they want at their whims and fancy which are not suitable for Bangalore in most of the cases. The outside people who have come to Bangalore for their livelihood and prosperity never want to learn Kannada and mingle with kannadigas. They make their own group of their state and language speaking people. Here also some exceptions are there no doubt. These outsiders speak their own language in Bangalore and Kannada people should learn their language to serwive. Another very important point is there that Kannada speaking people have no much regards to their mother tongue. When I went to Tamil Nadu whatever I ask they will answer in Tamil or in English if they are educated well. This will not happen in Bangalore. I have worked in many companies in Bangalore and seen this the owner is North Indian Hindi speaking person, his General Manager is again same, his departmental heads are also same and finally very few middle and lastly workers also 50 percent outsiders and 50 percent Karnataka people. I have to speak only Hindi in that company. There's no other way at all. Lastly the outsider enterprenier will get the work done and earn money and make lots of property will be happy and there's nothing to worry about what outsiders have given to Bangalore. No doubt exceptions are there. Some Outside enterpreniers are doing social services in Bangalore especially corporate companies. Because of their talents, currage and leadership qualities they have created organisations and given jobs and life to lakhs of people and because of that Bangalore contributing to Indian economy upto 20 percent.(approximately) Local Bangalorians are very very less in Bangalore now at present. So with all these factors you can guage what outsiders have given to Bangalore. For all these facts certainly there are exceptions. ",

            "answer_text": "I am amazed by the type of questions which are recently being posted. If you are looking at so much of a give and take it then the simple answer is Bangalore is Bangalore due to the people who are there. Every city , state or nation is what it is due to the citizens of the nation. A winning team is not due to the name of the team it's due to the work out in by the individuals. All the cities which have seen exponential growth over the past 2\u20133 decades have seen it due to the inflow of people. And cities which have wanted to grow have capitalized on this. Such questions also show how we don't see it to be a nation but all states and cities like mine and yours. Don't know how we will end up in a few years leave aside what wil be left for the next generation. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm.. where do we begin. This is applicable for entire India. Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, etc. Outsiders do these things: Pay Income Tax, no escape, TDSPay professional tax.Pay Road Tax when purchasing Vehicles.Pay GST on everything, including fuel.Pay Registration Tax 6.6% when purchasing property.Pay heavy rent, buy local farm products (Milk, Vegetables, etc)All these are what helps the poor natives, in terms of subsidy, farm loan waiver, etc. Booming economy generates money for the local government, who siphon it. Blame them, not outsiders. Most outsiders only go to their native only for max 1 month in a year (only 21 days leave in most companies). Availability of resources attract further investment. Many companies see that potential and further improve the condition. People sell off properties in their native and purchase in cities. So economy improves, benefitting natives. If natives condition is bad, blame the authorities, politicians elected by natives. ",

Everytime there is a political calamity Delhi has become home to the new migrants. Punjabis, Bengalis, Biharis, Tamils, Malayalis are all migrants here. Is this question even valid, because every next generation to a migrant is a native. Else, only people native to Bangalore are the army, retired officials and the British, or they dont even exist. Everyone else is a migrant, even if they arrived from Mangalore or Raichur. Just because someone speaks Kanadda doesnt mke him more rightful than one who speaks Tamil. Lets contribute to wherever we live, we dont own the place even if our ten generations lived there. We just rent it till we live ",
