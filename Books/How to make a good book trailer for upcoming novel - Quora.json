            "answer_text": "There are three templates you can use to create a book trailer regardless of your level of expertise when it comes to editing or video production. Try to keep your trailer\u2019s length to one to two minutes, keeping in mind that you risk losing your viewers\u2019 attention if you create anything longer. Also, longer book trailers can cost more time and money to create. Here are the 3 best types of book trailers: 1. Talking Head Videos Not a pro when it comes to videography? Fear not, there\u2019s always the talking head book trailer! Authors can speak directly into the camera as though they were having a one-on-one conversation with the viewer. These types of trailers are effective in that audiences love to actually see the author behind a book, particularly a self-help book, and tend to form an instant connection with them after watching them speak. Example: Job Escape Plan trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?  2. Presentation Videos Consider using a presentation tool such as Keynote or PowerPoint to showcase your book and what it\u2019s all about. Be sure to use engaging images and narrate the presentation with your own voice throughout, so as not to lose your viewer\u2019s interest. In order to create the video itself, you can record your screen using a screen capture tool. 3. Animated Videos Tell your book\u2019s story with the use of engaging animated graphics! Creating this type of book trailer will likely require the help of a professional video editor or motion graphic designer, although there are some funky free tools online that can create a video for you. These can be kind of silly, though, so be wary of of creating a video with stock animation and synthesized voiceovers. You may not have the effect you wanted! If you want to create a slick animated video, hire some experts. Our team at Happy Self Publishing specializes in this form of book trailers and can take care of everything from helping you record your voiceover narration to hiring external voiceover artists and putting together a complete attractive video. Examples: The Marriage Mantra trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?

            "answer_text": "I am a visual artist, and have designed book covers as well as created book trailers for promotional use for my current, and past clients. Most of the tips I am giving out come from my own experiences that worked for my customers. Some people might have different experiences, but these are strictly my own. It is not set in stone so please feel free to experiment with what works for you.  (The gif above is a sample trailer. You can click the link below this post to see the full version) The possibilities of crafting your book trailer to your liking is endless, but my biggest tip would be to keep it short, sweet, and to the point. People have really short attention spans so anything over 2 minutes may hurt your conversion rates. Lower conversion rates = loss in potential book sales!!! WE WANT SALES. If you can drive the main point of your story in 30 seconds without giving out the major plot twist or your entire story line then you have hit the sweet spot. Think of it as an enticing entree for your audience before serving their legendary meal (when they purchase your book of course!). Before you start I recommend getting to know other very successful book trailers, and reading the viewer\u2019s feedback (most trailers are on youtube due to it being such a large platform. The comments there are usually raw, and unfiltered so you really get to know the audience\u2019s take on it). This way you will get an idea of what your audience likes to see. Also play with your video editing software (imovie, movie maker, final cut, adobe premiere, avid, sony vegas, etc) until you feel comfortable enough to use it without feeling frustrated or confused. The more comfortable you are with your video editing software the quicker, and smoother the overall editing process will be. I posted an example book trailer at an author\u2019s forum as a tutorial for a question similar to yours, and had so much feedback that it turned into an entire blog post. I don\u2019t want this answer to turn into an epic so below is a more detailed version with more tips. You can find more details along with a sample book trailer I created here: TIPS | How to create, and edit a stunning book trailer I wish you much success! ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s what I made for 550AU. Considering i\u2019d never made any sort of video before and it cost me absolutely nothing, I think it turned out well. Way better than those cheesy slideshow types  Basically, I played around with iMovie (comes preinstalled on mac. Similar software is available for PC) until I felt comfortable with it. I ended up only using the intro part of the templet and the suggested music paired with it. The rest of the templet seemed too restrictive. Curating video and audio while avoiding copyright infringement is the hardest part. Luckily there are a few sites that let you download high quality video and audio with no strings attached. There are lots os sites offering creative commons (public domain free use) content, but you usually have to give attribution. In your trailer, that means listing every credit at the end like a movie casting scroll and listing them all in your video description on youtube (or, maybe more legally, tagging each clip with the appropriate credit (including links) \u2014 a challenge if you are only using a split second of their video). Purely for time-saving reasons, it\u2019s far better if you can just make a folder and go nuts downloading anything you think might end up being useful without having to worry about keeping notes on who to attribute or ask permission from. Here\u2019s the top totally free, no attribution required, sites I used for video: Free Stock Video Footage & Video ClipsFree stock videos \u00b7 Pexels VideosAlso sites like the Internet Archive and the Library of Congress have publicly available media, though quality varies. For photos: Beautiful Free Images & Pictures | Unsplash (no strings attached)Flickr has a huge library but you have to adjust the filters to find ones ok for commercial use, and even you need to cite the creative commons license. The photo quality is usually good, but not always great. And there\u2019s a lot of junk to sift through.NASA on The Commons is on Flickr but because it\u2019s NASA, no attribution is required. You can get NASA pics (and sometimes vids) by NASA from various other sources too. I do sci-fi, so this is great news for me. The European Space Agency also makes its media available for free is more strict about attribution.For converting formats (if needed) I used \u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc - Convertio It\u2019s Japanese but easy enough to figure out for other language-speakers. Tip: some sights (government ones like NASA for example) offer free use of videos but the newer ones only link to youtube so you can\u2019t download them. Just google \u201cyoutube to mp4\u201d for tons of free conversion sites, and copy/paste the video URL into. There are even more sites that do this for just the audio (youtube to mp3). Audio: ZapSplat - Download Free Sound Effects & Royalty Free Musicand many sights have sound effects and whatnot to download. iMovie has its own collection.Contact me if you\u2019d like more details on how I made it. Much appreciated if you\u2019d like and comment on the youtube vid (buying the book would be even better of course :-) ",

            "answer_text": "For any book in that case there are different parts that can be emphasized. Right from the introduction to a character to a serious event are the key factors that decide a person to read the book. These events can be picturized into different moments that will attract the viewer. You can make it even more personalized by adding the relevant images that will make the viewer get connected with the story itself. Spice it up by adding transitions between each slide. Now that we have the relevant images for each slide, we should add music/background tracks that would go along with the theme of the book. Step it up by making a 3D book mockup for your book by just uploading a cover picture on this website: 3D Book Mockup generator.In case you don\u2019t have cover for your book, you can easily create one using any paint or any other photo editing app.Once you got everything ready, create one on Animaker\u2019s web-based super simple drag & drop book trailer maker.

            "answer_text": "Here are a few things that will help: First, take the time to figure out exactly what you want to present and why -- make sure you know what you want the viewer to do when it is over. Go to your Amazon buy site? Go to your blog? Change their world view? Start with knowing this and the rest will be easier. Second, story board out your vision before you start. Again, make sure you know what you are doing before you start or you'll waste a lot of time later and your video will be confusing, either losing the viewer along the way or confusing them as to what you want them to do when it is over. Third, stay within your means. That is, don't try and do what you can't do. If your budget is $20, then stick within your budget. If you don't know how to shoot live action, then don't shoot live action. If you try to do something you can't, it will be obvious, and then you'll be in worse shape then having no video at all. Fourth, keep it to under 2 mins. Longer than that and people tune out.  Fifth, do all the things you need to do to optimize your video for the search engines. For instance, see this guide from Neal Patel: How to Increase Your YouTube Engagement by 374% Lastly, check out my book trailer and tell me what you think:   Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I can tell you how I made one. Firstly, I captured some significant and interesting moments of my novel, and made a text slide for each of them. Then, I selected and downloaded one image each for all of these moments. These images are available for free on the internet. I then inserted one corresponding image into each of these slides. You can include transitions and animations as you move from one slide to another. Make sure you write well on each slide and the quality of images you use is good enough and relevant to your story. Thereafter, I downloaded a suitable piece of music and inserted it as an audio clip. I constructed the trailer on Microsoft Power Point and during the last step, I converted it into a MP 4 video using the \u2018export\u2019 button. And the video was ready to be uploaded to YouTube. It certainly takes time before you arrive at a harmonious composition of text, images and sound but then, when it\u2019s all over, you can sit back, relax and admire your own creation! Here is the Book Trailer of my first novel Babysitter for your reference.  ",
