            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. I need to read up more on spy fiction; so far, I\u2019ve only read stuff from Tom Clancy and Ian Fleming (James Bond). But the only spy fiction that I\u2019m more interested in is the thinking man or character-driven stories like John le Carre in his books, even Clancy does the same with Jack Ryan. Spy fiction is full of characters that use their intelligence more so than their hand-to-hand combat. In real life, spies aren\u2019t known for being badass assassins like Bourne. However, spies do think like Bourne in that they\u2019re always trying to be 10 steps ahead of their enemy. The only character that I can think of that is similar to Jason Bourne in fiction is Lee Child\u2019s Jack Reacher. He is a military police investigator, but he knows several martial arts and his personality is no nonsense like Bourne. ",
