            "answer_text": "I read The Malefactors not too long ago by a writer named Caroline Gordon. It seems like some of her works are still being put out by FSG (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux) but this one was not. She was the wife of Allen Tate, the mentor of Flannery O\u2019 Connor, and played the part of hostess to a good many other writers of her time. The Malefactors is something of a Roman a Clef, something like an almost auto-biographical fiction piece\u2014think Sal Paradise as actually being Jack Kerouac in On the Road, and you have a pretty good idea of what a Roman a Clef is. The book follows Tom Claiborne, an ex-patriate, who breeds cattle with his wife Vera. He is a wealthy writer who hasn\u2019t picked up the pen in a while and has become rather dissatisfied with his life. I think in that sense, it could be compared to Tender is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald, but I liked it quite a bit more. The whole piece mostly concerns the whole group of them, the ex-patriates, but the drama of it centers on Vera, having become obnoxious to Tom, everything from her newfound fascination with breeding cattle to her French accent. He takes interest in a girl who is looking to enter into the business of translating Latin, and Tom, being classically trained, finds himself able to lead her into it. The new relationship with this girl brings clarity to the old one and what results is breathtaking. I found out about this book through mention of it in Flannery O\u2019 Connor letters. I loved O\u2019 Connor\u2019s writings\u2014the whole MFA community has somewhat deified her\u2014so I wanted to know more about the people that were around her. This is probably the best way to find good \u201cout-of-print\u201d books. When you start looking at the books that great authors recommend, you\u2019ll find gems like this that were either overlooked or didn't take off for some reason\u2014one of Caroline\u2019s novels was about the American Civil war, and it was published around the same time as Gone With The Wind. Imagine publishing a book about a high school of wizards at the same time that Harry Potter. What terrible luck! Thanks for the question! Daniel J. Dupuy +JMJ+ ",

            "answer_text": "The best out-of-print book I ever read was The Travels Of Jaimie McPheeters by Robert Lewis Taylor. While it is currently back in print, the cover price is outlandishly high in my opinion: $24.95 for a paperback. This wonderful picaresque novel won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1959, and was based on a real set of journals written by a young man traveling across country with his family to the gold field of California in the 1800\u2019s. The journals (which I wish would be published) were so detailed and vivid that it didn\u2019t take much work for a talented author like Taylor to transform them into this riveting novel. How anyone let this prize of a book go out of print in the first place, is beyond me. However, if you find a used copy ( like I did for a second time recently for a measly $3.00), grab it up, read it through and treasure it for the rest of your life. Like I have. ",
