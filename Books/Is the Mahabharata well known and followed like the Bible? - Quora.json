            "answer_text": "Early on, we learn it to be one of the two greatest epics ever written in this part of the world and arguably world-wide to date. It is not used as a moralistic guide to conduct ourselves in life, although there are life lessons that anyone could derive from, still very subjective. It is not considered as an absolute truth that needs to be upheld. Unlike the Bible, there are no commandments. It there are any\u2026 there are well over 10,\u2026 in the thousands?\u2026 and probably might even end up contradicting with each other. There is no Vatican or a pope in the Hindu world, things are very autonomous and decentralised. There is no one absolute authority upholding the sanctity of the epic. So no power rests with only a few people. Mahabharata was written 900-400 BCE. The Gods came into being from the Vedic scripture which dates back to 1500-1000BCE, essentially they are Vedic expressions, which took humanistic god form in order for the lay person to get a taste of these expressions. Growing up in India, the culture is entrenched with customs, rituals, festivals, based on the story lines from the two epics, that majority of us know the most popular stories from the two epics without having to read the actual or a version of the book (I haven\u2019t). Of course humans being humans, in most cases, the Vedic wisdom, such as Advita is not brought forth to commoners in a day to day life, instead for better or worse the Hindu world is riddled with superstition and rituals - O! and tasty food during festivals.
