            "answer_text": "No. In twin studies, it's important to know if twins are identical or not.  So first, you ask the parents, and then you do a DNA test of some sort.It turns out to be very rare for non-identical twins to be mistaken for identical twins, but quite common for identical twins to be mistaken for fraternal twins. This is why the term 'identical' twins isn't very good. If you can tell them apart, they're not literally identical. The preferred word is monozygotic, versus dizygotic.  When our twins were babies, people would ask \"Are they identical?\", I'd say yes, and they'd say \"But I can tell them apart!\" I'd say they're not identical, they're monozygotic.  They'd ask what that meant.  I'd sigh. However, this turns out to be very useful.  Twin studies tell us something about the relative influence of environmental and genetic effects. Twins share all of their environment. Dizygotic (DZ) twins share half their genes, monozygotic (MZ) twins share all their genes, so you can work out the relative contribution of these two things.  It could be argued that MZ twins share more environment than DZ twins - because they look the same and may be treated the same, they are dressed the same, and so on.  But because this mistake (that MZ twins are DZ) is made, we have a natural experiment - we can see if MZ twins who are believed to be MZ end up being more similar to one another than MZ twins who are believed to be DZ, and it turns out that they end up equally similar to one another, regardless of what people believed.   This solves one practical problem - should you dress your twins alike? Some people think you shouldn't, because it makes them too similar.  But they look so cute when they are dressed alike.  The answer is that it doesn't seem to have any effect. [This seems like as good a time as any for a photo, in a pathetic attempt to get some more upvotes.]    Monozygotic twins come in two types, depending on when the fertilized egg splits.  If the fertilized egg splits early, before implantation, then two placentas form, and the twins are dichorionic.  If they fertilized egg splits later, then they share a placenta, and the twins are monochorionic.  Fraternal twins are always dichorionic. We knew that our twins were identical, because the ultrasound scan showed that they were monochorionic. If twins are monochorionic, they are at risk of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), and so had to be monitored closely - hence my wife had an ultrasound scan every two weeks, for several months.  We got to know the people at the hospital quite well ",

            "answer_text": "Q. If I can clearly tell twins apart, does it mean they are not identical? -The identical twins will have similar physical structures according to same genes. But they will have different characters, personalities, intelligence and thinking processes because those traits are not determined by genes. So, that someone can tell twins apart (by so-called internal characters) does not mean they are not identical. -One can observe whether above behaviors are genetic or not by studying identical twins. If those behaviors are genetic, identical twins will have same behaviors. If not, one will find different behaviors in identical twins. Actually, some behaviors can be observed since very young. If one observes very different behaviors within the same identical pair, personality traits are not genetic although they are present since very young. Some people explain the reason of different behaviors within same identical twins pair by interaction with environment after birth by those twins. But the explanation is not satisfactory enough. -In present day science of genetics and evolution concept, it cannot explain how the identical twins have different personalities, different I.Qs, different characters, different interests, and etc. One will see a lot of explanations with different mechanisms. But those different mechanisms can't explain the initial differences during the first 3- 5 years of ages. Genetics can only give identical external physical appearances. Genetics cannot determine so called internal characters. Those internal characters are determined (inherited) by different unique soul or spirit. -Although science cannot explain the cause of differences in internal characters between identical twins, extreme differences between children and their parents (i.e. very, very far from the tree), those differences can be explained by rebirth concept. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, although the identical twins have identical physical appearances due to identical genes, each has different intelligence (I.Q), personality, character according to actions and habits, etc. from previous individual's lifetime. So one will see different personality, character, intelligence and talent in identical twins. It must be miracle to see those identical twins have same or identical so-called internal characters between them because they have different souls. But science will not accept that kind of answer because science has no concept of soul and science denies concept of rebirth. -And those extreme differences will be more and more common in society like USA because USA is the land of immigrants and rebirths may (or may not) occur in family of different cultures, different concepts, different values, etc, because one cannot select to rebirth in family with same culture, race with previous one.
