            "answer_text": "There are always exceptions, but speaking very generally, if at 20 years old you are just now learning multiplication and basic division, I don't think that you have a very likely future as a scientist. Most research scientists go from undergraduate university into a graduate program (often a PhD program).  There are admission requirements, and beyond that, one needs to find an advisor who will agree to work with you and oversee your research.  Part of the admissions requirement is usually a decent score on the GRE test, and for scientific fields, particularly the math portion of the test. Now, to be honest, I'm a research scientist with a PhD, and have very little use for precisely memorized multiplication tables, etc.  What I do have, and what I *need*, is to be completely comfortable with numbers, to be able to do basic arithmetic to calculate a percent, or integrate the area under a plot by eye (approximately of course), to see if numbers in a table (approximately) add up.  All that is needed for first-level checks of whether results are reasonable, and discussing things with colleagues. So, I think that the question is, just how much of basic math are you brushing up on?  Is it your goal to be able to answer without a calculator what is 63*72, that kind of thing?  Because that's not at all important for being a scientist.  Or, when someone tells you, \"I have 517 test subjects, and applied treatment X to 1/4 of them,\" do you not realize that this means approximately 125 test subjects?  If that's the case, it's a serious roadblock. Finally, this is a little field-specific, but in my case there are all kinds of conceptual things I use often in my work, from statistics and linear algebra.  Those things are mathematical, but they aren't arithmetic, they aren't 13 + 7 = 20.  But to learn them it was a very long process, and basic school-level math was the foundation of it. ",
