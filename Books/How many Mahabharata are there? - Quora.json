            "answer_text": "Imagine yourself standing in a room, talking to a friend. Now imagine a spider on the wall staring at both of you. Do you see what the spider sees? No Time, is linear to the human eyes i.e. it has a beginning and an end never to return again, but for some higher force in another dimension, in a broader context, time is circular. Everything is happening all at once in an endless cycle of creation, preservation and destruction. There are multiple copies of the universe, earth and YOU, all working differently, vibrating at their own frequencies, to fulfill a purpose with different choices, culminating in different results each time. To us, the Mahabharata has happened only once as we know and believe. But the same is not true to the spider on the wall, the great sage \u2018Kakabhusundi' who had the boon to go beyond time. Yes, the legend of Kakabhusundi is the biggest proof that ancient Indians did know about the concept of \u2018Parallel Universes' much before it was theorised in recent times. Legend says he had witnessed the Mahabharata, sixteen times, with different results, pertaining to different choices made by the warriors, while playing out their characters, on the Broadways of their respective lives. In one the Kauravas might have won the war. In another, Abhimanyu might not have chosen to tackle the chakravyuh all alone but wait for reinforcements and lived. Kakabhusundi had only seen 16 of the infinite number of times, the Mahabharata could have been played out. ",
