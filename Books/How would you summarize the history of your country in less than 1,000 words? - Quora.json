            "answer_text": "The Netherlands Up until 5000 BC there were only these guys, the Neanderthals.  They didn\u2019t do that much just some hunting and gathering and trying to survive the tundra climate of the ice age. Next in line were the Farmers who set the agricultural revolution in motion.  These farmers were a weird bunch who adored some special gods and created special structures called \u201cHunebedden\u201d.  They were probably used as tombs for the group of people who lived there although no one is certain. The Bronze Age(around 2000\u2013800 BC) followed and we made some tools but did nothing really spectacular. In the Iron Age we were joined by multiple Scandinavian tribes for the climate up in the north was getting unbearable. This is the reason why we have so much cultural heritage in common with our northern neighbors. In the Roman era (57 BC \u2013 410 AD) the Romans tried conquer our little country, succeeded up until the Rhine where we gave them a good ass-whooping and it remained the northern frontier for Rome for the rest of its days. To the south of the Rhine the Romans settled in quite nicely up until 69 AD when the Batavians revolted. They were demolished by Rome within a year. The middle ages followed and just as in the rest of Europe nothing really happened. We were conquered, we reconquered. We developted a new language, we changed it. We were raided by the vikings, well there wasn\u2019t really anything we could do about that one.  Up until this point there still wasn\u2019t 1 Dutch identity but different groups who were ruled by different people who held different beliefs. This changed around 1433 when the Duke of Burgundy unified most of what is now Belgium and The Netherlands together. The Frisians (up in the north) did not like this at all and rebelled although they were successful they could not keep up the rebellion. It was however a prelude to the fact that we were not going to give up our country so easily. As the Protestant Reformation quickly gained ground in Europe, many people in the Netherlands also found themselves part of this new religion. The king of Spain, a Catholic, was very displeased and sent an army to deal with the problem. Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba was sent and he did not encounter much resistance. Except from one man: William I, Prince of Orange.  He fled to Germany to fight the Spanish army from there. This lead to 80 years of war which lead to the independence of the Netherlands and made him a national treasure. With the Spanish gone we could focus on trade once more which lead to the most prosperous area of our history: The Golden Age(17th century). Many famous painters such as Rembrandt and Vermeer delivered many paintings in this period.   We had two major companies which caused this unseen wealth these were the VOC and the WIC which held a monopoly position over the trade with the Asia continent. Especially the spices made us very rich and Amsterdam became the trade center of Europe. As the Golden Age was coming to an end many wars were fought with the English known as the Anglo-Dutch War which was a bloody mess. In 1839 Belgium separated from the Netherlands and the Netherlands was truly on its own. The period of industrialization followed and the Netherlands followed the rest of Europe, the number of farmers decreased, cities grew and air became polluted. The first World War (1914\u20131918) came rolling around we remained neutral and did not really play a major part in the war. We tried to do the same in the second World War but Hitler was having none of it. Dutch Jews suffered heavily under the Nazi regime and many were killed in concentration camps. Among them Anne Frank who wrote in her diary about her life hiding from the Germans.  A few years after the second World War we were hit with another disaster, namely the flooding of our dikes. Thousands were killed and we decided we would never let this happen again. This lead to the construction of the Delta Works which will keep the water out of our little country.  In the following years decolonization followed which left the remaining strongholds of the Netherlands to fend for themselves. The more recent history is not very exciting and closely resembles those of our European neighbors. I hope you enjoyed reading this answer. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Brazil: a Song of Sugarcane and Coffee Before 1500, there were many, many Indian tribes around here. I present you one of them: the tupi-guarani:  In 1500, some folks arrived from Portugal, led by Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral.  Here, they found Brazilwood (huh), a tree you could get red dye from. Red was a noble color in Europe. Expensive. So they started trading with the Indians. By trading I mean giving them mirros, spoons and other not-so-essential objects in exchange for labor, extracting the red dye and giving it to the Portuguese. We would call that escambo. But nobody really cared about us. Until everybody in Europe wanted a piece of America. Then, in order to secure their land, the Portuguese founded the village of S\u00e3o Vicente, starting the colonization of what was called Land of Santa Cruz. The king of Portugal renamed the territory to \u201cBrasil\u201d and divided it into capitancies, lending them to Portuguese noblemen, who would serve as administrators. It was a complete failure, and eventually a \u201cGeneral Governor\u201d was appointed to our little land. When Brazilwood got old-fashioned, sugarcane became the new economic flagship. Everyone was planting it, selling it, and buying it. So, the Portuguese began to enslave African people and bring them to Brazil to work in the sugarcane farms, the engenhos. This will be a major problem in a couple hundred years.  Around 1580, after some family issues, Portugal and Spain became one single kingdom, the Iberian Union. Because of that, Brazil was a part of \u201cSpain\u201d and hence, enemy of Spain\u2019s enemies. Then we were invaded by the Dutch. Yeah. They set up their own colony in the north territory and called it Dutch Brazil, or New Holland. They ruled it between 1630 and 1654, 14 years after Portugal returned to be an independent kingdom. We got attacked by the French, too, but they weren\u2019t as successful as the Dutch. We also started expanding our territory to the west, through expeditions known as bandeiras. Just as sugarcane became mainstream, we found gold. Lots of gold. So much, in fact, that Portugal grabbed most part of it through taxes. People were pissed. So pissed that they started rebelling. There was even an Assassin\u2019s-Creed-able conspiracy in the Minas Gerais state to make it independent, Inconfid\u00eancia Mineira, which would eventually fail. Hey, Ubisoft, this SCREAMS \u201cassassin/templar conflict\u201d.  In 1807, Napoleonic Wars were running loose, and the Portuguese Royal Family had to escape Europe. They came to Brazil. As a result, the former colony was transformed to the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Yep, we once were another UK. The terrirory also received many infrastructural improvements A few years later, the king, Jo\u00e3o VI (or John VI), had to return to Portugal, and left his son, Pedro, as a regent of Brazil. The Portuguese wanted Brazil to become a colony again, but everyone was just sick of Portugal. Then, in September 7th, 1822, Pedro declared independence. A few days later, he is Dom Pedro I, first emperor of Brazil.  We\u2019re independent now, great huh? Well\u2026 Dom Pedro didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, and he was a little, uhh, incompetent. Finally, in 1831, he abdicated and went back to Europe, leaving his creatively-named son, Pedro, to rule Brazil. But his son was five. Five. This resulted in 9 years of unstable, rebellion-filled regency. Brazil was breaking apart, she would become many small republics. However, Pedro was prematurely proclaimed Emperor in 1840, when he was fourteen years old.  Voil\u00e0, Dom Pedro II. Pedro was a way better ruler than his father, sometimes considered one of the best governors Brazil has ever had. Many present-day monarchists use him as an example of \u201cgreatness\u201d. Oh, I forgot to mention, the gold was pretty much over, and the sugarcane had long been out-of-date. What was really in at the time was coffee. Around 1860, England was in the prime of industrial revolution. And she wanted consumer markets. And we (still) had slavery. Slaves don\u2019t buy anything. Hence began the English pressure for the Brazillian abolition of slavery. Many laws and demands went by, until Pedro\u2019s daughter, Isabel, in 1888, signed the Lei \u00c1urea, which finally abolished slavery in Brazil. But people, farmers and slave owners, were pissed. Again. A while later, in 1889, a military coup-d\u2019etat overthrew the monarchy and established the republic, which, for the first 8 years, was more like a military dictatorship.  Marshall Deodoro da Fonseca, first President of Brazil (By the way, the period between 1889 and 1930 is called \u201cOld Republic\u201d. And you thought Star Wars made that up) The following 30 years would be pretty boring, until Get\u00falio Vargas, in 1930, seized power (he wasn\u2019t elected) and started the Vargas Era, which lasted for 15 years. Yes, the same guy ruled Brazil for 15 years. You can call him the Brazillian Mussolini, or Franco, or Salazar, or even Vader. Up to you.  Vargas and Franklin Roosevelt. Okay, it\u2019s now 1945, Vargas has been peacefully removed from power, President Dutra assumes the presidency. Democracy has been restored. 5 years later, we finally have elections again. Do you know who won? You probably do. Get\u00falio Vargas, with an astounding advantage. Brazillians sure never give up. But this time he didn\u2019t last. By the end of his term, in 1954, amidst accusations of corruption, Get\u00falio shoots himself, at the heart, finally \u201cleaving life, to enter History\u201d. That was in his final letter. Great, now democracy must prevail, right? Wrong. Only two elections later, an alleged threat of a \u201ccommunist coup\u201d results in another coup-d\u2019etat. A military one. Thus, between 1964 and 1985, we had a violent, repressive military dictatorship, like many other South American countries also had.  Tanks in the capital, Bras\u00edlia After 1985, democracy settled in once again, in the so-called \u201cNew Republic\u201d (I hope there\u2019s no Brazillian First Order). I can\u2019t say much about the New Republic, as it\u2019s still going on, and I have only 3 words left. Hope you enjoyed.
