            "answer_text": "Be The Drug That They NEED - Different people bring out different emotional experiences within us. Some people are incredibly effective at making us feel amazing. This doesn\u2019t mean buy this person gifts, this means learn how to be a fun sexually confident force in their lives. You do this by understanding how to make people feel emotions by modulating your voice to make them laugh, sensually touching them during conversation and understanding what emotional experience they want to feel within that context. Here is a video I made on how to become the drug that people need in life. 2. Letting Them Invest in You - In love you have to let people invest in you as a person. This means letting them do nice things for you, letting them go out of their way from you, letting them show you that you are important. We as human\u2019s need to invest ourselves in people in order to love them. It\u2019s weird, we tend to care about the people we do things for more than the people who do things for us. Scientist think it\u2019s because we have to rationalize why we are going out of our way for that person. 3. Get into Fights Sometimes - Love isn\u2019t just thinking fondly of someone, it\u2019s feeling strongly for someone, and in order to feel strongly for someone you have to feel a spectrum of emotions. That includes negative emotions. Also, fighting with someone is a sign that you care about your relationship and that\u2019s why their actions bother you. It\u2019s also a sign that you trust the strength of the relationship enough to withstand a full blown argument, that trust helps build love. 4. Be Hot - Look I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush, it\u2019s easier to love hot people. This for a myriad of reasons, one those reasons being status, the others being biological, and lastly, we take in a lot of information about the world through our eyes. Just work out, get a nice body, keep your fashion on point, and look like someone your partner wants to brag to her friends about being with. 5. Cuddle, Pillow Talk, and other Soft Stuff - I never feel more like I love a girl than a post sex cuddle, where she\u2019s running her fingers through my hair, I\u2019m caressing her body, and we\u2019re talking about our dreams one second and an embarrassing moment the next. We put a lot of emphasis on sex when it comes to love, but I think the post sex bliss is just as important. I wrote a book called \u201cThe Power Bible\u201d click this link to find out more! ",

            "answer_text": "This is one of the most important questions when it comes to romantic relationships. A great number of studies that have been conducted prove that we really can control love. Because in general, this is just a basic psychological emotion like fear, joy, pity, and other emotions that can be regulated if they are monitored well. So, how do we use psychology and psychological tricks to learn to make others fall in love with us? The most important thing you need to understand is that the other person must at least have minimal feelings for you. Then, you will be able to turn these into real, deep feelings, easily and quickly 1. Don\u2019t get ice cream on the first date.  Social psychologist John Bargh who works at Yale University studies the role of unconscious processing on social behavior. Some of his studies found an interesting connection between the body temperature of a person and their psychological state. It turned out that when we are physically warm, we are more likely to be nice and friendly to other people. This trick may really come in handy, for example, during a first date when it\u2019s especially important to gain the person\u2019s trust. So remember this and make sure that in the future you choose only warm places, foods, and drinks so that every meeting you have (both romantic and business-related) goes well. 2. The advantages of extended eye contact  Harvard psychologist Zick Rubin conducted a study to try to understand if it\u2019s possible to measure love. He found the answer in the eyes, or more specifically, in the frequency and duration that people look at each other. He found that that couples who are deeply in love look at each other 75% of the time during a conversation and that they stop looking at each other reluctantly. In a normal conversation, people look at each other from 30% to 60% of the time. However, looking into someone\u2019s eyes may not only be a consequence of being in love but it could be the reason. When you look at someone for a long time and you do it frequently, you trick the person\u2019s mind because it remembers what the \u201clove look\u201d is. So, it starts thinking romantically about you. The nervous system starts producing phenethylamine which causes the sensations that we have when we fall in love: \u201cbutterflies in the stomach,\u201d an increased heart rate, warm palms. How could anyone resist? 3. Tell them something awkward about yourself.  It\u2019s obvious that an open and a communicative person has more chances to be liked. So there is nothing surprising about the fact that if you fearlessly share facts about yourself and your life, you make other people like you. According to a study conducted by the scientists from Harvard Business School, 79% of subjects preferred to be open and sincere people during first dates. They didn\u2019t hide anything, even when it came to weird habits, tastes, awkward situations that happened to them, and even negative character traits. Because it works just like secrets: when we tell someone a secret, there is a special connection between us and the person based on trust and understanding. 4. Don\u2019t do anything. Just let them do something for you.  When we do a good thing or help someone, we feel good. We are happy with ourselves and have very warm emotions for the person we helped. When we justify our effort, we idealize the person we were so generous to and convince ourselves that they deserve this treatment. As a result, we have an emotional anchor and start liking the person even more. On the other hand, when someone does something for us, we like it too. But it\u2019s about different emotions and not all of them are very positive. We mostly feel as if we owe to the person and we need to pay them back. Things are even harder when this is someone we don\u2019t really like. So, we should keep this physcological effect in mind. 5. Make up a secret language just for the 2 of you.  This is about inside jokes, special words, and unique gestures that happen between people when they find common ground and become truly close. Maybe you like the same movie, comedy show, song, book, or even meme. And maybe the joke appeared spontaneously during your first date, a walk together, or a meeting. Don\u2019t ignore these little things. When you find and use this phrase in your everyday communication, you will take your relationship to whole new level. The relationship will become even stronger and more intimate. The scientists from Texas University came to this conclusion in their study. We all want to be special and unique, and this secret language helps us feel that we understand each other better than anyone else. 6. The size of the pupils matter.  n a study from the 60s and 70s, scientists researched the connection between the size of the pupil and the attractiveness of a person. They showed men 2 photos of the same woman. The photos were identical except for one little detail \u2014 in one of the photos, the pupils of the lady were bigger. As a result, the men liked the edited photo more even though nobody noticed the difference in eyes. There is a way to use this effect to your advantage. Of course, you can\u2019t change the size of your pupil on purpose, but you can make the conditions right, for example, dim the light. Use candles instead of regular lights. Or plan to go to a restaurant that is famous for its relaxing atmosphere. 7. Be near them often... But then, make them miss you.  In our dreams, we can all find someone we like, tell them about our feelings, and live together happily ever after. In the real world, things are not that easy, that\u2019s why people need to come up with special tactics. Of course, it\u2019s important to spend more time together when the feeling is mutual. In order to know each other better, to break the ice and build a connection, you need to spend some time together. But after several dates, psychologists recommend to take a break (even if you don\u2019t want to) to make a deficit of your presence in the other person\u2019s life. This move achieves several things: You won\u2019t get tired of each other (over time, feelings stop being so new, and in order to keep them alive, you need to play hard-to-get);The person gets the chance to understand how nice and important this relationship has become for them (limited and rare things are always more desired);You can take control of your own emotions and think clearly.8. Make a positive association  You can program someone else\u2019s brain by repeating the same thoughts over and over again. This is why it\u2019s so important to carefully choose words when communicating with people who are very important to us. You can use this principle to improve your image. The better you present yourself, the more positive thoughts you will leave in a person\u2019s mind even when you are not around. And it doesn\u2019t really matter if you are really so positive (everyone has their flaws). The only thing that matters here is how you are perceived and how you want to be perceived. Then again after all these they may still not like you,cause its all about personal choice,just believe that you\u2019ll get someone and don\u2019t give up. ",

            "answer_text": "If you wait the other person you admire will fall in naturally with you then you should be hero of a movie, else you will be waiting forever. if you feel you have already fallen in love with someone on their first look or few meetups then You need to impress the other person to fall in love with you. Because at the end of the day, all we care about is looks, no one falls in love with your personality at your first look neither it going happen by chance luckily. You see, love is no different to other psychological emotions that you might experience on a day-to-day basis such as: Jealousy, fear, anger, anxiety. As these above emotions can be controlled, and as love falls under the category of \u201cpsychological emotions,\u201d  it can also be controlled. Controlling love as an emotion is just as easy as controlling fear, excitement or stress etc.  The problem lies in what we have been taught to believe. Over the years, we\u2019ve been conditioned to believe that love is something that \u201cjust happens.\u201d It all depends on \u201cfate.\u201d The reality however is far different. With the right knowledge, you can use the psychology of love to make him or her fall in love with you.  Now, nothing\u2019s perfect, which means this won\u2019t work 100% all the time, but you\u2019ll improve your chances dramatically. If you could triple your chances at making someone genuinely fall in love with you, why wouldn\u2019t you try?  1. Psychologically aspect.  Before even thinking about going down the road of learning how to make a person fall madly in love with you, you need to take a look at the psychological aspect of it, and no, it has nothing to do with magic potions and midnight under the moon chanting sessions. Without even realising it, you and everyone else you know has a checklist stored in the back of your mind. On this list there\u2019s a set criteria, a criteria that your potential love interest must meet before you will be able to fall in love with them. Psychologists call this list a \u2018Lovemap.\u2019 If someone doesn\u2019t match one or more of the points in this list, they\u2019re automatically disqualified as a potential love partner and they\u2019re likely to just remain your friend, this is why you might fall in love with one person while others will just be your \u201cfriends.\u201d Of course each person\u2019s checklist is different and unique. The items on your list depend on your:\tValues, Beliefs, Past experiences, Background and Previous relationships. This is also the reason why your friend might fall in love with a man that you consider ordinary and nothing special. This man matches her own unique \u2018Lovemap,\u2019 not yours. Calculating matches to see if a person lives up to our checklist is not a conscious action on our part, it\u2019s done subconsciously, without thinking about it. The mind does it all on its own. Just like your mind is telling your heart to beat as your reading this page. Even though you weren\u2019t consciously aware of it. This is why it\u2019s possible to fall in love with a person and have no idea why you fell in love with them in the first place. Your subconscious is responsible. This is why love is such a \u201cmysterious phenomenon\u201d and many people put it all down to their own personal destiny. But in reality, it has nothing to do with fate, it was all related to your subconscious, which was quietly figuring out whether the person matches your checklist or not. The truth of the matter is that if you\u2019re able to grow more aware of your subconscious mind\u2019s specific criteria, you\u2019ll be able to quickly determine why you fall for some people and not for others. 2. Making a strong impression The first thing you wanna do is impress him/her. Doing anything like helping others, standing for a good cause, telling truth, speech, voice, guesture or even making good jokes. The other person need to admire you in any certain way. 3.Take good care of yourself.  Physical appearance plays a huge role in whether or not someone will be attracted to someone else.  How well you care for your physical health and appearance is something that people can see right away, so it is worth putting some extra time and energy into while you are trying to attract someone. People will notice if you don\u2019t care for yourself and this may make someone lose interest. 4. Treat them special  you wanna to treat them very special via phone conversation, chats, or social media via anything. Atleast the other person wanna to believe that you dnt treat them like others. there is something special in their case.  5. Trying to understand them  This is difficult in beginning but you want to try harder to understand what they thinks when they are in silent and guessing their answer before they answer their question. And what are their likes and dislikes.  In what ever things they are interested to do, how they dream about their life partner.  6.Fulfill their wish  If you come their wish or likes try to surprise them by fulfilling it. Remember their Birthday or any special occasion and treat that day very specially.  7.Use your mutual friends  If you and your heart\u2019s desire have friends in common, you can and should use this to your advantage. The main reason behind this is because the subconscious is programmed easier when trusted sources (such as friends) are backing up what they are being programmed with. If their friends think you are great, chances are they will agree. If their friends think you\u2019re an idiot, chances are they will agree. In a way it\u2019s a subtle form of brainwashing \u2013 the more your mutual friends talk to them about how wonderful you are you\u2019ll have a greater chance of establishing a place in their mind.  8.Associate yourself with positive things.   When your name is mentioned in a crowd, what\u2019s the first word that\u2019s likely to come to peoples\u2019 minds? How do they see you? Do they think \u2018strong-willed\u2019, \u2018happy\u2019, \u2018confident\u2019, or is it something more negative like \u2018needy\u2019? The better you position yourself in peoples minds, the better people will perceive you. It doesn\u2019t matter what you are (we all have negative qualities), it\u2019s all about how they perceive you. And you\u2019ll only want them to perceive you in a positive light.  9. Be Kind   Treat others the way you want to be treated. It may sound cheesy, but it's true. If you want others to treat you with care and respect, you should start treating others this way way, too. People are more likely to fall in love with other people who have great personalities, who are polite, and who are kind to others  10.Show your flaws.   Share your good qualities with your significant other but also let him or her see how far you\u2019ve come. For example, if you getup late in morning and trying harder to getup early but confess you fail on holidays.  11.Create trust.   Trust is an essential component in a healthy, long-lasting relationship. Learn to trust your significant other and show that you trust him or her with your words and actions. Make sure that you show your significant other that you are trustworthy as well.  12.Support other during difficult times.  Offering support is very important to creating true love between two people. Most people want to be in relationships to begin with because they like having someone to support them. If you can be supportive and caring to your significant other, this will go a long way towards getting the person to fall in love with you  13. Don't fall in best friend category.  You should give your significant other the same consideration you would give a good friend but all check to that you don't stay as their one of the best friend category. Make them feel that they are very special than your best friends.  14.Spend quality time together.  Even if it is in phone call or msg, try to spend quality time together which later make them to miss you on your absence.  15.Tell them your feelings  Confess how you feel for them. how your heart beat rise when you see them. How you see them as a part of your future. How much happiness you get to see her smile.  Note:  For few boys, the list goes on..  For few girls, just a smile is enough.  Warnings:  1. Dont Flirt Don't behave as flirter in front of them neither with them unless you create a good bonding. 2. Don't be too good or too bad Be safe, revealing yourself too good or too bad or too childish can create a distance. 3. Don't be like Hero It is impossible to make someone fall in love with you. If you do all of the things discussed above and they still don\u2019t love you, then they are probably incapable of loving you (or already in love with someone else) and the two of you were a poor match. Some people are simply incompatible, even if one person feels very strongly for the other. It may be hard to hear, but you are better off ending a relationship if the other person simply cannot return your feelings. Don't turn movie hero and started drinking and go behind her.  4.Don't be like Villain also   Don't be clingy or pushy with someone who's rejected your feelings. Anyone that you have to try too hard to convince to like you is not worth all the trouble and will probably never like you. Pursuing a relationship too hard will only make you creepy and push people further away. Don't do anything harmful to them or things that might hurt them.  4.Not Interested, move on  Try, with all your heart, to match with your love and do your best for them. And if it doesn't work, you found that they are not interested in you then all you can do is move on. 5.Don't create sympathy Many people fail to make the other person fall in love with them, then they start threaten them or create sympathy for them to give a final chances. It will create more anger on you.      ",

            "answer_text": "This is actually long, but thought it will help those guys out there who are used to thinking that impressing girls with their swag clothings will make them fall in love. You got to read this. Let's get started. Getting a girl of your dreams is much like getting the car of your dream. But unlike a car which you can always bargain for, there is nothing like a 20 percent discount in courting the girl of your dreams, she's so sweet a thing to be discounted, you dearly are in love with her and your feelings for her can only be communicated not by the words of the mouth, but by the words of the heart. Getting the girl actually depends on how big your heart is - faint heart, never won fair lady.  The first dating idea for any man is to make a good impression. In your doing so, you don't have to talk, dress or do the common things that all the Toms do to get a decent girl's attention. Be unique, that's all you need. Be a man of his own style. Dress decently - indecency can make one be mistaken for arrogance; watch your language - obscene language gives the impression of immaturity, being uncultured and cheap; be a man of good habits - don't drink or smoke like any other loser.  How to make her fall in love with you? Take your time. Add some romance to your dating style. When in College I had a crush on the most beautiful lady in our first year lot. Though all senior guys were out to get that girl, I managed to divert her attention from the other guys. I wrote her three letters without disclosing my identity and slid into her room secretly; all I said was 'Yours Secret Admirer.' The first letter contained the meaning of her name, this I got by playing around with the initials of her name to make meaning. The second was a funny message that could only be read backwards and it was all about her physique and her smartness. In the third letter I told the girl to be ready to receive a rose flower from her admirer, but only if she could be kind enough to phone him using a number that I had included in the letter. The girl did phone me that very night, and her first words to me were, \"Hallo Secret Admirer.\" So, the story of our love affair came to be. Later she told me that was so creative of me, no one had approached her in that manner. I made her fall in love with me and made a date in the romantic manner.  Befriending and understanding the girl you are out to get is the next important thing. This is what I also did. You have to understand that as a lady, she loves to be loved, adores to be adored and needs to be needed. This will move you closer to the girl and you'll get to know what she's into, what she likes and dislikes, and what her style is. Love is built upon friendship and it always leaves individuals better off having known each other should they break up. I and my College steady were to break some time later but to date, we are the best of buddies. Be sure that bringing out the selflessness friend in you will make her create room for you in her heart.  A shoulder to lean on and some good friend that she can always turn to is all that a lady wants. Please don't hesitate to be helpful and supportive. Be that friend who rekindles her zeal of hardworking and restoring hope back into her life when she looses hope. This above all other things will make you her daily vitamin simply because you bring out the best in her in terms of personality and character. In you, she'll have found that friend whom she can open up to, share with and advice each other on the rights and wrongs, the dos and don'ts of life. Don't forget to always be there to celebrate the good times, and to lend an ear when the girl needs you to listen as a friend.  Make the girl feel special; because she's someone's friend - your friend, and let her know that she too has touched your life in a unique way like no one else could. Compliment her for her company and for being there when you needed her, when you felt sad and all alone. Show appreciations for the comfort the girl offers you and for making you smile.  In your day to day talks, share your dreams, your world, and every aspect of your life with your girl. Always dream with her, build with her, and always cheer her on and encourage her. Tell your girl how you always think about her even when you try not to think about her. Let the girl know that she's your first thing in the morning and the last thing when you go to bed at night.  Her knowing that you were thinking of her when you slipped beneath the softness of your blanket and gave in to the bliss of sweet dreams, will make her go 'my my' and her heart will sing your name all the year round.  You have to be creative and constructive to keep girl's interest in you so full of life. I remember one time I told my girlfriend to be to imagine we are both deaf and dump. We then sat opposite each other on the table and started sharing our feelings for each other using eyes and hand signs. It turned out to be some fun. There was also this time that we were in the library and we decided we are not going to speak to each other verbal, so I wrote a love note on a paper and passed it across the table to her, she replied and on and on we carried on our love on paper conversation till we almost exhausted a whole rim of paper. At sometime, I noticed that some guys sited with us on the table were enjoying our ordeal than their studies. Such are the things that made the girl embrace my world. I remember her suggesting that we play deaf and dump two years after we broke up, can you imagine that?  Never fail to phone her, even when she least expects it. I once called some girl that I was interested in at four o'clock in the morning. When inquiring of what I was doing up so early, I told her I was in thirteenth heaven, where people think of their loved ones when they can't sleep. Wow! First thing early the next morning, she was at my door with a king-sized hug for me. No matter how many dates you take her, don't make any elbow - exceeding moves after any date, just drop her home and with a friendly handshake, wish her good night. Don't kiss her when she expects you to. Your respect as a gentleman will be earned on how patient you are with her when it comes to such matters as kissing her and accessing her inner graces.  The writing is on the wall that you want her, but you can't have her just yet. Increase your demand. Try to show her that men are also hard to get at times. Make her realize that when she feels a little dizzy, a little tired, a little sad, a little sick, a lot bored and very much cold, she's actually missing vitamin you. By this time, she'll be so much into you and since love is truthful and is characterized by open and honest communication, honestly promise her your everlasting devotion, loyalty, respect, and your unconditional love for a lifetime. Prove to her that you'll always be there for her, to listen and to hold her hand, and that you'll always do your best to make her happy, and feel loved.  Remember, patience is the key to her heart; be like that gardener watching a fruit as it hangs on the tree, day after day admiring it, but, exercising tremendous self-discipline, neither feeling the fruit, nor pinching it, nor testing it to see if it is ready. And then, one day he holds out his hand and the fruit simply drops into it, ripe, warm and eager to be eaten.  The patience and self-control which you practice will make you more attractive and charming. This will qualify you as her daily vitamin and win you that heart hers.  I wish you to meet the girl of your dreams ASAP, make her fall in love with you, and make her feel the happiest girl in the world! ",

            "answer_text": "You see, this is where women and men of little experience understand. They always, I mean always ask the wrong questions. This question has nothing whatsoever to do with love. It has a lot to do with insecurities, neediness, desperation and seeking for approval, validation, to be liked and loved. So I\u2019m going to cut through the bullshit and crappy motivational and seriously crappy advise you always hear. None of this crap.. \u201cBe yourself and he will love you for who you are.\u201d That\u2019s why these people did a degree, dressed in suits, or smart dress, learned interview techiques, learnt copywriting to make their CV\u2019s compelling. See what I mean about \u201cbeing yourself.\u201d It\u2019s a lot of crap when it\u2019s said that way. You need to be a better version of yourself and that takes investing in knowledge, skills, social skills, influencing skills, knowing how to develop your core inner sexual appeal and outer appeal, flirting, to conversation and socialising skills. Because you need to\u2026 Stop thinking about what you want to get from a man and start thinking how to get the man in a mood, to FEEL alive and spark imagination that connects all this with you. That takes knowledge and skill. Same if you\u2019re a man who is asking a question regarding women. Stop thinking how do I get her to like me, love me and focus on learning, yes LEARNING, because it is a knowledge and skill, to take her mind to that level of state of emotions. The questions always are.. What I want her /him to feel?How do I get their state of mind to this place?And gradually escalate such emotionsFor the woman/man fantasize the sexual romantic experience with meAs you can see, it\u2019s not about what \u201cI want to get\u201d but how I do bring value, valuable sexual and romantic experience to make the man/woman FEEL. And all this takes knowledge and skill. So I don\u2019t worry about what I want. I focused on knowledge and skill, and that got me what I want. Being myself, didn\u2019t get me what I want but being a better version of myself did. One thing I made sure to learn fast\u2026 I don\u2019t have to fucking worry about what I want. I know what I want. I\u2019m not bullshitting myself. I want to rip her clothes off and bang her senselness until she has multiple orgasms. I want to give her the amazing sexual experience and that doesn\u2019t just mean sex. I mean the whole journey. From the approach and right to seduction and relationship. I know what I want but there is knowing what you want AND having the other person desiring the same thing and with more intense feeling than you. See what I did there? It\u2019s now focused more on the person and not on what you want to get. You know what you want to get. You know how you feel. It means FUCK ALL and this is why confessing it means shit too because people who do that are missing the point. It is about the other person and how they feel, and they need to feel the excitment, the arousal, imaginate it too and connect it with you. So forget about how to make a guy love you. Start with how to make him feel alive when with you.How to make his heart go boom boom without mind games.How to make his dick hard by you just being with him.How to make his emotions go wild and fantasize about you, and connect these positive feelings he has with you.Think of it this way\u2026 People don\u2019t care about what you want until you show how much you care about what they want. They don\u2019t care about what you know but they will remember\u2026how\u2026you..make them..FEEL!\u201d The key words is.. The other person\u2019s feelings, emotions, excitement and experience they have when with you whether it is on text, phone or when face to face. Now focus on that. Making him feel awesome when with you and stay away from negativity, bullshit play hard to get games, anything that confuses a guy and talk about love, relationship. Focus on the guy and how to make him feel amazing with you to want to be excited to be with you even more. ",

            "answer_text": " 1 ) Be mysterious but not closed off. This doesn\u2019t mean wearing a fedora or being the weird quiet one in the corner. When talking to that person, generate curiosity and intrigue. You do this by teasing them with information. If they ask where you\u2019re from, simply state where that is and a quick one liner about the town. Don\u2019t be so quick to tell your whole life story. You want them to discover you. Unpack you. The most interesting room in the house is the one that\u2019s locked. Always. 2 ) Keep them guessing.In the courtship phase while you two are still feeling each other out, don\u2019t fall into a routine. Text them at random times. Go on spontaneous hangouts together. Always try new things and bring them along for the ride. People want to spend time with others who add value to their lives. Keeping things interesting will multiply their interest in you ten fold. 3 ) Be busy but not unavailable.You\u2019re a renaissance man/woman. You have many interests, hobbies and people vying for your company. You wouldn\u2019t throw all that away for one person. Make it clear to them that you have things going on outside the relationship. They\u2019ll appreciate you more and it\u2019ll be a self esteem boost for them to think they\u2019re \u201cworth\u201d your time. I can\u2019t stress the second part of this tip enough. If you want them to fall for you, you have to be emotionally available. Answer their late night phone call when they\u2019re feeling stressed. Don\u2019t blow them off just to appear busy. You\u2019re toeing a fine line here so use proper judgement. 4 ) Get them to share personal stories. We are sensitive creatures at heart. Hearing someone\u2019s deep, dark secrets is the closest we\u2019ll ever get to holding a horcrux. That\u2019s part of their soul they entrusted you with. The caveat with this is the only way you\u2019ll get their horcrux, is by giving up one of your own. You have to open up and be vulnerable yourself if you want them to reciprocate the favor. 5 ) Be the honest version of yourself. Not the best. Or the coolest. Or the most suave. This is the person you are at five in the morning and 12 at night. The last thing you wanna do is put up a grandiose facade of being the \u201cultimate man/woman\u201d (The masculinity of Rambo, the style of James Bond, a Seth Rogan sense of humor, John Mayer sensitivity, and Sam Harris intelligence) Trying to be all these things is exhausting and will cause long term frustration and feelings of inadequacy. At the end of the day, you want them to fall in love with YOU. Not a perfectly sculpted, idealized version of you.

            "answer_text": "When I was in my twenties, I wanted so badly to be loved and I often asked myself this same question; how do I make someone fall in love with me? I often wondered why others were loved without even trying and why, for me, it took so so much effort. Whenever I had a crush on a girl, I would create this image in my mind of what is supposed to be a perfect guy, and then try to emulate that image. The results were always the same. The perception young women had of me was that of someone who was uncomfortable in his own skin. A spazz; hardly any fun, let alone lovable. When these brief romances ended, or never got off the ground, there was a young woman I was friends with whom I would turn to for consolation and advice. When I was with her, I didn't feel the need to put on any airs and as time went on she fell in love with me. Looking back, I did not consciously do anything to make her love me, it just happened. When I was around my crushes, I was trying to be someone I was not. When I was with her, I was myself, and that must have been enough. We dated for two years before we ended up breaking up. Staying in love, well, that's another topic. As I got older, I became more comfortable with myself and realized that I was likable and worthy of being loved. Gradually, my life changed. Friends and lovers were not people I actively pursued, they were people that effortlessly became part of my life. You reach a point of comfort and self-acceptance where these things just fall into place. Not everyone will fall in love with you. A lot of times the chemistry or attraction is not there. When you are comfortable with yourself, and you like who you are, there is a pretty good chance that someone you have a crush on will also be drawn to and fall in love with you. You'll get there, it just takes time. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are a few tips which can help you win someone\u2019s love for you :- BE A GOOD LISTENER. Out there are many people who just wants to tell people about their problems but mostly they don\u2019t find someone who wants to listen to what they say and not just ignore with Hmm\u2026 SO be a listener to them as they want one for sure.GET THEIR ATTENTION. It\u2019s very important to get someone\u2019s attention as this is when they truly see your actions and you are always in their mind. To get attention some easy tips are -be a topper (it really helps).be good at making pranks in class or make people laugh.it\u2019s very important to be expressive so whenever you get a chance to express your opinion never back off.3. SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS :- Don\u2019t start a conversation without any point. I mean it\u2019s a bad idea to just start by sending a \u201chii\u201d randomly, rather go for a more meaningful start i.e start something work related face to face and then go for online chats.Don\u2019t just ask your friends for the whatsapp number or facebook id. Instead ask him/her for the number and know whether they are comfortable sharing their numbers with you and then go for chatting. Love is a gentlemen process, so have CLASS and don\u2019t look like a roadside romeo.Don\u2019t go for compliments directly, rather wait and try to know about her/him. If you compliment them easily it\u2019ll make them feel like you are lying. Instead be a listener and keep your chats short in the initial days and as time progress, go for normal chats and following it will be personal life. Show interest in chats and act with patience.Once you get to know her/him better, then one day just confess you like them. Confess in the way that they are shocked. This will be a game changer, either it works or it doesn\u2019t. If she/he replies that they also like you but they need to time to think about you it\u2019s well and good. if not they\u2019ll say a direct NO!! which I think is a rare answer. In that case limit you interaction and chats. They\u2019ll rather go for I don\u2019t know!! so just confess that you just wanted to get this off your chest and now you are feeling relieved. Talk formally afterwards and then slowly he/she will show interest in you if they like you. Their perception regarding you will change and this is when real talk starts.4. TOUCH SENSITIVE TOPICS :- If you like someone then sensitive topics when you are with them. Topics such as their lost dream, their problems, their failures or anything which concerns with them. Trust me they\u2019ll spill out slowly what they feel and they\u2019ll get attached to you and they\u2019ll not even know that. Don\u2019t behave like a counsellor and start giving them advice. Trust me this\u2019ll backfire so it\u2019s better to just listen and make them feel comfortable. 5. DON\u2019T BE AMONG THE CROWD :- After you have gained that person\u2019s trust make sure you both get time alone and go out for parks, movies, eat outs. This is when you\u2019ll be the only one who she/he knows in that crowd and this will surely deepen the bond. Make sure you talk about your dreams once she/he is into you. This is the time when you talk and the other person listens. They are interested in you and once you have shared you heart out he/she will be happy and they\u2019ll understand that they mean something in your life and this is when they\u2019ll fall for you. 6. THE FINAL TEST:- When the person is into you then start showing physical touches. I mean holding hands in public, frequent hugs, kissing on cheeks/foreheads and rest you can imagine. Without physical closeness the LOVE and relationship will be incomplete so it\u2019s important. I am not supporting and wrong ideas, physical closeness only when both are comfortable.  At last making someone fall in love with you is no science. Some people are meant for you and others aren\u2019t , so the above steps may not work all the time. Getting someone who loves you is a blessing and even if you have put your heart into getting them , you can just HOPE for a YES!!  Pic credits :- google ",

            "answer_text": "Be a listener, make good eye contact, smile a lot, make them feel special or WAIT! If you still think that these stuff work exactly the way they\u2019re depicted to, then Welcome to reality Nobody will actually wait for you to learn the art of perfect body language or maintaining such charisma  However, from what I have observed and experienced, I can surely suggest some things that might work. So, 1.Never act like you want to be loved Psychology says that if 9 out of 10 people in your life love you, you\u2019ll still fall for the one who doesn\u2019t.  \u2022 People are usually attracted towards the ones who never ask for their attention. \u2022 And most of the times they ignore the ones who actually look like they\u2019re begging for love. 2.Don\u2019t tryna be the nice guy/girl Never ever go that extra mile to be considered as nice or sweet by the people around you. Remember the last time when you tried to be good to everyone and ended up being the dumbest person? Don\u2019t repeat that. Be who you are, proud in your own skin and mindset.  3.Know how people exactly deserve to be treated Be kind to the kind hearted, humble to the innocent ones, helpful to the needy and a complete badass to pesky dumbskulls.  This skill can surely attract the masses. 4.Work on yourself  Leave no stone unturned to be that version of yourself whom you\u2019d actually love to meet. Skin care? Fitness? Hairstyle? Stable Job? Money? Don\u2019t stop until you\u2019ve ticked all the boxes. And don\u2019t forget to love yourself in your process.Treat yourself as the most significant person you know, which of course you\u2019re, for yourself. Always remember, If you don\u2019t love yourself, people will see that from far away and nobody else is gonna love you. 5.Lastly, Confidence never goes out of style. And how do you expect to carry all these qualities in yourself, without the snazzy touch of confidence?  . ~Crimson times:) ",

            "answer_text": "Tough answer! As it\u2019s impossible to find ONE solution that works on everyone. However, I can offer a few tips that I\u2019ve learned (sometimes the hard way): BE YOURSELF : I can\u2019t stress this enough. No matter what the person you\u2019re trying to attract is like, no matter what their personality type is, or how impressive they are; trust yourself and be yourself. You will emanate the strongest confidence when you are in your \u201cpersonality comfort zone\u201d and not trying to be someone else, or to impress them in unauthentic ways. Sometimes, even when you may feel like you are too different from them for them to be interested (aka \u201cAw damn they\u2019re like a musician type they\u2019re never going to like me, I don\u2019t know jack shit about music.\u201d) but that\u2019s exactly what you can use to make them like you more. Don\u2019t try to mirror them if you aren\u2019t like them. To reuse that example, don\u2019t pretend to know and enjoy their music if you don\u2019t; there\u2019s nothing more annoying than someone who tries to kiss up but fails because its fake. Use your difference to ask them about themselves, (reusing my example) ask them about their music, maybe to share it with you, to teach it to you. When people try to get to know you, you\u2019re much more likely to be interested in them then when they act like they ARE you.STAY CHILL : Being a stress case and trying too hard can be really a turn off, so act like it\u2019s them who want you. Take the upper hand! Play hard to get a little bit! If you\u2019re down on your knees for them, trying to make everything perfect and please them in every way, they\u2019re going to get bored. Spice things up and make them want you. Calm confidence emanates a really strong \u201ccool\u201d vibe because it seems that you are 100% sure of yourself, and you aren\u2019t even trying.FLIRT AWAY : If there\u2019s any place you can allow yourself to try and adapt to them, it\u2019s here. Figure out what type of flirting they respond to by trying different things. And try to stay original! We all get bored of \u201cheyyyy\u201d texts. Try something different like engaging into a real conversation, and then slip in some discreet compliments when you can. The flirting needs to smoothly fit into your interactions, not be something you shove in their face. It\u2019s always better to wait a little than waste a move in a situation where you aren\u2019t feeling 100% sure of it. For example, over social media, don\u2019t comment on all their stuff desperately. Wait until they post something you actually have something interesting to say about and THEN hit them with a conversation. In real life, don\u2019t ask them out constantly on random dates, wait until there\u2019s a real opportunity (ex: a band you both like is in town; there\u2019s a cool art expo you know they like; they like coffee and you just found a sick coffee spot etc\u2026.) and THEN ask them out.",

            "answer_text": "So what can you do to make someone fall in love with you? Follow these things and you can try. 1. Put Other People First:- Everyone wants to spend their life with someone who is kind and loving. We all want to have that one person who makes us feel important. And we are all drawn to people who do good in this world. If you are someone who has a giving attitude, then you have a good shot of making someone fall in love with you. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to give to them constantly to make them fall in love with you. It just means that you show them that you have an altruistic attitude and the ability to act on that attitude when necessary. 2. Ask The Right Questions:- Want to create a conversation that will help them see how great you are? Ask the right questions. Ask the questions that inspire excitement and passion in them, and then create a conversation around those things that make them see you as someone they have connected with and will be able to connect with for a long time to come. 3. Look Into Each Other\u2019s Eyes:- That same study found that staring into each other\u2019s eyes had a big impact on making someone fall in love with you. I have heard variations of how long to do this, but 10 minutes seems to be the point where an altered state of consciousness is reported and creates a special type of intimacy, especially when combined with the previous questions. 4. Make Someone Feel Comfortable Enough To Be Vulnerable:- When someone feels vulnerable around you (not because of you), you have a chance at winning them over. Perhaps this is why men often take their date to a scary movie. It puts their date in a vulnerable state where they need their date to protect them \u2013 or at least that is the stereotype. In any case, if you can get someone to depend on you or require your support or care, you will deepen the bond between the two of you and have a chance of making them fall in love with you. 5. Mirror The Person You Are Interested In 6. Cure Their Loneliness 7. Make Them Laugh 8. Work On Your Appearance 9. Be Clear About Your Feelings 10. Back Away:- Creating some distance is one of the ways to make someone fall in love with you when you have been too needy. When you are in someone\u2019s face too much, it can be hard for them to get the space they need to assess your positive qualities that they find attractive. Backing away gives them some breathing space and allows them to stop focusing on your neediness and, instead, focus on what you can offer them. 11. Become A Part Of Their Routine 12. Increase Your Energy I hope these points will be more than enough to make someone fall in love with you. All the Best\u2026!!! Thank You\u2026!!! ",

I experienced the most unique \u201ccalling\u201d as such - the person I absolutely least expected.

And Yes - brilliance is the word - the most amazing, incredible person I will ever have the privilege to state that I knew. I was blessed - and that will remain so for eternity. If I told the story of that \u201ccalling\u201d one might argue that I was crazy, lost my marbles as such! BUT\u2026. the Universe - it has a unique and unexpected ability sometimes to enable two stars to collide - an ability to allow a perfect stranger to delve into your soul. If anyone on this planet experienced the same situation the sensation is that of euphoria - I was truly blessed. I began to realise the wonders that our world holds\u2026 and I know that experience will never happen to me again in this lifetime.

We \u201clove\u201d because regardless of the outcome, we want the best for the other person\u2026 always\u2026 no matter what life may throw in the mix. And no matter what hardship we may face as the outcome. I know that I will never experience that \u201ccalling\u201d again - I always felt I was not meant to give my heart away - but I did. And it was not in vain - hopefully one day that person will realise the wonder and the magic he holds in his soul. He will always be the most incredible person I ever will have had the privilege of knowing. Always and until time exists no more\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "You got to understand who you really are. And you got to understand the person right in front of you. Every person has his/her unique set of personality traits, an equally engaging but very different origin story, and his/her own unique perspective regarding life. Firstly you have to accept one truth- that you just can't satisfy everybody. Understanding who you really are and who you can't be, and understanding what a person is really looking for in you, will help you get an insight pretty early whether this is going to work or not. My gut feelings always have a better accuracy than the logical arguments by my brain (often, our brains get dizzy when we are with someone we find too attractive, and the arguments which we think are logical, are attempts to fight until the end, a battle which we know we\u2019ll lose). People subconsciously tend to have a check list of personality traits which they would ideally want in their perfect partner. This check list gets revised as we grow up- for example, when we were in school, it was a common thing to get attracted to the hottest girls in our batch (those who could take us to the dark side), however as I grew up, I saw a lot of my childhood classmates whom I never considered approaching- now surpassing the level of hotness of the kind of girls who usually pulled my eyes in school. This taught me one important lesson- that hotness shouldn't be an eliminating criteria when I am looking for a girlfriend, because in the long run people do change a lot, and who you perceive as someone \u201cnot in your league\u201d could someday turn out to be \u201cout of your league\u201d as well. Every single person has his/her day, and on their best days they will always get the better of you. So if someone rejects you today, ten years down the line its perfectly possible that if you cross roads with that someone, he/she might regret that decision. If that person has been going through a rough time, he might now appreciate how supportive your nature is, or what an amazing listener you are, that after a very long time he/she has been talking to someone the whole night at one stretch. The idea I tried to convey here is that every person subconsciously has his/her own check list of desirable traits that they want in their partner, and based on the long term experiences that person has had (failed relationships in the past, or events that left a scar), and the more pressing recent experiences (for example, loss of someone really close, or being cheated upon, or stress), that checklist keeps getting revised and divided into sections like- Traits I can't compromise with, and Traits I would like but definitely not mandatory. Through conversations you have to know what are these mandatory traits and whether you have it or not. When you are not communicating with a person effectively, you'll never get to know what that person is going through- lack of communication kills your chances to be what that person needs at one particular point of time. If you're not there for him/her, someone else might just get lucky. Someone might like you to take control and plant a passionate kiss on her lips on the first date itself because she has been craving for pleasure. However, if you assume that for everyone, it will definitely backfire, because its possible that one person recently had some really traumatic experience and now because of your move, perceives you as yet another desperate guy. What one woman perceives sexual could also be casual for someone else. Hence in order to really earn someone's love, you have to invest time in understanding that person first- what are her ambitions, what does she expect from her partner, what turns her on, what turns her off, what has she been going through. Effective communication is a trait which I consider as foundation for modern interpretation of love. Without communication, everything falls apart, no matter how deeply you are in love with someone. In order to make someone fall in love with you, you have to be a good lover first- learn how to give, without expecting to get something back in return. I talked about checklists- and every person has one common trait that he/she finds desirable in a partner- selflessness. A selfless partner instills the feeling of love (the urge to give everything without expecting anything in return) within you. Hit the upvote button if you agree. I am eager for your comments. This happens to be my first answer on Quora, give some love! ",

            "answer_text": "What most people would say to that is no. Love is not something you can force yourself to feel. But it definitely is something that can grow. It has to have the right circumstances and at least the willingness of the person you love to want to give it a try. I have as an example the personal experience of a close friend. Coming from an abusive childhood, followed by a marriage from Hell, she was really emotionally damaged and so scared. I think at the time she started dating again simply to deter her insane ex. She met this guy online who seemed absolutely besotted with her. I remember each time she would talk about him she would be angry with herself for not being able to feel anything at all for him, as he was a genuinely nice guy. He wasn\u2019t her type if anything she would find him slightly boring and she decided to do the right thing and tell him all of that. His answer was \u201cYes I know, thank you for telling me. Where would you like to go for dinner tonight?\u201d Over ten years later, 3 kids later they have an amazing relationship. Still not married as she\u2019s terrified of the idea. She\u2019s as besotted with him now as he was with her from day one. So yes, you can make someone love you if you give them the love, respect, attention and support they deserve and they are willing to try. However, it\u2019s very important to remember what kind of a person you choose to give all that to. Some people would take your love for granted and the more you try the least they would even like you. Trying to make someone love you, puts you in a very vulnerable position and there are a lot of bad people out there who would blatantly take advantage of that. As with anything else involving feelings and relationships there are no rules set in stone and you have to use your own discretion. The most important thing to remember is, just because you can\u2019t make one person love you, it doesn\u2019t mean someone else won\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": " Offer them something they cannot get from anyone else! The reason everyone says \u201cJust be yourself\u201d is because it allows you to show them something they haven\u2019t seen before. When you can make a person happy, show them a new world, excite them at every twist and turn and take them on the adventure called \u2018life\u2019 with you, then you will gain the love and respect of that person. Being yourself allows you to open up for them and like a book they have never read before they will be allowed to go on a journey they have never gone on before. But it allows allows them to love the real you, not this fake story you pretend to be. Trust me, no matter how good your cover story looks, sooner or later, if they go deep enough, they will find out the kind of book you really are. Besides being yourself just ask yourself what it is that most of us desire out of life. See it from their point of view, who would they want to fall in love with? Wouldn\u2019t you say it is reasonable to assume that if you can give them love and happiness, the two things most people want most in their lives, that they will then treat you nicely in the very least? That being said, if you want to make someone fall in love with you you only need to give them those two things.   #1 - Unconditional love. Think about the people you love the most, when do they love you? For most of us these are our parents. We love our parents, just as they love us, and hardly anything can ruin that. My question is: Why? The reason for this is often because your parents will love you no matter what! If you have a great relationship with your parents it is most often because they did not care what you did, who you turned into or where you went in life, they still loved you. This undeniable, unending, unconditional support is something that you cannot push away. If you can love someone else without any conditions and show that to them, they will feel drawn to you. Not only will they be safe with you around but they will have an unquestionable source of love next to them. (P.S. For those of you in the friend-zone, the reason you are there is often because you give love that person unconditionally but will expect something more as soon as it turns into a relationship.)   #2 - Happiness. Almost every person, when asked, said that the thing they desire the most out of anything else is to be happy. We all know that making your partner happy is the essence of a good relationship, but let\u2019s take a deeper look at that: How do you actually make someone happy? Rewind again to a time where the people around you were the happiest. And, when you think about that, you will realize the moment your parents were the happiest was when you were a child. When you did not go to school yet, but were old enough to at least be able to do the basic human functions on your own. When they took you to the playground, when you played tag running around the house and when you listened to the stories they read to you. That is the time most parents remember because you gave them so much joy. So what the heck did you do back then that made them so happy? Here\u2019s where it gets a bit counterintuitive: The only thing you did was try to have fun. As a child your sole purpose is to have fun, to enjoy life and to do whatever you can to create a great mood. The whole reason you stood up in the morning, threw tantrums in the store and ran around screaming was to have fun. And if you think about it you will realize that you also had the most fun being around people that had a lot of fun themselves! Just look at comedians, for example, whose job is it to make others laugh. The most fun we have with a comedian is when they break character and start laughing about themselves! That\u2019s why bloopers are so hilarious, why the \u201cFunniest Home Videos\u201d often create such a laugh and why you want to spend time around your happy, funny friends. If you can have a lot of fun being around a certain person and take them with you on that ride, letting them join in on the fun and making sure they are happy as well, then you will have someone that admires you at the very least.  Now, if you put those two desires of other people together and mix in a little bit of time and effort and sprinkle a lot of honesty in showing yourself into the concoction and then heat it to about 230\u00b0C for 25 minutes, you will have created yourself a Love Potion. Obviously, it may not be that easy all the time, but create that potion and you will be well over half-way there!  Stop being less than you can be and reach your goals.

            "answer_text": "We all want to be loved, and we want that love to be effortless. Perhaps, this is why people have long been romanced by the concept of a magic potion that perfectly patches people back together, igniting passion, liveliness, and love. When I was 12, I played in my school\u2019s adaptation of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, a Shakespearean comedy that traces a collection of characters who are mistakenly placed under the spell of a passion-inducing flower. Comical conflict ensues as characters fall in and out of love, left and right. All ends well when the spell is reversed on everyone except for one man, who now conveniently loves a woman who desired him, but who he despised at the play\u2019s start. Though I loved the play, I remember being slightly irked at this one outcome, that this particular love was inauthentic, that Shakespeare had cheated. In reality, we all want to be loved, but in order to have the love we say we want, we have to throw fantasy out the window. Love isn\u2019t something that happens to us. It\u2019s something we cultivate, something we can ignite within us by being open, vulnerable, and ourselves. According to many experts, what causes us to fall out of love has a lot to do with our tendency to protect ourselves by pushing back, losing sight of who we are as individuals, and forgoing real intimacy for a fantasy of connection. Staying in love has less to do with an unseen force pushing us toward or away from another and more to do with our own willingness to be open and vulnerable and to look at the behaviors that are steering us away from our closest feelings. This is good news, because it means we have a lot more power than we think when it comes to how we feel. As Dr. Lisa Firestone said, \u201cLove involves behavior. It is a skill. To be truly loving, we have to take actual actions toward our partner that he or she experiences as loving.\u201d So, while a potion would be nice, the answer to our woes is usually in our own actions. According to Dr. Firestone, there are ways to stay truly connected to our love for someone else, to help them feel seen, loved, and, therefore, more open and affectionate toward us. Here are some essential tips adapted from the work of Dr. Firestone and her father Dr. Robert Firestone, author of The Fantasy Bond. See the person for who he or she is. We can\u2019t really feel loved unless we\u2019re being seen. And we can\u2019t express love unless we\u2019re really seeing someone else. True love has to be true. To love someone, we have to know them. A famous study by Arthur Aron listed a series of personal questions that can produce intimacy and closeness between two otherwise strangers, leading some to say they make people fall in love. The 36 questions range from, \u201cwhen did you last sing to yourself?\u201d to \u201cif you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?\u201d The conclusion of the study was that a \u201ckey pattern associated with the development of a close relationship is sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure.\u201d This was put a touch more romantically in the New York Times essay by Mandy Len Catron, which she wrote about how her and her now partner tried Aron\u2019s questions before they started dating. \u201cWhat I like about [Aron\u2019s] study is how it assumes that love is an action,\u201d Catron wrote. \u201cI see now that the story isn\u2019t about us [her and her partner]; it\u2019s about what it means to bother to know someone, which is really a story about what it means to be known.\u201d In order to keep love alive, we have to remain curious about the person we\u2019re sharing our lives with without trying to fit them into something (or someone) else. Express affection. The more we express love physically and emotionally, the more we feel it. A Stonybrook University study concluded that intense love can last long-term, and that one of the main factors making this possible is the presence of physical affection like hugging and kissing. This is consistent with Bianca Acevedo\u2019s research that states that lasting romantic love is possible and is characterized by three main factors: intensity, engagement, and sexual liveliness. Part of not letting love fade means connecting to it physically through touch, contact, and intimacy. Do things the other person will perceive as loving. As much as we may love another person, sometimes we become so wrapped up in our own feelings that we stop seeing the other person. We may do things that seem in the vein of being a \u201cgood husband, wife, boyfriend, or girlfriend,\u201d but we aren\u2019t necessarily tuning in to what our partner really wants from us. Throwing a huge birthday party may feel generous, but maybe our partner would prefer if we just slowed down and caught up. We should always aim to offer tenderness, compassion, and sensitivity to the needs of the other person. What expressions of love would make him or her uniquely happy? Support what lights the person up separately from yourself. When we first get together with someone, we typically appreciate and respect each other\u2019s individuality. It\u2019s what attracts us to each other, the unique qualities that make each of us who we are. At first, this expands our worlds, and we\u2019re willing to go along for the ride, because we\u2019re excited about this new person and what they\u2019re adding to our lives. As we get closer, however, we sometimes start to limit each other, relating as a unit as opposed to two individuals. This can be a good thing in the sense of sharing more and feeling close, but when we start to control and restrict each other, the relationship tends to deaden and even create resentment. We should never give up being ourselves in a relationship nor should we ask someone else to give up themselves. This means we may have to stop trying to control the situation. We should strive to continue to offer concern and support for the loved one\u2019s aspirations separate from our own. Love thrives when two individuals make a choice to be together to enrich their lives, not to limit them. Encourage the other person to see their friends and to do the activities that make them come alive. This is the only way to maintain our feelings of freedom and attraction. Share activities and pursuits both old and new. When we first get close to another person, we often share a bunch of new activities that make our lives feel fuller and more exciting. As we get more bogged down into routine, we may stop doing those things we once loved to share like cooking together, meeting up for coffee, or, as many couples report, having as much physical contact or sex. It\u2019s important not to stop taking the time for the things that we once shared that connect us to our loving feelings. On the flip side of the same coin, it\u2019s important not to just fall into habit and stop trying new things, both together and separately. Again, the idea is for our worlds to always be growing as a means of keeping ourselves feeling alive in the relationship. Engage in an ongoing, honest exchange of personal feelings. When we are open with another person, we allow them to truly know us. By being vulnerable and saying what we want and how we feel, we give our partner an opportunity to get close to us, to feel for us, and understand who we are. This isn\u2019t about blaming or complaining. It\u2019s about being an honest and equal adult expressing what we feel and think directly, without manipulation. At the same time, we should be open to the other person\u2019s feedback and to hearing how he or she feels and what bothers him or her. We can meet this communication with compassion, both for our partner and for ourselves, so that we don\u2019t react defensively and both feel closer from the contact. Be wary of your inner critic. We all have a critical inner voice that puts us and our partner down. It\u2019s like an internal enemy we harbor that just doesn\u2019t believe we\u2019re lovable and sneakily works to push love away. This inner critic offers terrible relationship advice, encouraging us to engage in hurtful or dismissive behavior, telling us to hate, pity, or protect ourselves in ways that don\u2019t allow other people to truly be close to us. Getting to know this inner critic is a key part of allowing ourselves to fall in love long-term, because if we listened to this \u201cvoice,\u201d most of us would wind up alone. While there is no single secret, no potion we can conjure up, to make love last, holding these practices as principle gives us the best chance of having real love in our lives for as long as possible. This kind of love is richer than fantasy and more rewarding than mere loyalty. It keeps us invigorated and excited about the possibilities of a given day. When taken to heart, these steps keep us more than just in love, but alive, and not just to our partner but within ourselves. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 nope. Let\u2019s look back at me in my younger years and see what we have. What I see is an introverted little kid who doesn\u2019t know what to do. What to say when someone complimented him, what to do to get what he wanted, how to express his love for someone. You should know better than to expect him to do something like \u201cmake someone fall in love with him\u201d. Really, I was a fool, honestly. There was this one girl I really loved, and let\u2019s not get into the details, but she left in the end, and she was right; it was my fault, mostly. I was naive. I didn\u2019t know how to interact with people, and this is it. But I would like to thank her, for she is one reason I became a better person in this aspect. I learned a lot, I\u2019m no longer an introvert and I know what to do. I\u2019m still cautious when it comes to meeting new people, and some people may still find my personality off-putting (At least that\u2019s how I feel) but overall I\u2019m much better socially. This change might have come, eventually, even without her. But still, she is a reason. Now, I\u2019d like to go back to your question. It is still a no. I learned many things, but making someone love me isn\u2019t one of them, and I don\u2019t need to learn how. If someone loves me, be it a friend, relative, or whoever they may be, I want them to love me for who I am. One major plus of being unable to make someone love me is that whoever loves me, loves me because they want to (Whatever you\u2019d like to call it), not because I made them. They will not be easily disappointed and if they ever be, they will stay for a while longer. Anyone to disagree here? Some people, friends among others, have accepted me for who I was, and we still are friends today, that is a plus. So no, I cannot and rather not make anyone love me. ",

            "answer_text": "People fall in love with our energy.  We tend to look for someone to give us love rather than learning to love ourselves first. When we don\u2019t love ourselves it\u2019s much more difficult to find someone else to share our energy with. This is because instead of being the energy people want to receive it\u2019s quite the opposite. This kind of energy repels the good energy from us. 1)Love Yourself By loving yourself openly, you\u2019re inviting someone else to love you openly as well. It\u2019s not easy loving yourself but if you can\u2019t then don\u2019t expect someone else to, that\u2019s selfish. Be yourself & the universe will bring you along someone to grow with. Be aware of negative thoughts and emotions because they\u2019re unhealthy for your personal development. Negative emotions & self-talk can be projected on to other people if you\u2019re not conscious of it. You\u2019ll be perceived as pessimistic, jealous & insecure. These characteristics do not attract good energy to you is crucial to your positive improvement. 2)Have goals By having goals for each area of your life you become organized & gain clarity on where you want to go. It\u2019s easier for people to grow in love with you when you have a plan for your life. It\u2019s reassurance to the other person that you\u2019re willing to be disciplined about your goals & outcome of your life. You seem much more stable & give off the impression of being able to take care of yourself. Sometimes our partners need guidance in setting up goals for themselves & we can help them do that. We also sometimes fall off track ourselves & when someone holds us accountable it becomes more of a priority. 3)Develop self-awareness It\u2019s important to have a strongly developed self-awareness when you are in or getting into a relationship. You have the ability to determine why you feel angry, frustrated, sad, or anxious. When you have a strong self-awareness you\u2019re able to steer your thoughts wherever you want them to go. Despite the situation or challenge we face, strong self-awareness helps you overcome them. This kind of clarity allows you to really understand what kind of life you want with your partner. You can set goals with each other & cultivate different ways to grow together. It\u2019s important to make progress together because if you don't, then you\u2019ll begin to get frustrated with yourself. 4)Eliminate insecurities This was most difficult for me because I used to be scared of losing the person I was in love with. I was afraid of being hurt & vulnerable so as soon as I felt threatened, I\u2019d withdraw and get upset. My mind would start thinking about worst possible outcomes. Sometimes, I still get jealous but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve gotten so much better at & improving on daily. I\u2019ve realized that there\u2019s no reason for being jealous because it only makes you more upset & it\u2019s embarassing. You literally make up lies in your head to prove yourself right. Even if worst case scenario has happened to you before, realize that there is a lesson behind everything that happens to us. Life does not happen to you, it happens for you and therefore must not be afraid to love. Being insecure blocks us from the ability to fully love ourselves and others. Remember\u2026 Most of the negative assumptions we create in our minds don\u2019t happen in the first place. Being the jealous person in the relationship can be a very negative experience for you & the other person. When both of you are that way it can be destructive. You will begin to question eachother\u2019s trust & this can create unwanted tension between the two of you, even before a relationship is established. It\u2019s essential to increase your self-awareness to understand what you really want in a relationship & in life.  Thank you for reading!

            "answer_text": " Stop Trying - Stop trying so hard to make someone love you. In my experience, I\u2019ve been unsuccessful with love when I was actively trying to make it happen. You find love when you live and act like someone who isn\u2019t desperate for it. I think people are attracted to people who seemingly don\u2019t need them because \u201cwe all want what we can\u2019t have\u201d. You can\u2019t force someone to love you, so don\u2019t worry too much about it. This leads into my next point\u2026 Live An Attractive Lifestyle \u2013 Live a life that someone would want to be a part of. Part of falling in love in my opinion is not just falling in love with another person, but falling in love with their lifestyle too. After all, if you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time with someone, you might as well have fun while you\u2019re doing it! Focus on yourself and work towards setting up the life you want to live. Work out, eat better, make strides in your career, travel, etc. Play Cat And Mouse \u2013 I think part of the fun in building the initial attraction with someone is the uncertainty of it all. Have you ever wanted to chase after someone and became less interested when they made themselves too available for you? You want the other person to feel like they \u201ccaught a big fish\u201d when you\u2019re together. You want them to feel like they found something valuable and they would never want to give it up. So in my opinion, express your interest in another person, but don\u2019t make yourself too available. It\u2019s like a balancing act. Expressing too much interest could make you appear needy and being too unavailable makes you appear aloof. Make Them Invest In You \u2013 You\u2019re more likely to fall in love with someone you\u2019re more invested in. The more time, money, emotional energy, and other resources someone spends on you, the more attached they become. Grow Together \u2013 When you\u2019re with someone, it\u2019s important to evolve together. Look at a relationship like a roller coaster. What makes the roller coaster fun and addictive are the ups and downs and unexpected turns along the way. In a relationship love grows stronger when you build a number of diverse experiences with each other. Spend time together, go on trips, love each other, hate each other, love again, and become more deeply connected\u2026 Top 3 Life Lessons - Here is a bonus YouTube video I made describing the top 3 lessons I\u2019ve learned so far in life.

            "answer_text": "Be yourself. It sounds insanely cliche and meaningless in this day and age, but there's more to it. When you \u201care yourself,\u201d it doesn't have to mean that you just go around saying and doing the same things you always have. Instead, you should be bold, but never rude. There is a girl at my school that I consider to be the most \u201creal\u201d person that I have met in the high school. I'm going to call her Lucy to protect her identity. Lucy is the funniest girl that I have ever met, but she's also the most honest. She never fails to make a joke or say something if she sees someone wearing a shirt of something she likes. In eight grade, she admitted that she liked anime. It may not seem like much, but when you have people like me who spent my middle school years dealing with severe anxiety, hearing someone admit they like something that's not necessarily \u201ccool\u201d is a big deal. Lucy's one of those people that even though I don't know her that well, I consider her a friend. I would turn to her if I ever got into trouble, because I feel like I know her. She is completely, 100% percent herself. She is raw, and she is bold. You need to be bold. Tell that girl that she looks cute today. Tell that guy that he's really hot and him working out is really noticeable. Live your life with the philosophy that of you notice it, say something. You never know who may be too afraid to say anything. Unless, of course, it's rude. Then you should simply keep your mouth quiet. People gravitate to those who are simply raw. Even if the person you've been crushing on for months doesn't like you, there will be more people who like him. People already love you and like you, you just haven't seen it yet. Don't give up. Life hasn't given up on you yet. Sincerely, A Girl Who Refuses to Give Up on You ",

Be strict to yourself , but lenient to others.You think you are a book and hope others to love to read it and understand it. Yes, sometimes, they just don't understand it and they don't want to understand it. Allow the existence of misunderstandings and cognitive discrepancies. Allow people's laziness.People are equal. You want to change other people as you think they are too stupid. It is not always true. Everyone has their good sides and bad sides. Your thinking of their badness may not be bad at all. Things are too complicated. Learn from other people's advantages and see their bright sides. Believe that everyone is progressing everyday.Emotionally steady, not too sensitive. I found that when you are happy or they did something that make you excited, you are so crazy that you even want to marry them. But if other people spend several days no eating, no talking, just answering questions, but only only say one sentence \u201cwrong\u201d, you begin to suspect this and that. Even jobs need police checks whether they are bad persons. I don't know you. How do I know if you are bad? Am I wrong? This is the bottom line.Be generous. Not to me. Would like to spend money for your sweetheart. Your money is her money. Love is unconditional, don't you say that?Trust people. You suspect other people's purpose for taking use of you. You,You,You. You are mean and selfish. You are only a small common person. How come you treat yourself too special? Don't spoil yourself.Do you have some miserable experience in your childhood? Are you lack of love so much? Find love from yourself. Don't count anyone to give your love. Nobody owes you. You owe yourself. Treat yourself well first. Heal yourself. Other\u2019s love are supplementary. If have it, it is good, if don't, that is OK. Your love for yourself is enough.Your future wife is stupid. That is OK. As you love who she is. If you strictly and hardly try to reconstruct her to make yourself comfortable, trust me, the day when you guys break up is near the corner. Be simple, what do you want from her? When you want to make your penis feel comfortable, you don't need to do masterbation. When you are sick, somebody can do the meals and let you have a rest. When you have a heart attack, somebody can call 911 in time to save you. When you feel frustrated, you have someone to comfort you. You have someone at home, thinking about you, not making trouble for you. At best, having a baby for you. Isn't that good enough?Hope you are a east book to read. Hope the somebody who reads the book take it easy. ",

The general populace is too busy living their own lives to acknowledge your existence, let alone decide whether they \u201clove\u201d you or not. And if you do all sorts of things to gain their favor, they could still treat you like dirt. We are each the center of our own world, and that doesn\u2019t change no matter what you do to get attention- solve hunger, cure cancer or shoot up a school, it makes little difference. There are nice ones and mean ones, we feel unloved around mean ones even though their meanness may have nothing to do with us! And we feel loved around a nice person even though they\u2019re just being polite sometimes. So don\u2019t try. Change your perspective of love. It\u2019s not your problem to \u201cmake\u201d anyone love or even like you, but it is your problem to act with love and recognize the few who appreciate you. ",

            "answer_text": "Use Law of attraction . The sole thing that can bring the miracle is Law of attraction , scientifically proven universal law Law of Attraction actually works no matter what, much like gravity . Try and define and visualize the kind of person and relationship you want. Write down what you think on a piece of paper. Don\u2019t write what type of looks you are searching for; define what you are looking for in a person. What qualities, experiences and emotions do you want? If you don\u2019t, you might end up with someone you\u2019re not compatible with. Make sure you visualize and have that mental image of what you are precisely looking for. Make the laws of attraction work by following these steps.Next step, this may sound a little selfish, but it is very important. Love yourself. By loving yourself, you will give off vibrations you are a healthy, confident, and happy person, which in return will help you attract love. Your thoughts and emotions will attract good and bad things. If you love yourself than you are feeling good about the person you are. Like flies attracted to fruit, you will attract love. Love yourself and it will change how you feel on the outside and inside. So go take a bubble bath, go for a run, buy that sexy pair shoes you saw in the window. Do what makes you feel good. You are worthy of happiness, and you\u2019ll be reminded of this by feeling good. It\u2019s really simple. Use the Law of Attraction for love by honoring your core elements and all your attributes that makes you who you are.Be open and express yourself. By letting the universe laws do its job. Be open and you\u2019ll receive love, allowing you the opportunity to attract love into your life. Use the law of attraction for love, because it isn\u2019t much different from anything else. You\u2019ll figure out what kind of relationship you want by loving others. Your desired end results are complementary with the laws of attraction. Remember what famous scientist Nikola Tesla said \u201cIf you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.\u201d ",

Show your presence to her/him in everything.like if she/he is going to be participate in debate then try to be mike man don't be her/his competitor.Don't try to be her/his pet but her/his supporter so that she/he can see your support for her/him.Try to do some funny acts so that when she/he smiles you just say with your eyes that you love her/him.Try to use gestures not your butterfly words while communicating.Never let her/him think that you don't love her/him.And never say or text her/him -\" I love you.... As a friend\". Just to check what other person will reply.Just try to remain cool(not funky but angry less) in front of her/him and try to share problems with her/him(,but not complete) let her/him ask you what is your problem.Never show her/him, your hero giri until you are confident about your action.Just don't fake or play with any person. Because she/he is not an app in a playstore that if you don't like then uninstall ,or people are giving bad reviews so you uninstall ,just try to fix your own problems ,if you think that this app is consuming much battery then try to recharge it. EtcUntil you yourself feel that this app is really hacking my mobile don't let that person go. Its not your life when you love ,it's our life now. ",

Some never even get a taste of how sweet it is. Thankfully, I\u2019ve manufactured a simple 13-step formula to solve this problem. A simple guide on how to make any girl fall in love with you. Follow these steps and any girl will fall for you. Love has never been so easy. 1. Shower, shave, and leave the house. Obvious. go with a more confident mind. go with the mind set that you have already won her Now onto the real stuff\u2026 2. Speak to a pretty girl. Feeling nervous? Don\u2019t worry! That\u2019s just the crippling anxiety ingrained in all males since the days cavemen were savagely beaten for speaking to the wrong woman. use the choice of words you know that will make her fall for you 3. Bypass the bitch shield. Beautiful women will be initially bitchy to most men who compliment them. It\u2019s a defense mechanism that stems from being hit on by hundreds and hundreds of dudes. Avoid this bitchiness by being more interesting and charming than all of them. make her see a different man in you. let her see her dream man in you. 4. Disarm the cockblocks. A girl\u2019s friends will instinctively protect her from any man she deems to be creepy, rude, or unattractive. Either win them over within a minute of meeting them or find a wingman to keep them busy. If your girl is out in a big group, you\u2019ve got some serious plate-spinning to do. Get her phone number at the very least. 5. Show her you like her while acting like you don\u2019t. It\u2019s a precise tightrope. Find the perfect balance between trying hard and playing hard to get. 6. Masterfully construct the perfect text message. Bear in mind that girls will critically analyze and decipher every word. That\u2019s assuming your message stands out from the dozens of alerts she gets from Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Snapchat, other lads, etc. give her reasons to always want to hear from you. practically steal her mind just by her reading your messages. 7. Master the game of text-message tennis. Become the Andy Murray of messaging. Every time your love match sends you a text, you\u2019ll need to send a better one flying straight back at her.

            "answer_text": "There are some \"tricks\", some of them work so well that they shouldn't be told any further. But I will embed them in a few tips that should also be considered in any long term relationship: We fall in love with people who we feel have a special relationship with us. This feeling can be encouraged:Show real interest. Really listen, think about it, and ask questions out of the desire to understand the other.Maintain eye contact, often and for a long time. This makes it clear that the other person is the focus of your attention.Make physical contact: a hug for a greeting; a hand contact during the conversation to underline emotions (\"I'm so happy for you!\", \"No, did he really say that?\" - all opportunities for brief contact.)Take your time: always be there when you are needed, but don't obtrude.Always be helpful and friendly. Contrary to popular belief, we fall in love with nice people more often.Be persistent. Anyone looking for quick successes does not deserve them.Be tolerant and patient. Be yourself, but also adapt in specific things when necessary. This may not be that important if the only goal is to make the other person fall in love with you. But if you want to keep lasting love afterwards, you need a lot of patience and tolerance.",

            "answer_text": "You can't make one specific person love you. George Clooney is taken now. I can't get him to love me.  Ditto for Steve Black. What I can do, is find somebody who will love me. I do this by loving myself first.  When I accept and even love my foibles, when I take good care of myself, when I'm true to my values and desires, and think of myself as a prize, I make room for others can do the same. If I try to make somebody love me by taking care of them unilaterally, fixing them, or solving their dilemmas, I end up with a son and not getting much in return. If I try to make somebody love me by being helpless and needy, I end up with a daddy and not feeling very good about myself.   If I try to make somebody love me by demanding it, I end up with skid marks in my driveway. It's the best news and the worst news.  It's the worst news because you will have to face your stuff, and be responsible for your own happiness, but it's the best news because nobody will ever be able to take that away from you.  You will have a good life regardless of whether there is a man or woman in it, and you will have the best chance at a satisfying relationship.  So go make yourself look good, go out and do something you enjoy, and have fun just for the heck of it.  Try it and see what comes back to you. ",

MONEY Most easiest way to make people love you instantly and will even praise you but only for short time and the respect you\u2019d command won\u2019t be real. I know money is an important factor maybe the most important factor for people to respect you and your opinions but if you want real respect be a man of your word be humble and helpful this will help you to gain real respect from people and they will respect you for the MAN you are and the money of course! 2. GIVE RESPECT TAKE RESPECT \u270a See we all like to get respected and want people to respect our opinions so instant of disrespecting someone\u2019s opinions or ideas you won\u2019t gain respect instead you\u2019ll lose it when people around you will notice your nature. Respect everyone\u2019s opinions and try to stay cool when you\u2019re debating and person will respect you back. 3. FIGHT FOR YOURSELF! When i was in my 10th standard my section my changed so i was new to everyone and i was in eyes of the boys so they thought of bullying me. When they tried to bully me I fought back i knew I won\u2019t be able to defeat all of them but i can break jaws of few of them so after my big clash with them they didn\u2019t started hating me instead asked me to join them and they told me that we really liked your courage and from now on you\u2019re our friend and i became friends with them all they instantly respected me and i respected them for the act they did! this is the only way to tackle your bully either he/she will become friends with you or will not bother you again cause he knows you\u2019ll fight back! 4. STAY REAL! umm i think you understand what i meant here just stay real don\u2019t try to be fake and be someone else just respect yourself and people will respect you and love you. Be proud of yourself what you\u2019re doing and just don\u2019t sit idle hut do something and keep yourself busy and stick around.  \ud83c\udf7b ",

            "answer_text": "Let love come naturally\u2026 Each and every person is special and lovable in some or the other way. It might not always happen that the way we want and the person we want to receive love from, matches our choice, but if you ever get loved, it can't be discriminated, rather it never should be. People try to beautify their faces and bodies to make themselves lovable, but how does that even make a difference? Haven't we seen or at least read about acid attack victims getting married and loved, haven't we found people falling for those whose aren't attractive according to our societal norms. We all have seen how love defies the bars of shape, colour and size. But we still expect the answer to be something which might ask you to reduce your weight or tone up our skin to make ourselves more lovable. You just need to have a beautiful heart for someone to fall for you. You must have a beautiful heart to understand that you are loved by someone. You must learn to trust for someone to love you. Believe that you are lovable and that you deserve to get loved. Lastly I would like to quote Ed Sheering from the song \u2018Thinking out Loud\u2019 \u2026. \u201cpeople fall in love in mysterious ways\u2026.. maybe it's all part of the plan\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is quite simple: Be yourself, be honest, Exude Love (without being aloof). Since my Answer would likely be rejected if I were to hit SUBMIT, let me explain these aforementioned characteristics. 1) Be Yourself Not only is this the First thing that came to mind, but it is truly the top energy you can resonate. You\u2019ll attract guys whom resonate with that frequency. Of course, if you\u2019re not attracting the guys you think you should have, then you should readjust your energy. Many times, the reality is that we attract those we don\u2019t want because we\u2019re not being who we want to be. Being Human alone is an awesome experience\u2026being Sentient, yet another awesome factor. Sentient: having the power of perception by the senses; conscious. Unfortunately, we are forced to waste our learning years on learning things that are not relevant to us (purposeful design by those who steer the system). Thus, we have to learn our senses in a less impressionable state. This is partially why you see so many younger adults still figuring out that their \u201cprivate\u201d parts are \u201cprivate\u201d for a reason\u2026 With all of this madness, how do you be yourself? Well\u2026you must learn what it means to Love yourself. I literally just learned how to do that. Of course, was I not being who I am, I may not have had the opportunity to encounter that small, powerful message. We all say that we Love ourselves\u2026but do we really know what that means? This is what people mean when they say that you have to learn what you like and the like\u2026but what they\u2019re actually saying is, \u201cLearn how to Love yourself.\u201d Of you\u2019re thinking it means \u201cbeing more selfish,\u2019 you are wrong\u2026not that it means \u201cbe more selfless.\u201d Perhaps it means whatever you want it to mean initially, but in the end, it means to take care of yourself as you would another\u2026who fell in love with you. Be gracious, kind, empathetic, and with boundaries. Those boundaries are arbitrary, of course, until you\u2019re comfortable enough with who you are, who you were, and who you\u2019ll become. Begin that journey, cut off the television constantly influencing and controlling you, reduce your internet usage (especially YouTube and other media distribution services), and just be. All of the major belief systems have moments of solitude as the most reassuring. There is a reason for this. 2) Be Honest Whether you\u2019re religious or not, you\u2019ve come across the idea that \u201cFaith can move a mountain.\u201d Perhaps, having the \u201cfaith of a child\u201d has crossed your path? Faith\u2026means \u201chonesty.\u201d Sure, it has alternate meanings (some relevant, others to fill an agenda), but in the end, \u201cHonest\u201d is the definition that resonates most with my Center Chakra. Some times I think back and wonder whether or not my Honesty has pushed away opportunities that I could\u2019ve otherwise lead to fruitful endeavors, but the fruit of honesty is beyond anything I\u2019ve seen \u2014 thus, I remain honest. With that being said, realize that you live in a dishonest environment. You must not seek delivering honesty to the point of causing another immeasurable harm, but many times, honesty will get you \u2014 for lack of a better term \u2014 exiled from many gatherings\u2026primarily because you\u2019re not just \u201ctelling others how you see it \u2014\u201d any of us can do that. It always tickles me when I see people claim they\u2019re honest because they have an opinion of which they express. This occurs primarily with Women with some level of repressed anger whom feel it their duty to make everyone pay for the transgressions of their past. My heart goes out to them, as not only do they misunderstand the difference between honesty and ignorance, they misunderstand their roles as Women and wonder why they\u2019ve either found no Man who does what he \u201cshould\u201d or they find a Man who does the exant opposite of what they expected in a relationship. I am quite hard on Women, because you guys hold all of the cards in everything, but still find it necessary to blame a Man when things go South. It doesn\u2019t make sense. This is why we don\u2019t have communities and the like\u2026 So don\u2019t be like that. Be yourself. Be Honest\u2026especially with yourself. Learn the difference between intuition, anxiety, and fear\u2026and you\u2019ll have 75% of the game. Your next lover will thank you for it. Note: I realize that this has turned into an answer about attracting a suitable partner\u2026but this is far more desirable than having Love at First Site. \u201cLove at First Site\u201d is normally closer to \u201cLust at First Site\u201d\u2026and that has its place as well. If you\u2019re just looking for a date, I can privately share my OkCupid Profile with you and we can go from there\u2026 I\u2019ll fall in love with you\u2026just for being a Woman (hence: my first two advisements). Most Men set \u201cFeminine Woman\u201d as their bar to entry. Unfortunately, in American society, this is an elusive, valuable group. #message ^^^Yes, that\u2019s a hashtag in a formal prose; I do what I want^^^ Lastly, 3) Exude Love. The old adage that opposites attract has its merit, but I strongly believe it is not properly represented in greater society. At this point, we\u2019ve arrived at a junction where \u201cLove\u201d is bought and the effects are \u201chardly.\u201d After the previous two objectives have been truly embraced by you, this third one is a no-brainer. I am moreso sharing a third advisement because once you reach this point, I don\u2019t believe there will be any problem exuding Love (because you Love yourself for being yourself), but take this more as the encouragement to exude Love. Oh yeah, plus points feel better made with the Power (not mathematical notation\u2026just \u201cPower\u201d) of 3. 3 is a lovely number\u2026 The world seems kind of harsh \u2014 very harsh \u2014 but the affliction paints the Western World far more horrendously than other parts (at this time). Regardless, it remains that Love is the most Powerful force in the Universe. I believe we are seeing that occur right now before our eyes\u2026 \u2026 What I would like you to take from this list of advisements (short, but succinct) is that there are Men ready and willing to be the receiver of your objectivity\u2026or, said more conventionally, would love for you to be the object of their desire. I haven\u2019t even seen a picture of you, but believe that if you stay in this zone of wonderment and study, you\u2019ll find yourself in far more situations that you want to be in, as opposed to those that you\u2019ve acquiesced to. Be well, Sibling. And never forget to keep questioning, learning, and growing. Many times, it is the \u201cGrowth\u201d that scares us most. Even with that said, I can say that I went through a phase here recently where I did everything but what I knew I should do in an effort to avoid certain discomforts. In the end, I still had to deal with the discomforts\u2026 So, don\u2019t be afraid to Grow. And yeah, that makes it four thoughts on having someone fall in Love with you, but I see the Fourth more as a Personal strategy for improvement than specifically being used to attract someone\u2019s affection. Any questions\u2026or further inquiries: Feel free. With Love",

I'll tell you. \u201cMake up\u201d, make him to do this, make him to do that. Doesn't this word sound too forced to be attached with the most beautiful feeling in this world called love? Spend time with the person you love, get to know him/her well, see if he/she is well enough to confess your feelings for, and if the needs be, confess your feelings also with all your heart, don't hold back, be honest with yourself and the one who you are in love with. But, but, but, once you have confessed, or let's say proposed your love for the person, ask him/her once for approval, if it's a no, it's a no, if it's a yes, so of course you would be happy, but if the person asks you to wait, then just wait until it turns toxic for you. Having to think of making someone fall in love with you, and doing things for that going out of the way, is what isnt needed. If the person actually intends to love you later, he/she will, after spending time with you. One more thing, always be your own self while you are with that person, don't try to pretend and be someone that you are not, for trying to impress. The person may or may not fall in love with you. You don't lose your own self for it. I hope you get what I wanted to say, don't \u201cmake\u201d things, cuz beautiful things, specially a thing like love, a feeling like love, is blissfully natural, no one can make it or create it. :) ",

It\u2019s not just about appearance it\u2019s about so much more. Look inside of yourself and really see yourself ask a few trusted family or friends to say what they find to be an asset of your personality and character. If there are some that need a little work as in becoming more self confident controlling jealousy (just examples ) you can work on loving and respecting yourself. I think just about anyone & everyone could benefit greatly from self help groups therapists just for someone to talk to. They have grounds therapists for self esteem codependency etc. ",

True love will come when you find someone who is compatible with you, who you want to love and who you sincerely care about, and who feels the same towards you. Heal your wounds, and explore your true needs and true self. Own that and honour that. Resolve the need to be liked or \u201cloved\u201d by everyone. It is quite easy to make the most of one\u2019s appearance and develop some sort of charisma. But the charm that you may have over a handful of people will not be love. No one will be in love with you. They may feel intrigue, they may feel infatuation or some sort of attraction for you if you master social skills and are conventionally attractive. But whatever you perceive as people \u201cbeing in love with you\u201d, will be a projection of your own fantasy and insecurity. No one will be in love with you. It may offer a false sense of security and status. But it will not be real love. Heal yourself. Know what you want and what you have to offer. Cultivate authenticity, which will allow you to connect with people who can actually see you, and thus actually love \u201cyou\u201d. Not just have a fleeting infatuation with a facade. Trust me, it is much more fulfilling to have quality connections rather than live in a state of delusion where you mistake infatuation and intrigue with being \u201cin love\u201d. To briefly share a story- an ex of mine was a multi-millionaire. He was very handsome and dressed well. He had swag and confidence. He was entitled and shameless and that was so sexy and intriguing. But I never loved him. He was just an enigmatic person. I learned a lot about confidence and shamelessness from him- but he was hollow. He was just a shell of a man who was charming and intriguing, but who totally lacked depth or the capacity to connect with people on any real level. At one point I thought I was in love with him, but he was just enigmatic and confused me- so I stuck along for the ride until I quickly figured him out. Shortly after meeting him I realized what a boring shell of a person he was, and lost all the intrigue and chemical pull that I felt towards him. The only men I have enduring love for are those who are sincere, vulnerable, authentic, and in touch with reality. The infatuation you feel for celebrities or crushes is fleeting and shallow. If you decide to try and master that swag and charm, that is what people may feel towards you. But don\u2019t mistake that for love. ",

Telling you to \u201cbe yourself\u201d is probably not very helpful, since if you knew how to do that, you wouldn\u2019t be asking this. So my advice is to first, figure out who you are and who you want to be. Then be that person. Focus on what you like, and why you like those things. Ask yourself: What do you like about yourself? What makes you interesting? Answer for yourself, and then ask your friends and family. What do they like about you, what do they think is interesting about you? If you like what the answers to these questions are, then develop them further. Find ways to go deeper into the hobbies and interests that you like. Do more of the things you enjoy. If you don\u2019t like the answers, then start changing your behavior. For example, if you don\u2019t like that you\u2019re quiet, look up articles about good conversation topics and practice talking more. You can change who you are, but it requires learning new things and practicing them.  Now back to your question. You can hope that who you want to be is someone who this attractive person will want to date, and fall in love with. But here\u2019s the thing, if that attractive person doesn\u2019t want to fall in love with who you want to be, then why bother? Find people who like the person you want to be, and you\u2019ll find people who will fall for you. ",

            "answer_text": "There are seduction and language techniques to manipulate and control people. You might use language to get results with people but I\u2019m not sure they will be long lasting. Not sure about the \u2018LOVE\u2019 thing but this stuff really works. Ross Jeffries teaches this type material using NLP, anchors and process language patterns. Con men, the CIA and President Obama was a master at it. For example, President Obama one time, when he was trying to get ACA (Obamacare) passed, Said \u201cI need to go down there and explain it to them\u201d. He would have meeting with Senators and sure enough - after meeting there would be one or more change their votes to him. If you get a chance, listen to some of his speeches where he would - pause when speaking- use subtle hand signals when speaking. \u201cthe fact of the matter is\u2026\u2026\u201d; \u201cWhen you think about it you will realize\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d; \u201cImagine\u2026..; all these are subtle commands designed to talk to your subconscious where there is little or no resistance. Powerful stuff. You asked the question to me and I just told you some powerful stuff that few people understand. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my answer to : How do I make someone love me? Well , you don\u2019t need to. Even your closest pal , your spouse hates you at times. We are all different and cannot ever agree / love another being 24/7. Doesn\u2019t happen. We just choose to ignore those faults because overall the package is lovable. Hope you get the point. If not , pl read it again. Now just stretch that perspective to everyone & everything. Including you. You have flaws..BIG ONES. You may even hate yourself at times , but overall the package is good enough for you. Love thyself. Try and make it better, but you should love the fundamentals, your values as a person. Love thyself. Similarly, love thy neighbor. The other person will also have flaws , but if the overall package is good enough , love them. The worth of your love and the value of your loved ones in your life have more to do with YOU than them. I emphasize \u2026YOU and your emotions are the major contributor, not them. So , step by step . Accept yourself as you areKnow your flaws and accept them.Know your strength , cherish them.Know others have flaws too. Accept them.Love others, with those flaws.Once you can love , without expecting any return , is when life embraces you. You may find yourself with someone who sees your faults and yet loves the package. May or May not. But you will still love yourself. Trust me that would be enough. Thanks for the A2A SyEda. Hope it helps. ",

So present your self as a good person willing to be part of their life.Love yourself and give the same to your dream person without expecting immediate reflection of loveAvoid taking help of others(Indirect contact) to express your emotions because they may miss interpret it\u2026.even sometimes they can ruin it.",

            "answer_text": "What you have here can be viewed as a marketing problem. Your ex realized you (as a product) didn't fit in her life. We don't know the details, we just know that she was unhappy, and scrapped the relationship.  If you are the factory owner, how do you win back customers? You improve your product!  Of course this is the best all around approach, as it increases your marketability. It makes you more confident and prouder of your product. You have positive word of mouth, instead of complaints.  No matter how you improve yourself (the product), you will have to accept that there will always be customers that cannot be lured back. The bad taste from their experience with your product cannot be overcome. This is an outcome of presenting a product not yet ready for market - while you gain valuable on-the-ground experience in real time, dissatisfied product users often cannot be won back.  Tl;DR Work on yourself. Become the best you possible. You'll achieve two benefits from this approach. First, you're committed to quality, and know that you're doing your best. Secondly, if the ex doesn't recognize your efforts, or just doesn't want to get back together, there will be plenty of other opportunities with new women.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there are several things you can do that will increase your chances of anyone loving you - Love yourself, take care of your self, be confident in your actions, be presentable, etc. However, people have free will - They don\u2019t have to love you, nor would you likely be happy with the outcome if you could force someone to love you. Sometimes folks have this idea, that if only this one loved me, how great would I feel? This is rather one-sided. And love is more than butterflies in your stomach or the pitter-patter of your heart beating in your chest. Ultimately, I believe love is a verb - it\u2019s an action. Unexpressed in action and speech, it\u2019s simply a hormonal reaction trapped within you, for none to see. In this regard, do loving things, but most of all, be lovable! Whereas all this can increase your chances, ultimately it is up to the other person, as it should be. Love freely given is priceless, and will outshine any love you might obtain in exchange of power, money, status, etc. Besides, you would like the other to love your authentic self. You might fool them for a short while, but your true self will be revealed. If you are deficient in certain areas (bad/short temper, addictions, etc.), then work on your self to be the best you that you can be - And be loveable. Good luck! ",

There's a lot we don't understand about love - to the degree that we're even sure it exists as a meaningful psychological state outside of social constructs. And there's a lot that's idiosyncratic to individual people and couples. That's why a lot of research into why we mate is bizarre to the point of incoherence - cultural norms as well as oddities in research methods can create a lot of noise. Yet it turns out there is a lot of science about why people fall in love that is at once super strange and actually fairly credible. Keep in mind that no one study is enough to draw definite, broad conclusions. That's especially true because this research tends to focus on the specific behaviors of heterosexual undergraduate students at the universities where researchers work. Still, there's a lot of fascinating knowledge out there about our habits of love and attraction. Visit here for more details : Can Science help in making Someone Fall in Love with you?

If you love her seriously and if you want to make her life something special everyday, then you can proceed. Actually I fell in love with so many girls. I can make them love me. I'm jovial kind of guy, where my jokes will make them grin and ridicule. I can flirt also, most of the girls said that I'm good at flirting. Anyhow I used to flirt with them to make them smile and happy. Seriously if I want to give my whole life to some girl , I can make it happen and make her fall in love with me. It's easy to make her fall in love with us but what matters most and where difficulty arises is Protecting her like father Helping her like mother Caring her like brother Promising her that you will be with her for the rest of your life Treating her like an angel Making everyday special If you believe, you can do all these then love her. And if you can show her all these things then definitely she will be yours. Currently I'm single and I've to mind my own business. One day, when time comes, nobody can stop me from loving.

            "answer_text": "You shouldn\u2019t ever make someone fall in love with you. And by shouldn\u2019t I mean can\u2019t. You can manipulate someone into thinking they love you by assimilating everything they like, but then you leave yourself behind and lose everything you stand for. You can only truly make someone love you by loving who you are and being your best self. And by your best self I mean trying to be a decent human in the way that you think decent humans are. And don\u2019t do it for them either. That will freak them out. This person\u2019s doing good things\u2026 but like not staring at me right after to get my validation. Short answer is, just because you love someone, you can\u2019t make anyone love you. But loving yourself and being yourself is how you really tell when someone loves you. And allows you to deal with rejection much easier because you already love yourself, and get validation from yourself. Obviously loving yourself isn\u2019t some easy thing to just do if you don\u2019t already, but that is the first and most important step to it. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no foolproof plan to make someone fall in love. Its all luck. Even after planning a lot to make someone fall in love that person might just end up liking u and not fall for you. People falling in love is not a science. Anyone can fall in love with someone in anyway. It can take any amount of time, might take a day week month or years. Then there's d love at first sight. If u already like or love someone n u want them to feel the same way, it shouldn't be for the wrong reasons. U want them to be with you n not someone else, that should be the reason. To make them like u to want to hang out with them. I feel making them laugh is the key. Be a good person naturally not \u201cjust in front of them\u201d. Dont act like u r a nice person. If u pretend to be someone else, n he or she falls in love with you. She will find out that u r not the person she knew when she met u. It will cause problems in ur relationship when u have one with that person. So be the natural you. Have conversations with that person.. talk about ur school or college.. slowly u ll get to know their likes n dislikes .. U ll know way they watch what kind of movies they like .. what kind of food they like etc. U ll know what kind of person. U may not like them after knowing them. U should stop there. Lol Now its a game of patience. It will take time. Over time u ll have conversations with d person .. U ll know that U r progressing when she tells u something that very less people know or even nobody knows about that when u know that U mean something to her. Or even if she wants to hang out with just u n not with a friends circle. Or if she does something special of you like on your birthday. Or if she knows what u want or what u like better that anyone among ur friends. U might be like a best friend to her but still u mean something to her. U have to make her realise that she has feelings for you. That she feels something that is not just friendship. This will happen through a fight. When ur major fight happens she ll realise how much u matter to her. She might start developing feelings for you. Or she might just ignore it thinking u r a friend n its wrong. Now to make her not feel wrong. U need to flirt a bit. When u started as friend after first few months, u have to let her know that r interested in her. U have to be very subtle about it. Dont tell it ditectly please. Just slip it in a conversation through a flirt. After this be a bit flirty, not too much. Cuz she needs to enjoy that cheeky conversations with you .. Sometimes flirty is funny. Now to after that fight, She finds out about her feeling towards you. After this anything is possible. If d girl wants to make a boy fall in love, the guy will come forward when he discovers feelings towards you. Or sometime After the fight is over. U might go to him n confess. Just hope that he says the same. It all comes to this one or the other has to ask the other out on a date. Either u do it at d first within d first 6 months of being a friend. Or u do it after ummm\u2026 \u201cmy way\u201d 1st way is risky. U might lose her as a friend. My way has less chances of losing her as a friend. Its love. Nothing is easy. Nothing is definite. Anything can happen. The most foolproof plan can backfire. Being Unplanned can b fruitful. Its destiny. I believe. ",

But, why then, is it so hard to initiate a relationship? Well, its really down to the other person, as much as it's up to you. You can however, make someone attracted to you. Not knowing this person, I couldn't tell you how, and even then, it's still kinda 50/50. But, just talk to them, start showing her/him that you're interested. Joke around, be playful, flirt, etc. Show her real personality too. I see too many people turn into a completely different person around somebody they were attracted to, only to be instantly rejected by them. People have a strong phony detection sense when it comes to that kind of stuff (wish they had it for other stuff). If after that, she seems uninterested, you might want to at least consider moving on. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends whether you want this relationship to be lasted for a long time or not. If you just want the other person to fall in love with you and you really don't care about the duration of your relationship, 1. Never show the other person that you're way too much interested in them. 2. Don't be so desperate about getting their attention towards you. This strongly repels the other person, most of the times. 3. Find if he/she is Single and looking for a relationship. 4. Find out what they like/dislike to do. 5. Create a scene on your head a day before you meet the other person. (Hint: make use of the results from point 4) 6. Try to execute the scene. Chances are huge that it won't go well as you planned. Don't give up. Keep repeating. 7. Make his/her hobbies as yours. In short, Force yourself to be someone who your partner will fall in love with. (But, for how long can you do it?!! :D ) Whereas, If you expect a possibly \"forever\" relationship, 1. Meet the other person and confront that you're interested in them. Note: Don't say that you love them. Love is a big word and we use it at inappropriate situations. 2. Ask for a dinner date to know each other better in the most polite way that you can ask. 3. Be yourself all the time. They may fall in love for who you're. Looks simple and a lot easier, isn't it? ",

Here are 14 proven dating tips to make someone fall in love with you.  1. First Impressions First things first and yes we\u2019re talking about first impressions studies have shown that you only have about 30 seconds to make an impression on someone that\u2019s the amount of time it takes for someone to decide whether they like you or not. 2. Availability What\u2019s the most attractive trait surprisingly research has shown that it\u2019s not physical beauty status or even personality its availability this basically means that in order to be attractive you have to let people know you\u2019re single or at least throw some pretty strong hints out there. 3. Mere-Exposure Ever felt like you\u2019re falling more and more in love with someone the more time you spend with them that\u2019s the magic of the mere-exposure effect research has found that those who spend more time with each other are statistically more likely to find each other attractive. 4. Chameleon effect People seem to be attracted to those who act just like they do they say opposites attract but the opposite is also true at least according to the chameleon effect this states that if you subtly copy people\u2019s body language and mannerisms they\u2019re more likely to find you attractive.

            "answer_text": ". Have you ever seen people, who fell in love for the first time and took the relationship lifelong till the end? . I've seen plenty of them. How do you think they pulled it off, when they had no experience with Relationships before? . I've observed a common trait among these people. . They both were never looking for a Relationship in the first place: When you are actively looking for a relationship, you'll be in a hurry to try out with whoever you have even a remotest compatibility or attraction towards. Like trying out 100 Shoes before settling for one. . But when you're not actively looking for a Relationship and focusing on something permanent such as a Career, You're essentially keeping Romance as a second priority. Hence, you are calmer and you feel you have a lot of time to get to the right person. . When you are calm, you are not desparate and most likely will calculate and settle for a relationship, that gives you a lot of space to grow and make you intrinsically happy. . They have good amount of Communication, Inter-personal and Emphatic skills: A lot of people believe, you need flirting skills and some theory like Law Of Attraction, to get to the right person. . While it may work for a few people, Essentially your basic interpersonal skills that often gets you more friends, are more than enough for you to find your True love. . Care, Maturity, Affection, Understanding and Little bit of Attraction - These skills will help you get a lot of friends as well as get you close to your true love. . They were confident in their respective Careers: These people knew what they were doing and what they need to do to step up their career ladder. Though you need not show potential for making 6 figure salary per month, If a person notices that you are confident and hard working enough to steadily rise in your career over-time, your chances of a successful relationship, increases. . Think of it! Not dying for a relationship + Basic Interpersonal skills + Confidence + Steady career. A combination of the above will easily remove the bridge between you and your true love.  Nothing fancy like Law Of attraction required. Nothing complicated like Flirting skills needed. Particularly, no need to spend hours at GYM or Beauty Parlor, just to get the first love of your life.

            "answer_text": "You don't say if you are still together or re connecting after many years. If you are still together and you feel the fire has died then go back to the beginning. Start dating her all over again, this is what happens to so many couples. Mince they settle in with each other they forget the things that brought them together and made them feel such passion, Its like taking mom\u2019s recipe and leaving out essential ingredients then wondering why it isn't as good as it was when she made it. Dating is a life long part of keeping your relationship alive and healthy. And make sure you keep your phones in your pockets. Talk to each other. Be interested in their lives and what they are doing. Try buying her flowers on days when there is no expectation. Surprise her with a simple well thought out gift. A gift that will have some emotional significance. You have to re ignite those embers that are still burning but ready to die out. If you don't, someone will come along that will and you will be history. If you have been apart for some time and If those feelings were powerful and real, it it hard to resurrect them years later. I have seen it many times with people I know who run into their first love years later, their circumstances have changed and they are now single and then come into contact with their first love one way or the other. In a brief time all those feelings come back and curiosity takes over, \u201chmm, what if\u201d. Soon they go for coffee, then dinner then they are back together before you know it. But if it was a casual relationship lacking in true love then don't expect much. But interestingly, these nostalgic relationships seek to work once they re-develop and they go on to live happy un destructed lives. I was fortunate enough to marry the one and only love of my life. We met when we were I. 7th grade, started dating when 16 and we have stayed together ever since. We did spread our wings when we graduated and tested the waters for awhile but neither of us was happy and we migrated right back together and got married in 1968. I have often said, \u201cI'm glad we married because If I had married another I would have spent my whole life wondering what if?\u201d I know I would have had her in my mind forever. So I avoided the self torture and stayed with the sure thing. I have never regretted it. I hope it works for you like it has for so many others. But don't rush into anything. Many years apart produces a lot of baggage you might not be prepared for. Don't be blinded by love some things are deal breakers and you have to be realistic in your ability to deal with those things. I would start by just taking it slow with little simple coffee, lunch dates, then dinner. Do some things you both enjoyed when you were dating. It will stir her memories and emotions. But don't appear needy. Take it slow, or you might just push her away. Women need time to process things and ponder over what's happening and how they feel. Rushing them is a turn off. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Jen Tor. Thanks for the A2A. Easiest way is to be someone worthy of their love. I do believe everyone deserves love but there are ways you can live your life that draw people to you and benefits everyone and yourself. Cultivate your character. It's hard to do things for ourself, but once you start to see yourself in others you can be that person you always wished for when your life was hardest. Be strong for the little boy who was too small to protect himself, be courageous for the times you never stopped regretting, be kind for all those times your hurt was met with anger, be friendly for when you were lonely, be happy for all the times you couldn't be, be vulnerable so people get a chance to know you, and forgive for all the times you were never given that second chance when you made a mistake. Forgiveness is a very important one. Maybe someone hurt you, and that fear touches everything you do. But the reason they hurt you was never about you. Hurt people, hurt people. They were in pain as well. Forgive them. And forgiveness: means taking the knife out of your back and then refusing to use it to hurt anyone else ever again. You can get love by BEING love. ",

I did the same mistake, loved a girl, confess it to her, got rejected, even after that I tried, I wanted to be her friend. Because I don\u2019t want to lose her. (her friendship), I was trying my best kept calling her, finding excuses to talk to her. In fact Iwas making her to fall for me, in other\u2019s words I was forcing her to fall for me. What happened Eventually ??? I lost the respect she had for me. Now, I\u2019m just a freak, an obsessed moron in her eyes. Sometimes things we do for love might justify our actions, that same actions might make you villain in other person\u2019s eyes. IF you want to make someone to fall for you, just be who you are.

I definitely agree that true love takes time. But if that feeling is not there to begin with, most likely it won't ever be there. Yes you can do anything for them you can try every way you can think of. I have noticed that when you pull away from them if they have some sort of feeling then by pulling away will let the chase begin. It also sounds crazy but humans don't want what comes easily. Especially men they love to chase men don't want you if they can have you ",

The reality is how others feel is very much out of our locus of control. What is within our control though is whether we give ourselves the best possible chance of having someone fall in love with us. This starts with accepting the burden of being loved. When you\u2019re loved by others, your actions have consequences to their emotions and wellbeing. Are you ready to take on that responsibility? The idea of somebody endlessly taking care of our wants and needs, while great, isn\u2019t love. Love is a two way street where two people find joy in giving to each other and create a life that is more than the sum of its parts. Where you can care about another person\u2019s emotions as much as your own. Because to truly be loved, you must be able to love\u2026 And if you have to ask how can I make others fall in love with me\u2026then you\u2019re not ready for it. ",

You never know, if they fit well together, a chemistry may turn up between you both. But you need to talk about it to him right away.  Guys usually like girls who are straight forward in their speech instead of withholding secrets in their gut. Don't do that. Time flies by in a blink of eye. You never know when he will get out of your reach unable for you to extend your loving confession to him again. So better do it now, don't wait, go talk to him....

However, if you interpret more like \u201cInfluence\u201d, then of course. There are books aplenty, videos, blogs, and studies to show that absolutely you can do things to increase the chances (maybe even to near-certainty) that someone will fall in love with you. I think I would add that the chances diminish over time. I mean that there is a peak of opportunity when you first meet someone, but if you fail to succeed in those first moments, your chances fall off asymptotically. I\u2019m also not certain that ANYONE could pull of such a stunt. I think a certain degree of personal confidence, appearance, etc will factor into the likelihood of success. ",

The affection and care you confer, make them notice you. When your intentions are pure with zero expectation, it's highly impossible for the other person to not think about you. When you are in love with a person, you do everything to keep them happy; you do not mind making a complete fool of yourself just to bring a smile on their face. Imagine a person who's trying their best to keep you happy, with absolutely nothing in return. Love begins when you start to reside in their mind a little longer than anybody else, love takes place when they're amazed by your fondness. It\u2019s very difficult to not fall in love with a person who\u2019s a constant reminder of endearment. How hard is it to not fall in love with such person? ",

Most of them say that they like the way am good at observing things. Where as the rest say am good at being kind, polite and true. There could be many reasons why people would tend to fall in love with an individual; by individual I mean - you must really really stand out of the crowd. What\u2019s the difference between you and other 9 people who are in your team? For people to fall in love with you - you must be a super hero of your own life. So anything that comes your way to make you a super hero accept it. Embrace it with both your arms wide open. Those experiences will tell you the direction you are heading; the choices you are making; the ways you are shining. Once you recognize your strengths - Mabrook! you have fallen in love with your own self. Who on earth is not loved by others who is loved by oneself? Cheers! ",

I believe that true love is nothing more than a meeting of souls (or spirits, or your essence, or whatever you prefer to call it - the part of you that makes you you). Anyone who truly sees your soul will love you. And you will love anyone whose soul you see. If you are both open to a romantic relationship when this happens, then love and romance can flourish. If you are not open to romance, then true friendship can bloom. Whether new love can last is a completely different issue - with a completely different set of requirements. But falling in love is easy, and only requires a meeting of souls. ",

I know you might feel bad, and I know It\u2019s hard to do that. But like I said, you can\u2019t make someone feel what you feel about them. It\u2019s very difficult and useless. They will forever in their mind know that they never had \u201cactual\u201d feelings for you. Anyways, good luck. Please just don\u2019t try to make someone feel what they can\u2019t. Love takes time. Maybe wait a bit, see If she/he wants to commit to a relationship. If they don\u2019t, don\u2019t feel bad about it. There is someone there for you in this world.

They say that if a guy spends a few days with a girl then there are high chances that he would fall in love with her. You gotta work out your way. You know how to do that! Just be with him, spend some time with him, try to be interesting and smart; guys love girls who are both, they fall for them much more easily, and I'm pretty sure you're a complete package and every guy would love to be with you! Indulge him in some funny things, and sometimes impress him with your intellectual side. And meanwhile you gotta spot the timings when you need to send out some signals indicating that you'd love him to love you back, and remember, those signals should not be cheesy, they should be genuine and mature enough to engulf him! Most importantly you must understand this simple thing; if you just wanna be in a relationship then you'd get him very easily, but if you really want him to love you then it'd take time for sure, cause although infatuation seems a lot like love but love is something else which infatuation cannot be ever! I'm totally sure you'd win his heart, you're just 18 dear, you're strong, smart and beautiful, you've pretty strong chances and the stars are alligned for you too! Just step out and make it happen! And you can reach for help anytime. Good luck! Cheers!  ",

What do you think the result of that would be? fall in love with yourself. Do character building meditation and service. Connect with your own higher soul. Then bring your true self to everything you do. The side effect of this is you become magnetically attractive to others when you do this. You may even increase their soul contact. This is actually love. Soul contact, with your own soul and with others. So much greater than whatever it is you thought you wanted. ",

To be completely honest I know that there are many women that wanted to be with me but had no idea how to do it so they just had sex with me. That\u2019s not the way. In reality you have to approach them just like they approach women that they are physically attracted to. You have to put yourself out there and expect to get rejected. Then you have to accept that if they don\u2019t want to be with you, that they don\u2019t want to be with you. There is no special magic spell you can cast that will make the obvious not obvious.

That is not how humans work. If you give something of yourself to people then they will do the same. To make a friend you have to help of give something of yourself to that person.  ",

You don\u2019t have to do anything to make him or her love you cause that isn\u2019t gonna happen like how it does in books. My only advice is to just move on and find someone who is very much worth your love and time and loves you back rather than making someone who clearly doesn\u2019t to try and love you cause thats never gonna work unless that person really loves you back.

            "answer_text": "Hi, I'd recommend this TED talk by Mandy Len Catron, titled: Falling in love is the easy part In it she reveals a 36-question 'exercise,' including 4 minutes of sustained eye contact at the end.  The questions can be summed up as escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure. Mandy has tested the tool, and claims that if a couple both agree to go through it together, they stand an excellent chance they will fall in love.  She and her current partner fell in love that way over a year ago. However, as suggested by the title of her talk, it's only the beginning. A couple of her observations are: -   Everyone wants to be loved: to be known, to be seen and to be understood.-   Love doesn't just happen to us.  We're in love because we each made the choice to be. Mandy then raises poignant questions, about the vulnerability you feel when you make that choice, as in 'what happens if one person or the other backs out?' -   How do you decide who deserves your love, and who does not?-   How do you stay in love when things get difficult?-   How do you know when to just cut and run?-   How do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship?-   How do you live with your partner's doubt? Hope all this gives you a bit better idea of what it takes to fall in love and sustain a love relationship.  Warmly ... Michael ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, fall in love with yourself as you are. That should help you develop self confidence and self esteem in you. Then, show love and care for others whom you like without expecting anything in return. Please understand that people do not fall in love just because you love them back or show care. You cannot force them to love you. They should feel attracted to you. But, your care and love is the first step for you to show them that you like them very much. That may make them feel attracted to you. If they do not, move on. But, continue to show care and love. In short, be like a symbol of love without holding any grudge or harbouring any hatred for anyone. Remember, the world is full of people who are willing to reciprocate your love if you are patient and look for them without any animosity in your heart for those who refuse to love you in return. Soon, you may find yourself difficult to decide when flooded with choices! ",

If she finds you are for real and you do have all those qualities, treat her like a princess and she could fall madly in love with you. But beware; the first one that could fall in love with you could be your 80 years old neighbor who finds you so sweet! ",

All you do is create opportunities for the other person to see you in a loving light and maybe imagine what loving you might do for them. If there is chemistry (which can\u2019t be forced), he or she will notice your loving attitude and will want to receive more of it\u2026to do so, they will have to show love themselves and you have gotten the love wheel to turn.

Let them know you are interested and let go till they are in the same state. You can force anyone to fall in love with you unless they feel the same about you. If you really want them to fall for you but you are not thinking long term, then just be a person they want you to be. Act the way she/ he likes, behave in a way that she is impressed by you. This method has its consequence in long term though. Say, you are in relation for two years and he/she is totally in love with the actor you. They might feel you are changing from who you are, when you try to show the real you.They might be offended that you are going against their wish just to annoy themThat you will end up fighting because your real interests or emotions dont match up",

All you can do is keep your heart open for when love finds you. I know that sounds like a mindless, unrealistic clich\u00e9, but it really is how love works. You never know how, when, or who will come to fall in love. The only real action you can take in order to invite more love into your life is to learn how to love yourself better. Having self-respect, and allowing that love for yourself to emanate out to the others around you, will invite more love in. No guarantees. ",

It doesn't mean you must have the same vaue system with everything. If he believes in god but you don't and hes good with that and so are you, then fine. It's when a persons value system is up against someone who believe in the opposite that partnerships crack. Much of what is called love, is in fact infatuation. Don't get them confused. ",

Attempting to control other people is a form of disrespect \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want people doing that to you, would you? So my advice would be to lose the need to control, be yourself, be less narcissistic, have empathy for others, make yourself interesting; and you will be more likely to attract a mate who is a good match for you. If you absolutely are driven to control (as a psychopath or sociopath would be), then please don\u2019t damage other peoples\u2019 lives.

However, this will probably lead to a relationship in which you cannot be yourself because you are so afraid that you will be rejected if hyour partner sees your true self. The best thing you cann do is wait and be you. Before you know it, along will come someone who loves you just as you are. Good luck. ",

If you have a connection with someone, you should keep that connection alive.

Also, watch trying to please everyone; when you're off pleasing one, you may end up hurting someone else more important to you in the process.

If you want to attract people, you can't live your life as an asshole. Good people attract other good people. A bad person will never attract a good person. There is hope for you however. Start acting kindly and graciously to people (all people), especially people that can do nothing for you. You must be genuine about this. It cannot be an act. In time, you'll begin to attract good people. If you don't do this, you'll never be happy. You'll only see other people as tools and people don't like to be used, so they will avoid you, and you'll die alone. Good luck. ",

Just try to care him and make him yours. It's good that you are telling this and not your boyfriend. Try to give me more times of yours too. Make him feel that you are there with him always with good and bad times also. This makes him stronger feeling that someone is with him always and for this he will never leave you. Build the trust and never leave the trust. Make sure he gains the trust with you keeps it. Because in love trust matters most if you both don't trust each other then there is no point at all.

Most of the time I'm a calm person while single, but add male or female to the picture, then there is a problem.

I don't know what I would do If I ever fell madly in love with someone. I feel like my heart could possibly stop beating and evict itself from my body because it would be overwhelming. I never get to be myself in the relationships which is why its hard for me to fall in\u2026 laaaaoove. I just feel unlovable period, so it feels kind of weird to answer this question, not at all in a bad way. It just makes me wonder, why I feel that way. I hope I answered your question. ",
