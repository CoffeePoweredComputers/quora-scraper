            "answer_text": "Right or wrong in what way? The \u201capocryphal\u201d books (deuterocanon is the correct term) are books that happen to be rejected among the Jewish people in the late first century, according to a historical event known as \u201cThe Council of Jamnia\u201d around 90AD. Whether or not this event ever occurred is actually the subject of debate in history, and the general consensus is that it never happened. Regardless, it becomes a question of who has the authority to say what\u2019s Scripture? The take of modern Protestantism to follow the Jewish model actually doesn\u2019t make sense. The people who rejected Jesus are the ones to be trusted as to having the accurate Scriptures pertaining to him? That seems strange. Historically, it's easy to show that the books were accepted long before the Council of Trent in 1545\u201365. At the Council of Florence in 1431, the issue of the Canon of Scripture was discussed, and 73 books were listed. 46 Old Testament, 27 New Testament. Literally a millenium beforehand, around the year 415, Jerome finished his translation of the Vulgate, containing 73 books: 46 Old Testament, 27 New Testament. Jerome included those books despite his questions about their authenticity. Why? Because it wasn't his call. Before that, there were other councils- A synod at Carthage in 397 decided on 73 books- 46 Old Testament, 27 New Testament. Ten years prior, a synod at Hippo had decided on a canon of 73 books- 46 Old Testament, 27 New Testament. A synod at Rome in 382, five years before Hippo, published a canon of 73 books- 46 Old Testament, 27 New Testament, under the authority of Pope Damasus. Before that time, there literally was not a Bible. Before that, Scripture was \u201cwhat the local bishop says is Scripture.\u201d That's why you end up with things like the Shepherd of Hermas or Clement\u2019s Letter to the Corinthians as counted among Canons in the first two centuries. Luther was not the first one to suggest Scripture was smaller. But he was about 1200 years late to the party. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a bunch of reasons why the deuterocanon was rejected by Protestants. For one, it was rejected by the Jews. The Old Testament that was in common use at the time of Christ was the Greek Septuagint. Even though those books were there, they were relegated to non-inspired usage. Jesus seems to list what He considered canon when in Luke 11:51 He stated \u201cfrom the blood of Abel (Genesis) to the blood of Zechariah (possibly not the person who wrote the Book of Zechariah; many bible historians suggest a different prophet, from 2 Chronicles though this could be wrong \u2014 see in comments below), who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. These characters were bookends of the Old Testament. Furthermore, Jesus, nor any of the writers of the New Testament makes a quote from any of the Apocryphal books; they might even quote Pagan Philosophers but not the Apocrypha and considering how many quotes are pulled from the Old Testament; this is very significant. Finally in 2 Timothy 3:16 Scripture is described as God-breathed. That means inspired; consider the nature of many of the Apocryphal literature; there are allusions to non-biblical supernaturalism; verses which seem more concerned to giving glory to some man rather than to God and things which downright would never be said of something that is supposedly inspired. Consider this quote from 2 Maccabees 15:38 \u201cIf it is well told and to the point, that is what I myself desired; if it is poorly done and mediocre, that was the best I could do\u201d. Why would the author apologize for mistakes if God co-authored the text. ",

            "answer_text": "They were absolutely right. None of these books/fragments contain the key words \u201cthus says the LORD\u201d, showing that they are a revelation of God. The quality of the ethics is much lower and often involves folk magic/things denied by the accepted books. Historically oriented things are inaccurate, including rulers and locations. No recognized prophet wrote them. The Jewish People never accepted them, and they have not been found in any Hebrew editions that I know of, but only in Greek and other languages. The Catholic Church formally accepted them after the Reformation, to counterract Protestant claims that the Bible made the Church rather than the Church the Bible. Early scholars like Jerome rejected them for the Hebrew canon. Unlike canonical Scriptures, they are not quoted authoritatively by Jesus, the Apostles, or the Post Apostolic Church. They make for interesting reading about the time between the Testaments, but are not divinely inspired, and do not claim to be so. ",

            "answer_text": "A better question would be \"Why in the world were the deuterocanonical books included with the protocanonical books as part of the Koine Greek translation of the Tanakh which became the Septuagint?\" My conclusion is that when the translation was commissioned by Ptolemy the scholars, who were Greek-fluent Alexandrinian jews - not Hebrew-fluent rabbinic scribes, gathered up the Hebrew scrolls that were in the Library of Alexandria, not the official scrolls of the Masoretic Text, and simply translated them all! Since the text was now in the lingua franca of Middle East it went viral! But rabbinic Judaism rejected the Septuagint as being a valid Jewish scriptural text for a variety of valid reasons. So, to correct a popular misconception, the protestants did not reject the deuterocanon, they just chose the official Hebrew Bible used throughout rabbinic Judaism as the Old Testament for those same reasons. Others just went with the easy to read Greek version with the extra material! ",
