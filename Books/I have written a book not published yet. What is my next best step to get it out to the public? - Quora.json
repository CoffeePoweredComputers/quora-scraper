            "answer_text": "You probably have a first draft now. So you'll need to work on it more before even thinking on sending it to a publisher for their consideration. Get a beta reader, someone who can be honest with you, who can help you find any plot wholes, tell you if a character is not consistent, etc. It takes a lot of work to have a book ready to be published. When you have really finished working on it, send it to publishing houses (you need to do some research first, find out where they're open for submissions, check if your novel fits their catalogue). And be patient. They may or may not reply. You may be lucky, or they may all say no. But never give up. You can self-publish too. Or keep trying until your book is accepted. A \u201cno\u201d doesn't speak of your book's quality (think of the many times Harry Potter was rejected). ",
