            "answer_text": "To quote that famous American called Donald Rumsfeld There are things that we know that we know and there are things that we know that we don\u2019t know and things that we don\u2019t know that we don\u2019t know. So when it comes to \u201cBackpackers\u201d well we just don\u2019t know as they just turn up out of the wild blue yonder and they are there for a while and then as quick as they came they are Gone again. I was staying in a small town for a while where backpackers were seeking employment for fruit picking but because of the severity of the Drought at the time there was No Work so they only stayed a day or two and moved on or at least I assumed that they did. I mean I never followed up on their plans or their ideas so anything could have happened and in true Australian style It is none of my business. I was watching that Movie called Razor-Back which is about some Wild Pig that has a habit of eating people and I started thinking Oh Dear Me I do hope that those Poor Backpackers never came across any hungry Pigs. We have had a long and dry spell which can change the habits of our Wild Animals that live out West and even the four legged ones can become unpredictable. The two legged feral\u2019s were always \u201cDifferent\u201d and totally unpredictable. Last week I was driving way out West as I sometimes do and as always there is \u201cRoad Kill\u201d along the way and as the journey was taking longer than I expected due to me doing the right thing and driving according to the conditions and so whether I was getting tired or it was the angle of the sun reflecting off the road surface but I am sure that I saw a squashed back-pack laying beside the road. I was going to stop but there was a Road Train just behind me and then I thought about being questioned for hours by the local Constabulary and all the Paperwork and so I did a Sergeant Schultz and \u201cI Saw Nothing \u2026 Nothing\u201d \u2026\u2026 There was a Movie called \u201cWolf Creek\u201d and I cannot remember the story or even if I saw it myself or if the kids saw it and were telling me about it but it has some Psycho who was terrorising Backpackers or at least I think that is how it went and as we all know most movies are based on facts or at least I think they are. Obviously this was just a Movie and I know this because the Girls are Good-Looking as they always are in the movies. There was a case recently where some Farmer had some girls detained and was having his way with them and so if we hear about One then there may well be more that have tried this idea. Then most of the Backpackers that I have seen would be too smart to fall for those tricks as they are not stupid. But to answer your question as to how many Backpackers just disappear here in Australia each year and the answer is most probably None in all honesty. ",

Two criminals come immediately to mind:-1989 \u2013 1993 Ivan Milat \u201cthe Backpacker murders\u201d (2001) Bradley John Murdoch murdered Peter Falconio Occasionally people get lost hiking in the bush &/or outback. Some of those folks are backpackers. Most often they get found alive. ",
