            "answer_text": "The copyright is yours automatically. But if you want some kind of stamped proof that it is yours, you can do a simple thing. Print out your entire manuscript, put your name and the date of completion on it. Send it to your own address using the government postal service of your country. When it returns to you, keep the packet safely, unopened. It is now officially stamped and dated by a government agency. If at some later point of time, you find yourself in need of proof that the story you are claiming as yours is indeed yours, you may produce the packet. I was told of this in a creator\u2019s workshop being held by a team of copyright lawyers in New Delhi a few years ago. ",
