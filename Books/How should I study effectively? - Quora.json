            "answer_text": "I judged the question as to studying and then doing well in the exam on the subject. My experience stemmed from approach studying for my GCE O level exam in Biology, Physics, Mathematics and English I scored \u2018distinctions\u2019 for those subjects. You must \u201cimmerse\" into the subject matter. For example in biology, imagine you as the (white) cell fighting against bacteria.English read a lot of newspapers (one or two days old) as I was in an orphanage.Physics, I imagine myself an astronaut flying through our solar system looking for special minerals to cure cancer.Mathematics just practice and develop questions based on formula that were taught in class.I spent long hours reading and rarely speak with other kids in orphanage. Hahaha \u2026\u2026most thought I was a \u201cmongloid\". ",
