            "answer_text": "FACT: If it\u2019s digitized, it can be copied. Whether it\u2019s an e-book, a document, a video, a picture. If it\u2019s on the internet and can be viewed on a device, it can be copied. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) have been rendered virtually obsolete because technology is streets ahead of the safeguards that\u2019s supposed to protect artistic content authors. I would love to make you feel warm and fuzzy by offering platitudes of reassurance that is hyped by content platforms. But that is a denial of reality. As an author myself, I have used ebooks for some of my own work. But their only value is as a marketing tool for a hard copy such as a paperback book. For instance, let\u2019s say that I write a stunning novel about the financial crisis. The feedback is incredibly positive. Now it\u2019s time to merchandise it. I know that if I release it as an e-book and it\u2019s even moderately successful, the chances of illegal copying are exponential. So I don\u2019t. Instead, I do what major movie companies do. They take snippets of their movie and turn it into an explosive trailer that is viewed free of charge on content platforms such as YouTube. This whets the appetite of the potential audience and, if done right, creates a buzz on social media. So how do you do that with a book? It\u2019s a similar process. But do not confuse this with a book blurb or a synopsis. With a novel, there will be parts of the story that are scary, intriguing, tragic, funny or violent. Very carefully, pull out some of the most dynamic quotes and test market the hell out of each one. Find the ones that fascinates your potential audience and leaves them begging for more. Once you\u2019ve got at least a dozen, turn it into a novella with a max reading time of 5 minutes. THAT IS YOUR E-BOOK. With a link to your paperback book and this e-book MUST be free. Now I know some people reading this will be asking, \u201cWhat about the people who like to read the whole book on e-readers? I don\u2019t want to lose out on their business.\u201d Well let me tell you something that the e-reader promoters don\u2019t want you to know. First, e-book sales of novels and children\u2019s books are way, way down. WHY? First, because almost everyone expects online content to be free and prices are in free fall. Second, most e-readers are now on tablets and phones. So, just as you\u2019re getting into the story\u2026.. the phone rings, there\u2019s a text message, a Facebook alert or the battery runs out. So the reader loses their concentration, gets distracted and never finishes which is leaving them annoyed and frustrated. Third, readers, including parents, are voting with their pocket book. Physical book sales are rising again. They also make a great gift item for birthdays, Christmas and other gift-giving occasions. When did you last get an e-book as a present. Try unwrapping that. So, the e-book market, in these kind of categories, are diminishing. So use the e-book platform to promote the full physical book and give your readers something tangible to touch, read and enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "How do I protect e-books from being copied and printed? There really isn\u2019t any good way to do this. Some places offer DRM protection when they distribute your e-books, but any kind that I have ever heard of can be gotten around by anyone who wants to badly enough. Truth be told, it is rare for any of us to write something that others want so badly they will bother to copy or print them. Nearly all the professional writers I know just don\u2019t even bother to think about it, which is the way they, for the most part, approach the idea of piracy and unauthorized fanfiction. Unless something is blatant, there is rarely anything you can do about it, so why worry about it until it happens? ",
