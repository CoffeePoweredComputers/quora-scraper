            "answer_text": "I'll assume that anything is being used as an euphemism here. Of course you remember a lot of things from what you learned in school and read in books. But it is perfectly normal to feel you don't remember much of it, becasue on average, our memory is not very good at details, specially in making them available to you when you want them. Regarding school, we learn so much useless stuff, required to memorize so many dates, events, formulas, weird names, etc - it feels like as soon as we finish our exams where we use all that stuff, it's purged from our memory forever. It's not. It's there somewhere, but since you don't use it, it's is thrown into an underground archive along with all other stuff you don't even remember that you don't remember. Some people have better memory than others, and if you keep comparing yourself to people with amazing memories, this feeling that you don't remember anything will get even worse. You'll remember what is important to you. You will not remember all the books you read, only the ones that impacted you the most. Also, you must keep in mind that you might not be aware of how much you are really aware when learning or reading something. I read a lot, dozens of books a year. But sometimes, maybe because I'm stressed in a specific period of my life, my reading might get affected by random thoughts distracting me, so a month after finishing reading a book it feels like I forgot most of it. So, again, you're not alone in this. It is perfectly normal. My wife keeps saying that I have an amazing memory for books, movies and stuff that I learned in school, and that she doesn't. But she is a doctor, and remember all those insane number of weird names and symptoms associated with diseases, treatments, ad infinitum - that I would never be able to memorize. It's different for everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The thing called \"learning\" in most schools doesn't work. It flies in the face of decades of research, but it's so entrenched, most schools do it anyway, and most people simply accept it, saying things like, \"I learned how to learn.\"  The primary way we learn (and retain information) is by active trial-and-error, not by studying books. And we have to keep reinforcing what we've learned or we forget it. ",
