            "answer_text": "First, congratulations on an incredible accomplishment! A few thoughts:Your book only has one review on Amazon, try to get 10-12 reviews- ask friends, teachers, etc. You can email them your .mobi file or PDF if they're not Kindle unlimited subscribers.Since your audience is mainly going to be in the 12-18 range, I'm not sure only offering it via Kindle Unlimited and paperback is a good idea. You'll know this better than I do, but do very many teens subscribe to Kindle Unlimited? Maybe you'd do better putting it on as a regular Kindle book for .99 or 1.99, and spreading out to some of the other distribution channels, Google Books and i-books are really gaining popularity. Try to get YA book bloggers to review it. Here are some resource lists, http://urbanepics.com/best-ya-blogs-bookreviewers/http://yabookblogdirectory.blogspot.com/p/ya-book-blogger-list.html but also I'd just search on YA book blogs and see which individual ones come up as they're probably the ones seeing the most traffic. Most YA writers are adults, an author the same age as her target audience is very unusual and this is a huge promotional point in your favor that I believe the bloggers would find intriguing- also your Watty award.Facebook pages are free to set up. https://www.facebook.com/help/104002523024878?helpref=about_contentThis is different from a profile, you could use it specifically as an author page that serves the same purpose as a website, where you can play up your age, unique bio and interests. I've been told at various conferences that Twitter is really important, because frequent Tweets will raise you in the search engines. The Facebook page and Twitter account with your book cover, bio and links to Amazon should help get your name out and build credibility with the bloggers. Hope these ideas help, best of luck and keep writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Unlike traditional publishing, self-publishing is a \u2018long tail\u2019 game. It relies on a high-quality cover, good editing, a genius blurb/book description, and most important of all, an outstanding story with memorable characters that finishes in a way that leaves the reader satisfied and yet eager for more of the same. You\u2019re not looking to sell over a thousand books within a few days with your debut release. You\u2019re looking to build up your audience over time. Playing the \u2018long tail\u2019 means that while you do small, inexpensive (or free) things to promote your work, your main form of promotion will be word-of-mouth from satisfied readers and the release of more books. Many writers find it\u2019s easier to find some success through writing series. But whether you write series or stand alone books, you have to release new books on a regular basis. Most writers find a release schedule of 2\u20134 books a year really helps keep your visibility up. Unless you have a fantastic production team, often it\u2019s more realistic to release one book a year. Once you learn the ropes, often you can write and revise faster, so as long as you have an editor, cover artist and formatter that can keep up with you, (or you learn how to do your own formatting using best practices), you\u2019ll be able to release more books than one a year. Set up an author page on Facebook. This will be separate from your personal profile. Of course you\u2019re going to want to post when you have a new release or get a nice review, but mainly try to keep your readers entertained. No one likes a sell-sell-sell feed on their facebook page. You can create memes with quotes from your book, post about your progress on your latest work, and share writing or reading related posts. If you can reduce your book price to 99 cents or better yet free for a short duration, you can advertise through Free Kindle Books and Tips. Depending on the genre, you might also find value in The Book Barbarian or The Fussy Librarian. I would not recommend Bookbub or Net Galley. Go ahead and set up a profile on Bookbub, but I think you\u2019ll find that even if you managed to get a promotional through them (which is difficult when you don\u2019t have a reputation) you\u2019ll find it too expensive for your budget. Net Galley can be helpful for some authors, but many authors have found that they get an unusual number of one star reviews and dnfs. IMHO, it\u2019s not worth the risk because if you do get a bunch of one star reviews, they\u2019ll follow you forever. Home - Free Kindle Books and Tips Book Barbarian Free Personalized Book Suggestions Assuming you have a print version and depending on the genre, you can sometimes find events to sell your books like local home shows, festivals, conferences and conventions. It\u2019s best if you can share a table with other authors to help reduce table fees and so that the book display will be more dynamic. You won\u2019t usually make much money during these events, but it will increase your visibility and may attract readers to check out the ebook. Be sure to have a good supply of business cards that include the cover of your book, and shortened links to your website, facebook page, and the retailer that sells the most volume of your books. (Most people use Amazon.) You can also include a QR code. Here\u2019s an article about QR code: 7 Best Free Online QR Code Generator 2016 - DesignMaz And here\u2019s a book to get you started if you want to go to events to hand sell your books: Amazon.com: Working the Table: An Indie Author's Guide to Conventions eBook: Lee French, Jeffrey Cook: Kindle Store I hope this helps! If you have any more questions or if you want to get more specific about the kind of trouble you\u2019re having so that I can answer those difficulties directly, please comment. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t read your book but, chances are, your book is not as good as you think it is. Now, for self publishing there are dozens of alternatives, from Amazon, wich let you sell your book on digital copy and paper, printed on demmand, to self printing your book at home, and taking it to your local library. It doesn\u2019t matter what way you choose, the thing to celebrate now is that you finished it. I learn how to print books at home for a really low price (I live in Dominican Republic, Amazon and online sales are not an option here) and I enjoy the process. Later, when I grew up I felt ashamed about everything. My stories suck!!! But now I realize that it was necessary for me to do that in order to learn. If you are really trying to get something (economically) from your book, show it to an honest reader who can give you some advice. And your school and neighborhood is a better place to start selling than any fancy library. Make your fan base where you have fans first. And good luck!! ",

There are also book promo commercial sites that will advertise your books if you have them free or 99 cents, but you must be 18 to sign up with them so I am thinking you\u2019d need a parent to do that for you since you\u2019re not 18 yet (I am presuming.) Robin Reads, E-Reader News Today, Book Gorilla, there are tons of sites that will do promo, even some folks on fiverr will do promo. But you may need to have a parent be the site account holder if you are not 18.
