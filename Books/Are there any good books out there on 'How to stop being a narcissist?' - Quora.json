You don\u2019t \u201cStop being the ultimate form of evil,\u201d and this has always been the case. If you could stop being a narcissist, it means you never had the condition in the first place, and weren\u2019t a narcissist. Narcissism is not proof of the condition, everybody has it. You don\u2019t think you\u2019re an angel, the perfect good\u2026? But Narcissists surely use this on a higher degree than anybody. Again. You don\u2019t quit autism, and the idea something implemented in a person\u2019s identity could be simply dismissed is ludicrous. That idea is why people become sheep for the narcissist. Brainwashed fools unable to escape manipulation. You\u2019re carrying baggage unknowingly. ",

The game is what it is, and even though it has social advantages, and even though there are quora users who are gaining popularity here, we can\u2019t change them. In fact, if you ever give that person a book, the tables will turn and calls you crazier than they are. They want to be far more superior on basically everything. But yep, to answer your question, I\u2019m going to give a book. Not for them, but for you. Coping with Infuriating, Mean, Critical People: The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern ",

You can't get away from them: WE ARE THEM. It's all just a matter of degree. The other problem involves the central premise of your question: narcissism essentially can't be stopped. Hypothetically, NPD or narcissistic personality disorder, appears to be an unconscious process, and is considered, in fact, a delusional disorder.
