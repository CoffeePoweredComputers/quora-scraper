            "answer_text": "This is a great questionI The problem of authenticity of grimoire date back to the dark ages and in point of fact it is exceedingly difficult to find a grimoire with a chain of custody sufficient to establish authenticity. Adding to the problem as you can imagine since authentic grimoire are exceedingly rare, exceedingly small in number, one might say a vanishingly small number asymtotically approaching zero. This is unsurprising since most people on seeing one would assume that the writing there is some sort of random animal scratches as though ink and claw were drawn across the page and toss it into the trash. Some experts on Grimoire such as Professor Sybill Trelawney, PoD, hold that the scratches are actually just that, crudely forming runes in the which may, like tea leaves at the bottom of a cup, be read by those possessing the gift. Other experts have suggested that Professor Trelawney\u2019s manifestly obvious myopia has created confusion over the nature of the runes. Those experts hold that the markings are in an ancient language and not at all something that must be \u201cread\u201d like tea leaves. At all events most practitioners of magick agree with professor Trelawney which is wholly consistent with the provenance of the grimoire themselves. The only question is why anyone would want the memoirs of large black spectral dogs in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "First answer: don\u2019t. Sacred Texts Archive has plenty, and they\u2019re free. Read these first, they\u2019ll give you an idea of what is typical of an historic text. Second answer: don\u2019t be fooled by how \u201cauthentic\u201d something looks. A knobby leather binding with clasps, parchment-looking sheets, antique-looking calligraphy, and lots of stains, doodling, and odd scripts is no guarantee of age or content. In fact, I\u2019d hazard that the \u201cparchment\u201d is actually textured paper, and the whole was concocted as someone\u2019s term project in art school, sometime in the Seventies. Learn what an actual old book looks like: the rag paper, the binding, what colors of ink they used. Study how Crowley\u2019s Magical Records were kept: they were as clean as a lab notebook. Also: expect to pay. A lot. Third: if it says \u201cBook of Shadows\u201d, it\u2019s modern. Case closed. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you read ancient Aramaic or Classical Greek? How about Coptic or can you decipher a translation from Medieval Latin into 16th century German? That\u2019s how you know 99 times out of a 100 that an old book is not a real grimoire. Now of course a few have been translated into modern English, maybe but there would be very few copies and in special libraries like the Vatican. It\u2019s good that they aren\u2019t available as they would be ridiculously dangerous. Now I\u2019m not referring to Books of Shadows that are occasionally published. They are books of a Witch\u2019s trial and error and a collection of things that worked. My example would be a BoS is like a cookbook of things that work and have worked safely, while a grimoire is like directions for building a nuclear reactor written in code in an ancient dialect of a foreign language that\u2019s designed to hurt anyone who it isn\u2019t meant for. I would stay away from anything claiming to be a formal grimoire unless it\u2019s just a name for a person\u2019s spell book who you trust and have been given permission to look. ",

If you head over there, and find it referenced then you can be assured that it is at least authentic as any grimoire can be.
