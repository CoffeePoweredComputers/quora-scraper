            "answer_text": "Hard to say. The movie sacrifices some of the complexity (and a few of the more troubling details) from the novel in the interests of fitting the whole story into a two-hour package (and not troubling the censors). The novel lacks the Hitchcockian touches that made Hitch a legend in suspense film making. On the whole, I think I\u2019d have to say the novel was better. But the movie is one of Hitchcock\u2019s best. They\u2019re both wonderful, and can both be enjoyed, whether you\u2019re primarly a fan of Hitchcock or primarily a fan of du Maurier. ",

I think I finished the book in two days it was that good and one of my all time favorite books! I heard they are remaking the movie Rebecca with Lily James and Arnie Hammer so I am curious as to how close they stay loyal to the book on that one. ",
