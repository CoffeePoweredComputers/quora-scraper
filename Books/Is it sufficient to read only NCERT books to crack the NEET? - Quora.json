            "answer_text": "It is advisable that you read the NCERT thoroughly and complete all the in-text questions and exercises given in a particular chapter. Once you are done doing that, pick up a proper book for NEEt, for example, the previous year's questions, and start solving and practicing questions from there. Note that you need to finish the first thing i.e finishing NCERT before proceeding to other books. After you have finished solving the previous year questions, do sit for time bound full-length mock tests and analyze your score. This is the basic mantra every NEET aspirant should follow to get a good rank. Also, along with the NCERT, the NCERT Exemplar should be done as questions from that book come too in the exams. in case you have a problem finding the Exemplar book in stores, or you have a shortage of time/money, you can always head over to the MyPustak website, explore and order the books as they are giving it for FREE OF COST. The book will be delivered to your home and you have to just pay the minimum delivery charges and that\u2019s it! Books have been donated by several IIT-JEE and NEET aspirants who have cracked the exams and you might find something useful in those books. So that was my answer on whether NCERT is enough to crack NEET and I hope it helps you! ",
