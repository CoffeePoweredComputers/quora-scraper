            "answer_text": "If one is physically disabled, one cannot afford to be \u2018psychologically\u2019 disabled as well. \u2014 Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking could talk till 1985, then he caught pneumonia on a trip and had to undergo tracheotomy due to which he permanently lost his ability to speak. So communication wasn\u2019t a problem till 1985. For a while, he communicated with a spelling card and formed words and sentences by lifting his eyebrows. Then, he started to use a computer program called Equalizer[1] , created by a company called Words Plus, which allowed him to select words and commands on a computer by using a hand-clicker. It was attached to a speech synthesizer (hardware designed by SpeechPlus[2] ) and allowed him to communicate at the rate of 15 words per minute.  But the nerves that allowed his fingers to use the clicker kept on degrading. By 2008, he was no longer able to use the clicker. After Stephen Hawking lost his speech and then later the use of his hands, he started to use a system that detects facial movements. ACAT[3] (Assistive Context Aware Toolkit) \u2014 a program run by Intel \u2014 allowed him to select characters and words to form his lines. An infrared switch was attached to Hawking's glasses and it could detect when Hawking tensed his cheek muscles, and control the cursor or mouse pointer on a screen accordingly. The cursor scanned the virtual keyboard on the screen of a tablet computer mounted on the arm of his wheelchair. He could select a character by tensing his cheek muscle to stop the cursor and select the required character.  (You can see the sensor attached to his specs) ACAT also had a word prediction algorithm provided by SwiftKey[4] . It was trained on his books (both published and unpublished) and lectures, and it could immediately guess the most appropriate word or phrase after he had typed only a few characters. For example, typing \u2018the\u2019 could predict \u2018black\u2019 and then predict \u2018hole\u2019. Hawking could operate his whole computer by using ACAT to control the mouse in Windows. Stephen Hawking had also experimented with systems that could be controlled by using movements of eyes and eyebrows, but he found it tiring. So he stuck to using the cheek movement sensing one. After Stephen Hawking had typed what he wanted, he could save it in a disk, or send it to his speech synthesizer to change his text into speech. While giving lectures, the text saved on the disk would be sent to an ACAT software called Lecture Manager, which would send it to the speech synthesizer a paragraph at a time. Stephen Hawking wrote his books the same way he wrote his conversations and lectures. i.e., using his cheek movements to select characters after characters. Technology helped him to overcome ALS and do what he wanted. Writing lecture and 15 or more books in this way was a long and painstaking process, and it gives us an idea of how dedicated he was. He also got help from many people while writing. His students would assist him and pass on drafts of his works to his editor in USA via speakerphone. For example, Brian Whitt, one of his students, helped him in revising his book 'A History of Time' (the first draft was prepared before he lost his speech, but was incomplete) and also got him using the Equalizer.
