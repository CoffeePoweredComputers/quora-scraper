            "answer_text": "No, not all the books are free. You do a get a good number of free books. Mostly fiction books are free. You still have to purchase a majority of the good books that are out there. Amazon also provides a \u20b9150 monthly subscription for unlimited book reading. (Basically, for \u20b9150, you can read as many books as you want on your kindle) E-books are like the songs on your phone, you have a lot of them but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve purchased all of them! ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! You can especially get many classic (& therefore out of copyright) works for free. Many living authors also make one or more of their books available for free, as a taster to interest potential readers in their other works. This is very common with the first book in a series featuring the same characters or theme. Non-fiction writers do this too, so as to establish themselves as authorities in their field/experts available for hire/people with non-book products to sell. Here, the free book is a literacy loss leader to lure potential customers. Some authors will put up free books because they have a message to put across, and do not want a price barrier to it's dissemination. Subscribers to Amazon's (paid) Kindle Unlimited service can also choose from a vast number of ebooks, many of which are on sale outside KU, and download them at no extra cost. ",
