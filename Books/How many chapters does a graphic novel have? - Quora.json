            "answer_text": "However many chapters the author(s) want it to have. I am constantly amazed by questions like this. There are no rules in writing fiction. An author can do whatever he or she pleases. No one has the authority to set or enforce rules. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s prose, verse, or graphics \u2014 the entire book can be a single chapter, or you can squeeze multiple chapters onto a single page, or anywhere in between. There isn\u2019t a standard length for graphic novels, either. The page-count is usually a multiple of sixteen because of the way color presses are traditionally set up, but beyond that, no rules. So why would a 48-page graphic novel have the same number of chapters as a 256-page one? Now, if you want to look at what\u2019s most common, a lot of graphic novels were first published as a mini-series of regular comic books, or as part of an ongoing series, and then collected into trade paperback form, with each issue of the original series making up one chapter of the collection. These collections most often contain six issues because the big comic-book publishers have found that to be a convenient length that makes for a good marketable package, but four or five aren\u2019t at all unusual.
