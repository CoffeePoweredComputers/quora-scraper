            "answer_text": "I see Nick as a bit of a drifter who is ultimately disillusioned by what happens with Gatsby. He wrongly believes that this is, as he says, 'a story of the West, after all' , and looks fondly back on 'my Middle West'. To me, this is classic Nick: he is a quintessential dreamer who cannot  help but look back with rose tinted spectacles on the past. (His musings about Gatsby at the beginning of the novel reflect this). To me, Nick doesn't just move back because he is disillusioned but because he wants to believe that what happened  to Gatsby could not happen in the West. He wants to believe that what happened to them all, what corrupted Tom and Daisy and broke Gatsby, was, as he puts it 'some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.'  Maybe he's right, but maybe what Nick doesn't want to believe is that someone like Gatsby, so invested in Daisy and so wrapped up in the lies he's created for himself, could just be 'deficient' for America- not just deficient for the East where he lives. He wants to believe Gatsby would have succeeded in the West, but perhaps we know that this is Nick's wishful thinking.   ",
