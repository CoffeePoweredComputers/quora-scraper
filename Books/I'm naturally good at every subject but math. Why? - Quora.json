            "answer_text": "I like to say when you aren't good at something, you aren't interested and/or you aren't putting in enough effort to really grasp the material. I often use this criteria to understand if I am being lazy, or if I really shouldn't be persuing this path (such as computer science in my case).  Im going to assume that you are at least somewhay interested in the materail (as in not being bored, zoning out, sleeping in class, etc.) and have the desire to do moderately well. Considering you are naturally good at everything but math, you probably expect it to come to you with little or no effort and therefor aren't used to applying the level of commitment necessary to really be excellent at math. If this is the case, then you really need to learn some study habits and time management skills. Also, you should try and fully understand the material instead of mindlessly memorizing formulas.  Taking each class at the proper order is also crucial. This sounds obvious, but there are many programs that often allow your major studies to not move in sync with your math courses. Because this, mathematics should be your first priority so that you reduce the risk of getting lost further down the road.  However, if you find that no matter what you do, you just can't seem to enjoy mathematics, you should strongly considering changing your life plan. Math isn't for everyone and that's okay.   I have also found that any math intensive subject (I.e. physics and especially engineering) requires just as much if not more of a commitment than you give to your mathematics studies as. Don't try and force yourself to be good at something you don't enjoy. You will be miserable in your career and will find that competing with your peers is extremely difficult if not impossible. Sure, you need to work really hard on a few required courses, but by no means should you force a career out of it. ",

            "answer_text": "For the same reason that the student sitting next to you is good at every subject except history. And the student sitting behind you is good at every subject except Spanish. And \u2026. Fact is, people\u2019s talents don\u2019t all lie in the same area. Some are naturally good in math. Some aren\u2019t. (I have a PhD in math and I can say that at least at the high school level it always came easy to me. Languages on the other hand, not so much so. I\u2019m always amazed by polyglots who can speak half a dozen languages fluently.) But your difficulties in math may not simply be a function of your natural talents. It could be any number of things. If you find math difficult (or you\u2019re not doing well in it) it generally follows that you don\u2019t like working at it which means you put less effort into it which means you don\u2019t do well which means you don\u2019t like working at it which means \u2026. you get the idea.It could be inadequate preparation in earlier years. I\u2019ve always described math as a \u201ccumulative subject\u201d. That is, if you don\u2019t know the material you were supposed to learn last year you\u2019re going to have trouble with the material you\u2019re supposed to learn this year. And if you don\u2019t know the material you were supposed to learn two years ago you\u2019re going to have trouble with the material you were supposed to learn last year. And so forth.And it could be your teacher - because different students learn different ways it may be that there is something about the way they explain things that just doesn\u2019t connect. On that topic, if your school has some sort of \u201cdrop in center\u201d or \u201cacademic assistance\u201d you should take advantage of that - those are just rooms staffed with a rotating group of teachers - sometimes all it takes is to have something explained in a slightly different way.I wrote this when someone asked how to improve their math marks - you might find it useful - the comments apply for all math at any level (actually they apply to most subjects) Sam Adams's answer to How do you get high grades in Calculus 3?
