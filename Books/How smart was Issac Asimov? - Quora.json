            "answer_text": "Asimov was extremely intelligent, with an IQ registered at 160. He was vice president of MENSA, earned a doctorate in chemistry, and was professor of biochemistry at the Boston University School of Medicine. He claimed a photographic memory and wrote both fiction and non-fiction at professional typist speeds of about 90 words per minute (an ability which also constrained his literary skills regarding character development and complexity; while he was never a literary master on the order of a Ray Bradbury or Ursula Le Guin, his later works like the prequels and sequels to Foundation demonstrated a deeper skill set in these areas). He published 500 books in 9 out of the 10 major Dewey Decimal system categories. His greatest measure of intelligence, however, was how he (along with Joseph Campbell, Robert Heinlein, and Arthur C. Clarke) helped define the golden age of science fiction, beginning in the 1940s and running into the early 1960s, with his biggest contribution being the Three Laws of Robotics: First Law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws. He also established the first complex future history of a human-based galactic civilization with the Foundation series. His Foundation Trilogy was awarded the special (only one ever) Hugo award for best sf or fantasy series in 1966, which surprised him as he expected it to go to Tolkien for Lord of the Rings. And his short story \u201cNightfall\u201d was awarded a Hugo for best sf short story of all time (later expanded with Robert Silverberg into a novel). One of the most fascinating aspects of Asimov as a futurist was what he got right and what he got wrong. In the Foundation Trilogy, 12,000 years in the future, after the fall of the Empire, we see the appearance of microminiaturized electronics\u2026.which we achieved a few decades later. And in a marvelous short story entitled \u201cThe Fun They Had\u201d Asimov details a future where all education is home-based and computer-based, with students have personal computers for study, research, analysis and review. The idea was that kids in the past must have had so much more fun being in school together socially rather than studying with personal computers on their own. But the kicker? For all his prescience regarding the future role of computers, he did not anticipate natural language input or input devices such as keyboards and mice. Instead, all the kids had to first learn how to program computer cards to feed into the computers to perform any task. ",

He ruled during the \u201cGolden Age of Science Fiction\u201d as a founder of same, and perhaps his best work was the \u201cFoundation Trilogy.\u201d which was a handbook for how to found a civilization. He put out over 500 books, many of them as editor. Back in 1974 I read his book on comedy and still remember this joke. A man asks his lady guest if she\u2019d like brandy or amaretto. She says \u201cAmaretto, please. It reminds me of the open outdoors, the scent of mountain flowers, the friendly taste of honey. And besides, brandy makes me fart.\u201d I refer to him as Saint Isaac.  ",
