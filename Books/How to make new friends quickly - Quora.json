            "answer_text": "When you say quickly, I assume that you are talking about you having less time to invest in this area. Though making friends needs a generous amount of dedication, it doesn\u2019t necessarily needs a lot of time to dedicate. The work can be done in a less time or fast as well but only if you know how to act in the right way. I have some ways to approach strangers and become friends with them. I can share some of my ways with you. Here are 3 ways to help make friends quickly: Be Proactive To be proactive means to take control of a situation by making things happen. When it comes to making friends, you might need to take the opening step. The more proactive you are in reaching out to others, the faster you will be able to gain new friends. Welcome your neighbors, invite them for dinner at your place or a small get together. Approach a stranger walking down the street or sitting in a coffee shop and just say Hi! and there you go, both of you are pulling up a great conversation now. Be yourself When you approach someone be absolutely yourself. It will work in your favor. You can cut all the bullshit and just be sincere, honest about who you are, what are your interests and what are you looking for in a friend. When you sound genuine, the friendship can develop much quicker and last a lot longer than a temporary or false friend. Go online Internet is the solution to everything. If you really want things to be quick then you should definitely check out some apps online. There are some really good apps on play store which help you find friends who you can easily connect with. They also show you the similarities in your personality. This helps you in not wasting your time talking to a lot of people, you can directly approach people who you want to be friends with. Some of these apps that I have used are meetup ( http://meet.com ), Glynk ( Chat & Meet New People - Friendship App - Apps on Google Play ), Skout ( SKOUT ). Hope you find this information helpful!

            "answer_text": "How do I make new friends? What a compelling question. It begs for clarification, but since I have none, I\u2019ll offer some thoughts to ponder: How have you made friends in the past?What type of friends do you want?Why do you want friends to begin with?In the past, I made friends by being out in the world. I can remember the first day of 5th grade at a new school. While I was waiting for the teacher to arrive and open the classroom door, there was another student there waiting and we started talking. We became good friends that day. We remained friends until we went to different schools in 8th grade, sadly l0osing touch. I was fortunate, I suppose, that my family moved a lot when I was growing up. I attended four different elementary schools, two different junior high schools and only one high school. By the time I got to high school, I was pretty good at making friends. I was friends with kids from the whole spectrum of social status. My closest friends came from the associations I spent the most of my time, in this case, the band. I enjoy music, so naturally, I gravitated toward the musically talented kids. I learned that making friends is easy, if you are open to it. I would listen to others and decide if they were the type of people I wanted to spend my time with. I used these same skills in college, but to a lesser degree, since I wasn\u2019t really there to make friends. Whenever I got a new job, I would build report with coworkers and customers alike. I would form bonds that last until this day. After college, I fell in with a group of creative and fun folks who would become some of my longest lasting friendships (Going on 20+ years). I met them all through one person I met at work. My longest lasting friendship is with a guy who was best man in my wedding and invited me to be best man in his. We\u2019ve been friends since we were toddlers and although he lives over 1400 miles away, I still communicate with him. I spend a lot of my time on social networking sites and I have developed my skills for the digital age. I professionally make friends for my clients all across North America, each day. I build report wherever people gather on the internet because, first, I listen and then provide value. I look for pockets of value (Like Quora) where people I want to meet tend to gather. Some tools I use for meeting new people in person are: Eventbrite and Meetup Facebook and LinkedIn groups are also a great way to meet people locally through aligned interest. As a business person, I often attend events in my community where other business people congregate and I look for honorable business-people with integrity to partner with or simply befriend. At my church, I seek out, with intention, new faces in the crowd and introduce myself. Some of my best friends today are other men in the church who are married, have children my kids age and hold themselves to a higher standard than most of society. Does that mean they are perfect? On the contrary, but just as I hold them accountable, they hold me to a higher position than I could have reached personally. If I were to travel to a new city, where I had no connections and knew nobody who lived there, I would make friends quickly and easily. I know, because in 2008 I moved to Texas from California. I was very lonely for a short period of time and then I started making friends. First with my coworkers, then their friends and family, then with customers. I joined social networking sites that were specifically designed for getting people together in person (unlike dating sites, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t use those as well), like ModelMahem and OKCupid. I used Google to find fun events around town on obscure calendar sites and on the local newspapers calendar. I started asking my friends where they met great people and I started going to those places\u2026 Lastly, my friends introduce me to new friends. Many of the best people I consider my friends came from introductions from a current friend. Making friends is easy. Know what you like, and find other people who like it too. And always remember to have fun. Remember, friends are God\u2019s way of saying sorry for your family. ",

            "answer_text": "Making friends when you\u2019re young can be as simple as sharing a toy or deciding that we\u2019re suddenly \u201cbest friends.\u201d But the older we get, the significantly less straightforward it becomes \u2014 at least it can feel that way. It\u2019s probably been a while since many of us had to put ourselves out there. We might feel out of practice and, at the very least, a little confused about what we should actually say to someone we\u2019d like to get to know better. There isn\u2019t one right way to approach someone you want to be friends with, but here are a few ideas that might help. 1. Highlight a similarity Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: \u201cWhat! You too? I thought I was the only one.\u201d \u2013 C.S. Lewis It\u2019s true what they say; the root of friendship is often an underlying similarity, whether it\u2019s a shared interest, hobby, or sense of humor. That\u2019s why pointing out something you have in common is a great way to approach someone you want to be friends with. Commenting on your shared love of hiking, sushi, or jazz music shows that you\u2019re paying attention to and are interested in the other person and can set the stage for future conversations and outings, and a friendship. The key is to not force it. Avoid exaggerating and don\u2019t try to be someone you\u2019re not. Noticing and highlighting genuine similarities will not only make you feel more comfortable approaching someone, it\u2019ll also help you come across as authentic and increases the chances that you\u2019ll actually hit it off. 2. Ask them a question Asking someone a question is another option. But if you really want to have a chance at sparking an actual conversation, it\u2019s best to avoid questions about the current time or weather. Come up with thoughtful, open-ended questions, ones that you actually care about learning the answers to. Ask for a specific restaurant recommendation, a new workout class, or the best nearby cafe to work from. If it\u2019s someone you know a little bit, ask for feedback on something you\u2019ve written or created. These kinds of questions show that you have an interest in the other person\u2019s opinion, which suggests that you trust them. They also give a glimpse into your own personality and make follow-up conversations \u2014 like chatting about how that exercise class went or even suggesting that you go to one together \u2014 a little easier! 3. Pay them a compliment Compliments from strangers or people we don\u2019t know that well can be so powerful. They are often unexpected and deeply appreciated. That\u2019s why it can be such an impactful way to approach someone we want to be better friends with. It might feel easier to compliment the things that are obvious, like physical appearance or style, but if you feel up to it, make it something a little more personal. Compliment their work ethic, creativity, insightful comment, compassion, or great laugh. Explain what you love about it and why it moves you. These kinds of genuine, perceptive compliments are the ones that stick with us. And moving beyond the superficial can make people feel seen and heard in ways that really foster connection and friendship. Report this ad The one caveat: When it comes to compliments, it\u2019s best to avoid going overboard. Usually, the more you give, the more insincere they can start to feel. And ideally, most of us want friendships that are based on balance and equality, not adulation. 4. Offer help One of the main things that separates good friends from casual acquaintances is the ongoing emotional, practical, and social support. That\u2019s why letting someone know that you\u2019re there if they need help, (e.g., solving a problem with a school or work assignment, or even with some heavy lifting) is a great away to approach them and subtly let them know that you\u2019re interested in being friends. This can work out especially well if you\u2019re able to work together toward a common goal (e.g., like train together for an upcoming race). Sometimes, offering tangible support or having a concrete goal in mind can make it easier to approach someone in the hopes of becoming better friends. 5. Use humor This approach isn\u2019t for everyone, and it can be harder to pull off if it\u2019s not something you\u2019re used to. It\u2019s not about knock-knock jokes and it\u2019s definitely not about trying to show off your wit or charm. It actually has very little to do with impressing someone else and everything to do with trying to make both of you feel more at ease. Sharing a lighthearted comment or joke, your penchant (pun-chant?) for puns, or your tendency to be self-deprecating gives the other person a glimpse of your personality and can be a great way to connect. Just remember, it\u2019s best to avoid putting someone else down, even in a joking way. And don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if your humor doesn\u2019t land. At the very least it can be a helpful litmus test for seeing whether you can bond over your sense of humor! 6. Be upfront This last strategy is the one that can make us feel the most vulnerable. It\u2019s hard to put yourself out there and to worry about possibly being rejected. But when you feel like you have the most to lose, you most definitely have the most to gain. If you\u2019ve had only brief interactions with someone you want to get to know better, it\u2019s absolutely okay to share that you\u2019re looking to meet new people and that you\u2019ve really enjoyed the conversations you\u2019ve had so far. Being direct about your desire to make new friends doesn\u2019t have to be a big scary thing. Casually let them know that you\u2019d be happy to chat again or get together in a different context (e.g., \u201cHey! I really enjoyed our conversation! Any chance you\u2019re open to grabbing a coffee sometime?\u201d or \u201cI actually just moved here and don\u2019t really know anyone. I\u2019d love to find a time to hang out and maybe go for a walk together!\u201d). People are often far more receptive to this than we expect. They might even be relieved that you made the first move! Regardless of whether you are upfront about the fact that you\u2019d like to be better friends or prefer a more subtle approach, keep in mind that it is a process. It takes time, patience, vulnerability, and repetition \u2014 which means plenty of opportunities to practice these different approaches!!! Thank you for reading\u2026:) Good day quorans \u2665\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": " Don\u2019t read this answer if you\u2019re not willing to get out of your little comfort zone. There\u2019s a stigma about meeting people online and I don\u2019t know why because it is easier now, more than ever, to connect with people you\u2019ve never met before. Here\u2019s how- First, you need to leverage the social media platforms and websites- InstagramUse the hashtags to search up your city\u2019s people- bloggers, writers, entrepreneurs, whatever you\u2019re into. When I moved to Santa Barbara, I searched the hashtags like #santabarbaraliving and #santabarbarablogger to find profiles of people around the area that I would like meet.DM a genuine hello and offer to meet up for coffee!Here\u2019s where a lot of people get stuck here wondering: \u201cwell, what do I say...?\u201d Here\u2019s what I said to 2 separate people: 2. CraigslistNow, I know it\u2019s reputation for being creepy and I acknowledge that. But as equally bizarre as it can be, Craigslist is tremendously useful. A lot of people live together just off this website alone. I actively browse the community section of Craigslist, that is how I met Veronica. She was trying to launch a book club and even though it didn\u2019t kick off, she and I would meet for coffee to read and visit the local art exhibits. Later, I discovered we were both passionate about running so we took on the Santa Barbara Elings Park 5K Trail Run together, which was a blast! 3. Quora/LinkedInSimilar to Instagram, use these websites to check out locals in the area as well! Prior to moving to Santa Barbara, my intelligence gathering on the town happened through Quora and LinkedIn. I hit up other young professionals who were working and living here to understand about what life is like from a Millennial / Gen Z perspective. That\u2019s how I met Stefan. Then, in person\u2014 After exhausting your social media platforms, meeting people in person is awesome but you can only accomplish this if you set yourself up for success. ClassesThe cool thing about meeting people in classes is that you\u2019re able to get to know them over a period of time without setting anything up because you know you\u2019ll both be there every Saturday morning.ChurchIf you practice a religion, finding your local church can help immensely because in addition to everyone being super nice and welcoming, re-centering with God on why you\u2019re even where you are is incredibly helpful.Say YESIf a friend I met invited me out, I went. No idea what it was they even invited me to? I still showed up. Just go. New friends are new adventures, you never know what they\u2019ll teach you. When you\u2019re in a new part of the world, you have nothing to lose and so much more to gain.This article was originally published here, on my personal development blog, where I like to share the lessons and stories I\u2019ve learn in life.

            "answer_text": "Well, there are three types of friend\u2026. \u201cHi-Bye\u201d friends (or acquaintances). These are the ones you see at school/work because the context calls for it. You say hi when you see each other and you say bye at the end of the day, but that\u2019s about it. The relationship never lasts when the context is removed, i.e. when you graduate from school or leave the workplace.Regular friends. Social, activity buddies you meet up every now and then to catch up or hang out with. You can generally talk about regular topics under the sun.True, soul friends (or best friends). People you can talk anything and everything with. You may or may not meet up every day, but it doesn\u2019t matter as the strength of your friendship is not determined by how frequently you meet up \u2014 it\u2019s more than that. These are the friends you can trust to be there for you whenever you need them, and they will go the extra mile for you.we need such friends.Here are my personal tips to get new friends easily: 1. The first step is to develop a healthy mental image of meeting new people. Some of us see meeting new people as a scary event. We are concerned about making a good impression, whether the other person will like us, how to keep the conversation going, and so on. The more we think about it, the scarier it seems. 2. Start small with people you know. 3. Accept invitations to go out with them. 4. Be open minded, don't judge your new friends. Give the friendship a chance to blossom. 5. Open your heart to the person.<3 6. Be more adjustable and get to know the person. 7. Be there for them but not much. 8. Make the effort to stay in touch. 9. Connect with genuinity.Often times we are too caught up with our own concerns \u2014 such as what others will think of us, what we should say next, what our next action is \u2014 that we miss the whole point of a friendship. 10. Be always cool. If life gives you lemon, collect them and make shikanji. ;) xD. Thank you. Edits are welcome. \u270d\ufe0fAman Namdev. ",

I have been to 6 schools in 12 years, and change was an ubiquitous part of my life Here are a few things I did in each place that helped me cope better. Be polite. Always - People will be curious, and since they're just kids after all, will ask the darnedest questions. They might even belittle you and your previous school, and make all sorts of rude assumptions, but answer everything with a smile and tactful silence, at worst. Learn to pick your battles - this isn't home turf, and it's important you find your bearing before you radically oppose someone.Be nonchalant - Make sure you at least appear self-possessed even when your insides are churning. Do not let yourself be an easy target - there are always a few bullies in every class, who'll pick on the new kid, and can actually smell fear. Smile a lot and be enthusiastic when anyone approaches you, and try and be comfortable and engaged with yourself if and when you find nobody talking to you. It's a phase - it'll pass.Be proactive - This is a two-fold process. First, identify your strengths and make sure you display them when you join your new class. If you're good at academic, make sure you ace your tests. If you play basketball well, participate enthusiastically in gym class and give your best performance. Find your niche - people in general will be attracted to you and like-minded people will take you in their fold. Secondly, try and identify a few kids who seem nice, but don't necessarily have a lot of freinds - then go and talk to them. Ask them for help, and take tips from them about how you can best navigate your new school. Most kids, individually, are very friendly, but people in cliques are normally not very inviting towards new-comers. That's okay - respect their reserve and be friends with the kids on the fringes. Be patient - People take time to adjust to change, and the larger a group, the longer it'll take them time to accept you. Don't be disheartened, and be game to all the incessant queries, polite snubbing, and indifference that characterises the first few days. If you must, approach the class prefect/monitor/president and ask them for help - they're usually the most well-adjusted kids in a class and will be courteous and cooperative. It's a new chance for you to set the record straight, and redefine yourself if need be - I know I did, and it worked out fantastically for me.I wish you all the best! ",

Avoid inquisitions Asking questions shows interest, but don't overdo it. \"Anyone who has been trapped on a plane next to an inquisitor knows it's horrible,\" Elise says. \"Avoid pushing the conversation along with questions; use statements instead.\" 3. Make big talk Dispense with talk about the weather and go straight to grand theories of the universe. \"People often welcome more significant conversation,\" says Elise. \"The best subject, however, is what's been on the mind of your new friend lately.\" 4. Talk like you're friends Statements that include both of you in the same storyline establish fast rapport, such as: \"I don't know about you, but I could go for a burger right now.\" \"These sort of statements encourage interaction without demanding it,\" says Elise. 5. Don't bragWhen it comes to self-promotion, subtlety is required. \"You finished second in your age group at the London Marathon. You can rebuild an Aston Martin's clutch in 30 minutes. Great, but hold back. Let them find out later.\" 6. Be sillyPeople trust you when you trust them enough to let your guard down. \"Tell an embarrassing story,\" Elise suggests. \"Try out your bad American accent. Laugh at yourself, and people will feel more inclined to open up to you.\" 7. Don't fix their problemsStrangers often complain as a safe way of making conversation. \"You don't have to fix their problems,\" Elise says. \"It's more constructive for your friendship to reassure them they have the ability to solve the problems themselves.\" 8. Don't think -- listenIt's tempting to spend the time they are talking planning what you're going to say next. Don't -- just listen to what they're saying. \"The answer to the riddle of flowing conversation is not in your head,\" says Elise. \"It's right in front of you.\" ",

In his old age, he went to stay with the eldest son in the family. After about a month-and-a-half \u2026. his over-heard his daughter-in-law \u201cHe has two sons apart from you. Why only we ?????\u201d The next day, the behaggard old man returned to his village. The emotional shock was so deep\u2026.. in the 20 days that followed he (the father of three sons) left for the heavenly abode !!!!! (2) My parents \u2026.. had nowhere to go. I am the only son. And I did the best that was within my limits. Even today, 25 years after they left for the heavenly abode \u2026.. I feel their blessings at every step that I put forward !!!!!!  Remember \u2026..

She may have a feel for the kinder students in your grade and may be able to help you fit in. Don't give up if you try a couple of her directions and then get nowhere. Remember when you learned to balance yourself on your bike? It took practice right? It didn't mean you were doing anything wrong when you were first learning... it just means you needed practice. See if that counselor can help you join a group too maybe one that jut volunteers to help make the school pretty or to advertise dances and stuff like that. Or maybe, if there is something you are really interested in (cleaning up the environment? helping sick animals?) you could do that and that way you might meet people who are more like you in their outlook, and that helps to make it easier to start conversations and find out about each other. As to social \"skills,\" here's my top three tips after showering and looking your best (but no, you don't have to look gorgeous everyday): 1) Smile confidently at everybody.2) When you do get a chance to talk to someone, don't run away. BE PATIENT with others. Concentrate on them feeling YOUR acceptance. Let them figure out that YOU are a SAFE person.3) Guard your heart; there will be people who don't like you. It's okay A lot of these people don't really like themselves either. Be proud of yourself Samantha. You're not out doing drugs, you're not out getting yourself pregnant; you aren't giving up. And you aren't hurting others either. Right now, you may be afraid and not know what to do, but you sure aren't making anyone else's life miserable! Pat yourself on the back for being a good, nice girl, then go look for a little help. and try new things a little bit at a time. If worse comes to worse and you are unable to make satisfactory progress in this area, take heart: The girls that did the best from my high school years studied their eyes out, didn't do a lot of socializing and are heads of philanthropic concerns, doctors, writers, and business owners. It seems true that the harder you had it in high school, the BETTER you do in life, as long as you study. You could take a walk during lunch, could you not? And maybe you can ask a different person each day to take a short walk with you during lunch. That would be better, wouldn't it, then hanging in that bathroom alone? I think so. You deserve at least to enjoy your lunch break. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh honey, I am so sorry for you. I know what it\u2019s like to be the new kid when everyone else is already in a clique. You\u2019re going to have to be brave. It\u2019s not easy, but you can do it. Come out of the bathroom. Take your lunch and find someplace to sit. Bring a book or your phone or whatever so you have something to occupy yourself with. Smile and look cheerful. I know you won\u2019t feel that way, but you can pretend. It\u2019s important. If you look cheerful and you smile at people, there will be people who smile back. Maybe not your first day, but someone will see you and smile back. When that happens, go over and introduce yourself. It\u2019s a place to start. Meanwhile, make an appointment with the school counselor. Explain your situation and find out what clubs and activities you can join. You only need one. Once you\u2019re involved with an activity or a club you will meet the other people who are already there. You\u2019ll have a shared interest, and that means something to talk about. Oh, and pay attention to the people in your classes. There will be others who feel alone and friendless. There always are. One of them might smile back and after class, you can say hi. It won\u2019t be quick, but you can do this. I did. ",

            "answer_text": "It takes initiative to make friends. Observe how a person that has lots of friends interacts with them. Do you notice the little ways that offer proof of their friendship? A word of encouragement or a helping hand may be the seed from which a great friendship will grow. American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: \u201cThe only way to have a friend is to be one.\u201d It takes time to make friends and develop the relationship. Remember, friendship, like a flowering plant, needs to be watered and nurtured for it to blossom\u200b\u2014and that takes time. Pay attention when the person talks. Really listen and be interested in the conversation. Think of questions to ask them about their interests. Be forgiving, patient, and generous. Be free with sincere commendation and upbuilding speech. When you show genuine interest in the well-being of others, they are drawn to you. Think about what you can do for them instead of focusing on what they can do for you. Be reasonable about the frequency and length of visits with friends. Avoid possessiveness, which can lead to jealousy. Use good judgment when expressing personal tastes and opinions on matters. This contributes to a refreshing and welcome friendship. Also, remember to respect their privacy and property. Proverbs 25:17 wisely observes: \u201cMake your foot rare at the house of your fellowman, that he may not have his sufficiency of you and certainly hate you.\u201d Meaning don\u2019t overstay your welcome. Read the body language of your friend and listen to their words so you know when it\u2019s time to leave. ",

            "answer_text": "Find social places that interest you. Check out the night life. If you are comfortable going out alone and aren\u2019t shy, go to a coffee shop, bar, or concert and talk to people. Ask them what there is to do in and around the city, the best restaurants, malls, sight-seeings, etc. If you are not comfortable doing such, start by talking to people in and around your building or neighborhood. You never know who you will meet. I find it easier at places like a bar or concert because people go to be social. 90% of the time people wont find it weird if you were to strike a conversation with them out of nowhere, (you just have to scope out the right ones\u2026friendly, smiling, talkative, etc.) Another thing you can try is an app called bumble. It was initially a dating app but recently made it an option for the user to switch to \u201cbff mode\u201d. With access to your location it will connect you with people in the same general area as you who have also signed up for the app for the same reason: to make friends. I have used this app and went out with a girl I met on the app. We talked/texted before hand and it was not weird or awkward at all when we met. ",

Strangers are just friends we havent been introduced to. I am not saying, go and shake hands with every person you meet today. Smile ! Joke and be lighthearted as well. No need to always keep a straight face. I love Every single person in this world. Why? Because we all have potential for positive growth. Whats not to love about people? We should instead hate negative actions. Some of my friends are as old as the mountains. Some are still in their diapers. I dont mind! You are still my friend. No matter what. Or who you are. Some might say- so you even have psychotic and murderous types as your friends? Listen. I still hate wrongful actions. But even those people are my friends. They are prone and subject to change. By friends , I do not mean that we will be socializing or joining anyone. It merely means- people are Safe from my tyranny and mischief. And that- is how I have managed to make new friends quickly.

            "answer_text": "Having changed about 12 schools since I was a kid , I can say out of experience that it is not at all hard. Making new friends and getting to know about them definitely feels good. Here are a few suggestions: 1. Be yourself- I have to emphasize on how important it is to be yourself. You might get judged in the beginning but trust me, opinions can change and they do. Happened to me always as I was (still am) overweight. 2. Be confident- People get attracted to confident people. They can't like or love you the way you want them to, if you lack in self confidence. 3.Don't be Arrogant- being oversmart or arrogant is a huge turn off. 4. Don't be a sycophant but compliment those whom you truly appreciate. For eg- if you like some stranger's sketch in your school, go ahead and just tell them without coming off as creepy. Appreciation is always welcomed. This helped me talk to even those who didnt like when they first met me. 5.Just smile - Even smiling seems like a task at school when your nerves are a wreck while trying to make new friends. But,   a smile can make a lot of difference. Its more appealing than a dull face. 6. Stop worrying and be positive- worrying just lowers your confidence whereas positivity creates an aura. I used to worry a lot sometimes and I had trouble making friends. But the moment I stopped worrying and acted like I usually do and that is, truly show what I am, I made some amazing friends. 7. Listen- people like sharing stuff so they expect you to genuinely listen to them. Ultimately, it doesn't matter how many friends you end up making. Its more about enjoying the process and getting to know others. Deep bonds form only when you are true to yourself. 7 ",

If someone asks you if he wants to sit next to you seems like he or she wants to talk to you just talk don't make any judgement by his face really weird looking guys turn out to be great just happened with me . Don't tell about yourself until and unless other one asks you but yes do ask some normal questions. Not very personal questions just normal ones and when you both start  getting the same sense start having normal conversation . Show him or her that you trust them so trust they can also trust you. Don't be stupid make sense while talking but don't make comment about anything you don't know , don't be a know it all. Show active participation in class so that others also get to know you . If you are good something participate in it and if the teacher proposes your name then don't let him down . Don't be afraid of making mistakes everyone knows that you are just a human .Participate in assemblies or events which increase your interaction with others that's the best way to let others know what you possess and earn knew friends. I PARTICIPATED in Teachers day event and it turned out to be a great experience in my life and now i have some amazing friends .Be kind . Be helpful. Be Nice (though you don't get points for being nice anywhere , but here you do.) Be Confident. Here is a picture of my bunch of people.   ",

            "answer_text": "Here Are My Some Best Personal Tips To Get New Friends  Realize your fear is in your head The first step is to develop a healthy mental image of meeting new people. Some of us see meeting new people as a scary event. We are concerned about making a good impression, whether the other person will like us, how to keep the conversation going, and so on. The more we think about it, the scarier it seems. This initial apprehension develops into a mental fear, which takes a life of its own and unknowingly blocks us from making new friends. Shyness toward others is actually a result of fear. Actually, all these fears are just in our head. If you think about it, 99% of people are too busy being concerned about these very things themselves to pay attention to you. While you\u2019re worried about the impression you make, they are worried about the impression they will make. Truth be told, they are just as scared as you are. The remaining 1% are people who recognize that a relationship is built on way stronger values than specific words or things said/done during just one encounter. Even if there are people who do judge you based on what you do/say, are these people you want to be friends with? I think not. Start small with people you know If you haven\u2019t been socializing much, meeting a whole bunch of new people may seem intimidating. If so, start small first. Lower the difficulty of the task by starting off with your inner circle of friends, i.e. people you are more familiar with. Some ways to do that: Reach out to acquaintances. Have any hi-bye type friends from earlier years? Or friends you lost touch with over time? Drop a friendly SMS and say hi. Ask for a meetup when they are free. See if there are opportunities to reconnect. See if there are cliques you can join. Cliques are established groups of friends. The idea isn\u2019t to break into the clique, but to practice being around new friends. With cliques, the existing members will probably take the lead in conversations, so you can just take the observatory role and watch the dynamics between other people. Get to know your friends\u2019 friends. You can join them in their outings or just ask your friend to introduce you to them. If you are comfortable with your friends, there\u2019s a good chance you will be comfortable with their friends too. Accept invitations to go out. I have friends who rarely go out. When asked out, they reject majority of the invites because they rather stay at home. As a result, their social circles are limited. If you want to have more friends, you have to step out of your comfort zone and go out more often. You can\u2019t make more friends in real life if you stay at home! Get yourself out there Once you acquaint yourself more with your inner circle of friends, the next step will be to extend to people you don\u2019t know. Join meetup groups. Meetup .com is a great social networking site. There are many interest groups, such as groups for entrepreneurs, aspiring authors, vegetarians, board-game lovers, cycling enthusiasts, etc. Pick out your interests and join those groups. Meetups are usually monthly depending on the group itself. Great way to meet a lot of new people quickly. Attend workshops/courses. These serve as central avenues that gather like-minded people. I went to a personal development workshop last year and met many great individuals, some of whom I became good friends with. Volunteer. Great way to kill 2 birds with one stone \u2014 not only do you get to spread kindness and warmth, you meet compassionate people with a cause. Go to parties. Parties such as birthday parties, Christmas/new year/celebration parties, housewarmings, functions/events, etc. Probably a place where you\u2019ll make a high quantity of new friends but not necessarily quality relationships. Good way to meet more people nonetheless. Visit bars and clubs. Many people visit them to meet more friends, but I don\u2019t recommend them as the friends you make here are probably more hi-bye friends rather than type #2 or type #3 friends. It\u2019s good to just visit a couple of times and see how they are for yourself before you make your judgment. Online communities. The internet is a great way to meet new people. Some of my best friendships started online. I met one of my best friends, K, from an IRC channel 10 years ago. I have at least 2 other good friends whom I knew from online too. We\u2019ve since met up numerous times and became great friends. Even today, I have numerous great friendships with people I\u2019ve never met (other personal development bloggers and my readers). Just because we have not met (yet) does not mean we can\u2019t be great friends. Nowadays, online forums are one of the central places where communities gather. Check out online forums on your interest topics. Participate constructively and add value to the discussion. Soon, you\u2019ll get to know the people there better. Take the first step Once you are out there with people around you, someone has to make the first move. If the other party doesn\u2019t initiate a talk, take the first step to say hello. Get to know each other a little better! Share something about yourself, and then give the other party a chance to share about him/her. Something easy, like asking how the day is, or what they did today / in the past week is a great conversation starter. Once the ice is broken, it\u2019ll be easier to connect. Get to know the person A friendship is about both you and the other person. Get to know the person as an individual. Here are some questions to consider: What does he/she do?What are his/her hobbies?What has he/she been up to recently?What are his/her upcoming priorities/goals?What does he/she value the most?What are his/her values?What motivates/drives him/her?What are his/her passions in life? Goals? Dreams?Connect with genuinity Often times we are too caught up with our own concerns \u2014 such as what others will think of us, what we should say next, what our next action is \u2014 that we miss the whole point of a friendship. You can work on the presentation aspects such as how you look, what you say, and how you say things, but don\u2019t obsess about them. These actions don\u2019t (truly) define the friendship. What defines the friendship is the connection between you and the friend. Show warmth, love, and respect toward everyone you meet. Do things because you want to, and not because you have to. Care for them like you would yourself. If you approach others with genuinity, you will attract people who want to connect genuinely. Among them will be your future true friends. Be yourself Don\u2019t change yourself to make new friends. That\u2019s the worst thing you can do. Why do I say that? Say you make many new friends by being vocal and brassy. However, your normal self is quiet and introverted. What happens then? It may be great initially to get those new friends, but the friendship was established with you being an extrovert. That means either: You continue being the vocal, brassy person your new friends knew you as. However, it\u2019ll just be a facade. In the long-run, it\u2019ll be tiring to uphold this image. Not only that, the friendship will be built on a hollow front. OrYou change back to the introverted you. However, your friends will feel cheated because this isn\u2019t the person they befriended. They\u2019ll also gradually shift away if your personalities don\u2019t match.So, just be yourself. That way, potential new friends will know you as you, and they\u2019ll use that to decide if they want to take the friendship a step further. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need to be outward and articulate like Tony Robbins to get friends. It\u2019s all about being you. The truest friendships are built with both parties accepting each other for who they are. ",

YES it was hectic, shifting house, moving places and then travelling so much was really a tiresome process. I was not born in India, I have a Canadian residency. We moved to India later on.. so yeah its a huge story! what i was worried about the most was going to new school. I was so used to Canada that the whole atmosphere here was so different and new to me. Everyone made fun of my accent calling me fake. So like what normal teenagers do, I turned to the internet. Facebook, Instagram was too mainstream. I tried bumble\u2026 too much of an effort that was. And Tinder of course, everyone judged me based on my looks again, not that i was not confident about how I look but there is more to me than just my face and body is what I felt. At a point I thought let me ask someone to set me up on a Blind date, then luckily I came across an app called BlindMeet, of course I was confused and skeptical about using it but it had a decent rating and good reviews. We had currently shifted to Bangalore. The meeting spots were public and safety was the first priority and guarantee of the app. So i used it. It had 3 modes- Friendship, Dating and Networking, I wasnt really sure what I wanted but i went about choosing Friendship. I lived some 5 blocks from a mall and when i used the app, not to my surprise i got the mall itself, Central mall. I went there and guess what I actually got a girl as my match. I was happy and sad at the same time. Happy because its more safe that I got a girl, sad because it was not a guy I wanted a friend from the opposite gender as I studied in a girls convent. We both were chalk & cheese, I am a very girly girl and she was a tomboy. We went to play games had a good time. She knew nothing about me and i felt like a plain paper and I could write my story however I wanted to, and I wasn\u2019t judged at all. She never pin-pointed my accent and she liked me for me. We exchanged numbers and our social-media profiles and we are good friends till date. She became my go to person i could confide in, tell all my problems to. I found a good friend. Thanks to BlindMeet. I found a good friend through an app. Try it. Who knows you might just get lucky like me!! ",

Fake appreciation does not work. First of all notice everything that you really like about the opposite person and then appreciate them for that. Remember don't appreciate all at once. Don't tell everything in one moment. Tell them one by one. Orelse the person would run away from you. It also depends on the opposite person's personality. If they are introvert by nature then just be with them. Start to spend time and hang out with them because you need to give them time to open up to you. If the person is extrovert by nature then it will not be a problem. If you are introvert then too go to talk with people. Making new friends is not a very difficult thing to do. Because always remember they are also in search of people to talk to and be friends with someone. So why not you start with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Friends can be made even in one minute, I have answered this type of question before also. While introducing yourself to someone, just be yourself, Don't try to impress by saying the things which doesn't relate to you or you're not like how you're reprenting yourself infront of him/her because people understand that u're lying & trying to be someone who u r not (here psychology or sixth sense works). If u want to make more friends easily than after introducing yourself ask about him/her as much as possible, show interest in his/her life, if u'll show interest then they will tell you many things related to his/her slowly after trusting you, listen them even if it's not interesting, give them suggestion on their problem, try to help them, don't intrupt while having conversation. let him/her complete their story and after that they will ask about you for sure, now it's upto you to move forward and keep it in mind that don't bore him by telling long stories where u fill that he's not interested, it depends upon situation & comfortability. I hope u understand what I want to convey. Thank you ",

Find the right people. By right people, I mean don\u2019t go hang out with people who will drag you down and get you in trouble. 2.) Introduce yourself. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Joseph!\u201d Change it up a little and make it your own. 3.) Find common interests. You can\u2019t be friends with someone without having something in common. Maybe ask if they like a certain topic, or make a reference to something. I normally make Vine references, and if they know what I\u2019m talking about, then yay! 4.) The Commitment Once you\u2019ve had a conversation, and you feel like they would make a quality friend, ask them, \u201cHey, want to hang out sometime?\u201d Or \u201cWanna be friends!\u201d I use the second line more often, because I feel it\u2019s less awkward for future encounters when they\u2019ve already committed to being your friends. I hope this helps! ",

My friend moved to a new state and made a great new bunch of friends when she responded to a post in a group about so,done else saying they were lonely and they were interested in (for her it was horror movies and punk music or something). So it works to be a little bit vulnerable and to seek out like minded people. Don\u2019t fake it, no one benefits that way. ",

I think we automatically attract people with same persona and interests, thoughts and mindset. I think you should start interacting more with people rather than feeling awkward all the time. If you are a school or college student its really easy for you. But if you are the one who stays at home you should start socializing through many ways. Loneliness is very underrated it can be very heavy on heart sometimes. But having some good friends is very important in life they to a great extent are main support system of life after parents. And if you are a guy its easier to make friends. Just pick up a random girl and tell her that \u201ci love you or like you\u201d Bamm\u2026!! You've got yourself friends forever. Hope it helps! ",

Look up the word acquaintances and the word friends and learn the differences in the definitions. They are two very separate things. An acquaintance is someone you know a little about, but they\u2019re not your best friend or anything. A friend is a person whom one knows and with whom one has a bond of mutual affection, typically exclusive of sexual or family relations. You are never a friend immediately. Takes TIME to get to know someone. I say this over and over and over and over again. YOU must go to places where people are doing activities that you like to do. That is how you meet people that you like and will like you back. ",

Don't worry, making new friends is not all that hard - you just need to put a little time and effort into finding people with similar interests and getting to know them. Don't let shyness stand in your way - once you have an amazing group of friends to hang out with, you'll be glad you made the effort! 1st -Introduce yourself to people you don't know, whether either of you are new to the school or not. Be especially welcoming to new people starting school. 2nd Smile at that person and be friendly. People are much more approachable and less intimidating when they smile. 3rd  Make a great first impression. Most people form an opinion about you in less than 60 seconds. 4th  Compliment them. Don't lie but find something positive to point out. It will make them more comfortable around you. 5th  Start a conversation with them. Ask about their interests, classes they have, some people they hang out with, what sports they're in, etc. This should branch off of the introduction. Ask more about their classes. \"Who's the teacher?\" 6th Extend an invitation. If you're going to the movies, mall, etc. you can ask if they'd like to go. If you can have people over to your house you can also ask them. 7th  Talk in the halls and on your way to classes. You'll also get a better feel for where their classes are and if you have any together. ",

You can be humourous without being mean. Be yourself. Don't pretend to be someone else. Don't give up or compromise on your latent qualities, they make you unique.Friendship, I know is not based on how you look and how you dress up but no harm in being a little hygienic. Don't's:   Flirting is NOT the only way of being interesting. There are better ways to it. Don't brag. It is not a \"myself\" recitation day. Let others speak. Listen. There are more topics to talk on, than yourself. Don't get too clingy. Respect everyone's space. Having listed these I'd still like to point out the fact that friendship cannot be enforced. Its a decision where the mind is seldom involved. A friend does not care to look out for any of the above qualities in you. No conditions in friendship.But yes, these points will certainly help you socialize better. I believe you're good to go. All the best :) ",

Care about 2 things, allow that person to trust that you are being yourself around them, and also that you don\u2019t have a hidden agenda other than to be a nice friendly person.

Make a profile, set impressive pictures no matter if those are yours or not but should be impressive. Put some good thoughts some good lines etc and start searching people, soon your list will start increasing ;) but hey what's the use of that ? If you need friends in real then start going out start building your circle, not huge but decent one. Nr of friends does not matter how many of them are real friends that actually means a lot. I am sure you are not planning to join politics or going in an election so why you need more and more friends. :):) ",

Because he had a few qualities that a lot of people wanted, so they became friends with him to learn what they were and soon exhibit them too. Long story short, during my HR position, (I'm now in customers service) I didnt strive to make friends, but I was open if other did. And did they ever!! I brought to the table a happy greeting to every appropriate interaction, and quality service of treating every person I knew and met as a guest. I made over 120 friends and over 100 will greet me before I can great them. Why? Because they looked up to me as a person, and wanted my attention. I recently quit a job at a grocer and went in there and nearly 80% of my interaction with my previous coworkers were initiated by them. Bring something to the table, and people will follow. Then you can pick and choose who you want to be more than friends with.  ",

I can't gather the courage to talk interact with someone when the other people around us are not that close to me. But when I'm with my close friends and there are new people, I can instantly become very good friends with them. So I guess you could try having a hangout with mutual friends and meet new people. That way, you're in your comfort zone and can interact freely. It's easier to become friends with strangers in a group with other people you're comfortable with than alone. One on one has the chances of getting awkward, which is rare when you're in a group. ",

Eventually from that group of people you will want to contact them and continue the conversations that you were interrupted from maintaining by actual schooling so you will contact them after school usually by phone. Eventually you will want to have those conversations with these people in person so you will meet up after school and hang out. In general, you have just made a friend.

Maybe they will invite you to their home and drink some coffee/tea with you. And voila a new friend. ",

I will tell you how I made a lot of friends by just going to cafes and simply remembering other people's names. During weekends, I try different cafes nearby home to read novels. The first thing I do when I visit any cafe is, I read the tag name of the waiter and I call out with his or her names to order coffee. The waiter will give special attention to you (try it). This will be floodgate, you say his or her names and everything will just follow. You can ask them, where is their hometown or, when he or she moved there.. and I am damned sure you will make a friend through this. Now if you sitting on the table and another person is also sitting there then just say \u201cHello\u201d and start talking. The most important thing is \u201cRemember his or her name\u201d When you meet him the second time, just greet him or her with \u201cHey Name\u201d. You will have a lot of dates and friends through this. Try it and let me know ",

But there is a simple rule we should obey so that we can get new and true friends. Treating others sincerely and honestly. I treat all the strangers in the same way, no matter their colors or nationalities. Also, smiling and be nice to others are also keys to making new friends. No one would get close to a person with a \u201cmean\u201d face. In addition, be yourself. If you pretend to another \u201cfake\u201d perfect person when making friends, it just lets you get along with your friends much more harder. One more thing, birds of a feather flock together. It is unnecessary that you make friends with those who are really not \u201cfits\u201d you. A good friend of mine have told me that a person just will get one or two true friend(s) all his/her life. If you have less good friends, it is not a big deal. I have many friends, but just two good friends. Wish you good luck. ",

The next thing is just to seem friendly and approachable. Smile at people. Say hello or good morning. Help people. Just seem like a friendly person and people will want to get to know you and be friends. ",

Mutual friendship entails so much more of a personal responsibility and trust commitment than many people even realize. People find one another anywhere and everywhere, while friendship is a close personal bond we develop and choose to offer without expectations. I have to emphasize without expectation because an expected return is conditional and that comes with boundaries. Good luck in your efforts. ",
