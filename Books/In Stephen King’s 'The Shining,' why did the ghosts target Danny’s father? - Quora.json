Jack is just the next in line, the unfortunate soul taken by the hotel to do what it needs/wants.Jack has an easily-influenced mind due to (a) his prior history of violence and violent outbursts (b) his struggle with alcoholism, and (c) the ongoing stress he feels trying to write his novel and not having a decent job to make ends meet.Of the three of them, Jack\u2019s the obvious choice to take out the others \u2014 Danny has the Shining, so he\u2019s not able to be directly manipulated; Wendy is rather physically weak but mentally very strong and truly loves Danny; Jack is the weak link in the chain \u2014 physically stronger than the others and mentally weak.",
