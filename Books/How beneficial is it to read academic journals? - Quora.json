If you\u2019re an academic not in the field, it might be helpful if the scholarship is relevant to your field. If you\u2019re an inquiring lay person, you may derive some benefit from a given scholarly article, but likely you will lack the context to fully and properly understand it. \u201cA little learning is a dangerous thing.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer - it depends. Reading academic journals is certainly not my recommendation for pleasure reading, but if you need source material for an essay that you are writing, then you can not find better material to back up your argument. Academic journals are peer reviewed, meaning they\u2019ve been scrutinized by scholars in that field. As such, you won\u2019t find more credible sources. Hope this has helped answer your question. ",
