            "answer_text": "To put it simply: if you want profit, keep your money in the bank, or go invest in the stock market or something. It\u2019ll probably be less stressful and less risky. I mean it. Anyone who goes into the food service industry, especially the small food service industry, should not be thinking about profit. You could be thinking about providing a service to a community, or maybe you\u2019re a baker who can\u2019t see yourself doing anything else (I belong to that species of human). Don\u2019t go into this thinking about profit. We work with very small margins (think 10%-20%), and the ones who become truly successful, become a household name, open new units, expand, etc, are very, very, increasingly few. It\u2019s a very competitive market and only the best of the best survive the first few years. Owning a bakery is not only about baking good stuff. It\u2019s about management. It\u2019s about number-crunching, and people management, and crisis-solving, and leaky pipes, and broken freezers, and poring over your numbers day and night trying to cut costs while keeping your customers interested. It\u2019s not like running any other kind of business, and one needs to know what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve learned on the job, and man, there is still a long way to go. I\u2019m a baker, but I spend most of my days in the office staring at Excel spreadsheets. Here is a very-often cited article on restaurant failures from the School of Hotel Administration from Cornell University\u2019s website: Why Restaurants Fail The related articles at the bottom are very interesting too. But again: if you\u2019re thinking about profit, don\u2019t go into this business, unless you\u2019re absolutely confident that you know how what you\u2019re doing \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean the baking part. That\u2019s the easy part, and I wish my life was just building complex tiered cakes, it would be so much easier! Good luck! ",

Manual egg beater and electric egg beater Use an egg beater to whip butter, eggs and light cream. Egg beaters are also used when some wet ingredients are mixed together. Electric egg beater is more convenient and labor-saving, and the whole egg beat method is very difficult, must use an electric egg beater. But electric egg beaters are not suitable for all situations. For example, if you want to whisk a small amount of butter, or if you don't need to whip it, you can use a manual whisk to blend eggs, sugar, and oil. So both types of egg beater need to be equipped.
