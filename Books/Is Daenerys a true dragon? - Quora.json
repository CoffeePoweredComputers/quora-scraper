            "answer_text": "SERIOUS SPOILERS Daenerys is The Dragon . . My Daenerys Theory #1: The Fate of Daenerys The Dragon Targaryen Azor Ahai, TPTWP (2 People) + Dawn, Lightbringer (Two Swords) = 1 Person, 1 Sword. Duality merges and Becomes One. This post is packed with evidence to back up my belief, I hope you enjoy the read. What Rises in The West & Sets in the East - Daenerys, The Dragons, The Prince That Was Promised, The Prophecy and Her Role as The Blood of The Dragon in the Battle for the Dawn. Azor Ahai is the Warrior we know as Jon Snow.The Prince That Was Promised is Daenerys Targaryen, and she will become the sword Lightbringer.Azor Ahai Jon Snow - the great warrior who will face the darkness in the Battle for Dawn. Jon is the one who will wield the sword LightbringerThe Prince That Was Promised Part 1 Daenerys, who is on the side of \u2018light\u2019 side in terms of the ASOIAF story - but as the \u2018dark\u2019 side of the good.The Prince That Was Promised Part 2 Dawn/Lightbringer: Dawn, the Greatsword of House Dayne, also happens to have a duality aspect as well \u2013 pale as \u2018milkglass\u2019 at present, soon to be glowing fiery red as it transitions into Lightbringer, which ties into Daenerys (literally)This all sounds a little crazy right about now perhaps but I believe this is supported by the books and so I have included extensive details and quotes below, and you can decide if I have lost my mind in ASOIAF obsession, or if I am onto something ... or both Daenerys is the other half to the balance of Jon: Jon Snow is surrounded by all things white (representing purity) and White - the color of Jon Snow, of Jon\u2019s direwolf Ghost, of Snow itself (the white cold fluffy stuff), of the Wall and all that ice and snow surrounding Castle Black, the North and beyond.Daenerys Targaryen is surrounded by all things red and black - red represents martyrdom, blood, flames. Black represents sin or contamination.. I believe Jon and Daenerys are two sides of the same coin required to unite in order to fight the Great Other. They are 2 that become 1 via the sword Dawn, a dual-aspect sword, which will transition into Lightbringer. Jon and Daenerys together create the balance needed: The Light and the Dark of the Good. Daenerys will need to die, before the Battle for the Dawn, in order for Jon to have what is required to move forward and successfully fight the Others. . Dawn, the Ancestral Greatsword of House Dayne, forged from the heart of a fallen star, is one of the many mysterious aspects in the A Song of Ice and Fire series and one we do not immediately associate Dawn with Daenerys. Dawn is heavily connected to Daenerys Targaryen, the Blood of the Dragon, through prophecy and events soon to unfold in the Great War to Come. Here is why\u2026.. Dawn. The name alone made it almost feel too obvious at first, however, in classic GRRM-style, there are many levels to this sword and the word play and mental association trickery he employs is genius. Where to begin? Ah yes, the description of Dawn, indicates much and more as it unabashedly announces what a glorious and beautiful blade it is, like no other in Westeros, stronger than Valyrian steel, and a brilliant bright white. . Dawn, the Greatsword with a blade \u2018pale as milkglass, alive with light\u2019: \u201cAnd now it begins,\u201d said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light. - A Game of Thrones, Eddard X. Dawn is \u2018alive with light\u2019 because it brings the ligh, just like dawn does every morning. But that is only the tip of the prophecy iceberg. Dawn is certainly otherworldly, as the blade itself was forged from the heart of a fallen star: \"The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with a blade called Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star. They called him the Sword of the Morning, and he would have killed me but for Howland Reed.\" Father had gotten sad then, and he would say no more. Bran wished he had asked him what he meant. - A Clash of Kings, Bran III. The Sword of the Morning is significant and important enough to warrant its name immortalized as that of a constellation, one which hangs in the Southern end of the sky above Westeros. \u201cThe Sword of the Morning still hung in the south, the bright white star in its hilt blazing like a diamond in the dawn,....\u201d - A Storm of Swords, Jon IVBreaking this one sentence down reveals an epic amount of detail, the full implications of which do not initially jump out: The Sword of the Morning \u2013 Dawn, the beginning of a new daystill hung in the south \u2013 a southern constellation, House Dayne is a southern Housethe bright white star \u2013 brightest white stars in the sky is the morning star, a term used for the planet Venus who shines brighter than most stars in the sky; \u2018pale as milkglass\u2019in its hilts blazing like a diamond \u2013 diamonds are beautiful and are said shine and sparkle brilliantlyin the dawn \u2013 dawn is the time of day when light returns to the world, and is the time when the morning star is visible, appearing in the sky roughly an hour before the sun pokes his head upStars are associated as being \u2018cold\u2019 in A Song of Ice and Fire: \"What color are their eyes?\" he asked her.\"Blue. As bright as blue stars, and as cold.\" - A Clash of Kings - Jon IIIFallen stars are associated with heat, specifically with fire: Wherever she looked, she saw fires. They covered the earth like fallen stars, and like the stars there was no end to them. - A Clash of Kings - Catelyn II. There are also 2 aspects of East and 2 aspects of West of Daenerys which fit the prophecy beautifully: \"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,\" said Mirri Maz Duur. \"When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.\"- A Game of Thrones, Daenerys IXWest Aspect 1) Our sun sets in the west \u2013 as the Morning Star RISES IN THE WEST, visible in the hour after sunset. Here Jon sees the Sword of the Morning, the Morning Star, in the western sky proving it acts the same in Westeros as it does in real life here as well: \u201cSo many stars, he thought as he trudged up the slope through pines and firs and ash. Maester Luwin had taught him his stars as a boy in Winterfell; he had learned the names of the twelve houses of heaven and the rulers of each; he could find the seven wanderers sacred to the Faith; he was old friends with the Ice Dragon, the Shadowcat, the Moonmaid, and the Sword of the Morning.\u201d - A Storm of Swords, Jon IIIWest Aspect 2) Daenerys was born in the West on Dragonstone, therefore it could also be said she rises in the West in the sense of her birth. . There is another name for the Morning Star - Day Star - as in DAY-nerys. Also, the sun is technically a really big star . East Aspect 1) Our sun rises in the east \u2013 as the Morning Star SETS IN THE EAST, visible in the hour before sunrise. The Morning Star literally signals the coming of dawn, the start of a new day, the light of the morning. The Shining One. Dawn-bringer. The Bringer of Light. In this quote, Jon sees The Sword of The Morning, The Morning Star, in the eastern sky proving it acts the same in Westeros as it does in real life: \u201cJon took a breath of the crisp morning air and allowed himself to hope. The eastern sky was pink near the horizon and pale grey higher up. The Sword of the Morning still hung in the south, the bright white star in its hilt blazing like a diamond in the dawn, but the blacks and greys of the darkling forest were turning once again to greens and golds, reds and russets.\u201d - A Storm of Swords, Jon IVEast Aspect 2) Daenerys settled in the East when she married Khal Drogo and relocated to the Dothraki Sea, becoming Khaleesi the Unburnt, and made her way further east, conquering and settling in Mereen. Adding the following to the above: The Morning Star - rising in the west and setting in the eastSword of the Morning (constellation) - contains the Morning StarSword of the Morning (title) \u2013 held by a \u2018true\u2019 Knight of exceptional skill and integrity; the one who wields the Greatsword of House Dayne, LightbringerSword of the Evening (title) \u2013 a title that once existed centuries ago, a duality of the current title, the last Sword of the Evening was King Vorian Dayne (the last king of House Dayne).The Morning Star \u2013 also known as the Evening Star. Duality runs deep - No wonder it takes 5 years to write a book lol. . Now both the prophecy, and Daenerys involvement in it, become more clear. If you are a huge Daenerys fan, turn back now. Seriously. Final warning, cause this is as good as it gets for Daenerys, from here on in she is going down in a blaze of glory .... literally ..... much like a fallen star. \"Dragons,\" she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. \"It be dragons, boy,\" she insisted. - A Clash of Kings, Bran IThat Old Nan, she sure knows her stuff. Daenerys \u2018Mother of Dragons\u2019 Targaryen, blood of the dragon, she is The Dragon, the dragon of prophecy. The three fire breathing ones are the red herrings. Here are a wack of further facts to support my theory: Daenerys the Dragon, the fallen star: South: Targaryens are from the South, so it makes sense for a Morning Star to be associated with a constellation and a sword which are both based in the Southern end of Westeros.Goddess of the Dawn: In Greek mythology, the Morning Star (Venus) is the Goddess of DawnThe Dragon - In the Book of Revelation the Morning Star is called The Dragon, but in 2 Peter, the Morning Star is Jesus (duality)\u2018Lord of Air\u2019: is another term used, which also fits Daenerys as she rides on the back of a flying dragon (air) and as Maester Aemon states \u201cDragons are neither male nor female ... as changeable as flame\u201d which allows the \u2018Lord\u2019 title; also indicates a \u2018light\u2019 aspectLucifer: The Latin name for the morning star or light-bearer is \u2018lucifer, the shining-oneMoon: in Latin, the word \u2018lucifer\u2019 is used in reference to the moon, a female association; the moon also has a light side and a dark side (duality)Conqueror: In various religious texts, Lucifer is referenced as one who overthrows cities,Prophetic Visions: Lucifer, the bringer of light, (not Satan) is associated with having visions, is very intelligent and struggles with trying to find a balance for humanityThis is not to suggest Daenerys is Satan, she is not. She represents liberation, and she is a necessary ingredient in the quest for balance. Duality. Daenerys is the Material Girl \u2026. the \u2018Martyr Material\u2019 Girl. \"No one ever looked for a girl,\" he said. \"It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. Rhaegar, I thought . . . the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King's Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years. Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it.\" \u2013 A Feast For Crows, Samwell IVSince GRRM loves drawing from history ..... The Caanite people had a Morning Star in their religious belief system. The Caanites are ancestors of the Phoenicians, the Greek word for Phoenician is directly associated with the colors purple and crimson red: purple - a common eye color amongst Targaryens and Daynesand crimson, or blood red - the Targaryen shield contains a red dragon with three heads on a black shield. Blood and flames and sunsets are other common Targaryen traits. In Greek mythology, the planet Venus is called The Morning Star. It is said the Morning Star shines brighter and is the most beautiful of all the planets/Goddesses. It was her vanity, her pride, her desire to be revered as God-like, and placed above all others, which proved to be her undoing. As punishment from the Gods, the Morning Star was never able to rise as high in the sky as Saturn or Jupiter. She was prevented from attaining the level of greatness she thirsted for. Daenerys is much like Venus The Morning Star, she too is a shining beauty who aspires to climb higher than all others, a fact she announces constantly as Missandei recites her litany of titles. . Daenerys is not just the Mother of Dragons, Daenerys IS the Dragon, The Morning Star, the fallen star, the Lightbringer, who is both Daenerys and humanity\u2019s hope for salvation. Her three dragons are the red herring to distract us from seeing the truth of Daenerys being the Dragon who saves man, through her self-sacrifice. Lightbringer is said to be: the glowing red sword in the prophecy \u2013 what glows and is red is also something that is fiercely hot, flaming hot, and what is hotter than the blood of a dragon, the heart of a dragon perhapsthe color of blood and flame and sunsets \u2013 various terms for things which are \u2018red\u2019 in color, these terms are alos used frequently to describe dragon flamesthe sword which will play a crucial role in darkness fleeing - Lightbringer is as important in the prophecy as the warrior who wields it, together there exists the chance of victory against the darkness, the return of light to the world, the return of Dawn, the Morning LightDawn (Lightbringer) is the symbol for Day Light and DAY-nerys - DAE-nerys: Dae means goddess and Nerys means noble woman or white lady. Daenerys is the white blonde haired lady of noble birth and bloodline, the white of her hair also symbolizing her connection to the white sword Dawn which is pale as milkglass.DAY-nerys, Day Light, the bringer of light, which literally is the Dawn and is associated with the Day Star, the Morning Star.Stannis Baratheon\u2019s banner was changed once Melisandre came on the scene \u2013 with the addition a fiery heart and flames, which carries even more weight and significance than being associated with Melisandre and The Lord of Light. We now see how this represents Daenerys fate: \"In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.\" She lifted her voice, so it carried out over the gathered host. \"Azor Ahai, beloved of R'hllor! The Warrior of Light, the Son of Fire! Come forth, your sword awaits you! Come forth and take it into your hand!\" \u2013 A Clash of Kings, Davos I. This next quote is from the birthing of Daenerys dragons from stone during Khal Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre: \u201cAnd then there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys X, A Game of Thrones Beautiful GRRM foreshadowing of the secret of Daenerys heart, right there for all of us to see, hiding in the very first book lol - I love it. In The World of Ice & Fire, there is a legend based out of Yi Ti involving a great warrior named Azor Ahai who wields a sword known as Lightbringer and was able to fight off the darkness. Azor Ahai reworked Lightbringer many times and in the end, he had to plunge it into the heart of his beloved wife, Nissa Nissa, in order to make Lightbringer effective. I do not believe Jon & Daenerys will have any love connection though. Nissa Nissa means \u2018the beginning\u2019, or \u2018a remembered loved one\u2019. Daenerys self-sacrifice will mark the beginning of a new era in WesterosShe will be remembered and loved by many who knew her, and many who did not, as a martyrfor freedom and liberation of mankind from darknessDaenerys the Morning Star, the fallen star who falls (dies), via sword through the heart, who has the dragon blood heart required to create Lightbringer out of Dawn, the sword forged from the \u2018heart of a fallen star\u2019. Daenerys heart is the \u2018secret heart\u2019, the heart of the dragon, the heart of fire, the blood of the dragon, fire and blood, the fire from which Dawn will be plunged into and pulled out of, as the Ancestral Sword of House Dayne transitions into a glowing red blade, \u2018the color of blood and flame and sunsets\u2019, as hot as a falling star. As hot as dragons breath. As hot as dragons blood. Jon, Azor Ahai, is the flip side, the other half of the coin required to create the balance needed to fight the Great Other. Jon will not die at the end of the series, not in the books at least. He will live \u2026 but there is more to that story \u2026 for another day \u2026 . Daenerys will achieve the greatness she knew was her destiny \u2013 upon her death, as a martyr. Just a theory at the end of the day \u2026. one of many, and one of many more to come :) I also believe the Three Heads of the Dragon is not actually referring to the literal fire breathing dragons, or to who is riding them \u2026\u2026 Ava Monroe's answer to What does a three headed dragon symbolize?

            "answer_text": "YES she is. Reading the books, especially the first one (A Game of Thrones) shows that she very frequently has dragon dreams. She comforts herself by clutching a dragon egg to her chest and saying that she is the blood of the dragon. Viserys thought that he was, but according to Jorah, he was \u201cless than the shadow of a snake\u201d. Rhaegar was frequently referred to by his friends and enemies alike as \u201cThe last dragon\u201d or \u201cthe true dragon\u201d, and as the book series goes on, Dany is compared to her brother Rhaegar as both a compliment and as an acknowledgement of her true blood. Not all Targaryens are fireproof. Dany herself isn\u2019t fireproof in the book series, more so in the series, but all occasions demonstrate her magic as well as the magic of the dragons themselves.. When the dragons were hatched, it was Dany\u2019s embracing of the eggs in the fire that hatched them. Drogo calling her \u201cmoon of my life\u201d and her answering him \u201cMy sun and stars\u201d was more than just a love name. The story of how dragons came to be was that there used to be another moon that got too close to the sun\u2019s heat and hatched a thousand dragons when it was destroyed. The moon was the wife of the sun. Sounds a bit like what happened. ",
