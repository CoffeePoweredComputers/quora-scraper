            "answer_text": "I often will read by placing my finger under the word I am reading and moving along the line until I reach the end of the line. Then I will move my finger down to the next line as I continue reading. It is way less work than I make it sound, and it helps your eyes stay focused on the words you\u2019re reading. I think if you want to learn to be a bona fide speed reader you\u2019d need to learn other methods, but to just improve your speed the very next time you open a book, it\u2019s a good way to go. Other long, thin objects (such as a pen with the cap in it) can work too. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s simple, really: Reading a book while enjoying it is not a task while you are multitasking. Make sure you are occupying a serene and peaceful place. Reading in a shaded park at noon after a balanced meal while seating in an ergonomic posture is highly recommended.More importantly, your question itself has it\u2019s answer now. When you are sparing your full attention towards the book while the experience is being reinforced by the environmental comfort, you are enjoying the content. This is when you devour the book. You have to be at the top gear anyway, you don\u2019t have to sweat it.That\u2019s about it, nothing special. All that remains now is practice. ",
