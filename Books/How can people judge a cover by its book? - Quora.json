            "answer_text": "You consider the communication expressed on it. Think about it. Literally, a book usually has a title and perhaps a \u2018trailer\u2019 type description on the back, intended to make it enticing to its target audience. So you can tell a lot about a book by its cover, though how much varies with the book. Some books seem to rely on their own fame, or the authors - To Kill A Mockingbird hardly screams \u2018Grab me off the shelf!\u2019 to me. Now consider the figurative use of the phrase; judging people, most commonly. Ah, but people make choices in their grooming and attire, yes? Their posture, accent, word choice\u2026 they project a lot of data, info., hints about themselves. Now, it\u2019s important to be mindful of the limits of what you can tell. Sometimes what\u2019s inside is quite a surprise vs. what you might\u2019ve guessed from outward appearances. But you can\u2019t get to know everyone around you, anymore than you can read every book on the shelf at the bookstore. Since you\u2019ve got limited time, energy and inclination, you use covers to judge where to focus your energies and dig deeper, hoping to find whatever it is you\u2019re looking for, while excluding less profitable options that would be a waste of your time and energy. That\u2019s how and why. ",
