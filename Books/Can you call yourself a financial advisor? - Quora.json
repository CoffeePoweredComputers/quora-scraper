            "answer_text": "Hey,  I can only call myself a financial advisor for my own finance! With 12 years of experience in investing and managing my personal finance. I have cleared a lot of debt, invest in Stocks, Mutual Funds, Crypto, Land, and a Business too. I have made some crazy profits and I have also lost some crazy amount of money. I never believed in certification, My engineering degree never actually thought me anything relevant and I see a lot of jobs don\u2019t match what they teach in colleges these days (Strange). I think the certificate is to sell the TAG, Real value comes with experience. Hence, I never pursued a financial advisor certificate and I know for a fact that finance is not simple and not the same for all people. Most financial advisors will only suggest a variety of Mutual Funds but they can\u2019t legally advise on stocks or crypto or even business investments. Hence I choose to be my own financial advisor and I invest in everything that can give me a return on investment. I earned, I saved, I Learned and I invested. Over time, I have become a contrarian & asymmetric Investor (Google it) This style of managing finance has allowed me to make a good amount of money and most probably will allow more to be made. My Advice: If you really want to succeed in building wealth or financial strength, You will need to do your homework and not just depend on a financial advisor. It's your money and it will have to be your effort and decision. Hope this helps Regards Surya Someshwara ",
