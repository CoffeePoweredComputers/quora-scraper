            "answer_text": "The Guns of August - Barbara Tuchman - Still the best introduction and discussion of the first operations of the war. As a caveat to how each country got to that point in time, I suggest her other pre-war book - The Proud Tower. The best written and engaging works in the last 50 years. August 1914 - Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn - I rarely read or recommend fictional works in the study of history, but there is a perspective in this work that is vital to the understanding of the Russian war effort and under the spell of Solzhenitsyn\u2019s writing, it is compelling like few other works about the war. I would rank it above All Quiet on the Western Front - Erich Maria Remarque in that respect. The First World War - John Keegan - Keegan works are all very well written and from a perspective that is inherently instructional. Little wonder as that was his most common occupation as a lecturer at Sandhurst when he wasn\u2019t writing excellent works on history and warfare. As a follow-on to how this war differed from previous eras, I suggest his The Face of Battle. There are many, many other fine works, but purely as an engaging \u2018first works\u2019 to be read, I suggest the above three. Once they are read, whole vistas of other deeper works can be explored.
