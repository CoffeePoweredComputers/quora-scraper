            "answer_text": "Yes, Stewart is an OK first introduction. On another thread the Schaum\u2019s Outline was recommended and I second that recommendation; the Schaum\u2019s Outlines are good learning tools. Nothing is perfect of course but Stewart gives most of what is needed. Of course a good instructor makes a lot of difference. I was in fact a theoretical math major aiming at a PhD in math, and I was shoved off track by a professor who believed in \u201cmath made difficult\u201d and used Apostol and delighted in embarrassing students publicly \u2014 young beginning students in their first semester, needing help and support \u2014 by catching them out with trick questions. He continued his attack methods at all levels and is responsible for chasing a large number of students out of the field of mathematics. As the field is not exactly overpopulated this approach is unnecessary; he just delighted in making people feel foolish, and Apostol helped. Save the theoretical work for after you know the essential groundwork of the field. Beginning classes need the applications in books like Stewart and others. BTW, many math majors go on to teach (what did you think you were going to do with that degree?) The great majority of your first-year calculus students are going on to engineering or the sciences. If you\u2019re particularly unlucky you may end up teaching Business Calculus or Calculus for Social Sciences. These students want and need the applications of calculus. Yes of course an acceptable course needs enough theory to make it hold together as a logical system, and yes you should teach the essential proofs and definitions. But you will find today\u2019s students have learned nothing at all of proofs in high school and will be very resistant to doing anything beyond Grade 9 algebra. You need to lead them gently up to the next level, not drown them in theoretical trivia. Details about convergent sequences and suprema may interest you, but they will go completely over your students\u2019 heads. On the other hand, finding maxima and minima and related rates and volumes are things they do need to know how to do and will be examined on. One frequent and highly justified complaint of beginning calculus students is that their instructors and TA\u2019s know all sorts of stuff about theory but can\u2019t solve the homework problems. One time I was in a graduate school math class and I was the only person out of eight or ten who remembered the formula for a Taylor series \u2014 I coach several students in the topic every year. I was shocked; all these people happily throw the concept of Taylor series around in discussions, but they don\u2019t really know what one *is*. Make sure you learn these essential basic applications both for your own understanding of the power of the subject and for your ability to help students later. For this purpose Stewart and other books with applications are preferable. Apostol and others can wait for the very small minority of even math majors who want to go in that direction. ",

            "answer_text": "I learned calculus from Stewart books. It was perfectly fine. I am now a mechanical engineer, so everything worked out. That said, if you want to supplement your learning, then look for Springer publications on the topic at hand. You can find these in a university library, and there are quite a few available online as free downloads. Also, I found \u201cHow to Ace Calculus\u201d to be a great supplement for learning, and yes, even for retaining the calculus I have learned. Finally - if you want to go further into the development behind the calculus, there is an interesting novel \u201cA Tour of the Calculus\u201d by David Berlinkski which provides a great narrative about the beginnings and challenges of the topic. He also has another book the deals with the history of important achievements in mathematics, \u201cInfinite Ascent.\u201d I enjoyed both of these Berlinkski books. ",
