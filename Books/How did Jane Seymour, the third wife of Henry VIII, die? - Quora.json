            "answer_text": "It's been commonly claimed to be \u201cchild bed fever\u201d, which commonly caused maternal death in those times. Sanitation was poor, and bacteria from unwashed hands entering torn tissues caused sepsis, which killed the mothers Jane was recorded to have an extremely long labor, which often precedes a difficult birth, so this might make sense. Except that Jane was recorded to have a fairly easy actual delivery, was seemingly hale enough the days following, and, although detailed records were kept, she was never mentioned to have an actual fever, which would have been a symptom. It also can't be blamed on Henry's neglect, as some have claimed. He was so concerned with her that he broke protocol and sent his own doctors to her to consult on the case (no men were allowed in the birthing chamber except a priest). Alison Weir has a theory that Jane may have died from a blood clot in the lung. It's certainly a possibility since a Queen's \u201clying in\u201d involved laying still on her back for a month or more. Now days we know how dangerous that is. Ms. Weir speculates that she may have had food poisoning which resulted into hurried trips to the loo, causing a clot to move from the leg to the lung. Dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea would also increase the likelihood of this happening. The court diet was unhealthy. Very fatty meats, rich sauces, and sweets. Jane seemed to be fond of poultry and fish with rich sauces. It's reported that she had asked for a meal to be brought to her from the kitchen after delivery (around 2am). Since leftovers from palace meals were given to the poor, and most food was purchased fresh each day, who knows what she was served or where it came from. Most Tudor historians believe that there was some conflict between the doctors that Henry sent, and the midwives in attendance. The doctors could not touch Jane, but they could advise. Henry was kind of a germ-a-phone, and he seemed to know the effect of cleanliness on sickness. It's logical that he insisted that those attending Jane would be clean. All of these factors lean away from childbed fever. I guess one can theorize many ways, but in the report the head midwife submitted, she wrote (regarding the cause of death), \u201cit what those around her gave her\u201d. Something the doctors gave her? Her servants? Food? We don't really know. All we know is that the midwives insisted it was not their fault, but somebody elses. ",

            "answer_text": "Most textbooks say that Jane died of puerperal, or 'childbed' fever less than a fortnight after giving birth to the baby who would become King Edward VI, though historians such as Alison Weir are questioning the traditional narrative: Tudor Times There were rumours at the time that the cause of death was a ceasarean section following a long and difficult labour, but Jane seems to have been too well and willing to receive visitors in the days immediately following the birth for this to have been likely. Certainly she seems to have blamed her weakening condition on poor bedside care from her attendants, and it seems that this, and a lack of medical understanding, contributed to her early death. Edward was born on 12th October, 1537; Jane was dead by 24th October. ",
