I used \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 because i don\u2019t know your Name and I am New on Quora so i also Don\u2019t know to use it better. I can feel your Problem, Same thing Happened with me and i would like to share that how I Overcame it. First, Let me tell you I am very Lazy. when i study, i rarely use notebook. In mathematics and Physics i use but in Chemistry i do not. I always try to study in hurry and when i study it feels like i am getting everything but later i comes to know that I don\u2019t know anything. it happened with me when i was in Class 10, it also happens now also but i can overcome it. When you go to Study, you should always have a Water Bottle with you, while studying if you drink little bit of water then it increases your concentration. Before starting your Study, You should walk for five minutes and at that time you should not be thinking anything and your eyes should be few feet ahead from your feet. And you always sit with Notebook with you and after reading a paragraph close your book and write a summary in your notebook if you can write then go ahead otherwise read that again and write that paragraph. then slowly you should read two paragraph and write then you should increase the level up to the time when you can read a whole chapter properly and then you can write the summary of whole Chapter. You always have to revise these notes only and do not make these notes in good handwriting make them in Roughly Handwriting. I bet it will help you and will increase your mind also, it is a good mind Activity. Surely it will work. Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "Hello brother, I think I can give this answer because being an average student I have suffered a lot from this problem. I just read books or theory and completely understand those topics but when the main time came ie, exams at that time I started forgetting everything and hardly remembered anything I passed my 12th and then I get a college but the situation was same everytime. I could remember a thing or topic not more than 2 days. I never sit in any placements activities because of lack of knowledge. I thought to give gate(it's for graduation students , don't get confused) it will be easy for me and started preparing it I read everything and completed my syllabus and when I sat for their online test series alas! I forgot every theory concept and formula, I was very sad and attempted exam and hardly passed I didn't get any college. Then one day I told my father about my problem he said that revision can only make you better and stronger. He said that study 10 percent but revise it 100 percent then only things will get stored in your brain. I started preparing again this year and as I completed 1 chapter I revise it at weekend and solved every question regarding the topics and Notes play the important role in that. So brother nobody is perfect but practice and revision makes them perfect. I am very excited this year to give that exam again. So please remove this tension and start preparing with a time to revise everything. And don't let you motivation down anytime. All the very best for your bright future. Brother. ",
