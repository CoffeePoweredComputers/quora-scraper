            "answer_text": "Right now. As soon as you can. And don\u2019t pay for it.  I know that I am going to get all kinds of hate comments for saying this\u2026 but it\u2019s the truth\u2026 so here it goes\u2026 First, it takes a lot of work to become a certified financial planner or any type of licensed investment professional. However, have you ever wondered why someone who is an expert at investing money charges you to invest your money? I mean, if they were so good at investing, why wouldn\u2019t they just focus all their time on investing their own money? Hmmm\u2026 Well, I won\u2019t speculate too much on that. Instead I\u2019ll give you a couple options. If you are gung-ho about tackling your own financial destiny, then there are a ridiculous amount of free resources out there. There are all kinds of investing websites, blogs, resource centers, and videos all over YouTube that will give a ton of free information. Of course not all the information will be good, but that\u2019s why you look at lots of stuff, to give yourself a balanced viewpoint. If you spend a little bit of money you can buy some great books that will take your learning ever further. But, let\u2019s say you don\u2019t want to learn about investing. You just want someone to take your money and invest it for you. You don\u2019t want to deal with the hassles of watching the stock market everyday and worrying about what decisions the Fed is going to make. Well\u2026 if you fall into that category, there are a couple options for you... You can invest in a Vanguard Index Fund that has a fee of less than a tenth of a percent. These index funds perform very well and charge almost nothing for it. You can also invest in a service like Betterment or Wealthfront. These are basically robo-advisors and will take all of the complicated investing strategies out of your hands, in a good way. However\u2026 here is the bottom-line: If you don\u2019t get a financial advisor (whether it\u2019s you, an index fund, a robo-advisor, or an actual human), you will be seriously jeopardizing all of the hard work that you are doing. I write several times a week about investing and wealth building, all for free. I fortunately realized at a younger age that I was the only person who was going to save my financial situation - so I did something about it, and it\u2019s worked great. ",

            "answer_text": "I get this question a fair bit since for years I consulted thousand of financial advisors across the country. Deciding when you should get an advisor depends on a number of different factors such as life stage, age, income, how busy you are among others. To help give you an idea, I\u2019ve taken a couple of difference personal profiles from my blog - see which is closest to you and use that as a starting point. Sarah - single, 24 years old  Does Sarah need a Financial Advisor? No Sarah is young, has no debt, no dependents or partner and she is saving every month. Instead of spending the $1,000 she might spend on an advisor, she should contribute this amount directly towards building an emergency fund. If she wants to get more organized, she can download our free budget excel spreadsheet, use free online finance software options like Mint and read our free guides to educate herself as her life stage starts to change. Michael and Stephanie \u2013 engaged, both 29 years old  Do they need a Financial Advisor? Maybe After they marry, their individual finances merge, and considering the number one cause for stress in relationships is money, a great financial advisor can help set some good financial habits as a couple from the start. At this stage, there is probably no need to hire an advisor that manages their investments, as most of their savings are in their current 401k plans. Getting a one time fee financial plan or hiring an advisor on a retainer is probably best in their case, since their investable assets are below $50,000. The advisor\u2019s expertise should include holistic financial planning for young couples, consolidation of student loan debt and counsel on short term goals such as buying a house and building a more robust emergency fund. Mark and Kerry \u2013 married with 1 child, Mark is 34 and Kerry is 32  Do they need a Financial Advisor? Yes, they can definitely use one! Mark and Kerry could use a great advisor that can help them with their budgeting and debt consolidation. They are in dire need of saving towards an emergency fund before they even get started on student loan repayments or retirement planning. Considering that they have a young child, the advisor can also help them find the appropriate coverage of their term life insurance. Steve and Jon \u2013 married with 1 kid, Steve is 45 and Jon is 40  Do they need a Financial Advisor? Yes, for investment advice Steve and Jon have their monthly expenses well under control, but they could use a financial advisor that has strong experience in retirement planning and investments. A great advisor can improve their haphazard portfolio by incorporating their personal risk tolerance and goals to construct a portfolio with realistic return expectations. He or she can also examine the investment fees and investment taxes that they are currently paying to ensure they are being cost and tax efficient. Lastly, a great advisor can educate Steve & Jon on the importance of setting up a Power of Attorney and a Will and can connect them with the right Estate Advisor to do so. Dave and Claire \u2013 married with 2 kids, Dave is 55 and Claire is 54  Do they need a Financial Advisor? Yes Yes, Dave and Claire should look for a financial advisor that has strong experience in retirement planning and investments. A great advisor can help them take a more strategic approach to their investment portfolio by analyzing their risk tolerance and adjusting the risk/return profile of their portfolio. He or she can help them set realistic expectations of the income they will receive when they retire in 10-12 year\u2019s time. The advisor can also educate them on the importance of, and the steps involved in, setting up a proper estate plan. Perhaps you can relate to one of our profiles? Perhaps not. The point however is that no matter what life stage you are in, you can always use some help improving your situation. But that does not mean that everyone should hire a financial advisor! When your money is more valuable than your time, which tends to be when you are younger and have less income, it might make more sense to educate yourself on how to develop good saving habits, rather than doling out money to hire an expert. As your income rises and your life becomes more complicated (in a good way) with marriage, children, home ownership etc., time becomes a scarcer resource and it might make more sense to outsource the task of the household CFO by hiring someone to help you. To figure out where you stand, we offer a free financial assessment with our director of financial planning. He can assess whether or not you need any professional help and, if so, discuss the most important areas and who would be best suited to help you. To check out the full bog series, click here. ",

            "answer_text": "I think everyone can benefit from some advice. And at every level, there is an adviser with a client profile that matches. For example, some advisers help people on the low end with debt elimination or starting a savings plan. On the other end, there are \u2018family offices\u2019 that manage the entire financial situation for 1 or a few wealthy families (depends on the wealth). If you have significant wealth, I would absolutely recommend that you interview advisors to get an idea of the value they can add. In fact, I just answered a Quora question that asked: What value does a \u201cfinancial plan\u201d add to your life? (link). I also decided to answer it via a Youtube video HERE because I thought it was something I wanted to rant about a bit! The point behind my answer was that many people don\u2019t really understand all the different things that a comprehensive adviser team would look out for for you. Furthermore, some people prefer to delegate financial management for this reason, and because they have better things to do with their time. One Cautionary Step to Take The one thing that you could do that might cause you problems is giving any advisor (financial, lawyer, etc) custody of your assets. In this I mean, the ability to actually cash out and direct your money as you would. I don\u2019t accept this responsibility from clients - always leaving to them the final decision on spending, cashing out etc. This also offers the clients a layer of protection and it\u2019s how Madoff made off with the funds. It\u2019s ok to allow \u2018investment discretion,\u2019 meaning the advisor can buy and sell investments (require an ok though on anything that isn\u2019t \u2018standard\u2019) but not full custody where they could withdraw funds without your approval. Helpful Guide I created a helpful guide to give people some assistance on choosing the best advisory relationship for them, if having a relationship at all would be a good fit. It works through such factors as your personality type, advisor types, compensation, etc. You can request that HERE. And in case you are wondering, if you follow the guide, there is a 85\u201390% chance it will tell you NOT to work with someone like me:) ",

            "answer_text": "People tend to be their own worst enemy when it comes to finance. An advisor may know little more than the client knows about some aspects of the situation, but they are more objective. They help the client control their inevitable emotional responses to both good and bad financial news. They help the client stay focused on their goals. They help the client avoid goal destroying diversions. They provide context for surprises. Clients need financial tools. Tools are methods distilled from experience into a product. Things like life and disability insurance, investment vehicles and information about the containers they fit within. Tax deferred, or not being common. They help with arithmetic decisions like pay debt or invest in a deferred income plan. They help with assessing the financial environment. When it is your business to keep up, you do it. Most clients have their own important things to keep up with. Advisors share information about the environment. Context for decisions. Advisors have hundreds of people trying to do more or less the same thing. Some have already gotten to their goals. Advisors can connect theory to observed outcomes. Think of an advisor as someone who can keep you in touch with your goals,aware of trends and change,focused,motivated,communicatingchanging for the better as things around you change,emotionally centered andlearningMost of all advisors have access and know about more tools than the client. Always true. The facts don\u2019t matter as much as the emotional support and guidance as to the context of your particular situation. Tools come along as needed. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I would want to work with an advisor when I feel like it\u2019s time to get serious about organizing my whole financial life and/or to invest like I mean it. You may seek out professional advice because you simply want to look at your cash flow or you might want someone with whom you can collaborate or you may want to turn over the portfolio management to someone else. This could happen when you\u2019re young and your financial life isn\u2019t complicated and you want to get the planning off on the right track, but more likely as you get into your 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s when your savings starts to pile up and you\u2019re anticipating retirement. At that point, that\u2019s when an excellent advisor can add tremendous value by helping you make informed decisions about investing, taxes, family issues or about your business. The key is who? Number one, an advisor must be willing to take full fiduciary responsibility for his advice, and put that in writing. No one working for a brokerage firm or insurance company can accept that level of accountability. That means you have to find the right fiduciary advisor, or planner, who is independent and will work only and directly for you. And that individual advisor must be able to demonstrate competency. This is the whole reason I developed Wealthramp to simplify the search for vetted, fiduciary advisors. When you\u2019re ready to work with an advisor he or she will help you invest and keep your fees as low as possible, and to the extent you want to learn, your advisor should be happy to educate you all along the way so you can operate with knowledge and confidence.

            "answer_text": "Probably when you no longer feel comfortable with that financial advisor. If you feel like you\u2019re being screwed over by a financial advisor, that\u2019s probably a good sign that you need to start looking for other options. Usually, you\u2019ll get that gut feeling that something isn\u2019t right, but sometimes it\u2019s pretty obvious, too: If the advisor doesn\u2019t return your callsIf the advisor\u2019s advice isn\u2019t tailored to YOUR specific situationIf the advisor doesn\u2019t ask what your future goals areOr, if the advisor\u2019s advice just plain stinksFrom my article (linked above) on this subject: To get the very best financial advice from advisors, you need to do two things: Get 2nd, 3rd, and 4th opinions; visit every advisor in town if need be.Don\u2019t show any advisor what the other advisors recommended.It does not matter if the Advisor is a CFP, Fiduciary, Registered Representative, Hybrid, Fee-Only, or whatever. They all have one goal: they want you to work with them and not someone else and there is not a credential or compensation method that is any more or less impartial or fundamentally more altruistic. Advisors do this exceptionally well, and that\u2019s to pick apart someone else\u2019s work. If you go into a meeting with an advisor and the previous advisor recommended ABC funds, well then, you are about to get a lesson on why ABC funds are the \u201cgreat Satan\u201d. Ask every advisor to design what they believe is the best plan possible, then you can take all the plans and compare the pros and cons of each on your own. If an advisor really has your best interest at heart and knows the best way to help you reach your goals, they should have no issue with putting their best foot forward without knowing what everyone else in town is recommending.

            "answer_text": "First of all, if you are seriously asking, that might be the first clue! Other reasons (of many) to seek another financial advisor may include the following: The financial advisor relies on commissions for more than 10% of his revenue. Your advisor should preferably be \u201cfee only.\u201dYou don\u2019t understand how your advisor is investing your money.(Really 2a) When you ask her to explain how your investments are handled, your advisor is either unable or unwilling(!) to explain the program in plain english to your satisfaction.Your advisor is a \u201chammer in search of a nail,\u201d and will force his \u201csolution\u201d to fit everyone\u2019s \u201cproblem.\u201dYour advisor cannot adequately explain the growth (or lack thereof) in the context of your overall financial plan.She did a comprehensive financial plan, right? Right?Your financial advisor does not 100% act in a fiduciary capacity. This is a very specific word\u2026they can\u2019t legally say \u201cfiduciary\u201d if they don\u2019t meet very specific standards.Your advisor holds your money. This is a HUGE red flag. A reputable financial advisor will NEVER have direct access to your money. It should be kept at a 3rd party custodian, such as Schwab, Fidelity, etc.Your advisor promises high returns. Another big red flag.(Related to #4 above). Your advisor pushes hard to sell you variable annuities, fixed indexed annuities, and/or whole life as the answer to all of your financial problems. In reality, these \u201cproducts\u201d (which pay huge up front commissions to the \u201cadvisor\u201d) are only useful in very few, very specific circumstances.Your advisor cannot show you exactly how he is compensated, to the penny.I\u2019m sure that there are many more, but, if even one of these pops up, I would seriously consider looking for another advisor.

            "answer_text": "Have a process! For everybody reading this, I would say you should narrow down your investment and financial planning needs to 5-10 core things, probably 5-6 at best. You don\u2019t need to focus on other objectives. I would suggest you focus on the following things. Some of these things will apply for you, and some won\u2019t depending on your situation. Some apply to all: 1). Focus on getting at least a middle-income job. Whilst it is easier than you think, in fact very easy, to become financially free and/or a multi-millionaire on a middle-class income, it isn\u2019t easy to become financial free if you are unemployed of course or don\u2019t have an online income or another form of income. For people who are 18 or very young, getting the skills needed to earn must be priority number 1. 2). Watch your spending habits. They matter more than your income. This applies to everybody, full stop. 3). Read the academic evidence with an open-mind on finance, including then reasons why DIY investors tend to fail. Knowing the evidence isn\u2019t good enough.Doctors know you shouldn\u2019t smoke, be fat or drink, but most of them do at least one of these habits! Most people in financial services also struggle with these `human nature issues`. Be very candid with yourself. Do you have the needed character to face the challenges of becoming financial independent? If you can\u2019t face volatility for example, or are the type of person who easily panics or gets greedy, it would be better to delegate this task to a professional. 4). Don\u2019t ignore wealth protection. Health insurance isn\u2019t needed if you are in many European countries, but it is needed in countless others. Life cover and income protection can be very useful, depending on your specific circumstances. Protection is dead money if nothing happens so limit yourself to a small fraction of your income on these products but don\u2019t neglect them entirely. 5). Take advantage of tax efficient structures. If you are British living in the UK, that means using ISAs. If you are British living overseas, that may mean investing in SIPPS and so on. The same applies to Dutch, Americans and many other citizens. Depending on your nationality and residency, make sure you take advantage of tax-efficient structures. 6). After you retire, don\u2019t withdraw more than 4% of your portfolio per year. If you don\u2019t follow this rule, you risk either running out of funds or your kids may not get the inheritance hoped for. To simplify matters further you could reduce this to just 2-3 steps: Read the academic evidence including evidence on investing, tax efficient structures, wealth protection and why DIY investors failGet a middle-income (average) or better job if you don\u2019t alreadyThen decide if you want to DIY or use a professional to help you. Especially read the evidence on why DIY investors fail and why even those who read the evidence don't usually implement it - Does DIY investing work?Of course simple and easy are two different things. Knowing something isn\u2019t as complicated as it first seems, however its great to imagine a better and more stress free future. ",
