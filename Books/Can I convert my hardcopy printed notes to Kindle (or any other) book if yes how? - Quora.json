            "answer_text": "Are you talking about handwritten notes or typed notes? If handwritten, first find a way to scan them and import them into a PDF or Word file. A TIFF file might work if you can find a scanner capable of it. From here on out, the steps are the same for either handwritten or typed notes. Download the free software Calibre. Then add your PDF or other file as a book. Use the Convert button and convert the file to a .mobi or .azw3 document (or other format as required by your e-reader.) Connect your Kindle (or other e-reader) into the computer, and Calibre should recognize it easily enough. Use Calibre to upload it to the e-reader, and you should be good to go. A Kindle can also read PDF\u2019s natively, though depending on the size of your handwritten notes, it may significantly shrink the page size down tot the screen size. Also, converting the PDF to a .mobi or other e-book format may not work particularly well with image-based documents like handwritten notes, so you may be better off just using the PDF file. Word docs will transfer well. You can even use format headings to create an actual HTML table of contents that your ebook will be able to interpret. ",

Retype or pay someone to retype, put it in the right ebook format, and then upload to KDP and sell on Amazon. Another alternative is to scan your images and include them as attachments or illustrations as part of your book - though do be aware that drawings/scans/charts don\u2019t work great on Kindle viewer. Your best bet is to retype or pay someone to retype it into MS Word and then make it an ebook. ",

If you have the Pro version of Acrobat, you could output to a Word document.
