            "answer_text": "Scared is an adjective here. If he's scared, he's frightened, if he's frightened, he's anxious. If he's anxious, he's probably afraid. All of which are adjectives. PARTICIPIAL ADJECTIVES-adjectives formed from past participle form of a verb. \u2018Is\u2019, here is a linking verb. And the linking verb is a grammar term for a verb that connects a subject with a noun or adjective that describes the subject. Here the linking verb IS links the subject HE to some information concerning its state of being, SCARED(referred to as \u2018a subject complement\u2019). He's scared and he's happy are similar constructions. Happy is a regular adjective; scared is a participial adjective. Please know that the presence of a past participle alone doesn't make a construction, a passive voice one. Other examples: He's dead. He's well-known. He's open-minded. He's broad-minded. ",

            "answer_text": "It can go either way depending on your intent. In a linking verb construction, was is a linking verb and scared is a past participle adjective and a subject complement. It means the same thing as: He was afraid. In the passive voice, was scared is an auxiliary verb followed by a main verb in the past participle form. It means the same thing as: He was frightened [by the ghost]. To put that in the active voice, we move the subject (he) to the object position (him). We find the do-er\u2014which either is explicit in a prepositional phrase or can be derived from context (ghost). Then we drop the auxiliary verb (was): The ghost frightened him. I hope that helps!
