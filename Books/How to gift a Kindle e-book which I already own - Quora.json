You don\u2019t own the digital book, you bought the right to read the book and have it in ONE library, yours. If you talk to Amazon you might have the book removed from your library permanently (which Amazon always has online if you get a new device), and then give it to someone but I doubt they will like that or even find it legal. For gifting a book that you buy again there is another link on the right side of the browser window which says \u201cGive as gift\u201d.  ",

You can give another copy of a Kindle book you already own, but for that you don\u2019t use \u201cBuy now\u2026\u201d but \u201cGive as a gift\u201d button. That said, Amazon has filed a number of patents for a mechanism that yould allow owners of e-book licenses to resell (or gift) them. Publishers were not interested, as expected. ",
