            "answer_text": "I see Mr. Datta receiving some flak. So here goes. I can\u2019t comment on Mr. Datta\u2019s books or writing as I haven\u2019t read them. What I can share, is an incident that tells me why on an average yours truly and a hundred other writer\u2019s are outsold by a factor of a million by Mr. Datta. There must be something the man is doing right, so lets give him credit where it is due. As I am from an Army family, I did a recce of the massive crossword bookstore at Aundh, Pune for my book\u2019s launch. I could not have chosen a worse day since Mr Datta with those glorious dimples had his book launch that evening and the store was overflowing with young women being young women and trying to get a picture with DD. Here we were, my wife and I at the edge of the crowd looking at the women for our own reasons. (Mine being scientific) She looked at me. Possibly for a moment worried that this is the default reaction that writer\u2019s get and I must have given her my irresistible Rowan Atkinson \u2018I am so hot\u2019 look for she looked reassured. She was right of course, as the events of the next couple of years have shown. Apart from the shameless plug of my book Rustom and the Last Storyteller of Almora , my point is the answer - no matter what one might feel about his writing or plots - is he is a highly influential author who probably in terms of sheer numbers is in the Top 5 in India along with Chetan, Amish, Ravindra Pal Singh. And this popularity does not come by chance. You might say ok fine we will buy your book for you seem to be a nice guy, but my point is selling books is more difficult than writing them. It is very difficult to breakthrough the way he has, and DD has found his niche, his base and he is being clever addressing them like other writer\u2019s have their own audience. So no point in passing judgment. Here is quote from Teddy Roosevelt on critics. It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. So more power to everyone who is being himself / herself and being great at that. ",

            "answer_text": "If a brain damaged racoon scratched sandy earth with a spade it would still write a better story than Durjoy Datta. Every single one of his books is a 300 page long bowel movement. The rain of steaming turds begins at the cover page.  The title is something a guy who just read his first joke book would think is witty and clever.  Why doesn't penguin give him an editor?  Notice how he 'charmingly' implies that it is fiction where his co-author(who is way better than him despite being a first time writer) in acknowledgements says it's based on Durjoy Datta's real life. All his writing is just, 'hey I'm a nerd but I do sex with girls all the time and so can you'.  Don't believe me? Look at the summary. The protagonist's name is joy(Durjoy geddit?). He has MULTIPLE relationships. All Durjoy Datta books make it clear that he's swimming in it. In conclusion as an author Durjoy Datta is a writer of badly constructed, extremely exaggerated autobiographical wank. PS: All Durjoy Datta books are the same book. ",
