            "answer_text": "I admire that you are expressive when you write. Keep up with that. Writing gives us more time to organize our thoughts, articulate them into apt words, rephrase if needed and then convey. Spoken words on the other hand has got more to do with eloquency, ability to emote, confidence and ease. Some simple things that can help- Effective and active listening : Good listener makes a good speaker. So before you speak, focus, absorb, analyse and then respond. Try to not break or interrupt when someone is talking.Mirror technique : This is very effective way wherein you stand in front of mirror and just have a conversation with yourself. Talk about any random thing that comes to your mind. Observe yourself while you do so.Begin with small talks and don't be afraid to voice what you feel. If you feel conscious, phone calls can be a great way to go about.Let the words flow. Don't stop from making a mistake or two. You will learn from it.Enjoy while you talk. Take small pauses. Breathe. We often tend to talk faster than our normal speed and we don't really notice it. So try to go slow and steady.Voice modulations. Everyone has a great voice. Engage the listener.Be confident, polite and pleasant. Acknowledge the other person.Keep a smile on your face. Use hand gestures. Have a positive body language.All the best :) ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s best to start small. Go have a 90-second chat with someone who is paid to be nice to you. Chat about the weather with your grocery store clerk. Talk about the football game with your barista at Starbucks. There\u2019s no risk. You know it\u2019s going to be short. They could lose their jobs if they\u2019re rude, so they\u2019ll probably be nice. Those things count. They count for your mental health. They count for your emotional health. But even more importantly, every positive conversation, every positive experience that you have with a conversation is going to encourage you to have another one. You\u2019re going to experience those benefits, and it\u2019s going to make you even bolder when you start the next conversation, until you have worked your way up to having conversations even if there might be disagreements.
