            "answer_text": "Numbers! I had your problem. I'd read a book and the not pick another for weeks and months. Then I made it a mission to read X number of books in a year We know there are 365 days in a year, divide that by X: I decided that I wanted to read 150 books this year. I calculated so many alternatives, reading 100, 200, 91, and 150 was the sweet spot So far I have read 57: 57 * (365/150)  = 138.7 So since today is the 132th day. I am 6 days a head What's the point? 12 is stuck in my head. I must read 12 books a month (this gives me 144, but Im sure 6 books will be read without having to remember the exact left over number). How did I manage to be ahead? I found short books. The most amazing thing is that I truly am glad that I have read them. Or I'd read three short books and a  big one. From this, I have learned that the act of reading is not the point, what you get from reading is the important part. And I have also learned to let go of the \"panic\" that I can't remember what I have read. Sooner or later you pick a book that will spark something within, that makes you remember the things you thought you forgot. Curing bordem I started read Kane and Abel by Jeffrey Archer (592 pages). It was amazing. It was my first book where each alternating chapter focused on a different character, I found that fascinating (Later on I read The Spinoza Problem by Irvin D. Yalom that did the same thing). Half way through the book I got bored and picked two other books. A month later I picked Kane and Abel again and started where I had left off - I picked it up again because all throughout that month, my mind was playing the story that I had read up to where I left. There have been few books that I just found boring, I just left then and never thought about re-reading them. Where and how I read where ever I can. I have a kindle and a kindle app on my phone. I also use audiobooks. As I said before, the information * is the key, it doesn't mater whether you get it in the car, in the toilet or under your covers. * information = facts or fiction, what ever you like ",

            "answer_text": "I gather that you are trying to make a habit of reading specifically books daily, and not reading in general. Regardless, just keep in mind that you can also learn much from reading reports, articles, booklets, the list goes on. That is not to mean a lazy alternative, or that I'm downgrading book-reading (for I consider myself a bookworm); it is a fact. Addressing your question: Don't restrict yourself to reading about things that are merely interesting. Read what interests you.Know that despite being passionate about a certain topic, you will probably find yourself shunning away from it under certain situations, in certain moods. Don't force yourself to read something you aren't in the mood for at that moment. That will only make reading a real turn-off for you.Likewise, allow yourself some allowance. If you're simply in the mood for a book that is not known to be \"good\", although you have a list of \"actually good\" books waiting, read it. Don't suppress your urge to read, especially in these early stages.Enjoy it. Savour it. Never make it an effort or a chore. Thanks for the A2A, and have fun reading! ",
