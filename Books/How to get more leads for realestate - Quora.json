            "answer_text": "The successful agents I know are teamed up with great companies that offer steady leads to their agents. Of the lead systems I have worked with (tigerleads, zurple and zillow) Zurple was the best one. If you want to pay for leads I suggest zurple if you dont want to pay for leads I would be looking through craigslist and other sites like that for people looking for rentals or who are selling their homes themselves. Getting business in real estate is all about connections, carry your card on you hand it out all the time (coffee shop or walmart), also picking a neighborhood and passing out flyers. There are a lot of different approaches you have to decide what your comfortable doing and how much you want to spend. Also pulling a list for the MLS of recently removed from the market or expired listing (if you are not afraid of cold calling) may also work. ",

It usually involves making a number of calls a day, deal with rejection, maybe get a prospect or two a day. Another route is to buy leads. Zillow, Trulia and the like will sell user data. Other services exist thay sell leads too. Buddying up to hr/relocation at a good sized company can also generate steady leads. Prospect farming takes some time to get rolling, but sticking to a method that keeps you meeting new clients is key to long term success. Though Once it\u2019s up and running you may have so many leads that you can start referring them to other real estate licenscees for that sweet referral fee. ",
