            "answer_text": "One of the easiest ways I promote the books I have selling through Amazon\u2019s KDP is to use snippets and teasers from the book, and combine them with the book link and promote them on social media. I usually make ten to twelve teaser graphics while I am waiting for my book to be edited, and have them ready to go when my books goes live on Amazon. However, the \u201clow content\u201d aspect of your question bothers me. I don\u2019t even know what that means, but would add my warning to the one offered by Mary Findley below - short books won\u2019t make you any money. They are only useful as free giveaways to help promote a longer book on the same topic or perhaps the book is a prequel to a series you have available. Short - no useful content books - get bad reviews on Amazon. Readers request a refund. If more than ten percent of your sales are given back to customers in the form of a refund, Amazon starts looking closely at your book and can withdraw it from sale if they think you are scamming their system. I would suggest writing a longer book with decent content. Thank you for the A2A. ",
