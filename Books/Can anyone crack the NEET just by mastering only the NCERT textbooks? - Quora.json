            "answer_text": "Yes, you can easily crack neet by just mastering ncert textbooks. Majority of questions are from them. If one analyzes the paper of 2019 by nta we can say that most of the questions where asked directly from the ncert. For biology they generally give the lines quoted from the book directly. For that you need to be familiar with each topic or to be more specific each lines, each paragraph, each diagram and even each page of the book and when you are done with it you can definitely score good. For chemistry it is divided in three parts; for inorganic ncert is more than enough. For organic you should read ncert for the chapters like biomolecules, chemistry in everyday life and polymers. Coming to the other chapter reading it once is required but your main focus should be on solving more and more questions. For physical solve as much question as you can. Besides ncert questions you can go for ncert exampler and other objective books. Coming to physics I never went through its 11th ncert. Though 12th one is good. You can read it once. But solve as much question you can especially of the topics of more weightage and questions which have direct applications of formulas. In case of physics you should have all the formula on your tips. Besides these you should keep solving previous year papers for an idea of the question pattern. Hope this may help and all the best..
