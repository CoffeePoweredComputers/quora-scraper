            "answer_text": "No, I don't think so.But how can you say? Because the basic ingredients of any biscuits are flour, butter, sugar/substitute, yeast among others.And as such the flour is made of cereal which have fat content and so does butter or oil used.So they are definetly not fat free but may be free from Transfats or Cholestrol, but do check the packing and nutritional info.
