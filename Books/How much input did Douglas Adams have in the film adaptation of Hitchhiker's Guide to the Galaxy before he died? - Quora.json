            "answer_text": "Douglas didn't live to see the movie get fully greenlit, let alone made. However, the deal with Spyglass (and Disney) was done a couple of years before he died. He turned out at least six or seven drafts of the script after that. Most of the major plot additions came from him, including the Point-Of-View Gun (which he'd been kicking around in draft form for many years), Humma Kavula and the Vogsphere \"slapstick\" sequence (which explains how the Vogons were guided to evolve with flattened, upturned noses and no imagination). After Douglas died, Spyglass went looking for additional script doctoring to sort out the pacing and make other tweaks. (Pacing's hard on Hitchhiker's; bear in mind that in the radio and TV  versions it's episodic, uneven, and takes two hours to get to the end of  the Magrathea sequence, and if you use that as the whole story you  don't have a proper middle and end.) Josh Friedman (The Sarah Connor Chronicles, War Of The Worlds) turned in a draft which was never used. In the end Karey Kirkpatrick (Chicken Run) was given the job; most of his changes were around pacing, with a few extra gags. Most of the great sight gags and other design work came from the Hammer & Tongs production team (apart from the Guide sequences, which were all designed and delivered by Shynola). The Vogons were inspired by the cartoons of 17th century satirist William Hogarth, of whom Douglas was a fan. I was lucky enough to wander around the sets during production and saw the incredible attention the team put into things which got almost no screen time - such as all the Vogon signage (written in Pitman shorthand) and the incredible circular mural that shows the story of the Infinite Improbability Drive. (Some context: I worked at Douglas's company The Digital Village from '97 to 2000, and helped out with some very minor aspects of the movie and its marketing. Some of my colleagues will have better memories around this, I'll see if I can pull them in...) ",

            "answer_text": "We have to remember that this was a twenty-year itch by Douglas - he'd moved to LA circa 1984 to work on the script, which didn't happen then (not least because he wanted to retain more script control than the studios were comfortable with), he and we had sweated blood over the film deal in the nineties, only to keep getting told, \"It's great, but there's no money in Comedy Sci-Fi\". Then MIB came out one Friday and the TDV switchboard melted on the Monday morning. The voice of the guide did take some casting - although Stephen has a perfect voice for it and was a good friend of Douglas, Peter Jones had been the original consideration (obviously), but was too ill by then and then, for quite a while, there was the real left-field possibility that Oliver Postgate would voice the Guide. That was nixed by the studio on the simple principle that Oliver wouldn't play well (or comprehensibly) in Oshkosh.  Douglas didn't live to see any of the movie visuals, unfortunately. The original director lined up for the movie was Jay Roach, but the usual delays in moving from script to production meant that he was otherwise committed by the time production planning started. Everything Yoz writes is spot on. Believe the Yoz. ",
