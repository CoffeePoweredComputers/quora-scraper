            "answer_text": "I can understand your problem. I have read books like 'How to win friends and influence people' or  'Psychology of Winning - 10 qualities of a total winner'. Personally I find these titles misleading and myself often very uncomfortable reading in public because I literally felt how people were looking at me and asking themselves 'Doesn't he have friends?' 'Is he manipulating people?' 'Oh boy he must be a total jerk regarding himself to be a winner'. And I think this is a very very bad habit in human behaviour. And whenever I felt people looking at me I thought of the saying 'Do not judge a book by its cover'. And this has become very important to me because when you read for example 'How to win friends and influence people' you discover that it is really not about influencing (in terms of manipulating) people or winning friends, but it is a set of examples and mindsets that transform you into a better human being everybody likes to be around. I even dared trying to manipulate somebody into liking me by talking about his interests. And to my surprise it worked within 15 minutes of asking question about photography. If I had to break that book down to one simple sentence I'd say: Make people talk about themselves and show honest interest in it (even if it is not honest).  But to not turn this into a book review I'll give you the answer to your question: Use a book cover as proposed in the other answers.  To overcome my discomfort I went in the other direction. I would openly show what I was reading and I was happy with everybody asking me what my book was about. I have not yet reached the point where I can say I don't care what people think but I am moving ahead and getting very close.  The way I think is that by covering the books you read or the music you like to listen you put yourself in a cover and that is not the solution to the problem. I think you need to open up, maybe take a couple hits (bad experiences) but enjoy the moments where people show interest in you even more. I think that is the only way to get more self-esteem. I hope I could help you beyond your actual question and you can improve in a way you won't need to cover your book up because you may be ashamed.  PS: If it's porn or extremist whatever I can understand why you want to cover it because it can get really bad (beyond just hostile thoughts by others). ",
