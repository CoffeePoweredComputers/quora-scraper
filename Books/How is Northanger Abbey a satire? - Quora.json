            "answer_text": "Northanger Abbey is a commentary on as well as satire and general send up of the popular Gothic novels of her era. Austen was exploiting public interest in the creaky house, creepy older man, and frightened virginal young heroine tropes of the era\u2019s popular Gothic novels. However, satire relies on us knowing what is being taken to the ridiculous max. Because of this, Northanger Abbey is one of the hardest Jane Austen books to read now, up there with Mansfield Park and its classically passive heroine, because we generally do not read the books that she is interrogating and referencing. We simply don\u2019t know the tropes and so miss the often hilarious satire she is presenting. The novel still works because some of this is still known, the haunted house and Hammer horror films have preserved some of the tropes for us, but there is far less hilarity when we don\u2019t realise that she is slightly rewriting existing ideas for humorous effect. A few of us have read The Monk by Lewis. Fewer again have read the works of the, at the time, bestselling Ann Radcliffe and her The Mysteries of Udolpho, which is a key reference for Austen\u2019s book. (That\u2019s partly because some of the characters now read as appallingly xenophobic and racist, also because the heroines do not fit with our heroic ideals any more.) It\u2019s like watching Blackadder or Fawlty Towers with no knowledge of England\u2019s history or character. You\u2019ll get some of the jokes, but most will go by with a rather sad whooshing sound as you utterly miss why something is funny. Our heroine, Catherine Morland, spends the first half of the book having a normal Austen experience, e.g. getting chatted up by unsuitable young men and going to parties. It\u2019s only when she visits her new friend at her country house that we move from the classic romance novel plot to that of the gothic novel. Suddenly, our heroine sees danger, deceit, and devils in every corner. She believes she is trapped in a world where terrible things happen to lovely young women and where much older men exert vicious control, so attempts to save herself. Her actions are, frequently, brave, but also result in embarrassment for both herself and her friends. The reader is vaguely aware that this is all utterly absurd, that General Tilney is merely unpleasant and not evil, and that Catherine is only a victim of her over-active imagination. She is never in actual danger of her life, but she is in fact in danger of ruining her social reputation by behaving like a feather-headed fool, and losing the young man she loves. For an Austen novel, not marrying who you want is akin to dying, and is often accompanied by a decline in health or beauty. Readers of the time may also have recognised the satire-within-the-satire that Catherine is exactly why parents warn their daughters off reading trashy gothic novels as they lead to over-heated imaginations and ridiculous goings on. Yet we are reading Austen\u2019s book telling us not to read books like this, while also giving us many of the best Gothic tropes tricked out in properly beautiful language, with occasionally cleverly overheated prose that mirrors that used in the straight tellings. So the heroine is suffering for the very outcome that the parents warn against, but we are reading an example of the very books which they are warning us against, and that book is also warning us against reading this kind of novel. Yet the book demands that we finish it and figure out the central mystery, another key gothic trope. Austen is, as ever, as twisty as a corkscrew, always turning just as you expect her to play straight. She has her recursive argument borne along by a fluffy little story about a girl who loves a boy, meets another boy who wants her but is a bad \u2018un, and who puts the critical spoke in the wheel of their romance. All in a brilliant satire on the ridiculousness of the events, settings, and emotions of gothic novels in general. ",
