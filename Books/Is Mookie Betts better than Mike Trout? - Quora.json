            "answer_text": "Mookie Betts is from my hometown, Nashville, and he\u2019s rightly a legend here. I\u2019m a Mookie Betts fan, but he is not better than Mike Trout. No one has been as consistently great as Mike Trout since he appeared on the scene. As great as Mookie has been, he is a distant second to Mike Trout according to WAR, OPS, OPS+ and a variety of other measures. Granted, Betts is the better defender, but that doesn\u2019t make up for Trout\u2019s excellence in all other areas of the game. At the end of his age 27 season, Betts had 45.2 WAR, which is crazy good. But at the end of his age 27 season, Trout had 72.8 WAR, which is the best of all time. That is mind-boggling. An MVP season is 8 WAR. So Trout has been around 3.5 MVP seasons better than Betts, according to age 27 career WAR. Or look at it this way. Around 20,000 men have played major league baseball, and at every age he\u2019s reached so far, Mike Trout has been the best of them all. Mookie Betts has been great, but Trout has been going where only Angels dare to tread. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a very tough question these two players are elite players in the major leagues. Betts is outstanding outfielder who has above average speed, he covers a lot of ground in the outfield with a decent arm. Defensively I give Betts (4 gold gloves) the edge over Trout , even though Trout is also an outstanding outfielder with speed & an above average arm. Trout & Betts are both forces at the plate but I give edge to Trout for his power at the plate (7 silver slugger awards) , Trout is a rare combination of power & speed which is lethal for the opposing team, Betts on the other is a catalyst for Dodgers his outstanding play can set the tone for the whole team. If had to choose I would I would Trout but when speaking of these two players your speaking of two All-Stars. ",
