            "answer_text": "Old Testament Very few of the Old Testament books were written close to the period described. We have to look at linguistics, style and historical content to determine as well as possible when they were written. The Book of Genesis has been described as a compendium of ancient folklore, written between about 900 BCE and the sixth century BCE. The Books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy were written during much the same period, although they portray legendary events of the fourteenth century BCE. Scholars are forced to examine these, passage by passage to identify the addition of material by different authors from different backgrounds. The Deuteronomic History (Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 2 Kings) form a unity of style and content that points to a single author. The History is believed to have been written in the seventh century BCE, apart from numerous changes and additions to these books The Book of Chronicles covers more or less the same period but was written after the Babylonian Exile. The Book of Isaiah was actually written by three main authors, who wrote their respective contributions towards the end of their respective periods. The Books of Job, Ruth, Esther and Daniel were second-century-BCE novels based on earlier historical periods. There are anachronisms that help identify the dates they were compiled, as well as linguistic usages that provide a terminus post quem. The following table, abridged from Dating the Bible - Wikipedia is a both comprehensive and relatively accurate summary for the books of the Old Testament:  New Testament We know from synoptic analysis that Mark\u2019s Gospel was the first New Testament gospel to be written. Chapter 13, which includes a prophecy of the First Roman-Jewish War and the civil war that raged within the city even as the Romans besieged the walls, provides the main evidence that it was written approximately 70 CE. True, Jesus could have prophesied these events as stated, but the prophecy also includes the return of Jesus on clouds of glory within the lives of some to whom Jesus spoke. This did not happen and, since it is not acceptable that Jesus would prophesy something that did not happen, the War and associated events must already have been known to the author of Mark. There are ways of establishing that Matthew was probably written a little earlier than Luke, so Matthew can reasonably be dated in the 80s of the first century, with Luke in the 90s. Luke\u2019s Gospel probably also uses material from Josephus\u2019 Antiquities of the Jews, published in about 93 CE. Most New Testament scholars now say John\u2019s Gospel was loosely based on Luke\u2019s Gospel, placing it early in the second century. Acts of the Apostles was written shortly after Luke\u2019s Gospel and by the same author. This shows strong evidence of having used material from Josephus\u2019 Antiquities of the Jews, published in about 93 CE. Acts has long been dated to the very end of the first century, but there is now a developing consensus that it must have been written shortly after the turn of the century. Paul\u2019s thirteen epistles have traditionally been dated to the 50s and early 60s. However, most scholars believe that only seven of the Pauline epistles are genuine: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Philemon, Galatians, Philippians and 1 Thessalonians. The \u2018deutero-Pauline\u2019 epistles (2 Thessalonians, Ephesians and Colossians) were written later in the first century and the Pastoral epistles (1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus) can be dated by subject matter to the early second century. The Book of Hebrews, once erroneously attributed to Paul, must have been written about the same time as his epistles, because of the primitive Christology. The Second Epistle of Peter was the last book of the Bible to be written and was written pseudepigraphically late in the first half of the second century. 2 Peter 3:16 refers to \u201call\u201d Paul\u2019s epistles as if acknowledging that the list was closed, and referred to them as already being regarded as \u201cscripture\u201d. 2 Peter borrows themes from the Epistle of Jude, which self-identifies as being written in the second century. The First Epistle of Peter was also written pseudepigraphically, some time after the 70 CE destruction of the Jerusalem temple, as evidenced by the reference to \u201cBabylon\u201d in 1 Peter 5:13. That coded reference to Rome would have been meaningless before Rome destroyed the temple, just as Babylon had done centuries earlier. The Johannine epistles (1 John, 2 John, 3John) must have been written shortly after John\u2019s Gospel, which I mentioned above as written early in the second century. The Book of Revelation is an enigma, dated to about 96 CE because of the context of persecution, but modern historians are no longer sure that there was a period of persecution at that time. The year of 96 continues to be supported because there is no other evidence to a different year. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWe have a few basic ways of knowing when the individual books of the Bible were written: a combination of internal and external evidence and, particularly in the Old Testament, traditional accounts. Internal evidence might consist of the style of writing and mentions of people or places who can be more precisely dated. For example, while the book of Ruth is set during the time of the judges, scholars place the literary style as that of the time of the Israelite monarchy\u2014the Kings\u2014based on other writings more accurately dated to that time. The mention of David (Ruth 4:17, 22) also implies a date some time after David\u2019s reign. Another example: the book of Daniel uses a literary style and specific Persian and Greek words that place it around the time of Cyrus the Great (ca. 530 B.C.). Linguistic evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls gives us authentically dated examples of Hebrew and Aramaic writing from the second and third centuries B.C., when some claim Daniel was written, and it does not match that found in Daniel, which was written in the sixth century B.C. Other internal evidence might be the concerns the author is addressing. For example, the two books of Chronicles tell the history of the Jewish people and how they came under God\u2019s judgment in the form of the exile to Babylon. Traditionally, scholars have believed Ezra to be the author of these books, because the following two books, Ezra and Nehemiah (also written by Ezra), deal with the return from exile and the need to be obedient to God\u2019s law, and they are written in nearly the same literary style. The date of that return, which began under Cyrus the Great, can be correlated to historical records outside the Bible that place his reign from approximately 559 to 530 B.C. The dedication of the new temple in Jerusalem, in 516 B.C., is corroborated by the records of Darius I, and a second return of exiles was allowed under Artaxerxes I, whom we know ruled Babylon from 465 to 424 B.C. All these things help us to closely place the writings of those particular books of the Old Testament. Biblical scholars use similar cross-referencing to date other books of the Old Testament. In the New Testament, books are generally dated by the concerns being addressed, e.g., the growing Gnostic heresy, and how much they quote from other New Testament writings and a cross-referencing of events such as the collection for the needy in Jerusalem discussed in Romans and 1 and 2 Corinthians. We also have historical, extra-biblical accounts such as that by the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus to corroborate events described in the Bible. The Gospels are often dated by something that is not mentioned: Jesus predicted the fall of Jerusalem in Matthew 24:1-2, and we know from historians such as Josephus that the city fell in A.D. 70. It seems logical that if such a prominent prophecy had been fulfilled before the writing of the Gospels that it would have been mentioned, as is the fulfilled prophecy of Christ\u2019s resurrection as found in John 2:19, 22. It\u2019s important to note that even among scholars who believe the Bible to be God\u2019s inspired, inerrant Word there is some disagreement as to the exact dating of the biblical books. A good study Bible such as The NIV Study Bible or a commentary will lay out the various lines of evidence for the dating of the books\u201d -How do we know when the books of the Bible were written?
