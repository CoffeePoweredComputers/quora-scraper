            "answer_text": "Oh yeah. An FA who manages his own account often does have a fool for a client. I have encountered few FAs that won\u2019t concede, between friends, that their worst performing accounts are often their own. I suspect, again speaking from experience, that\u2019s it\u2019s some part a lack of accountability (\u201cit\u2019s not as though my spouse is going to fire me\u201d), some part a tendency toward overconfidence (e.g. \u201cthe rules don\u2019t apply to me\u201d) and some part the sense that more risk will be rewarded with commensurate return. As it turns out, letting another FA manage your account can be a gratifying and educational experience. It\u2019s always interesting to observe, at first hand, a different approach and different thinking. Better yet, you gain all sorts of unique insights into what the clients experience and how they react to advice in different circumstances. Good question. Hope this helps. ",
