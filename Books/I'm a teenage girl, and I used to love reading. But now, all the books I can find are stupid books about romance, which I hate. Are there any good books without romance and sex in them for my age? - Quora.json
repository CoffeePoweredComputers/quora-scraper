It\u2019s a Sci-fi/Fantasy Action)13\u201314: Unwind series by Neal Shustermann15-17: Mistborn Series by Brandon Sanderson (Again Romance, but it\u2019s not a Romance book. It\u2019s a Fantasy Thriller/Action)13-17: Time Riders by Alexander Scarrow. (Romance is only really hinted at. It\u2019s a Sci-fi timetravel Action)18\u201319: The Name Of The Wind by Patric Rothfuss. (There is some romance and some themes and scenes for\u2026 ahem\u2026 older teens\u2026 but nothing too graphic. Take care of yourself, Don\u2019t be like Kvothe. It is mostly a Thriller/Fantasy) Other books and Authors include: Eoin Colfer (Airman and Artemis Fowl are my favourites)The Ranger\u2019s Apprentice series by John Flanagan (Romantic subplots, but mainly Historical Fantasy)Halo by Zizou Corder (Yes, there\u2019s a bit of romance, but the main caracter mainly ignores that)Andy McDermont,Anne Mcaffrey,Roald Dahl (you\u2019re never too old for Dahl)the Harry Potter series, all the Terry Pratchet books (I mean ALL of them\u2026), CS Lewis (Chronicles of Narnia and The Screwtape Letters come to mind.), any JRR Tolkein (LOTR Is a MUST!)My wife also suggests Furies of Calderon by Jim Butcher\u2026Also, the Marx Brothers have some great screenplays/radioplays if you\u2019re into scripts and such. There are far too many books for me to go through and list them all\u2026 And, hey, If you wanna read any of my stuff, just find me on Wattpad ;) SashaLI wrote my own comedy Eulogy, a Fanfiction of the Avatar TV series, and a bunch of shorts. I really should get around to uploading my longer pieces of work there too\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, let\u2019s think outside the box for a minute. Usually, \u201cteenage girl\u201d=\u201dreader of romance\u201d. You are not usual. GOOD! So, what can you read that is appropriate for your age that does not include romance and sex? There are many genres in fiction, and more in non-fiction. Let\u2019s start with the non-fiction: Code Girls, Liza Mundy. Women cryptographers in World War II. An excellent read, it will give you more appreciation of how far women have come in the United States since 1940. Hidden Figures, the story of black female mathemeticians in NASA who helped calculate orbits. Again, an excellent read. A Beautiful Mind, Sylvia Nasar, a biography of John Nash, Nobel Prize winner, excellent mathemetician, mental patient. Seabiscuit, Laura Hillenbrand, about a horse. Trust me, you\u2019ll like it. The Perfect Storm, Sebastian Junger, about a huge storm in 1991. By the way, all of these books, except Code Girls, have been made into movies. A little fiction: The Maltese Falcon, Dashiell Hammet. Watch the Bogart movie, too! Devil with a Blue Dress, Walter Mosley. Excellent detective fiction set in Los Angeles. Mosley is a black guy from LA, and his hero, Ezekiel \u201cEasy\u201d Rawlins, is\u2026a black guy from LA. Excellent movie with Denzel Washington, too. Lord of the Rings. I know, it\u2019s a boy\u2019s book, right? Uh, no; it is a BOOK. You are at the age when you should be transitioning from \u201cgirl\u2019s book/boy\u2019s book\u201d to just \u201cbook\u201d. It is long, but it is an excellent read. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Robert Heinlein. He won the Hugo for it. Harry Potter. Not a lot of romance in it; no sex. Even if you have seen the movies multiple times, try Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone; you should like it. These should do to start you off. There is a whole wide wonderful world of books out there; more are published in one day than you can read in a lifetime. Some tips on how to find a new book: Go to the library and look in the Classics section, if it has one. Read one that interests you. Go to the library and choose a random aisle. See what interests you and read it. Go to the library and check out the new books. See what interests you and read it. Many libraries have used book stores attached. Go in, browse, and buy one book. They are usually only a $1 or 2. Enjoy! ",
