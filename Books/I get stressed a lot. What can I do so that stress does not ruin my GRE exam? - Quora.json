            "answer_text": "I've been there! The GREs can be stressful, but you can (and will) get through them. Some suggestions: \u2022 Don't think of the GRE as The Exam that determines your future. It's just one factor of many, and the worst case is that you take it again.\u2022 Don't think of the GRE as an exam that reflects your intellect or value as a human being. No exam can do that!\u2022 Think of it as a task that you want to do well at, not a hurdle.\u2022 Breathe deeply every time you feel anxiety coming on. Remind yourself that it's just a checkbox you have to tick off in order to move on with your dream of entering grad school. If your score isn't great, you'll study again and retake it. Nothing can stop you from achieving your dreams, least of all this exam. \u2022 Try Amy Cuddy's advice on power poses (Google her TED talk on body language).\u2022 Do lots of practice exams that are as close to the format of the real exam as possible. On test day, you won't have any surprises, and everything will look familiar. Plus, you'll know you practiced a lot, and that's the best prep you can get!\u2022 Get enough quality sleep. At least for me, anxiety is magnified when I am running on little sleep.\u2022 Exercise. Burns off those jitters. Releases positive endorphins. Improves your sleep. Enough said. \u2022 If you anxiety is severe, get professional advice. There is no shame in needing anti-anxiety medication, or talking with a counselor or therapist. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You may want to learn and practise a simple relaxation  sequence, with slow but deep diaphragmatic breathing routines. Preferably,  every morning upon getting up and out of bed, and every night before  you hit the sack, but more importantly,  prior to embarking on  any of your tests/exams. While you are in it, imagine a tranquil scene, and hold it as long as needed. Then, imagine yourself walking into the exam hall and finishing your paper with complete ease and inner peace, and then leaving the hall with a grin on your face. The scientific rational behind it is that the mind cannot tell the difference between a reel (or imagined) experience from a real world experience. In the world of competitive sports, like golfing and tennis, this phenomenon is called, \"mental rehearsal\". ",
