            "answer_text": "Magic is, well, magical. Fantastical. You can do whatever you want with it. You have already decided not to be bound by physical laws, so go nuts. Be as imaginative as you like. But I think there are three important things you need to make a successful magic system: consistency, cost and balance. Consistency: Pretty obvious really. If you are not consistent in the rules of your system, the reader will definitely notice and feel cheated. Cost: Every magical act should have some kind of cost on the person performing it. It could be a physical drain, of energy, lifespan, blood, etc, or it could be a mental one, turning to the dark side, losing sanity, becoming more and more possessed by a demon, etc.  Balance: This relates to cost. Summoning a 40ft dragon should not be equivalent to unlocking a locked door. Deflecting an arrow should not be equivalent to reversing death. You need to design a balanced hierarchy of spells, both good and bad. And any magical minions your heroes face should have roughly equivalent level of spells at their disposal. But the 'bosses', they should be far more powerful, forcing your heroes to use intelligence, guile, loyalty and other positive things to overcome what looks like certain failure at the climax. A lot of people use a kind of rock-paper-scissors approach to balance. They use some version of the old elemental systems of water, earth, air, fire, blah, blah and blah. Then they work out a balanced graph of which elements defeat which others. This can work out well, you just need to be original with it. The problem with midichlorians, is that it tried to use scientific jargon and ideas to explain something inherently fantastical. That process takes away the awe and mystery of the force. If it is scientific, why don't they have scientific labs experimenting on those microscopic creatures, working out how they can make midichlorian-imbued gloves or sceptres or weapons for non-jedi troops to use. It just makes it more boring technobabble, instead of awesome mysterious magic. It's up to you how deep you want to explain your magic system. I think a good level would be half an explanation. Show it in action a lot and explain it a bit, but keep it slightly vague. People like the feeling of the mysterious, but it will also feel like a solid aspect of the world you create. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it's generally best to NOT make any attempt at explaining how the magic works. The magic-system in Star Wars was a lot more convincing, and less grating when they left it unexplained, it's only when they came up with a bullshit scientific explanation with midi-chlorians that it all started to look like transparent bullshit. Since magic by definition isn't explainable in a rational manner, attempts to do so by necessity backfire. Write down, and flesh out the system for the magic for yourself, but don't attempt to give the reader a full explanation for the entire system. Instead, just write what they do, and if they can't do something, then say what the limit is, but not why. As a rough parallell, if I write a story with electricity in it, I may write that some character turns on the light. I'll do that without explaining how switches work, or that there's hidden copper-wires in the wall that channels invisible energy to a lightbulb by way of pushing electrons around; all of that stuff is irrelevant to the story were all that matters is that the character did something, and the room is now lit. If my character runs into a limitation; it'd be the same deal: He'd fail to boil the swimming-pool with electricity, because the fuse would blow if he tries to pull more than 16 amps. I'd NOT want to explain what a fuse is, or that ohms law explains why the fuse blows when it does and so on; I'd instead simply leave it at that. The same thing applies to magic.  I snap my fingers and illuminate the room. I don't explain, or attempt to explain how that works. I'm unable to teleport to a location I haven't seen. No I'm not gonna explain why. I can make stuff levitate, but my magic ain't strong enough to lift more than about my body-weight, and it takes effort so I can't hold it up forever. Why ? Not gonna tell you. Any explanation would be bullshit anyway. Just make sure to make it consistent. I'll accept that lifting heavy objects is difficult without making an issue of it. But if some newbie magician in the next chapter lifts a mountain, I'm gonna go HiWaitaMinuteDidn'tYouSayThisWasHard? ",

The Harry Potter Universe was quite good at this.  Kids could not disparate. Food could be moved magically, but someone had to make it. etc.So rules help it to feel real and not simply a boundless resource.  There might be magic, but there remain constraints. In the Richard K Morgan's, Land Fit For Heroes trilogy, we were looking the far future. But it felt like a medavel time.  The magic and the gods were the leftovers from previous high tech times.  But these were not explained in those terms to the reader. We saw them as magical things through the eyes of the characters. I'd suggest doing a full back-story on your magic. Explain to yourself how it works, and what it can and cannot do.   Then use that within the story, but don't ever explicitly reveal that to the reader. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, magic can be what you want it to be. It depends on the tone of your story. If it is happy and fun (like Harry Potter) then magic is just matter of learning the right spells and focus of mind. If it is neutral, the mentioned Tolkien comes to mind, where magic is performed by chanelling own life force. If it is based in nature, then either the way Vampie Diaries did it, or Full Metal Alchemist. Basically, whatever you do, it has a cost. The more powerful the spell, the more it costs+ there is always a way to counter it. Be it killing the one who cast the spell, or some counterspell. My favourite is the way G.R.R. Martin handeled it in Song of Ice and Fire. Magic there is powerful, potent, yet utterly unexplained. All you know is, that it is hard, mostly it channels from a diety, and as it was put: \"Magic is a sword without a hilt. There is no safe way to grasp it.\"  If you want it to look real, it has to be real. Use altered laws of physics, for example. Every action has an oposite reaction. Friction causes heat... you know, the basics, and aply it to the magic. ",

What makes it mysterious and mystical is the unknown factor. - Explaining a magic system means basically defining its limitations: how magic has to be used, in which conditions, when it doesn't work, what are the requirements, how it can backfire, etc.   ",

I once wrote a short story in which magic isn't exactly magic, but more of an exploitation of a \"universe glitch\" by geometric figures so specifically designed that they alter reality itself by their existence. The magic's effects could be on a huge scale. Like, someone created a constellation with it. But their power was limited due to the fact that more complex and widespread effects required larger figures. Said constellation builder was actually a city, with buildings arranged to form one of the figures. Something the size of your palm could bring a cat into existence. This kind of geometry magic makes no sense in real life, but it works fine and is consistent in universe. That's all you really need. ",

            "answer_text": "I recommend making sure you have a fully developed explanation for how the system works written down separately, then only bringing in the parts of the explanation that are absolutely necessary for telling the story. You need the complete explanation so that you stick to the rules and keep your system consistent, as inconsistency makes it much harder for your audience to stay immersed in your world. But you don't want to bog your audience down with exposition, so for the most part you can keep the big explanation to yourself or only introduce it in supplemental materials. ",

            "answer_text": "The best magic systems that I have come across (as a reader of fantasy) are those that do not need to be explained but are just a part of the world that the author has created. In those books the magic is so woven into the world, the characters, the story that you don't actually stop and think how, why, where but rather except the natural laws that govern the world the book is based in. Some good examples (if you want to take a look) of this are, All of Mercedes Lackey's novels and series L.E Modesitss's Corean Chronicles  David Edding's The Tamuli and Elenium series Rodger Zalazny's the Chronicles of Amber series Robert Asprin's MythAdventures series Terry Brook's Landover, Shannara, John Ross and Voyage series Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea series ",
