            "answer_text": "No. learning architecture requires hands-on experience and interaction with others, students and professors, to get an internal, \u201cthree-dimensional\u201d experience and skills in the field. some tools, like autocad, you can learn without this environment, but design is a complex and multi-layered skill and talent that can only be developed within a sequential studio environment. Even history, drawing, and other courses bring depth to designing for both building and urban environment cannot be learned online. I would suggest that even technical classes like mechanical and structural topics are best learned within a peer context where you share questions and processes. ",
