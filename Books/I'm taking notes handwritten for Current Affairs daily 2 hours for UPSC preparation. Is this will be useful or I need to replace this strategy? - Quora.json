            "answer_text": "Point wise answer Handwritten notes are good for UPSC. Two hours utilised properly will fetch u good results.COMPETITIVE MAGAZINES CANNOT TACKLE CURRENT EVENTS SECTION OF UPSC. So newspapers notes will help u in long run.Psychologically speaking writing clear lots of doubts and misconceptions. But sometimes it is good to put smart work into it.Smart work sometimes information are too lengthy to jot down all points. Then try to cut information and paste in ur note book. This is minor point but often Civil Services student are overwhelmed by plethora of info and mindlessly try to copy all points.Because writing takes time ,it will help u to linger on facts & opinions. My personal experience is that subconsciously writing help u dissect various facets of the particular issue.Going by last few year Pre & Mains papers current questions required deep understanding and perceptions. There are floods of issues each days. And each day u need effort to update urself.U r going in right direction. Good luck!",

            "answer_text": "Note making is very important. I personally make my notes on Quip/OneNote/Evernote for current affairs\u2026as I think that online notes are easier to catalogue and after, say, 3\u20134 months when your notes are significant, it is easier for you to search for something when your notes are online. Another thing that I like about online notes is the fact that most apps sync on multiple devices\u2026so, I can make my notes on my PC and revise them while I am out travelling on my phone/iPad. There are also less chances of your data getting lost, that's also a plus. ",
