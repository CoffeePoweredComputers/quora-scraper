            "answer_text": "Depends on what you\u2019re looking for out of the experience. A good book, as I\u2019m sure many people on Quora can confirm, is a fantastic way of transporting oneself to different worlds to experience different things, alongside casts of marvellous characters, to witness the unimaginable. A book can also give you an insight into the deepest of emotions, tell jarring tales of those things that can speak to the heart of any human being. A book is essentially capable of telling any story, anywhere, at anytime, as it uses the reader\u2019s own imagination to fill in the blanks, and a well-written book can continue to inspire for centuries. Videogames are, at least for the moment, unfortunately unable to provide the same sense of limitlessness that a book can. Videogames have budgets, production values, engines, artists, graphics and any number of other limitations that prevent them from being the boundless storytellers that pen and paper can be. However, videogames provide something (at least in my opinion) just as awesome in exchange, and that is tangibility. Videogames allow the player to be someone else, in a very tangible sense. The player pushes a stick, or a button, and the character on the screen moves in tandem. In that way, videogames provide a direct connection to the events within, and a sense of enjoyment unmatched by other forms of entertainment by providing the most direct and accessible form of escapism. So, videogames with good stories can make you live those stories, maybe more than any book ever could, but it also depends on the quality of that story. I think, with all the centuries of a head start that books have on videogames, it\u2019ll be a while before they can really compare directly. If you want to be told a story, any story, and be engaged by it, pick up a good book. If you want to participate in that story, pick up a videogame. ",

            "answer_text": "Some videogames with good stories are better than some books (there are so many varieties of each, and they have so many different intended audiences that it\u2019s easy to pick two examples of each that would work to either prove or disprove that statement). If they tell a similar story, the book, if written by a competent author, will have a superior story every time. That\u2019s why so many books make poor movies and video games. Converting from one form of media to another while retaining similar quality, however you define that (quality and/or retention thereof), is almost always very difficult. A possible exception is a well-written text adventure game (a genre also known as IF, or interactive fiction), something once done well by Infocom. The choose-your-own-adventure style books based on Infocom titles were not very good in comparison, but the intended audience was probably different as well. ",
