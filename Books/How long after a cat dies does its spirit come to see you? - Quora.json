            "answer_text": "Between 2014 and 2015 my first cat December was a special needs senior. I rescued him off the street in the middle of winter and only had him for about half a year (passed in June 2015) but it didnt take long for us to have an iron strong bond. I believe we are part of the same soul family, or our souls are connected in some way. A few months after he passed (that winter/between September and November) I was volunteering at the animal shelter near me when I found a little black kitten in one of the lobby kennels (the shelter would do this for kittens mostly I think) This cat, named Lutely, had the same look of wisdom in his eyes as December (he always seemed like an old soul kind of, and this was also present in the kitten.) He (Lutely) had the same fur length, texture, softness, body type... I felt like I resonated with him. I looked at his estimated birthday and it wasn't long after December had passed away. I swear the only difference between these two cats, except for age and health, was the fur color, December being solid orange (not even a tabby.) I took him out of the kennel and he purred and loved on me the entire time. Had no interest in going elsewhere besides next to me. Unfortunately one of my friends (that I often look to for guidance) said that I had my time with him (with the belief that this was December reincarnated) and that it was someone else's turn to experience life with him. She used my dog (Romeo, who passed away earlier this year) as an example saying that his previous owners probably miss him too and would love to have another life with him. However, I was the one who was fortunate to spend this life with him instead of them. This was enough to persuade me to not adopt Lutely, against my soul's cries, which I deeply regret even now. Even if I did pursue Lutely's adoption I dont know if I wouldve been able to have him. He was already pending adoption, though I was ready to beg them (the possible adopters), as in down on the floor pleading, to let me have him instead. This was the first and only time I felt or saw December (that I remember.) I always wonder how he (Lutely, but also December's soul) is doing and often times think of him. I wonder what my life would be like with him instead of my current cats. I rescued another kitten, Harlow, about a month after he passed (in July,) and originally my \u201ccousin\" (\u201c\u201d for non related reasons) was supposed to take her but she stopped responding to me. So, I essentially said f you and kept her. I ended up feeling deep resentment towards Harlow though, as I felt I wasn't ready for another cat. Currently though, we have been bonded for a few years now and we often cuddle, but our connection is no where near what I felt with December. I ended up getting her a partner, Lyra, at a different shelter a month after (August.) This was another reason why I didnt adopt Lutely. Sadly I am not bonded with her at all. Shes just kind of\u2026there. As bad as this may sound, I sometimes wonder what my life would be like had I waited to adopt an additional cat (Lyra) and tried to pursue adopting, or even found sooner, Lutely. On a different note, I have not felt Romeo's spirit yet, I dont think. He passed away in early January and, at the time of writing, it is mid August. So, in short, it took about half a year for me to see December again. ",

            "answer_text": "This can vary, but from experience, usually their spirit comes soon, a few months after they pass, to see you. Then you may not be able to see them with your eyes, but may feel their weight next to your leg while you are in bed, or in some cases hear them meow, or yes, you may see them. The phenomena varies, but is always catlike, and like the cat would do in life. Sometimes, their prescence is all you feel or experience. But you will know it is them when it happens. Sometimes their smell is all you experience, out of nowhere. It is dogs too, who pass then visit their loved ones. My immediate family used to have this dog, named Honey. Honey came down with hepatitis, and had to be put down. Horrible. But she had this particular smell all the time. After she died, I smelled it out of the blue, in the same room she used to be with me in when I was on the computer. ",
