            "answer_text": "Let me giv you a real life example mine! In the 11th when everyone was neglecting studies I fell in love with physics chemistry and biology . I learnt and understood the topics on vectors and Newton s laws. In fact I can remember the basic formulae of newtons laws of motion even now or derive them from definition. Flash forward 2 years to my second semester mechanics paper (at that time semester 2 Mumbai university was pure dynamics and nothing else )  I had a blank out , remembered none of the formulae related to simple harmonic motion , circular motion or anything for that matter .  I was sure for the first 15 mins I'd flunk . What did I do ? Derived all formulae from first principles (newtons laws) and solved the numericals. It was tough buried was able to do enough to pass. Understanding the concepts is necessary cause it never leaves you, never and comes in handy when you need it the most. ",
