            "answer_text": "Science loves its ignorance and stupidity\u2026 That\u2019s the motive to chase after the unknown and uncork the genie in the bottle. Many think that\u2019s a stupid waste of time to pursue what you cannot known of certainty beyond one\u2019s senses to known\u2026 I am glad they feel they are not smart enough to stop looking for the Golden Ticket. Smart people do not fall in love with their ignorance has been wholly erased or fully experienced. That\u2019s not IQ driven\u2026 just commonsense. Stephen Hawking was immensely stupid to be smart to focused study of areas of astrophysics and given his state of health due to Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, he had to do computations and rely on memory doing much in his head\u2026 or slowly dictating it over long-periods of time. Smart only applies to one being simply curious and become highly informed, acquired thought skills to analyze ideas and apply critical thinking skills, listening skills and practiced such, to articulate asserted ideas and interacted with others to get feed back, develop a talent to appraise things, find insight clues, and willingness to adjust findings over the course of a long and focused life. He had no problem reading or hearing the bells of truth and voices. It makes anyone smart at what they do that they know being smart to be able to question it may or may not be the sole truth and nothing but the truth\u2026 Knowledge is just a smart tool in your tool box to craft ideas and convey them (Like ART and creative thinking) to provoke and explore perceptions from given perspectives. His curiosity seemed mainly on the nature of Black Holes, thus, his level of expertise in that area gains influence to provoke a direction other astrophysicists and mathematicians worked on hard to validate the veracity of Hawking\u2019s squawking. He was not the only one doing the same primary research with the same host of information\u2026 \u201cSmart\u201d - Sure, Hawking smart to raise the bar on expertise of knowledge acquired. AND\u2026 focused. IQ? Matters not\u2026 hard work and strong commitment\u2026 a little ego pleasing all in the pot. So, too, was Albert Eisenstein not the only one exploring ideas that his equation E=MC (squared) came to represent\u2026 his hypothesis of Relativity and then Special Relativity about large body masses and the nature of gravity\u2026 and so on\u2026 were revised when wrong\u2026 and since have sustained the test of time under many challenges the math sicks to the present remain valid, but not the whole truth of the universe necessarily... That made him smart not to assume that. He spent the rest of his life trying to figure out a working Unified Theory of Quantum Physics along with others to mate small particle mass and energy to the big stuff in the universe we know, and the idea of space time as a force of consequence of...hum? He did not have an answer of certainty for Black Holes nor the Dark Matter of space\u2026 the empty or seemingly empty space as to it has or is matter of a a kind, too\u2026 but that that makes him smart to wonder\u2026 and frustrated by challenged to explore.

            "answer_text": "Question: How smart was Stephen Hawking? Firstly, what is your measure of \u201csmart\u201d? If your answer is IQ, then that doesn\u2019t help answer the question as professor Hawking never took an IQ test and actually regarded the concept of an IQ test stupid. The best we can do in terms of guessing how \u201csmart\u201d Stephen Hawking is, is to look at his achievements. Hawking\u2019s work related mainly to extending Einstein\u2019s theories to cosmological phenomena, specifically, black holes. The idea that black holes radiate their energy away over time seems intuitive to most people with knowledge in physics, but only after Hawking showed that it is the case. Developing a new theory that seems intuitive once someone understands it, is truly a mark of genius. Without a doubt, Hawking was significantly smarter than the average person (but probably not Newton smart). ",
