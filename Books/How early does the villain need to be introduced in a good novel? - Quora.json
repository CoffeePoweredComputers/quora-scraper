            "answer_text": "Introduced as a character? Or introduced as the villain? In a mystery novel, as a general rule, you do not know they are the villain until the end. That\u2019s kind of the point of a mystery novel. However, they should be introduced early on so that they are considered a suspect. In a fantasy/sci-fi novel, they can really be introduced at any time. They don\u2019t have to come on the stage right away\u2014they can be mentioned early on, but not show up until the end of the book or until another book in the series, there can be a plot twist, etc. Again, you kind of want to know who they are for a good part of the book, or at least what they are doing, but if there are multiple conflicts and/or multiple villains you can play around with this. In a realistic novel, you don\u2019t really need a villain. You may have an unlikable character but they are not necessarily a true villain, just another normal person causing a conflict like most of us do at one point or another. If you have that sort of antagonist, they are probably a big part of the story and should be introduced early on. You should also make clear that they are the antagonist or you risk slipping into reality tv territory, because real life does not have that many plot twists. In a horror novel, your antagonist is not necessarily a character, per se. You may have a plot device or classic conflict like Setting As Character, some form of Nightmare Fuel that doesn\u2019t have consciousness/agency, Human vs Nature, or Human vs Themself going on. Really, there are no rules for this one. Horror antagonists tend to pervade the whole story, and there are quite often multiple antagonists. Also, horror antagonists generally don\u2019t have much character development\u2014they\u2019re supposed to be something irrationally scary, not a reflection of real life, unless the story is about the horrors of something in real life in some allegorical or metaphorical way, in which case they are still often some stylized, idea-taken-to-its-extreme-conclusion manifestation of our evils. All that to say, you should probably know they are the villain to some extent to make the book legitimately scary, but you can have a few twists as more threats are presented and/or reality changes and/or the protagonists make different choices and question their reality and/or everything just gets subsequently more weird. I\u2019m not sure about romance or Western novels because those are not really my wheelhouse. Nonfiction doesn\u2019t have archetypes, at least not in the literary sense. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no law or rule about this. You have to keep the story going so you introduce everyone at the right time to keep that true. Consider The Hobbit (book, not movie). There are several villains in there and they are introduced about when they are needed. The only real exception is that Smaug is discussed early without being introduced. We don\u2019t even know there are such things as trolls, then we encounter them. We don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a king of the goblins, until we meet him. Gollum, same thing. Wargs, Spiders, the Wood Elves (who are antagonistic unlike the elves of Rivendell). If you want my own rule of thumb; I like a big boss villain who gets introduced just a few chapters in at the latest. I\u2019m more inclined to write a story that sets the main conflict going early. But keep in mind that Tolkien\u2019s conflict had nothing to do with the villains. The real conflict was Bilbo with himself, trying to find his own courage. Everything else was there to make that happen. In that sense, the villain was introduced in the first scene with Gandalf where Bilbo is afraid of all things uncommon, but most of all of being thought to be rude. The villain is often the personification of the conflict. You should probably consider inviting him into an early scene if that\u2019s the case. ",
