            "answer_text": "I see other answers telling you to go to their websites, or telling you where to upload your work, but I don\u2019t see any actually answering the question. That\u2019s a problem. To create an eBook for free, you need three things: LibreOffice (\tFree Office Suite), the Writer2ePub extension (Writer2ePub), and KindleGen (KindleGen). This whole process is pretty simple (with the exception of number 3, which is the hardest part), and assumes that you\u2019ve already got full cover art (back, spine, and front). Just follow these steps: Install LibreOffice.Install the extension.Write your manuscript in LibreOffice (do NOT import a Word file!).Format your manuscript so it looks like a book.Export your ePub using the Writer2ePub tool.Export your PDF.Create your Amazon-Format ePub using KindleGen.Upload your ePub file to Smashwords Direct (Smashwords Direct).Upload your Amazon-format file to Kindle Direct Publishing (Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing).Now, here\u2019s the third step that you didn\u2019t ask about, but that is very important to your overall sales: You upload a physical book to Createspace (Self Publishing and Free Distribution for Books, CD, DVD)The Holy Trinity of Indie Publishing is: Kindle Direct Publishing, Smashwords Direct, and Createspace. Kindle Direct Publishing gets your work up on Amazon - the 3-billion pound gorilla in the room when it comes to eBook sales.Smashwords Direct - not to be confused with Smashwords - gets your ebook up and available to virtually every other major eBook eRetailer.Createspace is where you create your physical book. The reason you want a physical book is twofold: (1) it allows you to set higher pricing on your eBook, and (2) it gets your book made available to libraries, academic institutions, physical brick-and-mortar retailers, and other eRetailers you cannot reach through KDP or Smashwords Direct.If you have questions, please feel free to ask me.
