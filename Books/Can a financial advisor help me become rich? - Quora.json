            "answer_text": "Yes, but with many caveats. If you know little about investing, you could be making costly mistakes like picking the wrong stocks, picking the wrong funds, or investing in high risk assets like crypto or commodities that blow up. A financial advisor might help you set up a diversified portfolio that will grow in value overtime. The caveats are: Financial advisors do not work for free. They may charge you an asset under management fee like 1% of your asset each year. Considering that stocks generally return 5% real pre-tax and 3% real after-tax, the AUM fee could cost you a third to a fifth of your return each year. The effect of the fee compound over time and could cost you up to HALF of your net worth over time. Not good at all when you are the one taking all the risk while the financial advisor spends only a minute to rebalance your portfolio each year, if that.The portfolio financial advisors tend to recommend are very conservative, often with more bonds that one needs. They do that to avoid losing, because many investors cannot stomach a 50% drop in their portfolio during a bear market. This \u201cconservatism\u201d could prevent you from getting rich, as fixed income assets do not even keep up with inflation after taxes.Financial advisors tend to recommend style funds that have higher expenses. For example, instead of a simple 2-security portfolio of a total stock market fund and a total bond market fund, they may recommend a 10-security portfolio of a large cap value fund, a large cap growth fund, a mid cap value fund, a mid cap growth fund, a small cap value fund, a small cap growth fund, an REIT fund, a TIPs fund, an investment grade corp bond fund, and a junk bond fund. The parts add up to the whole, but cost a lot more individually. Financial advisors do this because they want to add complexity to make you think you need them to manage your portfolio.Worse yet, some financial advisors are non-fiduciaries and may steer you toward high expense actively managed mutual funds, annuities, and life insurance so they earn a fatter commission for themselves. Over time, not only will it not make you rich, but may even send you to the poor house.How to combat this? Education. We live in the information age and can easily teach ourselves basic financial management for free through tons of books on personal finance in the public library and online. Read up.Just invest in a low cost broad stock market index fund. For example, VTI charges only 0.03% expense ratio with no capital distributions and tracks the entire US stock market. 80% of money managers underperform the market. Buying and holding an index fund allows you to capture the entire market return less a very small fee without having to do anything or know anything about investing at all.If you must hire a financial advisor, hire a fee-only fiduciary financial advisor on a hourly basis only (never pay an AUM fee!!!) to help you set up a financial plan. If applicable, check with your company HR to see they already have paid-for financial advisors that you could talk to for free.",

            "answer_text": "A financial advisor might be able to help you better diversify your investments and improve your pick of investments, but they will not likely make you rich. The only person that can make you rich is generally you. Having a good financial sense and saving money helps you become rich.Not living above your own financial means will help you become rich.Not buying the stuff you don\u2019t need helps you become rich.Learning in-demand skills helps you become rich.There are a lot of things that can help you become rich, but a financial advisor is not typically one of them. Financial advisors can provide value to the right person, but the value is most often not in the investment returns they provide. The truth is most advisors and even mutual fund managers themselves do not outperform a market index over 80% of the time in a 15 year period. A financial advisor can bring value with experience on better investment diversification and even advice on better tax-advantaged investments. For most middle-income people without tax problems or much money to invest, it can often be better to just educate yourself and invest conservatively if it is for the long term. Often you will do just as good or better than an advisor once you add in their fees and commissions. There is nothing wrong with using a financial advisor, but they are not generally going to make you wealthy. A good advisor might help you depending on your situation, but a bad advisor might even make you less wealthy. The financial advisor industry is like any other one. There are good professional people in the industry and terrible people that look to only make a profit. The trick is finding the right one. Here is a previous article I wrote Does Everyone Need a Financial Advisor? That goes more into depth on why not everyone needs a financial advisor. If you are going to hire a financial professional. Do it for the right reasons and not to become rich. They won\u2019t make you rich, but they might help with a path to get you there. ",
