            "answer_text": "RS Agrawal books (Quant, DI, Verbal and Non verbal reasoning) are good for practice and to begin your MBA CET. But if you are aiming for one of the top colleges then it may not be enough. What has been seen in the past and particularly in the past couple of years, the difficulty level of CET has been varying a lot. So it is important to practice from varied sources. Apart from RS Agarwal practice mocks from different classes. Each class has its own style of preparing CET paper. Though they conform to the standard CET paper there is still a variation. This helps to give ample practice of different type of questions and also helps to build strategy for different circumstances. Even if you are able to solve from two sources will suffice.Practice from the various banking exam notes and papers. CET paper to some extent are similar to banking exams and hence they form a good source for practice.Reading regularly, improving on calculations and a little vocabulary are other aspects you need to prepare.Patrick D'souza (CAT100%ile, XAT Rk 1, CET Rk 1) Conducts classes for CAT/XAT/CET Website: Quoin Academy Facebook Group for CET Prep : MBA CET Facebook Group ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. For making a good foundation, RS Agarwal books are the best ones you can refer to. But these books can seem lengthy to few especially when you don\u2019t have enough months to prepare. You need to go through many more things to prepare for MBA CET. Few of them are mentioned below: Sectional mocks Solve at least 7-10 sectional mocks of each section. It will help you in tracking your performance and focusing on accuracy. Study Material You can refer to study material of any coaching classes. You can also go through various hand-outs available online. Point here is to go through as many questions as possible, preferably of different type. Mocks Appear for at least 15-20 full length mock. It will help you get an idea of how to divide the time between the sessions, how to build strategies to maximize your score, etc. Analysis of the mocks is very important here. Understand your mistakes, work upon it and ensure that you don\u2019t repeat them. Strategies preparation videos You can go through few videos to know more about various strategies which can help you to either increase your speed or improve your accuracy. Such videos are available online or on the websites on various coaching classes. Workshops Attend workshops organised by various classes to increase your score. They guide you right from preparation of study plan to mock analysis methods. All the best! ",

Other all topics in it are completely outdated and not useful for CET nay longer due to the increase in difficulty of CET since 2016. Its machine input output, arrangement questions are very easy and no longer asked. It is useful for Bank Clerk level preparation only and not for CET. I have not used it for Quant's and Verbal books so I won't comment on it. But the LR book of it is definitely no longer useful considering the increase in difficulty of CET. ",
