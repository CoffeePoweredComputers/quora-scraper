            "answer_text": "Two months? And have to study from scratch? Really? Its too tough but not impossible. First of all a bit off the track, if you have to prepare for the neet in two months that means you have passed 11th class. If you're a dropper then you have passed your 12th too. If you are a fresher then its 27th Feb. Which means your boards are soon going to start and you've already taken preboards. So how can you say that you have to do from scratch? This things needs to be changed firstly. First thing for cracking national level entrance is you have to have faith in yourself. Then you can move ahead. Now I would tell you what you can do- Read NCERT. Very very very well. As it is your hope. And you can solve maximum questions by doing it.Take mock tests. Finish syllabus as soon as possible and start taking full length mocks.Join a crash course only if you feel there's a need.Solve questions. I would recommend NCERT at your fingertips to do. As it has limited yet sufficient questions per chapter. But yes! Don't buy it if you have any other standard book. As you will end up doing nothing. If you haven't bought any book yet then buy those, but if you have then finish those first.Don't read from heavy reference books till you complete NCERT. As you need to know evey chapter which won't be possible if you do it from heavy reference books. Do those books when you're done with NCERT two times and you need to be really fast yet receptive for this..And most important- believe in yourself. Don't procrastinate. Domt overrate or underrate the exam or any chapter. Be rationale, sleep enough and study with calm mind. Don't forget to take regular breaks, as they boosts you up. And one more thing- don't try to change your study habits - means don't try to wake up early if you're a night owl or don't try to stay awake if you're a morning person. Yes later has some advantages but If you try to change it at this point, you would end up sleeping more which will frustrate you and deviate you from your goal.So \u2026 all the best for your exam.

            "answer_text": "Hello, I\u2019m not saying that it is impossible but it is, tough. There are many reasons why it\u2019s being so, tough. Firstly, there are lakhs of aspirants appearing in the NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) every year. The level of competition is going higher and higher. The other thing is the competitors, whom you are going to compete with, you can\u2019t expect that they haven\u2019t given a good amount of time to their studies. So, my dear friend you need to work really hard as there is a very short amount of time you are left with. It is possible, to crack NEET in 2 months. It will be more easy for you if you have studied really well in class 11th and 12th. Because the syllabus of NEET is totally related to these two class. To prepare for NEET within these last 2 months you need to read the NCERT textbook thoroughly again and again. You can mark the important lines with a pencil or highlighter because you won\u2019t get time for revision. Divide 2 months among all the chapters you need to work on. This way you can easily classify and analyze your study. You can also get to know about the weak and strong areas of the syllabus. Make a strict timetable for these 2 months and rigidly follow it. You can also join some crash courses from a coaching institute. These classes will help you to organize your studies in a very short amount. You need to be confident and positive enough before as well as after the exam. This will maintain your mental stress and keep you away from the negativity. You can also practice through past year\u2019s questions and test series. The more you practice the, more chances of success you\u2019ll get. So, practice as much as you can. You must follow a healthy diet and practice a good amount of sleep. As you are left with a very short time period for your preparations but still you need to take a proper diet and 7-8 hours sleep per night. Never compromise with these. Because a properly balanced diet will help to keep you healthy and the good amount of sleep will relax and refresh your mind for the next thing you have to prepare. You should also practice meditation. Because meditation improves concentration and reduces the stress level. You don\u2019t need to spend hours on it. You can do it within the breaks of 10-15 minutes between your studies. My kind advice would be for you that if you are not really prepared well for NEET-2017 then don\u2019t go for this stunt because now every chance is very precious as caps are introduced in NEET exams. Take your time and join a good coaching academy. Hope this answer will satisfy your query. All the best for your preparations... ",
