            "answer_text": "Do you want to pay for financial services or not? If you want to pay for financial advices, just stop by any big bank or investment house (e.g Fidelity, Edward Jones) and ask for a rep. They will probably ask for how much money you have, what are your immediate and long term goals, etc and give you advice. The first session is usual \u201cfree\u201d. The second session they will \u201c\u201crecommend\u201d product to buy and if you decide to buy, some will have fees and some will not. Then each year both of you will get together and see if there is any change need to be made. Just that simple. If you want to do it yourself and learn, read the books by Dave Ramsey and Sue Orman and you should get plenty of ideas on how to save at each milestones. If you want to make money, then read Wall Street Journal and watch MSNBC or Financial News Network. If you want to invest, go to several mutual funds and see how they performed in the present and in the past. Lastly, maximize tax deferred (e.g 401k and IRA) account and see if there is other income streams (e.g real estate) you will like to participate in. Making and saving money take times. Often decades.

            "answer_text": "If you want to retain your money for at least 6 months- and probably longer: DON\u2019T DO ANYTHING. I have done planning for over 45 years and taught and wrote courses for real estate, securities, financial planning, insurance\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. You have now encountered an economic mess that is unparalleled in recent history. Nobody can tell you what to do right now with the virus running rampant over the world and unquestionably in the U.S.. I am not going into a lot of jargon here but suffice to say that RISK in the market is rarely ever taught to licensees. Risk of Loss is how much you can lose. They want you to buy a product that can reduce the losses sustained in stocks. Losses in 2000 was 49% and in 2008 was 57%. If you put in $1,000 and lose 50%, it could take over 10 years investing at 7% just to get even. To use the colloquial commentary- that sucks. Just save you money for the time being. ",
