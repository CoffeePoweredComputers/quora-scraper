While it should be respected, still i would suggest you to make notes. We tend to forget the topics which we merely read, it remains in memory for a longer time if we write it down. The more senses you use while doing a task, the more it will have an imprint in your memory. Even after you have a telegraphic memory, writing it down will simply enhance it. Moreover making concise notes helps you during the revision. You dont have to go through the unnecessary bulky books and newspaper and hunt for what you have read. You will always have your guide book with you. So make notes, in your own style, whatever way is more comfortable with you. Write it, decorate it, read it, love it. It will become your stepping stone for this preparation. All the best for your future. Happy learning !! ",

People makes Notes Bcz they can't remember all the matter, they write important points and Some makes notes bcz it's easy to revise before exam.. Everyone have a reason and U should have such reason to make notes.. Otherwise no need.. If u have Potential to remember what u read then No need of making notes..
