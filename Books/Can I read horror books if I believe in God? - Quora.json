            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe there is a God, but that\u2019s not what you asked. I\u2019m going to assume you are referring to the God of the Bible, that you think He is real, that you believe a Christian should live in such a way as to please and serve Him, and are wondering if it harms your development as a Christian if you read horror books. I assume you want to read them because some of them are considered very entertaining by many and can provide a unique kind of thrill. I don\u2019t really read horror much any more, because there is too much else to read, but when I was 16 and was being raised in the Assemblies of God, I found a book at the library called The Collected Ghost Stories of M.R. James, checked it out, brought it home, and read most of it before my dog chewed half of it up and then threw up on my bedroom rug. M.R. James was an Anglican Christian who simply wrote these stories as a diversion, but they really struck a chord with me, and they made my blood run cold. Now the book was certainly not obscene or anything, but had my parents realized what was in it, I suspect they would have told me to take it back to the library, had our dog not gotten to it first. First, I\u2019ll give you the answer that I think a traditional Christian would give, and then my personal answer. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll really like either of them. If I were your pastor or other Christian counselor, I think I would say something like the following: \u201cLet\u2019s consider what a horror book is. It is a book that dramatizes the operation of supernatural evil in the world. What is the source of that? Satan. And who is Satan? The enemy of our Heavenly Father, the one who tempted Eve to cause mankind to fall, the one who tempted Jesus in the wilderness, and the author of every human misery that has ever been. It was because of him that Jesus hung on the cross. It is because of him that murders and rapes take place, that people lose their lives to addiction, and every other awful heartbreak you can imagine. He is the enemy of mankind and desperately hopes that you, I, and everyone else will share an eternity of misery and horror with him in hell. He knows he is going there and hopes to take us with him. \u201cA horror book is basically a sort of advertisement of what happens because of the operation of evil in the world. That evil is real. Don\u2019t forget that the Apostle Peter said that the devil is walking about \u2018like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,\u2019 and Paul said that we are not really fighting against flesh and blood but with \u2018spiritual wickedness in high places,\u2019 and when he said that, he meant Satan and his servants. \u201cSo if a Christian asks me if she can read a horror book, I have to ask why she would want to. Sure, a Christian can read a horror book or anything else she wants and not cease to be a Christian just because of that, but isn\u2019t it kind of like saying \u2018Can I smoke if I want to be fit? Just one or two cigarettes a day\u2014I promise.\u2019 \u201cAs we mature, it is true that we may have a serious reason to study things that are bad in themselves, just as scientists study loathsome diseases in the hopes of curing them. But a scientist does not read a book about someone dying of a horrible disease for entertainment. As to spiritual evil, there is actually a book called Hostage to the Devil, by a Catholic priest, Fr. Malachi Martin, who claims to present case studies of actual exorcisms. If there is any truth to what he says in the book, it may be taken as a serious study but again, it is not entertainment. \u201cSo if you ask me if you can read a horror book, you can read anything that your parents don\u2019t stop you from reading. If you are wondering if God will \u2018cancel your membership\u2019 just because you read a horror book, He won\u2019t. But if you are wondering if you can read horror books for enjoyment while professing to serve God, my reply that it is like wondering if you can qualify for the cross country team if you spend 5 hours a day watching the tube. Christianity is a calling and a way of life, not just a label.\u201d So that\u2019s what I think your pastor would say. Here is what I personally believe: There is no God, and Jesus is deceased. Satan is made up, just like Lord Voldemort, so all those issues are moot. Having said that, it still makes a difference what we fill our minds with, and why. And it makes a difference depending on what age we are when we read certain things. Again, I simply haven\u2019t read much in the horror genre for years. I know there are authors in that line who are thought to be very skillful, such as H.P. Lovecraft. And of course, it\u2019s part of every American high school student\u2019s education, at some point, to be exposed to such masterpieces by Edgar Allan Poe as \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum,\u201d \u201cThe Telltale Heart,\u201d \u201cThe Fall of the House of Usher,\u201d \u201cThe Strange Case of Monsieur Voldemar,\u201d etc. I remember reading a Poe story in my teens in which the first person narrator describes killing a cat in cold blood, and it is meant to illustrate grave mental illness. As to spiritual evil, Hawthorne\u2019s classic \u201cYoung Goodman Brown\u201d is an incisive examination of the operation of good and evil in the human heart and the possible damage that can be done to the mind if it is too fixated on certain matters. And although I\u2019m hardly on a crusade to get people to read M.R. James, if someone college age or older asked me if I knew anything good in the horror genre, I would recommend his stories without hesitation. But if you are a high school student, as I assume you are, and want to read horror for entertainment, I would hesitate to recommend it. I suppose it would depend on what the book contained. If it were simply a hair-raising tale about a night in a haunted house, to provide a good scare, that\u2019s one thing. But if it seemed to present sadistic malice, physical or psychological, as objects of entertainment, I would hesitate. At different stages of our development, things can get into our heads and influence our perceptions more than we know. Some things should be left until we are older and have more of a sense of balance. ",
