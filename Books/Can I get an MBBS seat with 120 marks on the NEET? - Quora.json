            "answer_text": "May be or May be not . Because for the General Catagory students the NEET cut off percentile is 50th percentile. This is not percentage this is percentile .And 50 percentile means u have to rank in between 50 percent candidates of total candidates .For exam if total 12 lakh students wrote the NEET exam than u have to rank in between 6 lakh for qualifying . And the qualifying lowest marks for general Catagory is 134. And for ST ,SC and OBC it is 40th percentile .That means qualifying marks is 119\u2013107 for these reserved Catagory . So if u r from General Category u can not get a seat for MBBS with 120 marks . But if you are from ST,SC than u may can get a seat for M.B.B.S with 120 marks . I think u got your answer . But If U have any quaries then Massage me . ",
