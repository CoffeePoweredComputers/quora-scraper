            "answer_text": "You need to have a strong hold over concepts\u2026 As we can't grasp all what the book intends to convey\u2026 So we must have a good teacher to learn from apart from self studying. If you don't have the luxury of a good teacher\u2026See Physics wallah sir\u2019s video lectures on YouTube. They are the best for physics and Chemistry. Try downloading them and watch them on Airplane mode at 1.5 or 2x speed. Prepare your own notes\u2026Revise them\u2026 Solve his assignments available on his website. Also Contact Any Neet senior or see Mentor videos on YouTube. Study HC verma side by side and practice his O1 and O2 questions. Study OP Tandon for organic chemistry. All the best ",

            "answer_text": "For Neet, it is bit difficult for most students to solve good level numericals as there is no involvement of mathematics subject. Only NCERT will not be enough try out some books like Cengage publications, or OP Tandon. At this time one should go through very precise numerical related books i.e. book must have majority as MCQ along with their solution. Just have a glance at solved numericals and see to it that how is the approach/method for solving. Same question may have different approaches/methods to solve but in beginning please go through the one which you think is easy, later on you can go with the difficult one too. After going through theory try to solve easy numericals first then go through difficult ones. As many as you will solve numericals your concepts will be stronger and more difficult numericals you will be able to solve. ",
