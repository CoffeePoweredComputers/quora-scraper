            "answer_text": "Not just the Book of Revelation but other places in the bible as well: Bible signs of the \u201clast days\u201d fulfilled in our time: Mathew 24:7 New King James Bible 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. WAR: For the first time in the history of the world we have had World Wars embroiling all the worlds major and even minor nations. Since the beginning of WWI there has NOT been even one day where a conflict has not been happening somewhere. There are around 40 such armed conflicts occurring in the world today. FAMINE: One in every 6 people on earth go to bed hungry every night. It is stated that somewhere in the area of 9,000,000 people die of starvation annually. As reported by UNESCO. PESTILENCE, DISEASE: The 1918 Flu pandemic killed over 50,000,000 persons world wide. We have new diseases appearing AIDS, West Nile Fever, Ebola, Lyme Disease, etc. Old diseases such as Malaria, Tuberculosis. Gonorrhea and Syphilis have re-arisen and are becoming resistant to current treatment. More and more common bacterial infections are becoming resistant to antibiotics every year. EARTHQUAKES: *There have been more major earthquakes in the past several decades then ever recorded previously. Volcanoes such as Mt St Helen\u2019s activating after centuries of inactivity. All part of the earthquake phenomenon. *US Geological Survey. Proliferation of false religion: Mathew 24:23-25: \u201cThen if anyone says to you, \u2018Look, here is the Christ!\u2019 or \u2018There!\u2019 do not believe it. 24 For false Christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. There are over 3,800 different \u201cChristian\u201d denominations today all stating that they have the true religion. All crying \u201chere is the Christ\u201d. Most will ridicule and/or ignore the warnings in scripture: 2 Peter 3:4-7 NKJB 3 knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, 4 and saying, \u201cWhere is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.\u201d Luke 17:26-30 NKJB 26 And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man: 27 They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 28 Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; 29 but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. 30 Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed. Very few are aware of this and taking appropriate action. The world goes on with its politics, wars, oppression of people, etc. and does not realize or care that the world is at the threshold of the Great Tribulation as stated by Jesus and recorded in scripture, ignoring the warnings just as the people did in Noah\u2019s day. When God told Noah that HE was going to bring the world to an end, he stated that from the time HE declared it to Noah it would be 120 years until in happened. This gave Noah time to build the ark and gather all the animals while warning the world that the end was coming. God never takes action against man without providing a thorough warning and a way to safety. Jesus also stated a major sign that would be apparent to all the world, one that has NOT occurred until our day: Mathew 24:14 NIV 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. Since 1922 the Jehovah's Witness organization has been proclaiming the gospel (good news) of the kingdom and warning that the end of this way of life is coming. Currently there are over 8,700,000 witnesses worldwide doing this work. There has not been the remotest place on the earth in any of over 300 languages that have not been told of the Gospel and what it means for them. Like Noah (what is that crazy old fool doing building a boat in the middle of dry land and telling everyone God was going to make it rain and flood the earth, it never rains). So too they have been ridiculed as religious fanatics, a cult, a sect, heretics, false prophets, etc. They have been banned and persecuted by governments (including the USA) and rejected by main line churches who tell their members that the \u201clast days\u201d are long in the future, if ever, and not to worry about such things, above all do not listen to those \u201ccultist\u201d Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. I have quoted and/or cited the applicable scriptures to support this comment. It is submitted for consideration and to stimulate interest in the bible. I do not expect all to agree. Accordingly I will not engage in debate or disparage any such disagreement, personal opinions or beliefs. One is entitled to believe what one wishes.

            "answer_text": "Since 1914 ( First World War ) the prophesys that applied to the \" End days \" also known as \" the last days \" are being fulfilled with amazing accuracy If one reads the description of the last days writen by Mattew under inspiration by God's Holy Spirit in the book of Matttew 24: 3 - 22; 36 - 39 also 2 Tim chapter 3: 1 - 7. One can be sure that we are living in the last days of this system of things designed by Satan the Devil. One important fact to remember is that when Adam and Eve sinned, that did not made God change his purpose for his human creation and the Earth. Please see Isaiah 55:11,12, Daniel 2:44, Psalms 37: 10,11,29. God's purpose for his human creation was that they would live on a Paradise Earth, and live forever without the problems and suffering that affect most of mankind. After Adam sinned the Devil questioned the right of God to rule the Earth, and that no human on the Earth would remained faithful to God when facing death ( See Job 2: 1 - 10 ) True, there was not one human no mattered how good and loyal he was, that did not sinned. That is why God sent his only begotten son to be born as a human and destroy the works of the Devil, after the one thousand years reining from Heaven over the Earth, Jesus wii also destroyed the Devil, his Demons and every human who willfully and knowingly practiced what is bad in Gods eyes. There would be like if Adam and Eve never sinned and the Devil did not exist ( Please see Romans 5: 12 - 21, 1 John 3:8 ) ",

            "answer_text": "The Four Horsemen and History Have any of the seals of Revelation 6 been opened? When will the events prophesied in Revelation take place, \u201c? There is a clear statement in Revelation 1:1 that the events predicted to occur were \u201csoon to take place.\u201d Should we believe the direct words of Christ to John, or should we practice our most convoluted reasoning skills to reinterpret the verse to our own liking. Yes, one day is as a thousand years to God, 2 Peter 3. That was written to the distant future in context of the appearing of Christ at the end time and the patience of man. The message to John and the seven churches of Asia was written in the context of the times in which he lived and to him as a person. John was told these events would \u201ctake place in swiftness,\u201d genesthai en tachei. God understands context. He was speaking to John. The events revealed to John began in his own period in history. The Roman conquests of the next 300 years as well as those later during the Holy Roman Empire are perfectly fit for horseman one. In The wars and chaos as Rome was split up during its original decline perfectly fits with horseman two. This will resume again in the Holy Roman Empire throughout its history culminating with the siege of Napoleon in the 19th century. A failed attempt by Satan at raising up his antichrist ahead of schedule by Hitler in the 20th, sets the world scene in order for the gathering of Israel from the four corners of the earth, fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah 11:12. In addition, we do not forget the many hundreds of wars (ref. below), including the Crusades, throughout Europe during the dark ages that brought death, famine, and plague throughout these lands. Inflation due to these wars fit horseman three. Famine following this and plague perfectly fits horseman four, especially as the black plague ravages Europe and Asia for several centuries but not completely subsiding until the 19th century.   A number of expositors hold this position. (1) Elliott, Edward Bishop (1862), Horae Apocalypticae, Vol. I (5th ed.), London: Seely, Jackson and Halliday are early writers on the topic. The Wikipedia on the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse quotes him extensively. (2) Matthew Henry's commentary on Revelation 6:1-8 holds to a first century commencement of the first horsemen. (3) Beale believed the disasters represented by the opening of each seal are simultaneous throughout the church age, not sequential occurrences, for either the purification of believers or for the punishment of believers\" persecutors. [Note: Beale, pp370-72.] Revelation: A Shorter Commentary: G. K. Beale, David Campbell. I could go on. (4) Also note the interpretation of \u201cen tachei\u201d from Revelation 1:1 in the Expository Notes of Dr. Thomas Constable. He is totally in agreement with the interpretation \u201csoon take place\u201d as it\u2019s also interpreted in the NIV. Let\u2019s take a look at the first references to the four horsemen found in the Old Testament book of Zechariah.  Zechariah 1:8-11 During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses. I asked, \u201cWhat are these, my lord?\u201d The angel who was talking with me answered, \u201cI will show you what they are.\u201d Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, \u201cThey are the ones the Lord has sent to go throughout the earth.\u201d And they reported to the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, \u201cWe have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace. Zechariah 6:1-8 I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains\u2014mountains of bronze. The first chariot had red horses, the second black, the third white, and the fourth dappled\u2014all of them powerful. I asked the angel who was speaking to me, \u201cWhat are these, my lord?\u201d The angel answered me, \u201cThese are the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world. The one with the black horses is going toward the north country, the one with the white horses toward the west, and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.\u201d When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, \u201cGo throughout the earth!\u201d they went throughout the earth. Then he called to me, \u201cLook, those going toward the north country have given my Spirit rest in the land of the north.\u201d What we learn from these two passages is that the four horsemen of Revelation are not some recent addition to the heavenly host. Zechariah\u2019s vision comes in the late 6th century before Christ. We get the understanding from the first chapter of Zechariah that these colored horses with their riders have been patrolling the earth apparently as long as men have intermittently disrupted peace on the planet. Where is the dappled horse in chapter one? Could it be still out on patrol? Why, also, were there two red horses here? We will learn the answer in chapter six. They patrol in some instances in pairs. The explanation is that, in chapter six we find four pairs of colored horses at home ready for their next patrol. In this vision we learn that the black, red, white, and dappled horses can also be sent out as pairs pulling four chariots. These horsemen move in the four compass directions throughout the earth. The northbound horseman reports back peace, a place that the Lord\u2019s Spirit may take rest.   We then turn to Revelation chapter six and we learn of their most current mission. First, the Book of Daniel gives us context for the history of the planet. Daniel\u2019s fourth and final kingdom for the earth is the Roman Empire. It\u2019s influence over the earth will stretch more than two millennia. The conquest of Rome establishes the Pax Romana which endures for two centuries late into the second century. During the third century barbarian invasions, civil wars, and other weaknesses began to wear away at Roman stability. The final fall of Rome dated 486 A.D., begins a period of barbarian rule and their quests for legitimization by recognition from the remaining eastern Roman Empire located in Constantinople. The western portion of the empire will be resurrected as the Holy Roman Empire by Charlemagne three centuries later. This empire will last officially until the 19th century. Europe will undergo turmoil and exist as separate countries until the European Union attempts a secular unification at the end of the 20th century. The Union is now poised for strong leadership in the spirit of a resurrected Rome. This union will be ready and waiting for this leader of a world in peril during the coming end times. Daniel, like John, was given an unbroken sequence of events until the end time. John in like manner has a revelation of an unbroken sequence of events until the end time beginning with his own day. The mission of the four horsemen during the first four seals is a perfect fit for the events that have occurred over the last two millennia. Conquest, war, economic collapse, famine and plague have been the norm for this period. The sixth and seventh seal introduce cosmic disaster into the scenario. This will be the final opportunity for these four horsemen to finish setting the stage for end time events and the rise of the antichrist. ",

            "answer_text": "The end of days are mentioned at various times throughout the old and new testament Angels prophecy by the epochs and by the sociology and culture of large groups of people. The end of days are a reference the end of epochs. Daniel prophecied the end of the hellenistic epoch which some scholars argue lasted as an age til around 300 a.d. If you count hellene influence over Roman and Byzantine culture as an epoch hellenistic influence ended with the sack of Constantinople 1453 a.d. at the hands of Islam. That would mean that the king who rules by an authority not his own would be the prophet Muhammed. When the angels speak of beasts they are referring to the sociology of large groups of people and their culture. The end of days as prophecied by Jesus Christ is not a prediction of doomsday. It is the end of an epoch and the beginning of a new age. A second age of enlightenment. One of logic and reason founded on the word of God. I find it rather compelling that angels declared the epochs millenia before we had the hindsight to define their borders. And yes, it has begun. Let the name of God be blessed forever Wisdom and power belong to him It is he who changes the times and the epochs He removes kings and makes kings He gives wisdom and knowledge to men of understanding It is he who reveals the profound and hidden things He knows what is in the darkness The light dwells within him To You God of my fathers I give thanks and praise.

There are various interpretations, each one changes how the end times chronology is laid out. Every generation for two thousand years thought their generation could be the last one. And they all interpreted the events in their day in conjunction, seeing the great enemies of their day as the Antichrist, etc. And there is some legitimate truth to this as all of these are \u201ctypes\u201d of the Antichrist, leading up to the culmination of the final one. That being said, I do personally think we are NEAR the end times. We\u2019re not in the very last days yet. The Antichrist hasn\u2019t risen to power yet, nor has the third temple structure in Jerusalem begun to be rebuilt. The end is at least four years away or more. And could be much further away. ",

Right now the Democrats own almost all the sources of political power in the US. They control the schools and college faculties, the media, the federal bureaucracies responsible for our security, including many in the top ranks of our military and the governing bodies of most of our largest cities and states. They want the presidency. They expected it in 2016 and the people surprised them Undeterred, they tried to frame the President with Russian collusion charges that they bought and paid for. Then they created a media crisis that resulted in an impeachment charge by the Democratically controlled House based on a phone call with the Ukraine president that President Trump released to the public. So that flopped. ( Scott Lowden) At this time Obama is trying to over throw the current presidency buy the destruction of our economy and lead this country into a civil war. It is clear that the destruction of the economy is irrelevant to them. The white leftist tycoons cheering and funding supporters of these policies expect to participate in a socialist paradise for them and their businesses. We are now the lab mice in the destruction of the United States, the democrats who lost the election, have decided not to relinquish power of the presidency which is similar scenario to the destruction of Yugoslavia after the fall of communism. In 1989, the fall of the Berlin wall gave rise to freedom, those people living in Communist countries decided to live under the rule of by the people, and for the people. All countries of the eastern blocks of countries of communism relinquished power except Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia communist did not want to give up power. Since the climate in Europe was anti-communism, the needed a new strategy. Yugoslavia needed a new ideology to keep power in their hands. So the come up with a new name for the country, not just Social of Yugoslavia, but the National socialism of Yugoslavia. Sounds familiar. The playbook they would use is the one established in Nazi Germany. First you must install hatred amongst the people, in order to install genocidal levels of hatred into people. First you must define people of one country into groups, in other word define into how tribal groups thinks. This can be defined in different ways by dividing people by race religion and ethnicity. So, you can let your imagination go wild. Since Yugoslavia people were white and undistinguishable among themselves, the only card they could play was the religion card. Yugoslavia was a very mixed groups of religion. They had Orthodox Christian Serbs, Catholic Croats and Selvene and Muslin Bosnians. (In the U.S. it would be BLM) perfect starting position. In the next phase, you must start making social policies so terrible that will inevitably lead to the countless individual disadvantages. When the policies of such government become obvious, you must start claiming that the cause of those policies is the discrimination of one group towards another. And naturally you must start screaming that those inequalities must be corrected by favoring the \u201coppressed\u201d discriminated group over the \u201coppressor group\u201d Enter national quotas for hiring. Now change the name of national with race or women, one of the groups formed and well defined, and needless to say, all mainstream media is owned by government (Obama Administration controls the U.S. media: ABC News executive producer Ian CAMERON is married to SUSAN RICE, Obama's former National Security Adviser.CBS President DAVID RHODES is the brother of BEN RHODES, Obama's Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications.ABC News correspondent CLAIRE SHIPMAN is married to former Obama White House Press Secretary JAY CARNEY.ABC News and Univision reporter MATTHEW JAFFE is married to KATIE HOGAN, Obama's former Deputy Press Secretary .ABC President BEN SHERWOOD is the brother of Obama's former Special Adviser Elizabeth Sherwood.CNN President VIRGINIA MOSELEY is married to former Hillary Clinton's Deputy Secretary TOM NIDES .) and are in control and fueling the narrative about mutual discrimination of hatred relentlessly. The growing fear and feeling of insecurities destroyed relationships, marriages and friendships. As fear of discrimination hostility amongst group were growing, people started isolating them selves amongst there own group, because they did not feel safe anymore with the individual of the other groups. All of the sudden, staged and very well, organized mass protest started all over the country. Protest and killing of one group of another group. (In the U.S. the killing of George Floyd). At first those protest were peaceful, but soon enough rioting and burning started. Now that you have the attention of the public, you need a spark. What is a spark? A spark is a convenient event of murdering over one group by a hateful member of another and you usually need more that one of those. At this point, people were not completely divided. There were still reasonable people left. Those who believe we were one people under GOD and would not kill under any circumstances. The Believers went out protesting in piece and holding hands. But the hunger for the absolute power of socialism was stronger than our love fore each other. Shooting and attacked on protestor continued. On the Next phase, the tipping point of no return, by people erecting barricades at the entrance of there towns, neighborhoods, even on highways and roads. Barricades were guarded with armed civilians. Each and every attempt or the removal by law enforcement or deescalate the situation was in vein and they would be ambushed. Can you see the correlation between the civil war of Yugoslavia and what is happening, in our United States of America. The U.S. is at the tipping point of no return because under the table the Obama Administration has refused to relinquish the presidency. ",

When that happens we will be officially there. Don\u2019t think that it is not in the works, Isreal has been seeking such for a long time. I fear though that to get it might take another war where Israel beats the combine forces of the middle east. Hopefully, the USA would be on Israel\u2019s side, but that is debatable. ",
