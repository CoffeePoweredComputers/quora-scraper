            "answer_text": "I am no neurologist, but I think there may be a mistaken assumption by the OP. I realize that almost no adults have clear memories from age 5 or under, and that even ten year olds have almost no memories of 4 or younger, but that does not mean memories were not formed earlier. They were simply discarded because they had little relevance and because they were more abstract and because they had less \"hooks\" and re-use.  There is an incredible amount of \"wiring\" going on in the young, nearly identical to learning and memory of an adult, but at more than double or triple the pace than even a college student, but much more in the totally new types of experiences. New memories are handled differently, once they are no longer new, they are either moved from the right brain to the left brain, or perhaps more accurately, the left brain memories are retained and the right brain memories are no longer necessary. Each moment of experience could be said to contain hundreds of snapshot memories, each filed in a different RNA strand of a different neuron, some visual, some audio, some symbolic, some retaining emotion, most carrying a combination, and each one cross linked (indexed) to the other locations. Each night, our brain performs a \"pack, reindex and purge\" function that basically \"decides\" based on number of times used recently, whether to retain the connections to these snapshot memory moments. Over the years, we hold onto what we need, use, or value. I could probably derive the quadratic equation 50 years after learning it, but forget my previous boss's wife's name from three years ago. The 4 year old me had many things it remembered about a song or fairy tale heard the day, month, or year prior, but nothing ten years later. My infant period memories are more aptly, memories of memories, as I can recite what I told people over the years about an event when I was 4, I know the location and the who, and wanting to cry, yet I can't truly recall the weather, the smell and the color of the scenery. We each value, use, and save according to our own set of rules. I don't understand people who are directionally challenged, getting lost in their own town and unable to follow directions to get back home from an event, where I not only can visualize every turn along the route, but which direction we were facing at any moment. The joke is, when someone asks me when a song came out, I can give them them the month and year, but only after picturing where I was when I heard it, and it starts out, \"OK, I was facing West, on a street with trees, and the leaves were burning, and I know my bed at that time was North South, so I must have lived on Hayes, therefore it was October 1966. So, it is not that we did not make memories earlier in life, we simply have richer connections and more reasons to start saving more of the links as we age.  How we file memories is somewhat different for each of us, as different as a file cabinet that is alphabetized versus color coded versus arranged by account number. This why we will never read brains, they have 7 billion different languages. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe it begins at birth, but early memories are stored as visceral responses because a baby\u2019s brain is still developing and doesn\u2019t have the sensory experience or neural organization that later memories use for their coding. Here\u2018s what happened to me that makes me think so. A long time ago I went to a primal therapist because I\u2019d reached a block in personal growth and was unable to make further changes. The process can\u2019t be hastened, takes quite a lot of preliminary group work and it\u2019s not for the faint-hearted. Build up internal anxiety, body tension and discomfort till it becomes unbearable. Head aching, body aching, gut churning, deep and unfathomable fear. Sit in front of a therapist on a large cushion in safe surroundings where anything that might cause harm is well out of reach. Breathe deeply, go into a deep trance and let your body do whatever it wants to. Tension and shaking in arms and shoulders. Good, intensify it. Arm muscles hurting. Do more of it. Hands outstretched, fingers tense and suddenly little numb pads on the tips of 9 out of 10. Never mind what it means, make it stronger. More shaking with a very weak infantile scream, crying, gagging and nasal slobbering - plenty of towels handy. Suddenly a pad on the 10th finger. The pads merged together. My hands were holding something firm and elastic and much bigger than they were. My mouth began strong sucking movements and my throat gagged violently. Something pushed me roughly away into a place with a really foul smell. Darkness and oblivion. Half hour recovery in deep sleep. How did I feel? Better than I\u2019d ever felt in my life before! Something else that was a total surprise. My nose was clear for the first time in months and my chronic hay fever was gone! That was 40 years ago and it never came back. It had been severe most of my early life, none of the ENT specialists had made much difference and I\u2019d been told it was \u201cpsychosomatic\u201d so there was nothing they could do. It took a primal therapist who didn\u2019t know much about medicine to fix it, and reliving that early memory seems to have broken the neural links that were the cause. I went back to my doctor afterwards and told him the story. He didn\u2019t know what to make of it, all his training told him I was talking rubbish but he had no good explanation for my very real cure! Just said \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re better.\u201d I\u2019ve known other clients of the same therapist that had similar experiences with hyperactive gut and eczema problems - two more areas of psychosomatic illness that fit the pattern. What to make of that memory? It took me a while to make the connection that those were baby hands clutching at a woman\u2019s breast and suckling. Couldn\u2019t be - I\u2019d always known I was bottle-fed. Nagging suspicion something very unusual was going on, and next time I saw my aging mum I cautiously asked her why I wasn\u2019t breast-fed. Her answer: \u201cOh, they tried to make me but I had no milk!\u201d The final piece of the puzzle, and I never told her why I\u2019d asked. That was a newborn\u2019s memory from Day One! And that\u2019s what caused my hay fever! Oh, and that session also removed my other blocks to ongoing growth. Whether they came from the same early experience or not I don\u2019t know. Art Janov gave Primal Therapy a bad reputation because he accepted wealthy clients who didn\u2019t want to go through all the necessary preparation, offering him big money but demanding an instant fix. As a result he had many failures, got thoroughly discredited and his therapy was abandoned. Except for a few people like my therapist who understood its correct context in therapy and got safe and dependable results. I believe it is worth revisiting more objectively. And please treat your babies very gently. Those Day One memories might have far more influence on their lives than you ever suspected. ",

            "answer_text": "My earliest memories are from when I was very young - the first time I waddled my way across the floor in a small room with a green carpet - I can still feel the bulk of the nappies I was wearing. I walked late so must have been about 14 months. Next I remember standing in my cot, aged about 18 months, rattling the bars and crying \u2018Sopping wet, sopping wet\u2019. I was wearing a cream flannelette nightie and there was a candle nightlight in the corner of the room. Then I can see my mother walking down the step into the room - and the clarity goes. Aged three, my mother was driving me home in my grandparents\u2019 black Austin 7 - we lived with them at the time - and I was standing in the back, holding on to the seats in front. We drove over a hill and there was a wonderful sunset and my mother commented on it and then said: \u2018You must remember that sunset, it\u2019s so beautiful\u2019. I can, even now, see that sunset over the golf course ahead, can feel the leather on the seats of the car - and the smell. But our memories work differently - I\u2019m lucky in that mine is mostly through visualization, like being in a film sequence so, if a specific memory is triggered, I will see myself taking part. While my mother did not remember the sequence with me walking for the first time, she agreed where I did it and that her friend, Clare, was also there. When asked, she said I often stood up rattling the side of the cot and crying \u2018Sopping wet\u2019 when I needed a nappy change at night. But she had forgotten the sunset story until I asked her about it and then she verified that I was right. So, at least in essence, my memory of these events is as accurate as they could be when seen from the perspective of a small child. ",

            "answer_text": "Babies start to exhibit the ability to remember in the first few weeks after being born. They remember the sound of a voice the touch of a mother. As they grow older they learn to walk, potty training, speak, and communicate. Somethings like walking and talking and potty training we remember all our lives. Things that happen to us like a violent incident, a fabulous birthday party we can remember longer. As we get older and the memories get older we forget things. Sometimes we remember, remembering something but forget the \u201csomething\u201d its self. I have memories from when I was four. Research says that we start to have lasting memories at the age of 3 1/2 years. I\u2019ve taken my memories out and thought of them even written in a journal of them over the years. I don\u2019t think I remember those things anymore. I think I remember, when I thought about what happened. These memories, most of them are not average memories. Though my earliest memory was of playing with a toy. It was a toy that if you put it on the coffee table and tilted the table it would walk down the table. I remember it was a Disney figure, Pluto. I\u2019ve heard of some people being able to remember their birth. Then there are people like Marilu Henner who has highly superior autobiographical memory - Hyperthymesia - Wikipedia total recall memory. I don\u2019t know how far back in her life she can remember but she\u2019s reputed to be able to remember everything that\u2019s happened to her in her life. ",

            "answer_text": "Dr. i'm not quite sure what you mean by retaining. But over the time I have been digging into my own pathology, I have come to the believe that memories exist in different sorts. Among them manifest memories one can recall and unconscious memories or latent memories one cannot (actively) recall, or not recall at all. There is probably also the kind of memory that has been retained in our brain for sometime and maybe is of the second kind, but maybe has been forgotten. I am not sure about the question if we are actually able to really forget things, or that information we once have stored just becomes latent or dormant. Or, what forgotten actually means. This opinion is based on the general assumption op psychologists that some personality disorders are basically formed in early childhood, before the age most people assume the memory actually becomes active and stuff can be stored until eternity.  However a personality disorder is there to stay too if not treated and will usually only grow over time. So the child will have to have memories of some kind that at least have to be stuck in the brain long enough to be reinforced before they fade. This led me to the conclusion that memories already are being formed and the brain is already being trained to memorize things at a very early age, maybe even prenatally. They might not be retained very long at start yet, but they are definitely there already. ",

            "answer_text": "Excellent answers. I do have experience with asking a few hundred college students about their first memories. I taught a language development course and I wanted to demonstrate that our memory pattern changes as we move from visual/auditory memory to language memory. It is hard to tag your earliest memories to a specific time but answers typically ranged from 3 to 6 yrs. Most had memories from Kg. or 1st grade. My earliest memory was at 1 year-5 mos. I had no idea how old I was until I saw a movie of the event. I had turned my head from my aunt\u2019s shoulder to a window where I saw Santa looking in. The movie was a bunch of relatives trying to calm a screaming child. I may have earlier memories but have no way to date them. Someone close to me had no memories before about 8, but she lived in an abusive home. She went through therapy to recall some memories she had repressed and it took some time before she could accept the memories and move on from them. I found the response that gave the age of 7 interesting. Our brains go through a transformation between the years of 5 to 8 in which billions of neurons pre-wired for language skills are re-sourced for other activities (that is the major reason second-language instruction or immersion should begin early). The bottom line is that language generates meaning and meaning generates memories. Once we begin understanding our life based on language we create a lattice on which we hang our memories and connect them to other thoughts and ideas. ",

Around age 7 \u201cchildhood amnesia\u201d kicks in and they begin dumping huge patches of experiences that they haven\u2019t otherwise found critical to their day to day life. Up until that point, they are sponging up gigantic (unfathomably large for you and I) amounts of information and will be able to recall the tiniest details that you and I would find inconsequential, because they don't yet have any sense of what was important, and what was not. But around 7 all that information has coalesced into a general framework about how the world works and everything else becomes less important so the brain forgets it and starts collecting new information based on the framework that was formed.

There is motor, reward, sensory (visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactility, etc. ), emotional, traumatic, semantic, episodic, autobiographical, etc memory. Which is it? Which type of memory is stored and when is it stored for it\u2019s ease in retrievability? Motor? When it\u2019s not reflexive and deliberate, three to six months. Sensory? Likely from birth. Which type of sensory? Likely tactility at birth. Visual at three months. Reward? Immediately at birth. Semantic? Likely two or three years of age. Episodic? Likely around two years of age. Autobiographical? Around three to four years of age when infantile amnesia lifts. So when you ask about when memory begins, it might help to specify the type of memory that which is desired. Not all memory is the same. ",

However, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have memories back to very, very young. My earliest memory, I learned as a adult, was from when I was just under two. It was a really frightening experience with my father and, due to the strength of the emotion attached, I still remember feeling afraid, what I was thinking, and what, specifically, was scaring me. One of my kids has told me she remembers sitting in a high chair while I fed her, seeing something on the wall that scared her. From her description of what the room looked like and the fact that she was in a high chair rather than a booster seat, I know she was less than two. ",

You begin to visualize it , almost as if you take a photo of it as your mum relates it yo you and then you may expand on it. Visualizing you as a baby walking with that little bear in the old house you once lived. Is that really a true memory you had, or can it be a fragment of a memory and the rest created by a photo of you and your teddy you have, and the story relayed to you by family members? It can be complicated, so if i was to answer this question in more of a broad stroke; i would say someone's earliest memory , and memory being defined as a recollection from the past, the place in the mind where we store info is varies from person to person. I don't doubt someone can have a memory even BEFORE the age of two, but i question how much that memory is from stories told by other family members, photos shown etc. But , i imagine, not being a neuroscientist, that the earliest memory may very well be as young as 2 years of age .

It wouldn't surprise me if the same thing doesn't happen as the child moves from concrete to formal operations (solid abstract abilities) although the child is able to remember older memories better due to that same abstract reasoning providing experience.

On that day we all raised a flag of India on our houses. I was at my maternal uncle's place and remember they raising it on a long bamboo staff. When I came home I saw a flag on my house put on top of the house with small stick. I think there were some older memories about toys but they can not be dated. My daughter named Uma Damle remembers the U on her 2nd birthday cake. That's all she remembers about it because it was first function with guests in her memory. ",

My mother was in bed with a baby next to her in a crib. I was 5, and really annoyed at having to give mum a box of chocolates that I was carrying. My dads first memory was of him trying to stand up in his cot , holding the bars tight. He remembered the way it was decorated . I think it really varies, depending on the person. I remembered a major event, but dad could recall mundane things about being very small. ",
