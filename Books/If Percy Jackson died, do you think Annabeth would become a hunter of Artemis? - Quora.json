            "answer_text": "No. She\u2019d probably want to stay with her family and friends at Camp Half-Blood, especially after Percy dies. She\u2019d probably want to spend a lot of time at the spots where she and Percy would spend time together, like the beach and possibly the Poseidon cabin. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much for her in the Hunters of Artemis, besides Thalia. That\u2019s pretty much it. ",

For another, Annabeth would first need comfort from her friends and family, but would most likely later recover. It might take a while, but however strong her bond with Percy was, she would realize that she can\u2019t spend the rest of her life mourning someone who can\u2019t come back. (yes, I realize she could get him from the Underworld, but I don\u2019t think either of them would want that). I don\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever fall in love again, but she might. Annabeth has a good head and a strong heart, and I think she\u2019d learn to live through the pain and stay in the mortal world until it was her turn to die. That ended up being somewhat morbid. ",
