            "answer_text": "As a long time fan of the show I can tell you that South Park has mocked pretty much everyone over the course of their very long run with no regard for political preference. However I admit some of the more controversial episodes were those that offended the political left. Though this should not come as much of a surprise since the political left is more \u201coffended\u201d by social satire just in general than the right is. Some of the more controversial issues that jump to mind were the episode 201 which targeted Mohammad/Islam. This was by far the biggest shit storm in the history of the show. The episode was pulled entirely from streaming by Comedy Central and was censored on broadcast when the network received threats from various radical islamic organizations in the US and abroad.   The scientology episode ended up being controversial as the man who voiced Chef on the show was an active scientologist and ended up leaving the show entirely over the episode. Though he later claimed otherwise. Most of the rest of the controversy the show has generated has been garden variety identity politics issues. So accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. You know, the usual. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the shows creators, do not appear to have been deterred in the least by any of these incidents. They have consistently shown that nobody is off limits from criticism and mockery, which I feel is one of the show\u2019s core strengths. ",

One that I keep in mind was in an episode about climate change. All was good and fun \u201cLiberal\u201d and \u201cGreenbashing\u201d with all the people saying silly alarmist stuff about global warming. Somebody said \u201cBut the scientists say it\u2019s real\u201d, then a kid appears and says \u201cMy dad is a scientist and he doesn\u2019t says that\u201d. The strange thing is that it wasn\u2019t said in a funny or ironic mood, but just so, out of the air and context. A very WTF moment. What\u2019s true is that a good bunch of the SP audience is the type of people who use to hang around shitholes like 4Chan, places where alt-right and stuff like this Kekistan crap abound. So, I don\u2019t think they are directly pro-trumpers but they certainly pay tribute to the philosophy behind a good bunch of his followers. ",

Heck, in a very recent interview, Parker and Stone wrote that they hated both liberals and conservatives, with Stone famously commenting \"I hate conservatives but I really fucking hate liberals\"; in 2006, Parker commented in an interview that they were aware of the concept of the South Park Republican and they both felt that they were \"just pretty middle-ground guys\". Trey Parker even called the far left and the far right the exact same person. They vocally expressed hatred of both the Republican and Democratic parties. So are they Trump supporters? I don't think so. ",
