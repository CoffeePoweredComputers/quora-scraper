            "answer_text": "Yes. But think of it as more of an anthology of short stories than a single, concise narrative. It was written by different authors from different cultures over a course of a thousand years. It was edited through a series of councils between 300\u2013500AD that removed stories and elements that were contrary to their agenda. It has been translated and rewritten, often based on individual philosophies into just about every language on the face of the Earth. Not only is The Bible a book, it is the #1 World-wide Best-Seller. It is the most influential work in the history of the world, and has led to some of the worst, horrific wars and crimes against humanity over the last 2000 years.

            "answer_text": "The Bible is often referred to as a single book but it is actually a collection of many books and not necessarily in chronological order. It is divided in two halves, the Old Testament (God\u2019s dealings with the Ancient Jews) and the New Testament (The Life and teachings of Jesus Christ and his apostles). There are other books some consider to be scripture as well that are called the Apocrypha. They are not generally included when one says \u201cThe Bible\u201d but some argue they should be. ",
