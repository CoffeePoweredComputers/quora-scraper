Perhaps you have an aunt that takes grammar seriously and has free time.Social Media - post to your accounts to see who could help. Costs nothing and you never know.Swap Services -Do you know anyone that would be qualified to edit your book? Even if not, there are job boards (even places like Goodreads) where you could always offer to swap services with a potential editorUniversity Students - have a university near you? College kids are often hard up for cash and an English major (or more advanced) might love to earn a bit of extra moneyFreelance sites - a number of freelance sites exist like Guru and even Fiverr - just make sure to vet the person well. Sometimes the lowest bid isn\u2019t the best. Again Goodreads community is another great place tooGood luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Depends how you define \u201caffordable\u201d. A good editor is not going to come cheap. You\u2019re looking at hundreds - if not thousands - of pounds to get a decent result. Given the time they can be expected to spend on your book, it\u2019s a bargain. To find an editor is as simple as it comes - just type in \u201cfreelance editors\u201d in your browser and then start clicking through the pages \u2026. To get a good one I suggest you search for one who specialises in your genre, and then ask what other work they\u2019ve already done. If they give you references, don't be afraid to take them up. And make sure you actually get an editor and not just a proof reader. The latter are valuable, but they\u2019re not going to comment on your work and help you improve it. ",

A lot of the Author Facebook groups will have a periodical post where people with services can post they are available. Check these. Book editors will advertise where they can, but you need to look for them, because the options are limited. So they will be wherever Authors are. ",
