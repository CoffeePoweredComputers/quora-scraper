            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Give your friends books, preferably with meaningful things inscribed on the inside. Tell your friends why you think they would like something that you're reading or have read. Send them links to an article with a note about why it made you think of them. Or just share your enthusiasm convincingly. I am about halfway through a book I am reading because one friend posted enthusiastically about it on FB and another sent me an IM asking if I had read it because she couldn't stop talking about it. If none of that works (and you don't have to make it a campaign), just accept your friends for who they are, or cultivate some friends who enjoy reading so that you have more of an outlet for that passion.

Step 3: Tell them about the climax. About the most dramatic part in the whole novel and.... Step 4: Leave a cliff hanger. Do not tell them the resolution to the climax. Refuse to divulge anything else.  Step 5: They will be forced to read the book to find out what happens next! ",
