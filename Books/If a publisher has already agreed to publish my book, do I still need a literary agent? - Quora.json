            "answer_text": "You don't have to have one. It's a good idea. My first three books didn't have an agent. I read over the contracts myself, looked up what I needed to, and asked questions. I had a big, reputable publisher, unlikely to be cheating me, and it was easy enough to look up what a \"boilerplate\" book contract looked like, that is, the standard terms and percentages that were offered to a books like mine. My publisher acted as an agent in negotiating subsidiary rights, such as movies, games, and audio versions, in return for which they got a cut, just like an agent would have. No legitimate publisher is going to ask you to \"give away your rights\", but they may want the option of handling them and getting that cut. Since I didn't have an agent that seemed fair. Since my books weren't on the level where publishers were going to fight over it with an auction that would drive the price up (in which case you MUST have an agent), that was really good enough. If I'd been publishing with a smaller, or less prestigious house, however, I'd have been much more wary. Still, researching things like the standard payment for a hardcover deal isn't that difficult. Three books later I had built a name for myself and agents came to me. That was when I realized that my independence had cost me money in the long run, more than I'd realized. The cut that a publisher takes on things like book club editions and audio--and movies-- is much larger than an agent would take. It's a standard cut, so it's not like they're shortchanging you compared to other authors, but it can add up to a lot of money if your book is successful. I still get much more income from my later books than I do for those first three, and I regret not having gotten an agent sooner. Not only won't an agent have an issue coming on board now, but you will probably find it *much* easier to get one with a book offer in hand. They know you are a publishable writer, and they are being handed an immediate fee for getting involved. As for the publisher, they may try to talk (or pressure) you out of it, since they do get a much larger cut of the profits if an agent is not involved. Recognzie that that's why they are doing it, and make your decisions accordingly. Now, if they've offered you a contract already, it's legitimate for them to expect it signed a timely manner, so if you can't find an agent really quickly, you may have to forego it for this one. So in that case just make sure that your contract doesn't have anything that guarantees the terms of future contracts. There probably will be a clause that says they get first option or first offering, or some other such phrase, for your next book. That means that when you write the next one, they get to offer you a contract before you show it to anyone else. It's doubtful you could talk them out of that yourself, but do make sure you do not guarantee any terms for the next contract. One of the key terms is whether you are a \"lead\" book. If they offer you that, it's a very good deal. That means that you are their primary offering that month, and your book will get maximum marketing support. It's not standard for a new author, but not impossible either. Shop for an agent before the next book comes out, if you can. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I don't have one myself so it's not something I can speak to directly, but from speaking to others, they can still be quite helpful. If you haven't already negotiated your contract, they're helpful there. If you have, they can still help represent you in many other ways. They can help if the publisher wants to bu additional books, such as making the book into a series or a spinoff. They can help shop other books around for you (just because your publisher bought one doesn't mean they'll want to publish more).  If you reserved any rights (territorial rights or audible rights, for example - not likely but possible that you didn't give away all rights), they can help you negotiate for those in the future.  If you run into problems and need an extension on a deadline or want to change something about a book tour, they can help. Certainly not mandatory and you will only benefit if you find a good, reputable agent as opposed to someone who might just take advantage of you.  I've also known authors who have been hindered by an agent who sat on a book for long periods of time, in one case for a year. ",
