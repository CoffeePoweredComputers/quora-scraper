            "answer_text": "You want to start your preparation for SSC CGL, my advice will be try to understand pattern of SSC CGL Exam or I say pattern of SSC Exams. Santosh Kumar Yadav's answer to What are the books /resources to be followed for Tier 1 of SSC CGL? You want to start your preparation - most important things for you have to understand that what actually SSC ask in SSC CGL when you go through previous years you will understand that most of the questions are same just values are different. TCS is conducting exams of SSC since 2019 and there is a fix pattern which TCS follow in each SSC Exams. They ask current affairs of last 3 months only.TCS gs is mostly unpredictable, (except 4\u20135 current affairs questions and 3\u20134 static gk questions), GS is only of 50 marks out of 700 so give time according to its value.Reasoning questions are tricky but in maximum questions same logic applied.If you solve Previous Years reasoning of those exams which is conducted by TCS, you will very easily tackle all questions in examination.Length of passage is increasing in every examination.Improve your reading speed otherwise you will be not able to solve passage questions as passages are so long that after reading 5\u20136 lines you will forget what actually you read in the passage.Newspaper reading will play important role in your marks in english.(The Hindu or The Indian Express)Level of English is decreasing and in maximum papers they are just asking previous years questions and paper level is very low that lots of aspirants scoring 50/50 in pre and 185+ in Mains.In maths instead of solving tough questions, you should work upon your calculation speed, TCS is asking same questions as of previous years but now there are lots of calculative questions in examination, if your calculation speed is slow then you will be not able to score high marks in maths as you will be frustrated by doing lots of calculation in examination. Be prepared for calculation.Instead of solving 4 books 1 time, solve 1 book 4 times.Mock test plays very important role to improve your calculation speed, more mocks you attempt more you will get idea which question to skip and which question to solve.Always do 2 times analysis of mocks which you attempted. 1st time same day when you take the mocks and 2nd time after 10\u201312 days.Don\u2019t afraid by seeing toppers marks in CGL 2018 as these marks are normalised marks, in CGL 2018 till Tier-2 one who is scoring 618 marks and other who is scoring 520 marks, both will get same 4600GP job.What to not read is more important than what to read. First decide which books I will follow during my preparation and then do your preparation from those books, if you meet 10 people they will recommend 10 different books. Instead of buying 10 books and opening library in your room, buy 1\u20132 books and solve it many times. Be Positive and don\u2019t think too much, more you think more you will be frustrate. Always talk to those people who will motivate you who have trust on you that you will do best in future. Stay away from negativity and negative persons.Santosh Kumar Yadav ",

            "answer_text": "Well, before answering this question, I would like to share that I cleared SSC CGL 2015 at my first attempt. I took coaching for once at a local small coaching centre. Instead of buying books, I collected notes of some well known coaching centres. The sources of notes for each section are as under: Maths - Satyam Classes, Jaipur by Shri ML Vishnolia sirEnglish - Paramount Classes, DelhiReasoning - Notes of my own coaching centreGK - Lucent and notes of my coaching centreMoreover, I bought last year question papers for tier I and tier II and sample test papers (kiran prakashan) too.This is whole material I worked on. I used to complete my exercise on the same day which were being taught in coaching and simultaneously from the notes of Vishnolia sir and paramount classes. Subject wise tips to cover syllabus: Reasoning- 50 marksGo through all the topics once only. Practice papers will improve this section automatically.Use tricks as much as you can.Do less paper work.Try to cover at least 40-45 out of 50 in this section.General Awareness: 50 marksCover the basics and important points of the subjects you have interest in.General Science and current affairs may be noted too.Last year questions on general awareness may be seen. You can see the selection pattern and sometimes questions repeat too.This portion can be loosen if you have strong command on all three. Though, try to grab at least 10-20 from this section.English: 50 marks (Tier I), 200 marks (Tier II), 100 marks (Tier III)Go through each topic properly and exercise just after finishing the specific topic. It will help to check whether you learnt the rules or not. If not, go through the topic again and exercise again without cheating yourself until every rule is clear in mind.Learn 5 idioms, synonyms, antonyms and one word substitution daily. Don\u2019t try to cover more. Leave them for every day. Connect the words with some person, story, sentence, thing etc and prepare your own tricks/notes to make them by heart than copying others.Pick some random topic and try to write essay, precis, letter or application on that. This practice will help you as you don\u2019t know on what topic you will be going to write in Tier III examination.Note: (English covers 350 marks in three tiers, so this section you seriously need to make strong)4. Maths: 50 marks (Tier I), 200 Marks (Tier II) This is the section where most of the students cover maximum marks.Use tricks as much as you can.Get notes or coaching once to have the tricks on every possible topic.Do exercise of each topic just after finishing it.Do less paper work, make a habit of maximum calculation in your mind.Make the formulas by heart. The best solution for this is to solve questions. The repetitive use of formulas won\u2019t let you forget them.Don\u2019t stuck with too difficult questions. It covers hardly 1-2 % of questions. Either keep your command on easier ones.Once you completed your syllabus, Start solving last year question papers and online mock test papers, wherever you find difficulties, revise that portion.Solving online mock tests is very important because if you know the answers and cannot do it within allotted time, will be painful.See your test paper results. E.g. if you are getting 82 out of 100, it means you will score about 60-70 in actual examination. Understand where you stand and which portion needs improvement.Try to score as much as you can, don\u2019t think just to clear cut offs. The more score you will get, the better and desirable post you will get.Practice completing your papers in less than allotted time. Like if you are to solve a paper in 60 min, try to do it in 40 or 50 min and keep the remaining time for the questions you left for solving later. We lose efficiency a bit in examination hall, so have a good speed.Start solving one test paper daily for one month before your examination.Tips for solving paper: Tier I paper contains 4 sections, divide time for each section and too in this solving order:General Awareness \u2013 5 minReasoning -10 minEnglish -15 minMaths \u2013 25 minTo look over the whole paper and remaining questions- 5 min2. Start paper with general awareness section. Don\u2019t think much on a question, this won\u2019t help. If you know the answer then submit and move forward and finish this portion just in 5 minutes. 3. Go with Reasoning next followed by English and Math. If you follow the time limits, you will get sufficient time for solving maths section i.e. one minute for each question. So do practice at home. 4. A good attempting with accuracy is important, so avoid answering very doubtful questions. 5. Leave the questions to solve later which are difficult and time consuming. Try to spare at least 15 minutes in Tier II for the questions you left for later. 6. Never panic in examination hall. A peaceful mind gives better results. Reach on time in examination hall and make yourself comfortable. 7. For descriptive paper, its important that your writing should be legible. Avoid repeating same ideas. Make your material striking to gain higher marks. For this, I have already suggested to practice writing on random topics. 8. DEST \u2013 Take 20-30 sheets instead of a book and do one hour regular practice for one month before your test. Typing Master is good for this. Focus on accuracy with speed. 9. CPT \u2013 Word \u2013 as suggested for DESTExcel \u2013 Download some sample sheets from internet and learn to make them.PowerPoint \u2013 Download sample sheets from internet and learn the basics.The sheets for CPT are normally based on basics. If you have basic knowledge of MS office. You can easily do it.Wish you all the best. Thanks for reading. :) ",
