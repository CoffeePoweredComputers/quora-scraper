            "answer_text": "Hello. I have been preparing for m.a economics entrance for the past 4 months and I follow a different strategy. I hope it will be helpful to you too.Before beginning you must understand that the pattern of entrance is different in each university, for instance DSE has a very different pattern,they do not stick to the same topics every year. I mean in DSE if there were many questions on probability this year and the next year questions may come mostly from calculus or game theory. So for that you must have been a brilliant student and a really sincere one. In JNU, they have 40 objective type questions(with -ve marking of 0.33) and 9 subjective questions of 5 marks each(of which you are supposed to attempt any 7) and a compulsory 15 marks subjective question. For HCU, you get 100 questions that includes general knowledge, micro, Marco, development, growth and international economics. For CUCET you get 100 questions that include English proficiency, logical reasoning, general knowledge and economics. These are the only ones' that I appeared for. Similarly, other entrances follow other patterns. Therefore, you must first zero it on an entrance that you really want to crack. Then you must try to get the syllabus for the entrance exam and if possible last years question papers. I believe that each one has a different way of doing a thing. I will share mine but you must develop your own in order to make an effective strategy. After collecting the syllabus and question papers I began solving them without giving a second or a first reading to the text. I got stuck in almost every question and whenever that happened I would search the books and internet for the answer and the concept. Then I wrote everything down and understood the same. It took something around a month to complete one question set but then when I began doing the next one, I could solve many questions and got stuck up lesser. I continued and finally the 2016 question paper of HCU took only some days. What I have understood is that even if you are good with the concepts maybe even then you may not be able to score good. Because scoring is an art and an art requires a lot of practice. Practicing questions will boost your confidence and make you a better competitor. I hope that helps. ",
