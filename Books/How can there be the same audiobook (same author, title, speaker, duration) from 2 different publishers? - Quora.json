There will be two editions floating about and you may be able to find the older one second-hand, but all new sales will be the new editionThe two different publishers are in different countries. Publishing rights are territorial, so a book that is Penguin in the UK might be HarperCollins in the USA and Hachette in France. They will often be selling the exact same product, but only one publisher gets to sell it in any given territory.",
