            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question Cameron. It is best to start by collating all of your financial documents that paint a holistic picture of your income, expenses, and debt. This way your advisor will know what you have available to save and invest. It is also imperative for you to have a clear vision of what your financial goals are. Do you want to save, invest, and/or plan for retirement. It is also very important to have a solid understanding of how much risk you are willing to take with your money. These are personal questions that only you can answer. If you don\u2019t have a clear answer to them prior to speaking with an advisor, you should really give them some thought. Your advisor can help you answer them but chances are he or she will ask you these types of questions and if you are not prepared your advisor will give you the opportunity to think about this prior to your next session. You don\u2019t have to be knowledgeable about investment options or things of this nature as your advisor will guide you in these matters. But to have an effective relationship with your advisor I definitely suggest that you have your financial goals outlined as best as possible. ",
