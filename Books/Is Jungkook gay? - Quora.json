            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gay, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s straight. I don\u2019t and I won\u2019t assume his sexuality because, 1 that\u2019s not my business, and 2 it\u2019s highly disrespectful. So I\u2019ll just say what I think. I do believe he is attracted to women. He has shown over the years his nervousness and shyness towards girls. He has also shared his personal type which is IU (could\u2019ve changed being he said this years ago). He has also had a few girlfriends when he was younger. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean he is attracted to females. There have been many instances where males who are gay and closeted lie about their attraction or mistake it, along with having girlfriends. But I do feel Jk has genuine feelings towards girls he likes. Now, onto males. Jk definitely doesn\u2019t show nearly any attraction towards males as far as we can see, but tbh that\u2019s normal. Different people react different ways with different genders. For example, I\u2019m bisexual, but I have much stronger feelings around men than I do around females. It\u2019s harder for me to crush on a girl than it is a guy, so I feel less nervous around girls. Jk could be the same way, but switching the genders. Without context, this just sounds like a lot of blabble, but before I say it, I wanna get one point across. I am not saying this for ships. I am not trying to offend anyone (no armys or members). And I\u2019m not trying to start ship wars cause this is not about ships. Anyways. The main reason why I believe Jk isn\u2019t straight and may have an attraction towards males is because of Jimin. Yes. I said it. Don\u2019t attack me. Yes I am a Jikook shipper, so I sound very biased right now. But setting ships aside, I do believe Jk feels a little bit more with Jimin than other members or other males for that matter. We all know how nervous and shy Jk gets around girls. Well, tbh his behavior was not that different around Jimin pre debut and for the first few years after debut. Jimin was the member that took Jk the most time to get used to. He was constantly shy around Jimin, was probably a little intimidated by his straight forwardness, and was usually nervous whenever Jimin said something that was romantic. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean Jk was in love with him or even liked him. All I\u2019m saying is he wasn\u2019t like that around his other hyungs like Hobi or even Tae. He warmed up to them pretty quickly compared to Jimin. It felt almost like he purposely distanced himself away from Jimin for reason we will never know. We know that Jk never hated Jimin despite how many times he\u2019s avoided him and made fun of him. But I believe Jk felt a stronger connection with Jimin that he didn\u2019t know how to process. Doesn\u2019t have to mean anything romantic, it\u2019s just he felt weirder when Jimin said things or did things vs when other members would do the same. Carrying on into the years of 2016-now, Jk has gotten very clingy to Jimin compared to the other members. It seems a little odd that the person Jk avoided the most became the person he wants to be around the most. Overtime, Jk started warming up to Jimin\u2019s affection and started showing his own in his own way. He began to hang out with Jimin more. He started bullying him less and complementing him more. He took him on a trip to Tokyo for his birthday. He made Jimin his muse (unofficially). He began to be more touchy and affectionate with Jimin. And there are many more ways. But It\u2019s important to see how Jk and Jimin\u2019s relationship grew overtime. As Jk started to mature and become more aware of his body, his feelings, himself, I feel like a switch clicked in him that told him, \u201cJimin makes you happy and comfortable, so go be with him, show him you care\u201d and again doesn\u2019t have to be romantically. But I feel like this switch never clicked with anyone else. I say that cause I feel like it didn\u2019t have to. Jk already knew how he felt about his other hyungs so there was no realization he had to come to. However, whatever Jk was feeling towards Jimin must\u2019ve been different if he had such a large switch up like that. I really do believe that Jk adores Jimin wholeheartedly. The way he supports him, the way he touches him, the way he talks to him and about him, the things he does for him. It\u2019s adorable honestly. But the thing I think that should be noticed about Jk is that it\u2019s clear he has a very deep connection with Jimin that just isn\u2019t visible specifically with the other members. Now whether you see that as friendship or relationship, you can\u2019t deny it\u2019s there. Again, I\u2019m not forcing you to ship Jikook cause that\u2019s not what I was trying to show here. I was trying to show how deeply Jk cares about Jimin individually to display his possible attraction towards him. Important word being POSSIBLE. I honestly could type so much more about JK\u2019s personal connection with Jimin, but I won\u2019t because I\u2019ll just continue to run on. To finish, I once again am not assuming JK\u2019s sexuality. I just believe that he is not straight. I view it as, if Jimin was a girl and Jk had the same interaction with her, would I see it as friendship or romance? Why can\u2019t Jk be gay? Bisexual? Pansexual? Why can\u2019t Jk be attracted to someone in bts? Tbh, Jk could be in love with any of the members, but we wouldn\u2019t know because people are too quick to believe that that could never be possible. ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest\u2026what\u2019s the point of asking all these questions about a member from BTS being gay? Does it really matter? Anyways, I will answer now. Homosexuality is not widely accepted in South Korea. Most men around the world end up dating at least one girl before realizing their true sexuality. Although most of South Korea doesn\u2019t believe in homosexuality, doesn\u2019t mean that Jungkook (or ANYONE) can\u2019t be gay. I\u2019m not saying that Jungkook is gay, but there is a possibility. He may wear makeup and chokers and other \u201cfeminine\u201d clothing, but that doesn\u2019t mean he is gay. And yes, he does have a lot of close bonds with his guy friends, but don\u2019t a lot of males as well? Remember, he is still a young man, debating and facing a new challenge everyday. If he were to be gay, I would personally support him. I like anyone no matter what their sexuality. Also, nobody actually knows him but his friends or family, so they may or may not know what his sexuality is\u2026. Ugh\u2026my answer isn\u2019t the BEST answer, but whatever. #Army4ever  Goodbye, everyone. Don\u2019t come after me for stating my own opinions please!!! <3 Spread the Love and Support. Thank you.
