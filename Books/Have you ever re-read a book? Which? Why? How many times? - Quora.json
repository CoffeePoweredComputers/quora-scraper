            "answer_text": "I have re-read many books. More than I can remember. Just off the top of my head - The \u201cSharpe\u201d novels by Bernard Cornwell Dune by Frank Herbert The Lord of the Rings trilogy Star Gate by Andre Norton Tje Dresden Files novels by Jim Butcher The Dream Park novels by Larry Niven The Pliocene Exiles novels by Julian May The Bolo novels by Keith Laumer and others. The Wailing Asteroid by Murray Leinster The Time Patrol novels by Poul Anderson The Polysotechnic League novels by Poul Anderson The Prince Roger series by David Weber The General novels by David Drake The Telzey Amberdon novels by James Schmitz The Demon Breed by James Schmitz The Giants novels by James P Hogan The novels or Alistair Maclean The Matt Helm series by Donald Hamilton The Council Wars novels by John Ringo The Sector General novels by James White The Puppet Masters by Robert Heinlein Sinister Barrier by Eric Frank Russell and many many more. Why? Because I enjoy reading them. Unless you have an amazing memory and try hard, you don\u2019t really remember every word and line of any book, so it is fun to re-read and find new stuff or stuff you\u2019ve forgotten. How often? All the above books, definitely more than twice. I don\u2019t see why re-reading is surprising. People re-watch films all the time, and they have to pay for it too. ",

            "answer_text": "I do this all of the time. Fictional ones that I have enjoyed I will reread from time to time because it is a pleasure to again visit that world. Of these there are so many, I won\u2019t even try to list. I also reread some non-fiction books (not quite as many, granted) because I need to in order to grasp everything. One of these, an excellent book, is \u2018Strange Glow; The History of Radiation\u2019. It conveys a great deal of information in order to give that history, all without any (or very little) math, for the lay person. I can understand it but it is a great deal to assimilate and I have read it cover to cover multiple times. It is also enjoyable to read as well - I highly recommend it. There is one more non-fiction book I mean to reread and would also recommend, although it is a difficult book in a way. \u2018To Hell and Back\u2019 is an excellent book covering the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the aftermath. It is good because it gives you, I think, the closest to the actual experience of these events without actually having to experience them. That is, of course, the difficulty of it as well. It is very well written, I would even almost say enjoyable or certainly riveting (stunning?). It is a lot to process, both mentally and emotionally, and I find I need to read it again for that reason. By the way, I am retired so now I have a lot more time to read. But I have always reread books I really love - of which, fortunately, I have many! ",
