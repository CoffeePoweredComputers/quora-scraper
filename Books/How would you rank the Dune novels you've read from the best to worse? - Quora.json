DuneGod-EmperorHereticsChapterhouseChildren of DuneDune MessiahHeretics is my favorite because it turns several of the major themes on their ears. After Odrade finds the message Leto II left for her (a Bene Gesserit of Siona Atreides\u2019 lineage) thousands of years earlier, it becomes clear just how big a failure Paul really was, how the God-Emperor was less a tyrant and more of someone who sacrificed their humanity to save the species, and completely flips the script on the Bene Gesserit narrative. However, I listed Dune and God-Emperor above it because they're almost completely different books on the second read-through (after finishing all six books). I like Dune Messiah the least because it gets bogged down in occultism and has several continuity issues (though most are minor). I always got the feeling Herbert wrote Messiah because it was necessary to deconstruct the whole charismatic leader trope, not because he liked the story, as opposed to the other five which are far more developed in theme and literary function. Thank you for the A2A. ",
