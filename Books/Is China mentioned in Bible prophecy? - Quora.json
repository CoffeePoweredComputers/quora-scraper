            "answer_text": "China is not mentioned in any Bible prophecy. There are mentionings of \u2018 Asia \u2018 in certain Biblical books, and even a prophecy against \u2018 Asia \u2018 in 2 Esdras (Apocryphal to Protestants and Catholics, canon to Orthodox), however, none of these references are referring to the continent Asia or any of it\u2019s countries or people (which would include China); it is referring to the Roman province of Asia.  The red you see there is the Roman province of Asia (known also as Asia Minor) from about the second century B.C. to the seventh century A.D. Today, those lands are apart of Turkey and Greece. ",
