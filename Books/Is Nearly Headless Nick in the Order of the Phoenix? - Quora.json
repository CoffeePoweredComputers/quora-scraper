            "answer_text": "Are you asking if he was in the Order of the Phoenix book/movie? Or if he was in the anti-Voldemort group itself, the Order of the Phoenix? I will answer both. According to his Wiki page, Nearly Headless Nick or Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, is in the OotP book. He is not in the movie although he was filmed just cut later. As far as if he was a member of the Order? I don\u2019t see any proof that he was. He has been a ghost for 500 years. I don\u2019t see him getting to involved in something outside of Hogwarts. Plus, he is a ghost so I don\u2019t see him being able to do much other than relay info between people at Hogwarts. Hope this helped! -Drew ",

            "answer_text": "No. He\u2019s a ghost. He had been for 500 odd years. The order members tend to be living before they die. Therefore, since Nearly Headless Nick was already a ghost at the time that the order was created, and he lives in Hogwarts, I severely doubt that he would ever have been sworn in. Dumbledore, for all his flaws, has to have had some degree of rationality, and would not have bothered extending an invitation to a ghost, since it would have served no purpose. Just like this question. Google it next time. ",
