            "answer_text": "English is my second language and now I am a English for ESL (English as a second Language) teacher for foreign students. I also teach Spanish. When I started learning the language I carried a dictionary everywhere I went. The store, the bus, the class, the groceries. The main secret is to accumulate as much vocabulary as you can and learn how to use it. When I was learning English 30 years ago we didn't have Google and all the current technology! I recommend my students to listen to the News on the language you are trying to learn because they will be the same News in 2 languages. Learn the way is used in sentences. Use English subtitles for movies. Write down the words you don't understand and ask a teacher or look it up in an online dictionary like Webster Definition of DICTIONARY In regards to grammar, unless you are writing papers in English, I wouldn't worry so much about the grammar but maybe just the basic verbs tenses (Present, Past, Future) this will give you enough to keep a conversation. This website has helped my students many times when teaching the right tense on verbs.
