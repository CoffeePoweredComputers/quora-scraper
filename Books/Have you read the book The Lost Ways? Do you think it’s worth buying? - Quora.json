            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve purchased the book a while ago. From their sales page you get the impression that it\u2019s a survival guide for when the apocalypses comes. To be honest it won\u2019t make you a survival guru nor will it provide you with the necessary skills to survive. Simply because you lack practice, experience, etc. However, Claude Davis, the author makes very good point. We rely too much on today\u2019s technology and we take too much things for granted. Think about electricity, transportation, communications, education, etc. If the electricity stops for any reason, we\u2019ll go back a few centuries in our development and evolution as specie. And that\u2019s exactly what I like in the book. Claude Davis has put all the knowledge that has been passing from father to son for generations in one place \u2013 The Lost Ways. He introduces the vital techniques and methods you need to know in order to survive without any technologies. That\u2019s gathering and preparing food, hunting, collection of herbs and plants you can use when you\u2019re in pain or sick. Of course these are just a few of them. It\u2019ll take me all day long to tell you what\u2019s inside the 350 pages book. Instead you can check it yourself: http://tinyurl.com/gv3kpkk The techniques and methods by themselves are nothing special and at first they sound logical and you may say: \u201cHey, I knew that!\u201d but the people have developed and kept them alive for many years. Most of them are accessible on the web but you need to spend lots of time searching and structuring the information. However, for others I wasn\u2019t able to find no additional information on the web since they\u2019re not documented anywhere. Just the people have used them for many years and as I said above have been passed from father to son. The think I don\u2019t like about the book of course is the price. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I loved the book and I recommended it to my father because he is also interested in that kind of stuff. But I think it\u2019s a bit overpriced. At the time when I purchased it, it was $47 which I think is a bit too much of the value of the book. I think that $25-35 would be suitable price to pay for it. But still, I\u2019m happy with my purchase, I ordered the hard cover so can reference the book at any time. ",
