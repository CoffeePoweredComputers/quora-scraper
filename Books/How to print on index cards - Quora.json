            "answer_text": "If you have to print on pre-cut index cards, you'll need a printer that has a \"straight-run\" print path (that is, the printing path doesn't change the travelling direction of the card). The best printer I've used so far that does this well is the Hewlett-Packard 5L and 6L LaserPrint, both being legacy models but still available secondhand. You feed the index cards in with the paperfeed frame centred, at no more than 10 cards a go. For the text-input part, you'll need to inset the left, right and bottom margins in MS Word by several inches so that the text prints correctly, but reduce the top margin by half inch or so. ",
