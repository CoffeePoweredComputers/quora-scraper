            "answer_text": "Was it first published in the U.S. after 1977? (More exactly, after 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 1978; that\u2019s when the 1976 Copyright Act took effect.) Then it\u2019s copyrighted. No printed notice is required. Was it first published in the U.S. before 1923? Then it\u2019s out of copyright and in the public domain. Was it first published in the U.S. after 1961, and it has a copyright notice? Then it\u2019s copyrighted. Was it first published in the U.S. between 1923 and 1978, and it doesn\u2019t have a copyright notice? Then in theory the copyright is void, but you had better check very carefully. This a gray area. Was it first published in the U.S. between 1923 and 1961, and has a copyright notice? You need to check with the Copyright Office to find out if the copyright was renewed. Some were, some weren\u2019t. If it was never published in the U.S. and the author died before 1947, it\u2019s out of copyright. If it was never published in the U.S. and the author is still alive or died after 1947, it\u2019s copyrighted. If it\u2019s unpublished and you can\u2019t determine when the author died, or if it\u2019s owned by a corporation instead of an individual, the cut-off is 1922 instead of 1947. (Yes, that\u2019s a year earlier than a published book \u2014 for the next seven months. Then they\u2019ll sync up on 1923.) If it was published outside the U.S. but not in the U.S. and you can\u2019t determine when the author died, or if it\u2019s owned by a corporation instead of an individual, the cut-off is 1923 instead of 1947. I think that covers everything. I\u2019m not 100% certain on the last few cases; if you really need to know for those, talk to an expert. If this seems complicated, it is \u2014 the U.S. reworked its copyright laws at least three times in the twentieth century, and because they didn\u2019t permit changing the status of an existing work \u2014 that is, nothing in the public domain could ever be put under copyright again, or vice versa \u2014 there are a lot of lingering complexities. If it\u2019s any comfort, by 2073 they should all be gone. ",
