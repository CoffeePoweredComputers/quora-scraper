            "answer_text": "There are a few things that make fantasy works Tolkien-esque. Most people just say that Tolkien is the seminal work of fantasy, but it\u2019s very rare that people actually discuss what makes Tolkien Tolkien. Tolkien defined one genre of fantasy, but only one. It\u2019s a very predominant genre that has survived the years and born many offspring, but you can easily spot a Tolkien-influenced work by looking out for the following: The world building. Tolkien\u2019s Middle Earth was originally created way before any Lord of the Rings story was made. The world was rich in history, backstory and its own cultures well before a plot was even put to paper. Tolkien based his Middle Earth on Nordic, Christian and Medieval myths and philosophies, so avoiding that helps.The races. One of the defining characteristics of Tolkien is his use of mythology to create races in a human-like fashion. People who play Dungeons and Dragons know these as \u201cdemi-humans.\u201d As far as I can tell, Tolkien was really the first big writer to do this and make it a thing. He took the mythology of spirits like elves and dwarves and made them into a human-like race that was very human in the way they interacted with actual humans. Any fantasy that deals with elves and dwarves as \u201cdemi-humans\u201d is Tolkien-esque, whether the author knows it or not. Do not work with the \u201cstandard fantasy races\u201d and do not treat them as demi-humans, and that would work well.The story model. Tolkien takes the basic \u201cquest to defeat a dark lord\u201d model for its main plot and runs with it, creating a story where a great dark overlord can be beaten by a band of heroes entrusted with the one thing and task that can save the world, a grand ball of good vs. evil. A lot of high-fantasy stories do something similar and this is the traditional Tolkien-style of story. You can instead focus on different themes or more contemporary, modern themes that don\u2019t deal with a polarizing good vs. evil scheme, or tackle modern issues like prostitution, homosexuality, capitalism, and the like.If you avoid these three things, whatever you create is definitely not going to be Tolkien-esque. People will still probably compare your work to Tolkien, that\u2019s just how it is. But if you take these three things out of the equation you\u2019ll definitely get rid of that bothersome Tolkien-esque stench. ",

            "answer_text": "User-13149996426564820158 gave a great answer but I'd like to add that it's very easy to write a novel that's not LotR. LotR is kind of like the Highlander: there can be only one. There are few, if any (and if there are, I'd like to know what they are), other fantasy novels that have as rich a history and as solid a bedrock as LotR before the author even set pen to paper to begin writing it. It wasn't even a novel that Tolkien had any ambition to write; rather it was born out of the desire to answer the request of his publisher and his fans. He sort of plugged it into his existing mythos and managed to come up with quite a lot more mythology to add to the legacy. I have to say it's a rather vague question you're posing; you're not stating what your reading interests are, for instance. Is Tolkien the only fantasy you've read? Do you have any ideas rattling around in your head that you think you might want to write a story about? Impossible to tell from your question.  But if you're saying you want to write a fantasy novel that doesn't have elves and dwarves (it's illegal for it to have hobbits, though you can have your own analog, at the risk of further criticisms of unoriginality), then write a book that doesn't feature elves or dwarves. Look at different fantasy books. Tolkien, as prominent as he is in the genre, is hardly the only game out there. Also read other books, fiction or non-fiction (cue the old adage that truth is stranger than fiction). Search the Internet for lists of good fantasy books and books of other genres.  Also, look at the mythologies of the world, like Tolkien did. His works are not entirely original themselves; very many of the elements in his works are inspired by older myths. But he took these elements and crafted something that was, as a whole, a unique tale. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear poster, allow me to introduce you to a surprising fact. Lord of the Rings (And let us whisper it for fear someone might hear) is in fact NOT the only fantasy novel in existence or the only type of novel found in fantasy. Shocking I know! As proof, I provide the following examples.   You may have heard of those. Some small little series that you MAY have heard of. DEFINITELY not Lord of the Rings   Also very much NOT Lord of the Rings. Who'd of thought it?   Even this is very much NOT Lord of the Rings. And that's barely even scratching the surface. You write a fantasy story that is not Lord of the Rings by doing what EVERY FANTASY AUTHOR IN HISTORY HAS DONE and come up with a unique plot (In this case, not Lord of the Rings) and WRITING IT. However, if this is a struggle, I would suggest giving up and reading a LOT more books in as many different genres as possible. Read sci-fi/fantasy books, murder mysteries, romances, drama, thrillers and even factual textbooks. READ and maybe one day you will have an original story worth writing. THEN you get started on your epic fantasy novel. Or you could decide to write for a different genre, as Adam Steiner has suggested. Certainly this would make more sense if you have your heart set on being a writer. (I'd still recommend READING as much as possible. This applies to writers of every category)  Or you can give up and go home if you really can't be bothered.  At any rate, I hope this helps.  ",

            "answer_text": "\u2026What the hell? Do you have such a limited perspective on fantasy? I\u2019m sorry, it just really pisses me off when people assume or act like fantasy is only Tolkien. Fantasy does not have to have elves and dwarves and orcs. Fantasy does not have to be an epic quest to defeat a dark lord. Fantasy does not have to have wizards and magic. Fantasy does not have to have a medieval European setting. Tolkien is not the fantasy genre. The fantasy genre is not Tolkien. If you feel like you can\u2019t produce anything that isn\u2019t Tolkienesque, read something besides Tolkien. There\u2019s urban fantasy, magical realism, dark fantasy, and a myriad of other things in between. You have options. You have infinite options, theoretically. It\u2019s super easy to avoid writing LotR\u2014 write literally anything else. Now, maybe I misunderstood the question. Maybe you really want to write something Tolkienesque but don\u2019t want to be accused of plagiarism or cliche. If so, I\u2019m sorry if I was a little hard on you. I struggle with that problem, too. I worry that everything I write will be compared to Harry Potter (Midnight Magic, Those Who Fly), or Twilight (Shadowbook), or the Mortal Instruments (Those Who Fly). I\u2019m particularly hard on myself when it comes to things being too much like Harry Potter, even though I like a lot of things from Harry Potter. The truth is, if you write authentically and vary your sources, your work won\u2019t be too much like LotR. If it\u2019s even the least bit Tolkienesque, people will compare it to LotR anyway, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve done anything wrong. Tolkien was trying to tell an old-fashioned epic that reads like a history of a fictional Europe. He based much of his work on history and Norse mythology. That was the story he was trying to tell. What story do you want to tell? ",

It's about a transvestite wizard Elf who dresses like a female Liberace and who's lover is a purple Unicorn. They live in a Steampunk style universe set in 1400's, in Maine & Quebec, where there exists portals to castles in Scotland, portals to the past (such as Ancient Egypt and Persia) portals to the future (such as the time they went head to head against 1920s rum running gangsters) and some portals zip them across the galaxy where they meet Lovecraft inspired squid headed aliens.  They frequently find themselves in an insane asylum in the year 2525, when the world is on the brink of self destruction as the moon come hurtling towards the Earth.  They sometimes travel with a half-Demon/half-Elf and sometimes with a Vampire Leprechaun, and sometimes with green skinned, pink haired Flower Gnomes.  Several times they visit the North Pole to make attempts at rescuing the enslaved Cookie Elves from the sweat shop slave factories of the evil red robed Leprechaun Santa Claus who obsessively gives shoes to children and his blood thirsty Phookan partner Krumpas who obsessively eats children.  The creature races include Phookas, FarDarrings, GhuillieDhu, Tweegs, and other creatures from Scottish mythology. They fly around the world on a purple pirate ship named The-Rent-A-Prize. Some of the villains fly around in Zeppelins.  Humans are always evil, and in spite of it being the 1400s are armed with 20th century guns. In this version of Maine & Quebec, taverns and wild west saloons can be found in every city, yes, Maine & Quebec are teaming with cities in this alternate version of the 1400s Earth.  And the most feared Necromancer on the planet is scared of dead things and faints at the sight of blood and has a fetish for being tied to trees and BDSM tortured by Unicorns. Does that sound like Lord of the Rings to you? I have never read Lord of the Rings, by the way. Shocking. Yes. I know. I am however a Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master who ran a SpellJammer session for well over a decade and kept detailed game session notes of every game and later used those notes to create the novels of the series mentioned above. And there you have it: how I wrote an entire series of Fantasy novels that is NOT Lord of the Rings and yet, still has Elves and wizards in it. ",

            "answer_text": "LOL! I think you're getting a lot of answers because people are a bit surprised (and perhaps somewhat suspicious) that this is even an issue. LotR was written quite some time ago by a war vet who passed some of his time distracting himself with world building. Tolkien later became part of a now-famous writer's group, and that writer's group produced some of the classics that are now part of the fantasy genre legacy.  They are far from the only authors who've written epic fantasies. But you haven't specified 'epic' fantasies. Are you happy writing any fantasy? Because there are many types of fantasy, including urban, dark, magic realism, and arguably weird west and steampunk are also varieties of fantasy, although some consider them on the verge of science fiction. If you're asking, how can you write a fantasy with orcs, elves, humans, dwarves and a magic item that may or may not doom the world, well, you're probably not going to top what's already out there. But, if you're determined, then you're going to have to approach the matter seriously. You're going to have to set up the world on which these races live in a unique way. The relationships between these species, both personal and political, will also have to be unique. In order to avoid what's been done, you're going to have to read a lot of what is known as sword and sorcery. The good news is, if you love LotR enough to want to write something that epic, you're going to have a lot of fun reading similar books in that genre. There are many, many books, some of them written as a series, some of them associated with games, quite a few stand-alone and of course there are plenty of trilogies. Maybe one of them will inspire you to think beyond LotR. ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t go with a medieval, Euro-centric setting. Immediately, that frees you from the standard characters. You can now do anything you want including making up species outside that realm. The Harry Potter series is set in an alternative universe in modern times. There are many of the same genotypes, but with a bit of a twist on some. My own writing is real world and contemporary, but not urban fantasy. It\u2019s setting is Scandinavia, Siberia, Finland, and Scotland. You could try getting into the real-world elements of countries other than mid-Europe. I do have witches, warlocks, vampires, and werewolves, but I also have trolls, Orcas, bunnies, unicorns, goddesses, elemental spirits, and some other stuff which is not as common as the Euro-centric model. I also have a couple of books set in middle-eastern mythology. No LotR there, but I do get genies, simurghs, demons, and a whole slew of mythological gods from the pre-Islamic middle-east. My suggestion is to get out of town, so to speak. How about setting your fantasy in Africa or South America? If you change the location, you can get out of the usual elf/wizard mindset. You don\u2019t even have to stay on this planet. ",

            "answer_text": "For whatever it is worth, when the Shannara books came out, they were considered rip-offs of Tolkein. That said, Brooks (I think) published scads of Shannara books and probably made a decent amount of cash. I remember another series (can not remember the name) that really struck me as modelled closely on Tolkein (with a smidgeon of Lewis thrown in for good measure)\u2014it was fun enough). A lot of people have said that aSoIaF is really just a D&D campaign put on paper. There is another series (by Sanderson????) that is openly a written version of an RPG campaign. Whatever. Write what you like. If it is reminiscent of JRRT, then so be it. LotR is reminiscent of a lot of works (the Kalaleva, for example\u2014if I misspelled, sorry). A well-crafted and well-written work should be (one hopes) recognized for just that. One thing you might do is read other fantasy and sci-fi works. A lot of stuff from the 60s and 70s really smacks of JRRT. The 70s and 80s are filled with D&D style fantasy. There are others, of course. Read Eddison. Read Barker. Read Donaldson. Read Cherryh. Read Lackey. I assume, if you want to write fantasy, you have read some. If nothing else, write a book you would like to read. If it smacks of JRRT, then it does. No biggie. ",

            "answer_text": "I am extremely confused by your question. Are you writing a book that has similar themes, setting or plot points as the LOTR, so you would like advice on how to maintain the individuality of your work or you simply want to come up with concept that is different from LOTR.  The latter is simple. There are many themes that one can explore which are not mentioned or covered in the LOTR.  The former is a little tricky as the line between inspiration and imitation is very vague. Inventing an individual writing voice with a fresh approach (on already explored themes) is one of the best ways to make one's work stand out.   I would also like to add that the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) books represent the absolute best in fantasy fiction writing. It is extremely difficult (though, not impossible) to replicate a work like LOTR.   ",

Tolkein has taken a kind of medieval Norse myth based world and made that a standard, and plenty of other famous works use the same model of dwarves, elves, dragons.  To radically change the dynamic, pick a different era of history as your base model, say the Renaissance. After that, you can use a different base mythology, such as, Russian. Already you'll have a world radically different from Tolkein.  Then, finally, make a magic system which is not based on rings :)   ",

I'm not sure how this came about, but maybe Liu is someone who loved reading fantasy and said to himself, \"I'm going to do that, but in a new and original way.\" I'm sure that there are other examples of books that do this, and there are definitely new stories to tell in the realm of fantasy.
