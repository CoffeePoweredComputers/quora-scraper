            "answer_text": "Is adultery ever justifiable? Short answer: No There is never a reason to intentionally hurt your partner.  Longer answer: maybe This somewhat depends on how you define adultery. I can tell you that I believe in open relationships. If your partner gives you permission to share your body with another person, or better yet, chooses to join and all of you share each other, then of course, with permission that behavior is justified. Depending on the laws in your country, polygamous relationships may fall under the legal definition of adultery. In those cases, I suppose the answer is \u201cyes\u201d illegal adultery can be justified in my opinion if and only if, that shared sexual experience was approved (and preferably participated in) by your \u201cpartner\u201d. Basically I\u2019m saying you should never intentionally sleep around in an effort to hurt your partner. But if your partner agrees to some form of open or shared relationship, then forget the law and make each other happy. The only justification you should want is from your partner, they are either OK with your behavior or they aren\u2019t. I don\u2019t really care what the law has to say about my personal life, it\u2019s none of the governments business, and their laws on marriage and adultery are out dated and nonsensical. The only thing I consider as adultery is a sexual act without the permission of my partner, and that is not justified (to me). I will never \u201ccheat\u201d on my partners. I will however occasionally get permission to sleep around or include them in multi-partner sex. But I don\u2019t consider that adultery (regardless of the stupid law), because it\u2019s only ever done with permission (and/or participation). ",
