Some I stopped reading because they were bad, some because they failed to hold my interest \u2014 which isn\u2019t necessarily the same thing. Three that stick out for me are: The Silmarillion, J.R.R. Tolkien \u2014 It\u2019s a history book, but without the attraction of the weirdness of *real* history. I could manage two or three pages at a time before my eyes glazed over and the words just turned into white noise. I lasted about 4 chapters, I think? And I remember exactly nothing. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrill, Susanna Clarke \u2014 I really wanted to like this book. There are parts that I actually do find entertaining, but the pacing is just so slow. It doesn\u2019t feel like the story is ever actually going anywhere, and eventually I stopped caring. I think I got through about two-thirds of the book before it became too much of an effort to read. Chronicles of a Royal Pet: A Princess and an Ooze, Ian Rodgers. This book has earned the dubious privilege of being the first one-star review I\u2019ve ever given. The idea is fun (A princess chooses a slime as her pet, and it saves the kingdom) but that\u2019s all there is. Huge chunks of the setting seem to be ripped off from video games, tabletop RPGs, or anime, the author drops a new exposition bomb every three pages or so, and whole pages are spent with the (supposedly blind) protagonist describing costumes and locations. In fact, every single limitation that makes the slime interesting as a protagonist is immediately ignored, forgotten, or overcome because magic. Grammatical errors and homophone typos are everywhere, and it\u2019s blatantly obvious that MS Word\u2019s spell-check is the only \u201cproofreading\u201d that was done. I have seen self-insert fan-fiction that\u2019s a better read. I made it about 120 pages in, roughly 25%. Keep in mind, though that I\u2019m a voracious reader. I plow through an average-sized novel in 3\u20135 hours, and have frequently blitzed two or three books in a single day. I\u2019ve been reading like this for over 30 years, so I can\u2019t even guess at how many books I\u2019ve devoured.. And however-many-thousands of books have passed through my hands, there\u2019s less than 10 that I couldn\u2019t finish. ",

            "answer_text": "(Sorry this is so long, I have very heated opinions) Two years ago, I was stuck up at the cottage, bored out of my mind. I had already read the 10 or so books I had packed - mind you, I didn\u2019t do much all day except read or swim - and it was raining outside, so we couldn\u2019t do much. Then, I spotted it. Sitting on the coffee table, just begging for me to pick it up. The Room, by Jonas Karlsson. I asked my dad who\u2019s it was. He told me it was his, but that I wouldn\u2019t like it. I scoffed and was determined to read it anyway. What does he know about my taste in books anyway? Long story short: I. Hated. It. The book was so completely uninteresting, I put it down after about 50 pages. I couldn\u2019t take another minute of this man blithely describing some \u201croom\u201d he found in his office. (This is just my opinion so no hate please) Another book I couldn\u2019t stand was The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien. I noticed that another Quoran put it in their answer too, and I\u2019m glad someone else agrees with me when I say that book is so boring it could put a chronic insomniac to sleep. It\u2019s basically a glorified history book with all of Tolkien\u2019s rambling descriptions of every single thing and none of the plot that made Lord of the Rings bearable for me. It was worse than trying to read my history textbook at the time, and that was even in French, for god\u2019s sake. I picked it up from my school library, thinking it would be interesting, or at least some variety from what I usually read at the time, and I hated it. I made it maybe a chapter and a half in before my brain stopped seeing words and just fuzzed out. Generally, I do try to finish any book I start, but some just aren\u2019t worth the time and mental effort it would take. ",
