            "answer_text": "How can you create an original, unique, deep, and fantasy novel? Let\u2019s face it - your fantasy novel can only be as original, unique and deep as you are. Don\u2019t stick to the cliches, don\u2019t try too hard at being unique, and write about what you want to write. In short, be yourself. And you\u2019ll get a novel that is as original, unique and deep as you are. If you are a special person, you\u2019ll get a special novel. If you\u2019re a boring person, you\u2019ll get a boring novel (the sort that become bestsellers among people who haven\u2019t seen it all a million times). If you happen to be a neurotypical protestant heterosexual white male, and aren\u2019t confident in your specialness, you\u2019ll need to work on yourself. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not telling you to participate in satanic gay orgies. Instead, you should acquire wisdom. Listen to all the different viewpoints and worldviews.Educate yourself on all sorts of political ideologies and philosophical systems.Do research on obscure topics.Get an education or a profession if you don\u2019t have one already (all writers are writers, but reading a physicist writer is different from reading a linguist writer).Once you have your unique insight you want to share with the world, you are ready to write something unique. It will take practice (probably a lot of practice) to make your novel actually interesting, but originality is about being true to yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t worry about any of this. You would not be asking this question if you had ever written a book yourself. Before you can even hope to pull something like this off, you need practice. About a million words of practice. Right now you are someone who just bought their first pair of figure skates, showing up to your National Olympic Skating Association and saying \u201cPut me on the team!\u201d when you can\u2019t even skate two strokes without falling on your ass. Just write a book. Rewrite it until your eyes bleed. Rewrite it some more with the help of a professional editor. Then write another. And another. By the time you get those million words of practice in, you\u2019ll be able to answer that question for yourself. ",
