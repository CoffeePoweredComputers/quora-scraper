            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always loved reading. My fondest memories from childhood are of losing myself in a good book. By the time I was in high school, I was reading upwards of 120 books a year. (I kept a list.) I loved Douglas Adams and David Eddings and Clive Barker. When I discovered a new fantasy or sci-fi series, my heart would skip a beat, and I\u2019d dive happily into a brand new world. And then, when I sixteen, my english teacher asked me to stay after class. \u201cYou\u2019re an exceptional reader,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re wasting your time reading fantasy books. They\u2019re not worth your time. You should be reading worthwhile books.\u201d I was somewhat taken aback. Up until that point, I\u2019d never considered the idea that there might be \u201cworthwhile\u201d books and \u201ctime-wasting\u201d books. She handed me a copy of The Grapes of Wrath, and told me to tell her what I thought of it once I\u2019d finished. As always, I was excited to dive into a new world. That afternoon when I got home, I sat down to start reading, and\u2026. And was bored out of my brain. I was an Australian teenage girl, with little to no interest in American history or culture. I loved stories of high adventure and magic and mystery. I would devour a 400 page fantasy epic in two days. But I couldn\u2019t get through five pages of Steinbeck\u2019s masterpiece without wanting to claw my eyes out. Nevertheless, I persisted. I refused to pick up another book until I\u2019d finished The Grapes of Wrath. Six months later, I was still only halfway through the book. In the end, I returned the book to my english teacher, made some inane comment about it being \u201cgood\u201d, and then tried to never catch her eye again. During that process, I learned to hate Steinbeck; I missed out on six months of reading books I loved; and I became incredibly suspicious of book recommendations.  If you\u2019re not enjoying the book, stop reading it. There are more books published every single day than a person can read in a year. You are under no obligation to read anything you\u2019re not enjoying\u2014trying to force yourself to keep reading just means that you\u2019re missing out on reading books you will love.  The exception to this is if you have to finish the book for some reason. Possibly it\u2019s a text for school or university, or possibly you\u2019re in a similar position to I was, and you feel obligated to finish the book because someone recommended it to you. There are still ways around actually \u201creading\u201d it. See if you can buy/borrow a copy of the audiobook. If you\u2019re struggling to read it, it can be easier to listen to the story while you\u2019re doing something else with your hands. Put it on while you\u2019re doing housework or playing a computer game.If even an audiobook is too unenjoyable, find a decent plot summary or study guide for the book. (Much easier to do if the book is often studied.) You can find out the plot and the themes, and work out which sections you need to actually read yourself in order to engage with your coursework.",

            "answer_text": "Reading is a unique and an amazing skill, and skill means that you have to be attention to your habits from the day one you intended to plant this skill in your life!Don\u2019t start reading hard books, or books that are not in your level ,Let me talk a little bit about reading from another point of view:I think that what we are reading is kinda of an experience from the life of the writer him or herself, and they just use words to express and spread this kind of experience to us, I don\u2019t think that we should blame them if we couldn\u2019t understand that experience, because sometimes I hear people say to a specific book \u201c it is a very complicated book or I didn\u2019t understand something\u201d okay nice guy, if you see that book has many complicated ideas simply this book is not for you or for your level right now, can you wait a little or learn something before you touch it? I really don\u2019t know why many people think they should have the ability to read all kinds of the books at any time they want, and that is really not true for example, 7 years ago I read a Novel \u201c4o Rules of love\u201d to Elif shafak at that time I thought this Novel wasn\u2019t a nice one, and even couldn\u2019t understand why most people like it, later after maybe 3 years I read it again, I bought the book for a friend, but the day before I gave her, I started to read the novel again, and I couldn\u2019t believe this the same Novel I had read before?! what really happened?!! I found that I can agree to many of the ideas in that book, then I have known later we don\u2019t live in our own comfort zone of learning process for a long time if we choose to change our ideas or perspective that would be very welcoming from our mind and soul, and that is a part of our humanity to learn through our experiences and keep moving without stopping. so I repeat a lot of books more than one time, that is my rule if I find this book is good but I don\u2019t have a lot of experiences to understand the deep meaning of it or I should try to practice some principles then I continue save that book in its place till I do some movements.  as Reading is a process to rise up our awareness, we should know that this skill needs tools, and those tools are very important to keep us on the track of our goal to read any book. Let us talk about tools a little bit: you don\u2019t need to finish the whole book:who said that you need to finish the whole book? what if some pages are not useful at all? or you know some information about it already?! Don\u2019t be into finishing the book till the end from cover to cover expect if you will have exam on it or every single page is unique than the others and that doesn\u2019t happen always because the author always repeat the same ideas a lot of times through the pages to let the reader understand it. 2. Eat a bit of that elephant every time: Do you struggle to finish a book that has 300 pages!! why don\u2019t make schedule for it then? Make your plan to read that book! write down you want to read that book ( its title, pages, the whole time that you need to finish it)now separate the pages according to what is important to you, or chapters or find anything will let you choose to read this before that in amount of time (\u2026.)put exactly the day which will start reading the book, and finishing itFind a suitable time in your week to read the book, in suitable place ( No Interrupting at all).Review the pages you read , and write down the most important ideas!Work on those ideas, every time you apply something from a book, you will go deeper and deeper to read and apply in your lifeALL The Best :) ",
