            "answer_text": "Hoo boy, you've just described my own current personal creative dilemma. I feel you, I really do. And while I can't give you a definitive answer because I'm still figuring it out for myself, at least I can share what I've learned. If you're one of those people who has dreams that seem far away, who has to work at a job that isn't getting you near your ideal workplace, or who has responsibilities that work in opposition to your goals, then welcome to our merry band of dreamers-not-doers. Whether it's geographic, financial, familial, or something else...there will probably always be something holding you back. First of all, almost everyone who gives you advice for this struggle will say to you some variation of: \"if you really want it, you'll figure it out.\" Or \"it doesn't matter what's stopping you, do it anyway.\" You know what? SCREW THOSE PEOPLE. They've probably never had the schedule that you have, the daily routine that you have, and they don't understand how hard it is to nurture your dreams when you're also trying to put food on the table, make sure to tend your family's fragile emotional needs, and be a good person to your spouse/friends/coworkers. And if they have, they've either forgotten just how hard it is to strike a balance, or they don't like to think about it. We've become so well-versed in this armchair philosophy that a successful person is someone who bowls over every obstacle in their way through sheer determination and willpower, that it's become rote. It's also complete bullshit. I have a theory that the advent of the Internet and social media...plus resources like TED, YouTube, the special features on DVDs, biographies, etc....are actually perpetuating this philosophy, and it's doing damage to those of us who actually want to be successful. It seems like you can't go on Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or anywhere else without seeing some \"inspirational\" quote, quip, or adage. Our daily lives are full of success stories from famous people...how they faced enormous obstacles and overcame them all through sheer willpower, or energy, or drive, or dumb luck. The unfortunate thing about all of these stories is that they're a perfect example of Survivorship Bias. You only hear about what worked, but one quote about one incident that turned out well does not cover a lifetime of struggle, failure, and grief. You also don't hear about the billions of other people who fail outright...because honestly, who wants to think about them? Who wants to admit that yes, they might be counted among the forever dreamers? One of those faceless masses that no one talks about, because no one wants to think about them and the fact that they didn't succeed. Well wake up, buttercup. Life isn't some fairy story where everyone who has a dream succeeds, and those who don't succeed never had a dream in the first place. There is a percentage of the population, probably a rather large one, that will never achieve their dreams to the level that they wish. And statistically speaking, you're very likely to be one of those people. Now if you've read that, and gone and had your cry because you finally realize Why Generation Y Yuppies Are Unhappy, and that you are no more special than anyone else...no more talented, capable, driven, or endowed with divine inspiration...if you've realized all of that and come back here, sat down, and then said to yourself: \"well, I don't really care if I don't get paid for it, or recognized for it, or even if it's my 'true' calling...I'd still like to do it,\" then congratulations! You've graduated to the inner circle of dreamers: those of us who have our dreams so deeply embedded in our bones, that we can't not do it. Read on. Second, those people whom I just said to screw are actually half right. But what they should be saying is: \"if you really want it, you have to figure it out,\" or \"it doesn't matter what's stopping you, find a way.\" Because the dismissive nature of \"figure it out\" or \"do it anyway\" is what's so damaging. It implies that this process is easy, that there's some magical formula that if you ask enough (on Quora, among friends, etc.), eventually one of the people \"in the know\" will slip, and let you in on the secret. Well here's the rub: there is a formula, but it will work only for you, and you're the one who has to invent it. Not stumble upon it, not find it...but create it from scratch, through trial and error. If your dream (yes, I am purposely boiling it down to just one here, because one dream is hard enough to achieve let alone several) is really that important to you, you can't wait for lightning to strike and show you the way through the darkness. You have to fight for it. You have to earn it. You have to take one step after another down that pitch-black road, feeling your way the whole time, with every distraction coming at you like bats in the night. Most of the time, possibly every day, you will bump into something and realize you've veered off the road. Change direction and get right back on again...don't lay down and wait for a morning that will never come. This fancy metaphor is basically saying that you need to figure out what schedule or method will work for you, every day, to get you closer to your goal. If you need time but don't have it, find it. Cut out all other distractions, and focus on only one goal (no TV, no going out with friends, even no sleep if it comes to that). If you need space but don't have it, find it, borrow it, or steal it. If you get a job offer, take it only if it gets you closer to your dream, not further away (I forget who it was who said that he saw his goal as a mountain in the distance, and he tried to only ever take a paying job if it got him closer to that mountain, not further away...even if it was just a tiny step closer). If you need direction, find a mentor and don't be shy about it. But you have to find your way, through all the struggles, around all the obstacles, and only you can figure out that path. Sorry I can't help you further here, I wish it was easier...but getting the time and space alone is a lot of hard work. And once you get there, the work itself is a lot of hard work. Welcome to living a dream...it's probably the toughest thing you'll ever do. Third, and perhaps most important because it is the pervasive force that threatens to undo all of your progress, is to recognize the difference between responsibility and Resistance. Steven Pressfield's The War of Art is a great, short read on this. You have to understand when you're actually taking care of something in your life that needs to be taken care of, and thus your dream has to wait...versus using that something as an excuse. Those who are unfamiliar with the concept of Resistance often think it's a silly idea. After all, if someone has a dream that they desperately want to achieve, why on earth would they get in their own way? If they do, then they must not really want it in the first place, right? I can tell you from my own experience that Resistance is very real, and it's insidious. It will convince you to take that job that gets you further from your dream because it pays more and your family could use the money...it will tell you that it's better to get a full night's sleep than work on your passion project...it will tell you all kinds of logical things that are perfectly reasonable, and sound like good advice. But at the end of the day, there are times when you have a legitimate excuse, and times when Resistance is winning the battle, and you have to recognize from the inside out which it is...you have to be conscious of what is going on in your own head. (Once you begin doing this, the crazy revelation is that most excuses, even when they feel legitimate or other people tell you they're legitimate, turn out to be Resistance. You realize that you can keep working on your dream anyway, despite these setbacks...but not until you've built an infrastructure that supports your progress. This is a secret just between you and me, however. Don't tell Resistance I told you.) There's a lot more I could say on this subject...obviously I've been obsessing about it myself. But I hope this is enough to get you started. What my advice basically boils down to, is this:  Screw everyone who tells you to \"do it anyway.\"Stop paying attention to everyone else's success stories, they're poisoning your expectations.Recognize that you're not special, so your dream will not be bestowed upon you. You have to earn it. You might become special, but right now, you're not.Find a way. Do it every day, even for a second. Punch through. This will probably be the hardest thing you ever do, but it will be worth it. Find a way.Recognize Resistance for what it is. Realize that you'll never be rid of it, but with enough self-consciousness, you can tame it.Do it anyway.Do it anyway.If you really want it, do it anyway.",

There is a old proverb - which I really hate but I will have to mention it here.  \"Where there is a will - there is away\" You have dreams - you want them - you need to find the time... One should not find / search excuses - he should go ahead with his intention.  There will be responsibilities - but still there is a long night and long weekends which can be used as real time. ",
