            "answer_text": "Yes, the human body can function fully on only 4 hours of sleep per night. I read an interview they spoke to a man who one day decided that sleeping is for the weak and Adjusted his daily routine to leave only two to four hours for sleep, and here's what he said. Where did the idea come from? Rumor has it that great minds like Leonardo Da Vinci, Nikola Tesla Salvador Dali, and a whole slew of other geniuses of the like practice so-called polyphasic sleep. Which mean they slept for only about one to four hours a day polyphasic sleep is a sleep pattern where you drastically cut your bedtime during the night and Add a couple of twenty to thirty-minute naps throughout the day . Here's how the next couple of days went Day one the experiment started out fantastically, to be honest, I went to bed at 1:30 a.m. 02:53 And woke up at 5:30 I had plenty of extra time before work So I finally did all the housework and made it to-do list for the entire week. To keep up with the schedule I brought a sleep mask and earplugs to work. After lunch, I just found a quiet place to really relax and try to fall asleep I tried the same thing at home, but I couldn't fall asleep within 25 minutes. Well. I guess that'll change in the next few days Day two Before I started this experiment I had talked to a couple of people that tried it and managed to master this type of sleeping pattern They warned me that it takes several weeks to get used to it until then especially for the first two weeks You basically feel like a zombie And this is exactly what happened to me on day two I was incredibly tired and emotionally drained Day 3 at this point there was no today or tomorrow all the days turned into one big blur But I was finally able to fall asleep during like 25-minute breaks However, I didn't feel any better after them every now And then I thought to myself \"why on earth am I doing this I should just go to bed.\" It took a lot of effort and willpower to overcome this rough patch and continue the experiment Day four the blurry state of mind became almost a norm for me if someone started to talk to me I just stood there and stared blankly ahead of me it took too much energy for me to keep up a conversation or even simply reply to questions I spent most of my time staring off into space my appearance also changed in the first four days and definitely not for the better I looked way paler, and my eyes were constantly bloodshot with dark circles under them Maybe the worst is over and it's going to get better from here Day five I started getting a little accustomed to my new sleep schedule. As soon as they close my eyes for a The 25-minute nap I could immediately enter deep sleep I even woke up earlier than I needed to and still felt a bit rested I also had a lot of free time at night, so I decided to read more books and watch more documentaries That's how I found out about a tribe in Brazil called the piryohae People in this tribe never fully sleep. They just take 20-minute naps leaning back against a tree from time to time They believe that when you sleep for too long you become less and less yourself That's some deep introspective stuff, right? Plus, they don't like sleeping in general so that helps Day six and seven I finally got fully used to polyphasic sleep almost every time I woke up from my naps I felt like I had been sleeping for a solid few hours instead of just 25 minutes Mental blocks and cloudiness completely vanished and my work capacity went back to normal I managed to do more than I had ever imagined I could I was reading books and watching movies every evening, and I was able to stop drinking coffee entirely! Not to mention. I started going to the pool with long-last, so I'm back on track Days eight through ten My creativity and stamina improve significantly due to the fact that I could properly recharge my brain in time and regain my strength After the afternoon nap, it felt like a whole day had gone by and I was able to find the best solution to a problem I couldn't figure out earlier all of the obvious signs of my exhaustion had disappeared too and my complexion went back to how it was before My experiment continued to give some great results. I felt all right and was more productive than ever Days 11 through 14 At this point, I decided not to stick to any certain sleeping schedule and just let my body decide for itself When the best time to rest was and I felt really comfortable this way I also pushed myself a little to know more about my limits So I kept sleeping less and less through the night it turned out that two and a half hours of nighttime sleep is enough for me if I have my daytime naps. If I want to sleep even less at night I should just add one more sleep break, and that's it. That's basically how I do it now the pros and cons of polyphasic sleep Pros Number one productivity I managed to knock out my entire days to-do list before lunchtime If this isn't the goal then I don't know what is. It's become way easier to solve any problems and complete all my tasks Number two no more alarm clocks. I've started to notice that I wake up before the alarm clock even rings And I don't feel so grumpy about it either. I'm just ready to hop up and get things done Number three healthy food. It was hard to fall asleep on a full stomach So during my experiment I ate mostly light meals and natural foods. The result was obvious the feeling of heaviness in my stomach disappeared I became more active and I even saved some cash. It was definitely worth it number four: more exercise and books With less time spent sleeping. I had more time to develop myself both physically and mentally. I've read all the books I wanted to and I started going to the gym in the swimming pool All this has resulted in me getting sick less often and feeling much more robust! Cons number one days turn into one big blur We're all used to thinking of days as a series of dust and dawns But with polyphasic sleep, the days all become an endless time stream Dusk and dawn are just signals for people to fall asleep or to wake up and nothing more Number two no more partying, I think I entered a serious more mentally mature phase of my life during this experiment from that time on there were no go hard or go home parties or nights out with friends and don't even get me started on alcohol. It ruins the whole schedule. I guess productivity requires sacrifices Number three health-wise it's not for everybody in the beginning of the experiment The drastic changes in your sleep are very hard for your nervous and circulatory systems So be careful do your research and learn more about this topic before you start? My thoughts after the experiment if your life is like one big to-do list that you just can't seem to keep up with Then polyphasic sleep is probably for you. All jokes aside, I definitely became more productive, and I have a lot of spare time that allows me to do everything I want and even more. On the other hand, it can be difficult since the whole world is on a completely different regimen your friends and family might think it's weird when you tell them you can't go out with them or Ask them to pause a movie so you can take a nap. In any case, it's your choice to make Just do your homework first and then go for it. If this sort of dramatic change isn't for you. Don't worry There are still lots of things you can do to improve your productivity First of all, when you're trying to get something done turn off your phone it might sound a bit silly But your phone is a huge distraction You'll reply to one message here, read some news there and within a few minutes You're on Instagram Checking out celebrity profiles or on Twitter debating some new topics. Just put it down or turn on airplane mode Trust us, your level of productivity will definitely increase secondly, stop waiting for the perfect moment If you want to do something just do it. All the obstacles and roadblocks are in your head in real life, It doesn't matter whether you start something on Monday or Thursday. What really matters is how much you've worked on it Another thing is a messy workplace You won't ever be able to do something quickly if your workplace isn't tidy It just takes more time to find things and stresses you out even more, so clean it all up And learn to keep it that way it's no surprise that people you surround yourself with make a huge difference too Try to steer clear from negative nancies and Debbie downers You won't get any good energy or inspiration from people who are always depressed for the sake of being depressed They'll instead just criticize all your ideas and make you doubt yourself and finally learn to say \"No\" It's a magical word that everyone should know Don't overload yourself with too many tasks, some of which you don't even care about. Value your time and spend it on stuff that makes you happy and excited. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they can I have been following 4 hrs sleep pattern for now over 2 years approx. Maybe it's 1.8 yrs. Yogic science :- it has been proven that monks and yogic while meditating practise deep state of consciousness which helps in less or no sleep. I am not sure what the neurologist and the current science says about minimum hours of sleep. Every decade a new research claims the contrary to popular belif. My view is that brain is a complicated machine that is century away to be decoded. I started off with this myth of sleeping 8 hrs minimum. I saw lot of Ted talks and universties lecture about brain. Every one has their experience and mindset . Vedas purana :- these were books written thousand of year. If you are not a literature guy just go through a specific book known as yoga sutra. Specially read it written by swami vivekanad. Aahhh I know I speak spiritual and vooodooo black magic tantric shit but that is entirely different. The people of that age were free. Free in all sense. They were hand to mouth. Alms agriculture and only need was food and cloth to cover. So they invested time on them selves. They found that what the human mind was capable of. They talk about some science fact we don't understand. Example there is term \u201camrit ras\u201d. So what happens is, if you deprive your body of food in manner jainism and hinduism text speak, you will start feeding on the body juices. Like body will be self sufficient to to make you live for maximum. Offcourse you will die but not that fast. A single meal is suffice for months. Meditation helps you control your metabolism as it helps you control your breath . By this you tend to slow your every process in body. I talk about years of practise here. So life is prolonged. So my point here is we don't yet understand our bodies. Although science has help us see million of miles in space we are unsure about the human body. It is what you program your mind. If you say you need 8 hrs sleep you will need it. Body tend to work on thoughts. I have now been sleeping 4 hours a day and it was a disaster in initial month. I could not walk my cognative activities were shit. I lost 3 phones in 6 months. I lost my wallet. Not to mention forgot my keys in ignition many times. But in maybe 3 4 months and experiment with coffee I made it. Now I wake up for 24 hours and then sleep . Today is my day one for 36 hours. I hope it goes well. But I have faith in my belief and self control. Yes it is possible. It takes practise took me 4 yrs but the benifit are countless. I have 3 degree two master 4 languages including mandrin.also planning for violin very soon to boost my focus. It's is dangerous but worth process. Your heart goes through so much. I had consulted docs and researched . I have talked to yogis to help me with process. For beginners start with meditation and specifically awareness meditation which is a type. Well it's two at night and this is me  Have faith and stick to reason why you wanna do so. If it's strong enough who knows maybe you compete people like Albert Einstein and Isaac newton or Nicola Tesla . Edit one :- please while u do this check your caffine intake and be on the diet. Deit here plays a key role. I had a full body checkup and my liver enzymes were above normal. So practise a lot of meditation and light healthy food. Cut down red meat and be on light fruits and pulses diet or else your organ will get tired. Give them rest by light diet and pratise this under guidance. And its a dangerous method where diet plays key role. ",

You can functionally drive a car after drinking 1 litre of vodka, but you wouldn\u2019t win the Monaco Grand Prix that way. Similarly, humans can survive by habitually depriving themselves of sleep - in fact, that\u2019s what most of us in Western, industrialised nations do. Since the 1940\u2019s Americans averaged 7.9 hours sleep per night[1]. In 2013, this had dropped a full hour, to only 6.9 hours of nightly slumber.  Average sleep duration since from the 1942 to 2013 (CC The Conversation) So what, I hear the naysayers respond. Who needs sleep? If I can survive on less than the recommended 7\u20139 hours, then I\u2019ve got more time\u2026.. to work, to party, to scroll through Instagram until 3am, to binge on Waking Dead re-runs\u2026. you get the point. Problem is, when you decide to go against millions of years of evolution and cheat yourself out of sleep, then inevitably you will pay the consequences. Despite what Donald Trump insists, the vast majority of us unequivocally NEED between 7\u20139 hours sleep every night.

Short sleepers and the \u2018sleepless elite\u2019 You\u2019ve no doubt heard people brag about how little sleep they need. CEO\u2019s, entrepreneurs, and politicians[8] are notorious for treating lack of sleep as a kind of badge of honour. But most of this is likely bravado and a result of societal pressure; to increase productivity, beat the competition, etc. However\u2026\u2026 in recent years scientists have discovered that there exists a tiny minority of individuals who possess a rare genetic mutation - specifically a sub-variant of a gene called BHLHE41 (also called DEC2)[9].  People with this gene variation have been dubbed by some as the sleepless elite[10], because they can get by on as little as 5 hours sleep, with no ill-health consequences. So, is it possible that you\u2019re one of tiny blessed minority who can get by on 5 hours sleep a night? Sure, it\u2019s possible, but as Matthew Walker says in his bestselling book Why We Sleep, says, the odds are against you; \u2018it is far more likely that you will be struck by lightning than being truly capable of surviving on insufficient sleep thanks to a rare gene\u2019 \u27a1\ufe0f Read more about sleep hacks and productivity tips at Sleep Junkies Footnotes[1] Why are we so sleep deprived, and why does it matter?[2] Late Nights and Appetites: the Sleep-Obesity Connection | Features | Sleep Junkies[3] Alzheimer's Disease and Sleep[4] Lack of Sleep Increases Your Risk of Some Cancers[5] Sleep Duration as a Risk Factor for Cardiovascular Disease- a Review of the Recent Literature[6] Sleep disorders as core symptoms of depression[7] Drowsy Driving[8] It's time to stop this competitive sleep deprivation[9] Study Reveals Gene Mutation That Makes You Need Less Sleep[10] The Sleepless Elite",

            "answer_text": "For the great majority of humans, it hard to sleep less than 5 hours and still perform at peak.  Even creativity suffers.  There have been some studies looking at elite personnel engaged in polyphasic sleep cycles where they would sleep a total of 4 hours per day.  Each cycle is 1 hour long for a total of 4 cycles.  Others have done six 30 minute naps per day.  While there have been claims that it works, there is no evidence that it truly does, other than from word of mouth claims. See Polyphasic Sleep: Facts and Myths http://www.supermemo.com/articles/polyphasic.htmand the follow-up 5 years laterhttp://www.supermemo.com/articles/polyphasic2010.htm Read more:  These Alternative Sleep Schedules Could Save You 20 Years Normally Spent In Bed http://www.businessinsider.com/polyphasic-sleep-schedules-and-benefits-2013-10 Humans are essentially biphasic.  I tend to sleep this way.  The problem in today's society is that we've become monophasic (a single sleep cycle).  That is not normal. Our ancestors slept using two sleep cycles.  Babies and animals sleep polyphasically.  Heck, babies sleep more than 4 cycles at longer lengths of time for each cycle.   We need sleep to help clear out the junk (toxins) in our neurons.  And it's also used to help create new synaptic connections as well as new neurons.  When you learn something new, your brain has to process it and then create the connections.  Sleep is the way it happens.  In my forthcoming book, \"The Four Pillars of Optimal Fitness\", I list sleep as the 4th pillar. I'll never forget when I was going through SERE training in the Marines and part of it included training for being a possible POW.  I was deprived of sleep and after a couple of days I started to hallucinate.  I realized what was happening and was able to regain control, though my mental and physical performance suffered.  After a week of no sleep, I was spent.  After the training I slept for nearly two days (A total of 20 hours of sleep over two days). ",

            "answer_text": "It is now clear that most humans require on average 7.5 hours of sleep per night. What's not clear yet is if there are lucky mutants who can get by with 4-5 hours of sleep per night without taking some hit on daytime performance. If there are any, these alert freaks are difficult to identify because: (1) the brain has subtle ways of paying back (usually by installment) any sleep debt incurred from the previous nights and (2) every person has developed ways to cope with the cumulative effects of partial sleep deprivation. The waking EEG of sleep deprived individuals will show evidence of sleep debt repayment in the form of intrusions of slow waves during the waking state. Except in cases of extreme sleep deprivation, the EEG changes can be quite subtle. Thus, routine visual inspection of the EEG may not reveal the subtle slow wave intrusions, but spectral analysis and measurements of EEG slow wave power (amount of waves in the theta and delta frequency bands) may reveal an increase in the amount of slow waves in the waking EEG. In other words, the EEG will reveal physiological markers of sleep intruding into the person's waking state even if the person appears awake and has no behavioral manifestations indicative of sleep or sleepiness (e.g. droopy eyelids, yawning, etc). Individual coping abilities also vary and what may be effective for one person may not be for another. Most people will take caffeinated beverages or other stimulants just to get by through the day. Without coffee and rock music, I doubt I would have graduated from med school. Add to that my caring roommate who woke me up in the morning by throwing shoes on my face and my audacity to miss classes when they don't monitor attendance. What also worked well for me is a mandatory long nap during the weekend. At this age, the only coping mechanism that works for me is the mandatory catch-up weekend sleep. I also acquired the ability to work half-asleep-- fortunately I don't operate machinery or do surgery. The point is that everyone brags about their proverbial prowess to \"defeat the sleep drive\" in school or while in training. While you may be able to cope to a certain extent you will always reach a point when the somnolence gets overbearing and you have no choice but to drop dead. Sleep deprivation - whether acute or chronic - can be disastrous.. beware!

However sleep less than 6 hours is\u2019nt good for your body and your brain. You may feel okay when you less sleep, your body did\u2019nt tell you to feel okay But your brain did. you have to change your habit cycle from day to day, just like i did. Sleep Habit : Change your sleep habit in the night. Give it a try to force yourself sleep at least 6 hours if you find yourself difficult to sleep early. And do it day to day. Your brain will adapt and your brain will automatically request to sleep when the time has come. then try yourself to extend your sleep hours into 7\u20138 hours when it become habit.Get Clean before Sleep : get clean. Wash your face, get a toothbrush make yourself feel fresh when you go to bed. Make your bed comfort before sleepJust Let Go : avoid daydreaming. Forget about work, forget about tommorow. You back in business in the morning. Focus on your mind and make yourself relax for a second. Take a deep breath and try to close your eyes slowlyAvoid Screen : don\u2019t use your smartphone when you go to bed. Put your phone aside at least 1 hour before sleep. Apparently it is big factor to decide your sleep quality. Screen radiation won\u2019t make you sleep well.Morning Routine : set alarm. make yourself wake up at the same hour everyday. Open your bedroom window and let sunlight beam to you. Sunlight will affects your brain, Just like this.. \u201cwake up now you son of a b*tch!\u201dyou may think these are common tips you\u2019ll find on the internet. But these simple tricks that actually works. You\u2019re same guy with me. However we still need enough sleep to balance our tight activity on the day. My advice do not sleep like that anymore, it will affects your productivity at work. you may feel less focus, lack of awareness, easy to be tired, always yawn during your meeting, easy to get angry etc. just don\u2019t be that person. sorry for my grammar. I\u2019m just trying to help :) ",

            "answer_text": "My whole family has been going through a private course provided by a PhD in this field. So this information is fresh in my mind. Generally speaking we should be getting about 8 hours of sleep. In that time the brain goes through several cycles of about 90 mins. From deep sleep to REM sleep and then repeat until you wake up. In deep sleep the fluid surrounding your brain seeps in deep and washes out the toxins built up during the day. Then the clean washed out brain is used during REM to process information. Your brain goes through several of these cycles as you sleep. This is a huge simplification of what goes on but the general idea is there. Unless you are some kind of genetic mutant people need to get about 8 hours of sleep. Yes you can function but after about 17 hours of no sleep on average it\u2019s the same as having a 0.05 blood alcohol level. Your brain can follow an ingrained script but will be severely challenged if presented with extra information to process. It\u2019s that feeling of driving a few blocks without knowing how you did it. Yes you might make it home but if someone else is running a light you might miss it and go boom. And with enough sleep debt built up you start nodding off for a few seconds at a time. That is your brain not being able to function and is resetting itself. So bottom line, don\u2019t do it. I personally think all these people trying to hack their sleep are setting up for severe mental health issues down the line. ",

            "answer_text": "There's a genetic variability in how much sleep you need. However 4 hours per day sounds pretty low. It was shown in one study that only 3% of the population may need less than 6 hours of sleep per day. Personally I know one person who claims to survive on 4 hours of sleep a day, but this was not scientifically confirmed.I recall some research that studied how army officers in combat setting can function without sleep for days. It showed that they actually have a tiny episodes of sleep in between while functioning 'normally'. On the other hand chronic sleep deprivation is a real health risk and is very common in our society. I suspect that being on Quora is a major risk for sleep deprivation, but this should be a subject of a separate study. http://m.helpguide.org/articles/sleep/sleeping http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation ",

From then I do a high intensity 45 minute workout at the gym, and set a goal for myself to have taken a shower, brushed teeth and hair, and be ready for the day by 8 (Sometimes it took til 8:15, though).  Keep in mind that I\u2019m only this scheduled in the mornings, because studies show that when you are instantly getting ready in the morning, that high activity kind of imprints itself onto your brain and gets you active and excited about working for the rest of the day. I don\u2019t eat breakfast, and my lunch break isn\u2019t until 2pm, so I practically live on vitamins and protein milk. I don\u2019t care what scientists think they\u2019ve proven, but I\u2019ve found I function much better with this system then I ever had before. 4 hours is just enough for me. ",

Lots of times I would arrive early to get some much-needed sleep. My worst time to stay awake was between 03:00 and 05:30. I plan out my trip so I could sleep from 01:00 and 05:00. That didn\u2019t always work out that way. My body got used sleeping in those conditions. I would sleep soundly and wake up via an alarm clock. I\u2019d slide into the driver's seat and be wide awake. I carried a heavy-duty thermos filled with hot black coffee. That juice was a must have in order to function. Gary Indiana was our regular stop to take loads of steel back to Toledo. If none were being loaded I\u2019d crawl into the bunk and sleep 8 hours. I felt like crap when I work up. It would take long to stay awake than when I napped a shorter time. ",

Instead of satisfying the four hours sleep is good, it is better to analyse and fix the problem of moving a lot during night. The problems for improper sleep are many. Food: Take light nutritious food two hours before bed and a cup of milk boiled with almonds powder and aswagandha powder. No beverages or strong food of chillies, masala etc. Mental: leave all the mundane problems outside the bedroom and go to bed with clean mind by practising pranayama and meditation. Avoid TV and cinemas of emotional and excitement and terror , and listen to good music. Go through good books of Spirituality, and biographies of great personalities. Visualize pleasant and romantic scenes and enjoying moods of Life in place of nagging problems. Let the bed room neither too cool nor hot, dimly lit and let in fresh air. Good bath with mild hot water and Massaging the head with good aromatic oil release the stress of body and mind helping in relaxation. Good luck. ",

I take melatonin pills, benadryl tables  and sip warm milk before going to bed most nights.I live in a neighborhood that is not always quiet at night, especially during the summer months when kids are not in school. Fall and winter months are much quieter. I do not function well off of 4 hours of sleep. ",

You may experience microsleep that is terribly dangerous. Microsleep is a sleep you experience even without knowing you're having it. If you get microsleep while driving it's lethal.

Researchers believe that assigning a rigid number of sleep hours is not possible because it varies a lot depending upon person to person. But even though it varies, four hours per day is very less. You might experience abnormalities in performing regular functions at first which can lead to serious complications in the long-term. Such people are more likely to suffer from chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, diabetes and even dementia, Though it might be possible for you to live on with only four hours of sleep, but it will be very difficult for you to really savor what life has to offer because you will soon be too fragile.

Now, this period of use depends on what you do. If your job is active and you have an active personality, you could find yourself burnt out in a month or two at least, maybe later depending on your diet. If your sedentary you might be able to pull that off to three months, maybe even four. I would recommend not doing this because it is very bad for your body and your brain, as many studies link a lack of sleeping to a few of mental disease; such as, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. You\u2019re better off getting that extra three hours of sleep in. ",

The average for adults is 8 hours, but some can thrive on 7 or a little less, and some need 9 hours or a little more to be at their best. Depriving yourself of sleep isn\u2019t a good idea, as eventually you will notice that you\u2019re not as alert, or able to concentrate, you\u2019ll become forgetful and irritable, and you might even experience involuntary \u201cmicro-sleeps\u201d during the day which can be dangerous if you\u2019re driving. So, if you need 8 hours just accept it, and arrange your waking hours so that you can get your daily necessary things done without needing to stint yourself of sleep. ",

Same with sleep, you can't expect to sleep 4 hours and then expect that you will concentrate on studies and clear entrance exams. You can check the study that we are more productive when we sleep properly as sleeping is the time the things actually sticks to our brain. Your mind needs to clear the chemicals it has accumulated, and there is a reason we need sleep. So don't try to lower your sleep and concentrate on doing more with your wake time.\ufeff. ",

If you\u2019re primarily a very active person, vs a person who isn\u2019t very active, then I think you\u2019d still be able to function, since you\u2019d have more energy. Using myself as an example. Being an Intel Officer in the US Army, I\u2019m mostly processing paperwork or spreadsheets after compiling data. Because 1/2 of my work, after mining my data is spent at a desk, I have more energy left over, because I\u2019m not as active. I can easily pull a 24hr duty shift, for example, if I spent the previous day at my computer, versus if I spent it rushing around out on the field. Therefore, while it isn\u2019t easy for me to function with so little sleep, I still am able to do so, just with a bit of fatigue. Hope this answers your question! ",

Second, you need to eat only once a day and eat nothing from 6pm till 9am tomorrow. It takes about a month to get used to this diet but after this period, you can go with three to four hours of sleep a day for a month or so without any pressure on your nervous system and without needing sleep during the day. Then you might need one or two days with 7 to 8 hours of sleep at the end of the month. Gradually, your body will get used to this routine and you won\u2019t need the \u2018two days rest\u2019 at the end of the month anymore. This is my own experience though but if you are overweight or you have not been a vegetarian or vegan before, please consult your doctor before deciding to start such a diet and do this under their supervision.

The basis of this is 3.5 hours sleep at night and 3 separate 20 min naps during the day spaced to allow for REM recovery time. This is used to cut out the steep hill between shallow REM sleep and deeper Non REM sleep as certain studies believe this time isn't needed. ",

This sleep consists of REM(Rapid Eye Movement) sleep and the normal sleeping hours. REM sleep generally occurs in the late hours of the whole sleep cycle and ranges from 1 to 2 hours.So, if a person indulges himself into the polyphasic sleep pattern (sleep pattern which is fragmented into 3 to 4 hours of sleep at a stretch and 2 to 3 sessions of power nap, usually of 20 minutes), the person enters the REM sleep immediately during the longest stretch of sleep. This type of sleep pattern is generally not recommended for each and every person because each person has different physical needs. Personally I know a person who sleeps 1.5 - 2 hours a day, who is an entrepreneur and a fitness freak. Additional reference-Alternative Sleep Cycles: You Don't Really Need 6-8 Hours! ",
