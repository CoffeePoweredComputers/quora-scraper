            "answer_text": "I think there can't be a direct answer of \"yes\" or 'no' .Books are aggregation of shared experiences only, happened over thousands of years. Evolution in all fields of human's interest has happened or still happing by taking inferences from inherited shared Knowledge- available in forms of books.Coming to the point -\"Learning\" : Of course, experience is the greatest teacher of all kind but we can't try doing each and everything in our life from the beginning just to get experiences and then only learn about it. If you think experiencing every things around, your entire life will be gone in few things. Books help us to start from one level ahead of anything from which in already being experienced by someone, and save life time of each generation. If each of us would think to invent/work on things from the beginning the human race would have never evolved and remain same as its ancestors, repeating same things again and again to experience by each individual.In our life we don't have much time to make same mistakes again and again to experience it. We can be learn things from shared experiences of others which comes in form of Books. ",
