            "answer_text": "If not the greatest sci-fi novel ever written, an argument can be made that Dune may be in the top five. Several of the answers already provided have made solid points regarding why this novel should be considered among the best in the genre, but I\u2019d like to add a few more and take respectful issue with some of the commonly held negative views. As some have argued, we all have our individual tastes. While all the world may love caviar, some of us find it repulsive. While Mozart\u2019s Marriage of FIgaro or Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle hold revered cultural, even iconic status, plenty of us have a hard time handling them. The same can be said for The Lord of the Rings. The world seems to love GRRM\u2019s Game of Thrones. I am not among them, though I have heard that Martin is a superior writer of short science fiction. Everyone is a \u201ccritic.\u201d But informed critics tend to employ broad knowledge about genres and the criteria that work in those genres. There is nothing perfect, much less universally accepted, about criticism. But a critic who provides context and criteria gives the rest of us more to chew on than, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like it.\u201d  So, for Dune, the context of \u201cscience fiction\u201d itself is important. There are many truly great names in science fiction, from granddaddy Jules Verne to the likes of Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Ursula LeGuin and Orson Scott Card\u2014all of them known for their own spin on a somewhat fragmented genre. Space operas/fantasies vary widely from \u201chard science\u201d stories, and one shouldn\u2019t be surprised to find fans who are more attracted to one kind of sub-genre over another. It can get complicated for the \u00fcber-fans, but we won\u2019t go there. A lot of science fiction explores sociology, philosophy, religion, and politics with a futuristic gloss that includes bright (or dark) new technologies. These techno-aspects slide such works into \u201cscience fiction,\u201d but without hard-core science as the fulcrum for the plot. The six-part Dune series may align more closely with Ursula LeGuin\u2019s style of social science fiction than it does with Arthur C. Clark\u2019s or Asimov\u2019s more speculative science-driven stories. Because of that, you might hear the \u201cscience\u201d-minded argue for Asimov\u2019s Foundation or something by Clarke or Heinlein. If you Google \u201cbest science-fiction,\u201d however, and weed out the fantasy stories that wrongly make it onto these lists, you will find that the majority of the \u201cbest\u201d (maybe \u201cpopular\u201d is more accurate) are more futuristic socio-religio-political explorations than science\u20141984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Dune always makes these lists, somewhere near the top, if not #1. Of the ones listed, Dune has more \u201cscience\u201d in it than most of the others\u2014mostly literary facsimiles of genetics and geology (the \u201cstill suit\u201d remains one of my favorite conceptions). Arguably, though, most science-fiction deals with larger human questions, using science and technology as prongs to get at the meat. Briefly then, Dune excels as a great story with all the juicy Joseph Campbell mythic hero bits. As a speculative work on politics, economics, religion and sociology, few other authors do quite as well juggling all those, and probably none of them does it so beautifully in one throw. Unlike a host of authors we could identify who fall in love with their encyclopedic lists of names, Herbert never loses sight of his characters and finds a way to weave each well-defined individual meaningfully into a glittering tapestry, their clashing motives heightening the conflict and building the suspense at multiple levels. This is supremely difficult to pull off well, judging by the list of big names who couldn\u2019t quite manage it, and I tend to think that because the weave fits together so tightly, the artistic breadth of the achievement gets overlooked by some. I\u2019m mystified by those who say Dune is great without being good. One acid test for whether a book is good at a very basic level is how it reads aloud. Try it. Dune is great on the ear. The recorded book versions are simply wonderful. That\u2019s not as true of some of Dune\u2019s competition. I teach the great literary works from Gilgamesh to Northanger Abbey to hundreds of freshman and sophomore college students. I get it. Not everyone is thrilled by complex human drama examined from the micro and macro levels in the same story. Not everyone jives to Dante or Milton, or agrees with Aristotle\u2019s criteria for good stories in the Poetics. And many yawn at the Mariana Trench levels of depth in Frank Herbert. And that\u2019s fine. But there is little question that Dune ranks as one of the finest epic stories ever written, regardless of genre, and the test of its greatness may be how long it stays near the top of everybody\u2019s lists.

            "answer_text": "Dune is considered a classic particularly the books written by Frank Herbert as for his son\u2019s books they have some good points but they suffer badly from the fact that his son is nowhere as good a writer as his father. Although there was a final book in the Dune series his son managed to add a layer of stupid that made the books seem like mediocre fan fiction and I have seen some Dune Fan fiction which was far more interesting than the effort that Brian Herbert and Kevin Andersons came up with as they attempted to pad out Frank Herbert\u2019s notes on the final book. In fact there was a book called the Dune Encylopedia which was far better as it was drawn from the notes and writings of Frank Herbert. There is an introduction by Herbert himself, and the front is subtitled: \"The complete, authorized guide and companion to Frank Herbert's masterpiece of the imagination\"  Funnily enough nothing in the book is like the way Anderson & Herbert jr. tell it as it became disowned as non-canon and has been out of print since the 1980s though it shows a great deal more imagination than Anderson & Herbert jrs version and there is certainly material stolen from it : the death of Holtzman is identical in that it is the result of laser and shield interaction. It is available on line but will cost your right nut to get these days So if you are going to read Dune it is best to read Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics and Chapter House. I know there are quite a few people who think the God Emperor of Dune is the best - like this photo I found on line.  The rest written by his son are particularly disappointing with vague glimmers of writing but the plots are bordering on inane particularly with the Legends of Dune The protagonists were cardboard and at best one dimensional; the villains were cookie-cutter bad guys whose only defining characteristic as artificial intelligence machines was being labeled so by the authors; all the battle tactics were brain-dead stupid on all sides; technology was inconsistent, often uncharacteristic of Dune, and universally poorly thought-through; I believe the book itself said it best in the epigraph on page 622: \"The Butlerian Jihad arose from just such stupidity.\" Yes it did. At times the writing in the books fell into the space opera of a bad episode of Star Trek at best and I am thinking of the episode of Spock\u2019s Brian or Star Trek Voyager episode Threshold with the villianous thinking machine\u2019s intelligence never being considered seriously or rationally in this book, which is odd for a book that was going on about the perils of machine intelligence. I mention threshhold particularly as there is no explaination why Paris & Janeway became sort of amphibians and that they got better after that thanks to the Doctor as apparently that is what happens when you go at Warp 10 even though there was a mention of Star Ships going at Warp 13 in the last episodes of the Next Generation but those newts were well creepy.  The book does spend a great many words babbling on about the superiority of humanity over machines, and the virtues of the human capacity for irrationality, but these topics have been covered in much greater depth by Star Trek which isn't saying much. In fact there is a 1968 Dr Who episode that had a greater understanding of computers with a Character casusing a computer to crash with an Algol program which would have been easier than having those three terribly written books though they could have just had the thinking machines some of those outsourced code for safety critical software which would have crashed pretty quickly.
