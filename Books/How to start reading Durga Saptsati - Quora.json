            "answer_text": "I can only share how I started and then you can also if that suits you. As a child I was fascinated by all books, religious or non religious and hence I got a copy of my own like when I was in 7th standard. Since its a Gita Press publication its not an expensive book to buy and started reading the hindi translations. I read the 12-13 chapters that share the stories of king and the merchant (Raja and Vaishya) who are just roaming around this ashram of a guru. I could not retain the names much, but I went on and read them. They trace the journey of the pradurbhav to avlokan of the mother goddess and how the King and the Merchant ultimately took on themselves to find goddess Durga themselves. Sharing what got my interest to reach further in my own words - \"So King Suyath (not sure of the name so please forgive) has lost his kingdom in battle and is in exile, the Merchant Sadhu has been forsaken by his kids and wife, yet both of them worry about there respective past life. Even the possessions they used to have, King is worried about his favourite elephant, his treasure and the Merchant is worried about if his Sons are doing right by their mother etc. They then ask the Guru/Rishi what is this affection towards whats lost or what is no longer their own to call. Even the people who have not done right by them, why do they worry about their well being. That is where the story starts.....\" Start there, dont pay attention to all the sanskrit versions. All the Shlokas that are used to worship or please Ma Durga are part of those narrative, they are usually used for either the welcome (ahvahan) or praise of mother goddess. Once you are through with that read, go over it again this time trying to contemplate the philosophical aspects of it, gradually your 'Spirit' or in this case your 'Brain' will interpret and identify areas of interest. Research them if required, ask questions and don't hesitate to interpret in your own words.This is the enlightenment, its a book about our mother goddess. Now within the book if there are certain Shlokas that you like try chanting them, you can read them silently ( I try to use a rythm - not mandatory) it helps. Just reciting them without learning the meaning of them is also OK, but it would be better if you understand what they mean. See my 'Isht' or chosen diety is Krishna, and hence I love the 'shringar ras' that is used in the praises of krishna. But out mother goddess is a Mother yet a fiersome warrior - thus the 'shringar' is similar to a warrior. Since there are multiple roopa/yogini's of Durga ji, there are recognizable shringar's of each. They have different weapon(s), different Vahan (vehicles - in this case they are animals or birds they ride), a chosen color of their clothing etc. With love in your heart and thirst of knowledge read it, recongnize it and if it touches your heart recite it. Thats the whole point of the Saptshati Shlokas. Ya Devi Sarva-bhooteshu krupa roopen sansthitaNamah-tasyay, Namah-tasyay, Namah-tasyay Namo Namah! Iti! ",
