            "answer_text": "You\u2019re asking about dialogue but I suspect what you REALLY want is how to make the reader not only hear the angry words but FEEL the anger. This is with a combination of things\u2026 but physical registers, transferring emotions with the status of the viewpoint characters body. Layering thoughts to add impact and emphasis to the back and forth. Excerpt: Wren didn't like being touched by this strange woman unbidden. She flinched, but did nothing else. Apparently, her objections and warnings meant nothing to Cassandra. \"Come.\" Wren followed, not thinking anything of the touch until she caught sight of herself in one of the many mirrors throughout the hall. She froze and gripped her hair, pulling the strands in front of her face to confirm the reality. This levity went too far. \"My hair! Put my hair back. I don't want it black!\" Cassandra never stopped walking. \"It is only temporary. Be calm. I will return it to normal.\" She chuckled. \"This will be marvelous.\" \"To Hades with you. I've taken enough of this!\" That stopped Cassandra. She whirled, those black eyes drilling into her. \"Have you, little girl?\" Her voice dropped to an icy whisper. Golden light flickered around her staff. \"Remember who you are talking to and mind your tongue. Or do you intend to try to attack me with my own dagger?\" The woman narrowed her eyes. \"Try it.\"  Anger melted the frozen ball in Wren's stomach. She closed with Cassandra until their noses nearly touched. The woman's breath felt hot on her face. Dealing with a mage's condescending attitude she'd do; merely a part of their better-than-thou make-up. But Cassandra or Ishtar herself--she played the fool for nobody. Her anger at Desiray, at Hethanon, at her own impotence spread into every limb, making them burn as if on fire. Wren gritted the words out slow, one by one. \"I don't care who you are.\" Her voice cracked, but she forced it to a flat growl again. \"I am nobody's toy. You can insult me, think me ignorant but never--never think you can treat me like some pet.\" She felt blood starting beneath her nails. Corona whimpered on her hip. \"I'll die before I let myself be demeaned for someone's pleasure. Understand?\" The mage snorted. \"Are you done?\" Fueled by an iota less anger, the contempt in Cassandra's voice would have stopped Wren. Instead, the woman's biting tone increased the fury. She pulled the strap on the scabbard belt and snatched Corona off her hip. She brandished the bundle in the mage's face. Wren felt tears on her cheeks. She didn't know why she cried, but it only made the passion hotter, more out of control. \"I'll have a please from you, milady. Please dance for me. I came to save lives. My friends are dead and dying because of that arrogant witch you call friend. She wanted to play goddamned games. A very dear friend was murdered. I've been abused, attacked, and nearly raped. My home, my life are destroyed.\" Her body shook so hard she thought she might fall apart. Every breath hurt. She tossed the scabbard and dagger at the mage's feet. \"You want me to play your games? Goddamn ask nice. Otherwise, eat Corona for all I care. Try and make me dance, mage. Try!\" She shook her fists in Cassandra's face. Daring. The red haze of anger seemed to make her hands glow. Cassandra stepped back. The radiance around her staff grew bright. The stars in the mage's dark eyes appeared to flash and explode. Wren glared at her through a blur of tears and fury. She could feel Cassandra's magic building to be released; enough to turn her to a cinder. So alone. She had nothing left but her dignity. She would die with it. Probably better off that way. \"Go ahead,\" Wren challenged. Ishtar, how she hurt inside. She felt like she'd eaten broken glass. \"Kill me because I wouldn't simply roll over for you! Do it!\" A gold hand clamped around her throat. \"Be silent!\" \"Make me.\" Notice this scene builds\u2026 it doesn\u2019t suddenly explode\u2026 there\u2019s simmer rising to a boil and then a SNAP! So, it\u2019s not just the dialogue\u2026 it\u2019s the scene coordination, the gestures and registers that make an argument or verbal fight come across. ",

            "answer_text": "Angry dialogue is just dialogue. It\u2019s how the characters get into it and out of it. It\u2019s about what the characters want. Here is a short dialogue from my new novel, Until Love. Dorothy is a presidential candidate. Cristhal is her assistant, a woman of color. And the First Lady.  Dorothy turned to the First Lady and shook her head in apathetic disgust. \u201cDominique, you\u2019ve done well for yourself. I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d Dominique, brought back from her musing, jerked her head toward Dorothy. \u201cI\u2019m sure you are. Maybe that\u2019s why you want my job.\u201d Cristhal\u2019s eyes jabbed into Dominique\u2019s. \u201cWhose job?\u201d Dorothy laid a comforting hand on Cristhal\u2019s arm, stopping her from aggressive agitation. With her eyelids, the First Lady flicked the emotion away. \u201cAnyway, enough about potential futures. How are you doing these days, Dot?\u201d \u201cThe National Register posts everything I\u2019m doing.\u201d \u201cOh. Is it that dreary for you, dear? Certainly, there are more things in life than politics.\u201d \u201cYes. I\u2019ve heard that as well.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s come to mind, sister dear, that I\u2019ve got the perfect man for you. I believe you two may have been meant for each other. He\u2019s quite the celebrity, in more ways than one.\u201d Her eyes wandered back\u2026 she recovered with a nervous twitch. \u201cOr so I\u2019m told.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m capable of my own star search, thanks just the same.\u201d \u201cReally, darling? I believe the FBI folder on you is labeled: Boyfriends, is mysteriously empty.\u201d Dorothy darted a scowl her way. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m joking. Just a little White House humor.\u201d Cristhal slipped between the women, her face inches from the First Lady. \u201cIf you have any ideas of starting a slur campaign, I\u2019ll tie your whole lurid past behind my SUV and drag it through every backwater town in this country.\u201d Dominique moved her face closer. \u201cMy, my, Ms. Mason. I don\u2019t remember your name even being on the invitation.\u201d \u201cMadam First Lady, in case you aren\u2019t sure what century this is, I have every right to be here, as you.\u201d \u201cI know both our ancestors came over on boats, my dear, but mine were on the Mayflower.\u201d Rage contained behind clenched teeth, Cristhal\u2019s hands became fists. Dorothy grabbed her arm. Cristhal leaned in to the First Lady. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you are the first bitch of America, I\u2019ll smack the Avon right off your Plymouth Rock face.\u201d Frightened, the First Lady backed up. She miscalculated the response, but wanting to keep propriety, raised her hand, stopping the advancing Secret Service agents. ",
