            "answer_text": "One million is a '1' followed by six zeros: 1,000,000. The comma is not necessary, but makes it easier to read the numbers. One Billion is 1,000,000,000. Trump has several of those. Jeff Bezos has hundreds and doesn't pay his workers a living wage. Trillion is 1,000,000,000,000. Our national debt is LOT of those; some of which is owed to Russia. The UK used to do it differently, but I think they changed to our system. In a story write: 'one million.' In technical writing: '1,000,000' or 'one million.'Never start a sentence with numbers, except for a year: \"2018 was. . . .\" If the first word in a sentence is a number, write it out. How do you save a million dollars? It easy! If you save a penny on the first day of the month, and double the amount every day for 21 days, you will have $10,485.76. At 28 days you will have over one million dollars. Continue for two more day and you will have over $5,000,000 on the 30th day. $5,368,709.12 to be exact.Try it--day one - 1 cent; day two - 2 cents; day three - 4 cents; day four - 8 cents; day five - 16 cents. . . . Do that for 25 more days. The quick way is to do 2 to the 29th power on a calculator. You have to start with 2 on the second day because 1 to any power is always 1. Remember, it's pennies. Divide the total by 100 to get the correct dollar amount. I'm still trying to scrape the pennies together for the last four days. ",

            "answer_text": "In a math problem: 1000000 In an essay or some other kind of non-technical writing: 1,000,000 It\u2019s best to leave out the commas in technical writing since commas are used in many places as a delimiter and trying to use them as a place marker can lead to confusion. For example, is (1, 1,100) an ordered pair with two numbers, 1 and 1100 with the second comma just a place marker, or is it an ordered triple with three numbers, 1, 1 and 100? ",
