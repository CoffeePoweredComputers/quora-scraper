            "answer_text": "Pray for that person (Matthew 5:44). When I was in my 20\u2019s I operated a typesetting/printing/word processing business with my brother. One night someone broke in and stole a sophisticated $16,000 word processing system. With nothing else to do, I prayed for whoever stole it. A few weeks later I got a call from the police, with a difficult to believe story. Two men had done the thieving, a young hoodlum and his uncle. The younger guy was told to try and sell our system at a local swap meet (a difficult proposition as he got the hardware but not the software). So he set up a booth and was trying to get some cash for it. Unsuccessfully. Across the way from him was another booth selling those glitchy paintings on black velvet. Think, dogs playing poker. One of them, facing this young man, was a painting of Martin Luther with his foot on the throat of the devil. I kid you not. Somehow God spoke to this lost young man through that velvet painting. He prayed for forgiveness and that God would enter in and change his life, giving him power over the forces of evil that were in control of it. So, he turned himself in to the police, along with our stolen equipment. I think because he did this, they went light on him. The insurance company had already paid us off for the loss. They didn\u2019t know what to do with the system (I still had the software, after all), so they offered it back to me \u2014 at 10% of its value. With the cash we were able to buy another piece of equipment, as well as get our original system back in good order. I never met him, but I knew from the story that the officer told me that his life was changed. God is amazing, and prayer works! ",

            "answer_text": "Prosecute to the full extent of the law is justified unless for some reason, you can live with the sin against you. Some children steal credit cards from their parents and use them\u2026illegally of course. The credit card companies will prosecute them whether you are forgiving or not. Moses\u2019 Ten Commandments had \u201cThou shall not steal\u201d as one of the commands. The Hebrew took breaking the commandments very seriously. Some of the commandments, stealing one of them, could end in death of the thief. Jesus had a thief on either side of Him at the crucifixion. You can prosecute or you can forgive the thief, but in some cases the thief may have broken a law against the state, thus you have no control of the prosecution. ",

            "answer_text": "Luke 6: 29\u201330 says to turn the other cheek. This means to show forgiveness, forgive 7 times 70 times. Psalm 98:9 shows that the LORD is the ultimate just judge. He will judge the world with righteousness and equity. A contrasting (though not contradictory) verse would be Romans 13:1-7. This says that we should submit to the government that God has ordained in place to rule us on Earth. Therefore if your government wants you to report the crime, you should definitely do so. In the United States, not reporting a certain crime might be a crime in itself. ",
