            "answer_text": "If I wanted to write a book, where should I start? You should start with the idea that excites you so much that it makes you want to write. Just wanting to write will not be enough of a motivation for you unless you are highly disciplined at making yourself do things you don\u2019t want to do. Sounds strange, since you said you wanted to write, I know, but it\u2019s true. You need to find that one idea that super-excites you, that damn near compels you to write the story even you know you will be the only one who ever reads it. Write it for an audience of one\u2014you. If you want to see how your own story turns out, you\u2019ll keep writing it. There is an exception to this. Sometimes you may be writing for a specific someone else and the guilty pressure you put on yourself will keep you writing. But that said, writing a book is kind of like going on a diet or exercising. You really need a lot of self-motivation (or really strong external motivation) to make yourself keep doing it. It is easy to want to start because you imagine yourself fit and attractive (imagine yourself a published author), to buy a membership (get an idea), go to the first day (write the first page). Then the newness wears off. It becomes a pain to go to the gym (take the time to sit down and write), it interferes with family time and playtime (yes, it does), it gets harder as you push yourself (yes, it does). Pretty soon, you haven\u2019t gone (written) for a week. Then you feel a little guilty and maybe you go (write) another time, maybe you don\u2019t. Then it\u2019s been long enough you wonder why you are wasting your money (time) on the gym membership (thinking about writing when you know you won\u2019t do it). It has to be both something you want and something you enjoy (or something you are afraid of the consequences of not doing\u2014hence why some authors actually love deadlines). So, find that one idea that is exactly what you love, that one story you wish someone had written so that you could read it, and start there. It doesn\u2019t matter if you plot it out or make it up as you go. It doesn\u2019t matter if you write the last page first so you know where it ends. What matters is that you love it so much that it becomes your new hobby, your new pastime, your new obsession. Otherwise your chances of getting more than a couple of pages done are very, very low. And then all of the rest (outlines, character bibles, research/classes to learn how to write, marketing plans, attempts to meet agents or editors\u2026) won\u2019t matter. ",

            "answer_text": "If I wanted to write a book, where should I start? All books start as an idea. I highly recommend developing that idea before launching into writing or research. Idea development can take a few minutes (especially with shorter work) or it can take a week or more. Don\u2019t short-change your idea development. Although ideas are easy to come by for most writers, that doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t important. In fact, it\u2019s essential to evaluate your ideas, and to pick only the best to write about. We are all mortal, and sadly there isn\u2019t enough time to write everything we\u2019d like to in a single lifetime. Where you go after you\u2019ve decided on a particular idea somewhat depends on what kind of book you want to write. For non-fiction, you may have to do a considerable amount of research just to figure out what you\u2019d want to include, what you might want to exclude, and what you want in your \u2018further reading\u2019 section if you want to have one. I highly recommend writing an outline, bearing in mind that you may have to move chapters or even whole sections around, as you determine what is the best information flow. Don\u2019t forget to keep a wish list for images or illustrations as you go along. I wouldn\u2019t start collecting those images until you\u2019ve got a first draft at least, as you may decide to cut the parts of the book that require those images. If you\u2019re writing fiction that requires research, in order to keep yourself from spending months or years in never-ending research, I recommend that you go online, determine which 2\u20134 books are considered essential reading in the area you want to study, and limit yourself to reading those books. Then, while you\u2019re writing, you can mark areas that need further research instead of stopping your writing and doing more reading (unless it\u2019s just a quick look-up, of course.) Not only will this save you time and make your writing research more efficient, but it will spare you a great deal of frustration and agonizing. Why? Because until you have a completed first draft, you don\u2019t know what scenes you\u2019re going to keep. You should feel free to cut what needs to be cut, instead of clinging to scenes that contain something you spent days or weeks researching to \u2018get it right\u2019. Not every book requires research, though. For new writers, it\u2019s difficult to know how to start because you\u2019re probably not aware that there are different ways to approach writing a book, much less which way will be most effective for you. There are four basic sorts of writers I\u2019ve worked with: outliners, \u2018pantsers\u2019 (write by the seat of their pants), hand writers, and hybrids. Outliners do best with an outline and character profiles. The idea is that with an outline, they\u2019ll never be at a loss to figure out what will happen next. They may also avoid plot problems, as their plot will be laid out in advance. Some outlines are very elaborate, such as outlines that are generated using the Snowflake Method. Some writers write just a treatment, as if they were pitching a book to an agent. In most cases, the writers are clear with the idea that the outline is just a tool, and that it can change as they write and come up with new ideas. Pantsers just start writing. Not all pantsers write linearly, either. They\u2019ll write the scenes that they feel most excited about, and then, as they get closer to completion, they write the transitionary scenes. Pantsers seem to do best when they have a clear vision of who their characters are, the setting, and the antagonistic forces in their work when writing fiction, or who have world-class mastery of their subject matter when they\u2019re writing non-fiction. The best of them are ruthless when it comes to cutting large sections of writing that doesn\u2019t work, and replacing it with new writing. It seems like the pantsers I\u2019ve worked with tend to write quickly and a lot of words daily, but that may be a sampling error. Hand writers struggle with writing directly into a computer, but really shine when they hand write and then transcribe their work. Something about the process of writing with a pen (one writer I know uses high-quality fountain pens and fancy journals) onto actual paper helps them pace their thought process and choose their words in a far more productive way than typing. If you spend your time staring at a screen, feeling frustrated or at a loss, but feel full of ideas and constantly jot notes about your work, you may be a hand writer. (You may also struggle with something I call \u2018office head\u2019 which is cured by writing elsewhere like a park or a library.) Hybrid writers are, well, hybrids. I\u2019m a hybrid of a pantser and an outliner. Before I start I need to know my character wants and needs, my initial conflict, my primary conflict, a couple of subplots, my climactic moment, and the tone of my ending (tragic, HEA, whatever.) But I don\u2019t actually outline until after I\u2019ve written a draft, and I do that to see what I\u2019ve got structurally going on. I\u2019ve also done well with hand writing and then transcribing, though I only do that for some scenes. The thing is, you won\u2019t know what kind of writer you are until you try. What\u2019s important is that you experiment. Also, bear in mind that every book may have a little different process for you. You may outline your first three, but wing the fourth. You may write one as a pantser and the next as a hybrid and then move to handwriting. Being open to changing your writing approach is important for your development as a writer. Once you have a few books written (and often those first books will not be something you\u2019d necessarily want to offer up for public consumption) you should have a pretty good grasp of what sort of writer you are. You can refine your process to make yourself as efficient and productive and possible, right down to tracking what time of day you write best and whether you do better writing at the dining table with the radio on, or whether you do better combining writing with excursions and/or retreats, or something entirely different (like having an office shed in the back yard, a cat on your lap, and an endless supply of tea.) One final note about ideas and those first books: some writers have wondered if they should \u2018save\u2019 their best ideas for when they\u2019re better, more experienced writers. Well, if you must, you must, but personally I wouldn\u2019t. At least in my experience, I find that not only does writing improve over time, but idea generation and refinement also improves over time. So please, write your best ideas from the get-go. It\u2019s extremely likely that you\u2019ll have even better ideas later on. Happy writing! ",
