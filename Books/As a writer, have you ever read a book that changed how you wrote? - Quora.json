Instead of one after the other of well-formed, carefully expressed sentences, with impeccable syntax, Jackson intermixes sentences that are sometimes disjointed; sometimes he uses just words or phrases: Here is an excerpt: \u201cAll? Dorothy too? Anna? No. Never Dorothy. Not Anna, really. Certainly not Miss Dawson. Dorothy he had certainly not been in touch with since he was in his \u2018teens, Dorothy he had let believe what she would believe always.\u201d ",

From the good and great ones you get examples of how to do it well. From the bad, you get example that show you how NOT to do it and you get to understand why.

I also read the kissing booth and that was written by a fifteen year old girl and that inspired me to be more outgoing with romance between characters. Though not sex and kissing just like saying that two friends were in love not the character I\u2019m writing. I\u2019m not ready for that yet. Uhhh \ud83d\ude2c too gross. \ud83d\ude02 ",
