            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written quite a few books. So the question doesn\u2019t specify which. But my highest selling book is an indie and is well over 50K copies sold plus additional Kindle loans, KU page reads, audiobook sales/borrows are on top of that. There are a lot of authors who have sold more. Since traditional books are on delayed royalty reports, I\u2019m never up on the numbers. It\u2019s always 6\u20139 months off. Amazon is always 2\u20133 months off. Reporting stores are not every store, event, festival, etc. so though some stores report numbers, many authors and readers do not realize how manybsales don\u2019t get counted toward \u201cbestseller\u201d lists. Reporting stores are those that report sales for NYT. The list is kept fairly private. But not all stores are reporting stores. So it\u2019s actually not an accurate system. So, if the question is about comparing sales, you really can\u2019t because different markets have different sizes of readership and there are too many moving parts. What may be fantastic sales in one readership/genre may be low in another. Beware generalizing in the industry. ",
