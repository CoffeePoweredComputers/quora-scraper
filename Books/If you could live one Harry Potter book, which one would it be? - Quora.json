            "answer_text": "Hmm, let's think: Philosopher's Stone: Everyone's new. So am I. Good place to start and it's not too dark either.Scabbers is still his pet. But he is too much frightened and without company to do any good.Voldemort stinking like garlic in DADA. But he is a wreck.Harry, Ron and Hermione became good friends in the book. I dunno if I could be their friend, I mean, I'm nerdy too so either Hermione hates me or likes me. But no, that would ruin it, she would not be friendless or alone, so well, she wouldn't have been in the trio. So nevermind that.Chamber of Secrets: Too dark. Muggle borns stand a chance of being killed.Ugh, Lockhart.Prisoner of Askaban Not too dark since Sirius is innocent.Dementors. But they're fine. Or maybe not\u2026Goblet of Fire No! A big no no! With Barty Crouch as Moody, Rita Skeeter on top of it, and ofcourse, the Tournament. Not too mention that Voldemort comes back and Fudge doesn't help matters.Order of Phoenix: Umm, Hogwarts is not in a good condition. Obviously, with a huge pink toad burping around there. Something stinks I guess\u2026.ah yes, lies and corruption and\u2026blood! Nope sorry.HBP and DH get too dark so they're out of question. HBP is especially horrible with Ron and Hermione behaving \u2026immaturely.You know what!? I'd be in The Order of the Phoenix. I'll join the Order. No, that's not easy either but I don't wanna spoil their teenage years. Nor do I wanna take a minor role at Hogwarts. So I'll join the Order and probably die a hero's death if it gets too dark or stay till the seventh book fighting against Voldemort. ",
