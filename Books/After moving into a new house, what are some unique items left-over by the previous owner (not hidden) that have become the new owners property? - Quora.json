            "answer_text": "Honestly Jacob most people don\u2019t want other people\u2019s stuff to be left inside a house when they buy it, no matter how valuable those things may be. I remember someone leaving some cool antiques and a 50\u2019s vintage table and chairs in mint condition. The buyer called to complain but when I went and saw everything I said \u201cNo problem! These can be sold for a lot of money or gifted to someone who will be very happy to have them. I am sure the seller thought you would want them and left them as a gift. Suddenly, they wanted them and I didn\u2019t have to remove them. That was another agent\u2019s client and I was just running interference for him. The oddest call I have had was when I worked in Florida. The house was empty and ready to close. The seller no longer had keys to get inside, but I did. The wife called and said her husband just called from work remembering he left his gun in the attic hatch area and asked me to go get it. That was hidden, so not really your question, but I told them I would meet them there so they could get the gun but I would not remove it myself. Most of the not hidden seller left it stuff is worked out before closing. You would be surprised at how many things the seller wants to gift to the buyer, that the buyer could sell, but the buyer says no thank you. They most of the time want an empty house that the seller emptied entirely. ",
