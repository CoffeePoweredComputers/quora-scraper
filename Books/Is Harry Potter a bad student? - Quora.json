            "answer_text": "No. You mentioned that Harry disobeyed several school rules. But he normally had valid reasons to do so. Namely, secretly trying to solve some mystery or doing something really important like figuring out the egg clue in GoF. (Of course, there are some exceptions to this during their first year.) But mostly, Harry did not sneak out just for fun. Harry don\u2019t roam around at midnight just for the thrill of it all. So yes, he broke many school rules. But you could say that he had no choice. (I mean, he can always not involve himself in the matter, but he is Harry Potter, so\u2026) Apart from that, Harry (and Ron) actually care a lot about school. It is debatable whether they are all that enthusiastic about the lessons themselves, but they certainly considered school very important. In CoS, Harry and Ron were so horrified and worried at the prospect of not being able to go to their school that they decided to risk their lives just to fly there. As Professor McGonagall pointed out, the obvious course of action is sent an owl. Or at least, just wait for Molly and Arthur to find them. (Which they will sooner or later, because no matter what mode of transportation they are taking, Arthur can\u2019t just abandon his car.) The only explanation why the two thought flying here was the best solution to the problem was that they were so terrified at not being able to go to school that, being young kids, they totally lost their mind and the possibility of sending an owl and waiting didn\u2019t even occur to them. Yes, I mean, that certainly created a fair amount of trouble for the school, but you can\u2019t deny their effort and enthusiasm to go school. Harry certainly studies and does his homework. A notable achievement because to him, homework obviously isn\u2019t fun. He even does Divination homework, of course, instead of actually doing Divination, he just cooks up a bunch of horrible predictions. But even that is a tremendous effort. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether Harry is a bad student really depends on what angle you're approaching it from.  If we approach it from the grades perspective, Harry isn't all that bad of a student. He runs about average, with a few subjects he does really well in (like Defense Against the Dark Arts) and some that he's absolutely not good at (Divination). But we can see he's decent in this regard by the fact that in Potions, for example, he typically does okay on his final exams despite having to deal with Snape in the classroom. But the question details talk about him breaking the school's rules, so let's have a look at that. The gut reaction is to say that the high levels of rule-breaking do make him a bad student. But if we think about it, Harry is definitely not the only student breaking some of those rules, especially ones like not being out past a certain hour. He does get caught and punished occasionally, but again, I don't think this necessarily makes him a bad student. In this department, he's probably still around the average. The thing that makes his rule-breaking more noticable and therefore more \"bad\" is that he is typically in situations no other student is in. Hearing a snake speak inside the walls before it attacks others? So-called murderous godfather bent on your destruction? Thrust into a tournament that could kill you? Who wouldn't end up breaking some rules in these situations? I think I would. Because of this, I think we can totally discount his not attending his final year at Hogwarts. It was extremely special circumstances that, again, none of the other students had to directly deal with. None of them had a prophecy that foretold their fighting Voldemort, none of the others knew about Horcruxes. In many ways, Harry had a duty to stay out of school that year -- and he never would have survived his final year if he had gone. Think of all the Death Eaters that were at Hogwarts!Saying all this to say, Harry is not a bad student. He's an average to good student who is thrust into special circumstances that others did not have to deal with, causing his rule-breaking to become more extreme than other students. ",
