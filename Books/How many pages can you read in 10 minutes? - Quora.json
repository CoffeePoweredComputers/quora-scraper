            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never kept track. It seems contrary to the spirit of reading. I know people who could read a book in two hours, and ones who could do a sentence in a couple of minutes and then go back and make sure they understood. In his book Ruined City, Nevil Shute places his hero in jail, where he has only a few books and has to learn to read slowly and enjoy them. When I\u2019m reading something interesting and well-written it\u2019s fast, if it\u2019s trash - like a textbook - it\u2019s slow and painful. Think how much better education would be if textbooks were well written, or if teachers used books people liked to read and their students understood. But that\u2019s a different and more interesting topic. I think everyone is like that. There are lots of people in the world who don\u2019t ever read, and it comes down to two causes - they grew up in a house with no books, and parents who didn\u2019t read, or their teachers made them read books and stories nobody could possibly like and made them hate reading and education. Reading is a skill. The more you do it, the faster you get. So really your question is, do you like to read? And that boils down to, do you come from a family with books, and did you have at least one good teacher? ",
