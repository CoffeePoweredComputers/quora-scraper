            "answer_text": "A book review describes, analyzes and evaluates. The review conveys an opinion, supporting it with evidence from the book. Before reading, consider: Title - What does it suggest?Preface or Introduction - Provides important information about the author's intentions or the scope of the book. Can you identify any limitations? Has the author ignored important aspects of the subject?Table of Contents - Shows how the book's organized -- main ideas, how they're developed (chronologically, topically, etc.)Points to ponder as you read the entire book: What's the general field or genre? Does the book fit?From what point of view is the book written?Do you agree or disagree with the author's point of view?Make notes as you read, passages to quote in your review.Can you follow the author's thesis, \"common thread\"?What is the author's style? Formal? Informal? Suitable for the intended audience?Are concepts well defined? Is the language clear and convincing? Are the ideas developed? What areas are covered, not covered?How accurate is the information?Is the author's concluding chapter, the summary, convincing?If there are footnotes, do they provide important information? Do they clarify or extend points made in the text?If relevant, make note of the book's format - layout, binding, etc. Are there maps, illustrations? Are they helpful?Is the index accurate? What sources did the author use -- primary, secondary? Make note of important omissions.What did the book accomplish? Is more work needed? Compare the book to others by this author, or books in this field by other authors. (Use the books listed in the bibliography.)Writing the Review: Include title, author, place, publisher, publication date, edition, pages, special features (maps, etc.), price, ISBN.Hook the reader with your opening sentence. Set the tone of the review. Be familiar with the guidelines -- some editors want plot summaries; others don't. Some want you to say outright if you recommend a book, but not others.Review the book you read -- not the book you wish the author had written.If this is the best book you have ever read, say so -- and why. If it's merely another nice book, say so.Include information about the author-- reputation, qualifications, etc. -- anything relevant to the book and the author's authority.Think about the person reading your review. Is this a librarian buying books for a collection? A parent who wants a good read-aloud? Is the review for readers looking for information about a particular topic, or for readers searching for a good read?Your conclusion should summarize, perhaps include a final assessment. Do not introduce new material at this point.To gain perspective, allow time before revising.",

            "answer_text": "First, most reviewers are not full-time reviewers. Some magazines and newspapers still employ full-time critics, but the majority are freelancers. So the \"job\" every day is most likely fit in around another job. And just like authors, every reviewer is different. Some will only read paper ARCs. Some (like me) prefer digital. Many of us take notes as we read. I don't think any pro reviewer does the \"DNF\" or \"did not finish\" review unless the book is truly atrocious. Personally, I stuck it out through even the worst things so I could be absolutely sure my review was accurate. When it comes to reading multiple books, it's as individual as readers are. I can read books on my own at once, but made myself finish a review book before I'd start another. That said, I often did pleasure reading in between to give me a break from a book I wasn't enjoying. Depending on the book (and the deadline), I'd usually finish a book, take a few days to digest it, then write the review. Some books I've come to think of more fondly than my review would indicate, some less. Deadlines are a hazard when it comes to the amount of time you have between reading and having to go to print (or live online). As for activities regarding reviewing, most of it was housekeeping: interacting with publicists. Trying to determine which books should be reviewed (and that's a complicated process in and of itself). Responding to emails from authors and/or publicists about whether a book will get a review or not, or to obtain an ARC for review, or to ask about publication date changes. You also have to somehow remember all the books you reviewed (I often reviewed over 100 books a year, not including pleasure reading) and be ready to nominate/defend books when it comes time for year-end lists (which is now). I hope that answers everything! ",
