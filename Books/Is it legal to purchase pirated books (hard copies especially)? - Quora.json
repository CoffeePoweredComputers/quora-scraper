            "answer_text": "Straight answer NO. It is not legal at all. The only times you may buy pirated copy is when Original is out of print and you have checked it with publishers and they have either not answered or answered in negative about such title being in stock or replied that they are not going to come out with new print version/edition any time or at all.Publishers are no longer in business and you have no idea as to whom the trade has been passed over toAll you attempts to contact author have failed as well -author may be incommunicado; refused to answer, you were unable to get his/her contact address.Author of the work is dead and you have no knowledge of author\u2019s heir/s if any and how to contact them.Normally such circumstances it is considered alright to buy a pirated version.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. It is more of a choice rather than compulsion. Every novel that comes out, comes out in multiple formats nowadays: Hard cover, paperback, mass market paperback and in eBook formats. It is pointless to purchase a low quality pirated copy; owing to following reasons: I did purchase a few from M.G.Road road-side shops in Bangalore; got a novel for Rs. 30/- or so; but once I brought them home; it was not really worth it. Many of the pages were missing; some had horrendous printing with no visibility at all. It spoiled my entire reading experience. Every time I see the title; my heart cringes.The print quality and binding was terrible.Overall, I decided never to purchase pirated xeroxed novels. I prefer buying hard cover and paperbacks only; since reading to me is more of an experience. It is very similar to having sex with someone you love; making love to someone you love versus picking up someone for $20/hr from the streets; that is the quintessential difference. The difference lies in the overall experience. ",
