            "answer_text": "\u201cOut of print\u201d isn\u2019t the relevant part; \u201cout of copyright\u201d is. If it\u2019s out of copyright (also called \u201cin the public domain\u201d) then anyone who wants to can publish it, whether it\u2019s in print or not. You are absolutely free to put out your own edition of the Bible, or Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol, or Shakespeare\u2019s plays. In the U.S., anything originally published more than 95 years ago \u2014 that is, before 1924 \u2014 is in the public domain. In most countries it\u2019s not a specific year, it\u2019s whether the author has been dead for seventy years. But whether it\u2019s in print has nothing to do with it. If it\u2019s still under copyright, you need permission from the copyright owner (which is usually the author). ",

            "answer_text": "Emphatically not. Whether or not a book is currently available for sale from its publisher has no bearing whatsover on the issue of copyright, which is to say the right to make something available. Laws do vary a bit from country to country, but there\u2019s a decades-long period during which the author (or some other entity) holds the copyright. This is an exclusive right to publish a work, and it doesn\u2019t go away for a very long time. And the only thing that makes it go away is time (there\u2019s a gray area for things which authors deliberately release into the public domain or for which there are \u201ccreative commons\u201d and similar licenses, but they\u2019re exceptions where someone is deliberately making them free for all). A publisher is allowed to let a book fall out of print and republish it a while later for business reasons, or simply on a whim. But it\u2019s their right to control publication of the work during the duration of copyright. You don\u2019t get to take that away. ",
