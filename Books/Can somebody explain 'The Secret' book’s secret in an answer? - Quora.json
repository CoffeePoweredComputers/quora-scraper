            "answer_text": "I read \u201cThe Secret\u201d when it first came out and while I bought into what Rhonda Byrne wrote, I couldn\u2019t help but think two things. Throughout her book, she makes reference to, \u201cthe secret\u201d that every successful person who ever lived, lived by and used to propel them to success but us common people, we\u2019ve never been privy to what the secret is, until now and Ms. Byrne\u2019s book. She goes on and on and on about this and that but never specifically mentions what \u201cthe secret\u201d is. Motivational speakers back her up on her claims. She makes references to \u201cits power\u201d but leaves you guessing until the very end and even then, you\u2019re not 100% sure what specifically the secret is other than to be a positive thinker with a positive attitude towards everything and some other concepts.Ms. Byrne makes reference after reference about how poor she was and all the bad/negative in her life until one day\u2026.her daughter handed her a book that changed her life\u2026.that taught her there was a secret\u2026and on she goes. What\u2019s that book her daughter gave her? Um\u2026that\u2019s apparently a secret because as far as I can recall (I read her book like ten years ago), she does not mention the name of the book.Wanna know a secret? I know the secret. I know her secret and I know the name of the book her daughter handed her that references \u201cthe secret.\u201d I also know that none of what she wrote is original except for how she marketed it. Rhonda Byrne was given one of the most popular books of all time, published in 1937, it continues to be published today and 95% of what was written in the book, holds true today which is why it continues to be a best seller. Here\u2019s another secret, the author reveals \u201cthe secret\u201d in one of the first chapters and refers to it as a secret (probably where Byrne came up with her title) but does not focus on it or keep you guessing for the entire book \u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d by Napoleon Hill is the gold standard\u2026the playbook, the handbook and instruction guide to just about every motivational speaker and author\u2019s lessons on motivation and positive living. While every motivational speaker takes parts of his book and turns it into their mantra, it is Napoleon Hill who really brought all the philosophy together. Not all of what he writes is original but certainly he writes in manner that seems to make sense and work, if you believe and follow the basic philosophy. Rhonda Byrne did just that and made millions of dollars, so yes, it can work. My advice is to buy N. Hill\u2019s book and read the real \u201csecret\u201d in its entirety without the mystical mystery and goofiness that Byrne uses. It\u2019s an easy read. You\u2019ll quickly learn in chapter one, page 7 where Hill writes, \u201cWhen you begin to think and grow rich, you will observe that riches begin with a state of mind, with definiteness of purpose\u2026\u201d and on page 9 where he writes,\u201d \u201cLittle by little, the truth has unfolded itself, until it now appears certain that the principles described in this book hold the secret of mastery over our economic fate.\u201d A person\u2019s state of mind is the absolute secret to absolutely anything & everything that you have ever wanted or even did not want. The rest of the book explains how to achieve that state of mind. And if you really think about it, state of mind really is what sets apart the winners from the defeated.  ",

Comprises of an energy in the whole universe, so if you want something in life such as an object or person you need to constantly think about it and work towards it. You shouldn't think anything bad at all since that would be you emitting negative energy and it would come back to you. So the basic principle here is to focus on what you want and you will get it. Hope this helps. ",
