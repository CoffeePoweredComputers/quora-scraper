            "answer_text": "NCERT\u2019s are the backbone of IAS preparation. One must go through all the ncert\u2019s before going to big books. Now coming to summary of NCERT, ask yourself just one question .. If someone tells you that he knows all the questions coming in the exam and gives it to you. will you prepare only those questions and leave everything else ? do you trust someone and believe he is correct ? can you take such a big gamble considering that if you fail you will have to wait another year ? A wise man\u2019s answer to this will be a big NO. Same goes for summary\u2019s , do you believe that author selling you the summary has covered all the important aspects in his book ? if he has missed something important you will definitely miss it too as you have not read ncert fully. It is advisable that please read ncert books yourself and make notes. This will be helpful to you in the long run. Once you have read this well you will be satisfied from within that you have covered the basics and can now go to GC LEong and other books. Coming to buying ncert\u2019s , this is costly affair for most and people do not find all the books also. There is a government initiative called \u2018epathshala\u2019 . open this in any browser and you will find all the ncert books at a single click free of cost. Use this. Thanks. ",

The use of Summaries would be best for quick grasp and reviews and analysis of the preparations but core details will be much easier to grasp with the detailed books ",
