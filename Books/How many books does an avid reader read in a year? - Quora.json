            "answer_text": "I have to say, those are some pretty impressive stats. But I think I outdo you just a bit. Allow me to sound smug, but I\u2019m not. I believe being an avid reader is not majorly about the number of books one reads. It is what you understand and take from the books you read. And in retrospect it boils down on how many books you\u2019ve read and internalized. For fiction readers, I have to say carving out ninety days in half a year to read a volume of fifty books by the same author is VERY avid. In fact, it could be taken as a weirdness. Anyway, an avid reader will always remember the plot and the characters of the book an year after reading the book. It runs in his or her mind like a movie film. You literally get jitters when you think about a book you read. Some people might take this as being compulsively addicted, but it\u2019s a healthy addiction altogether. An avid reader will also tell out the story with so much vividness as if he or she owned the book or wrote it even. An avid reader will also stock up books and even re-read them when bored. It\u2019ll be like he or she had never read it before and every turn of the page is a step down an already-traveled road. I believe it\u2019s great to read. Reading opens up our minds to new worlds, new ideas and unexplored terrains. It conjures up friends we refer as characters, takes us through an inward journey of their feelings and conscience and makes us a part of their decisions. It connects their situations with those we face, and they become models of how to cope with them. Their loss becomes ours, their joy becomes a shared asset. Lastly, their breakthroughs become ours and in the end their sweet ending becomes a lasting memory in our minds. All the best ",

            "answer_text": "I am an avid fiction-reader and I usually average like 30-50 books a year. This year I started doing 2 fiction books a week plus 1 non-fiction book if I have the time. I mostly read while travelling or listening to audiobooks while at work.Also , I re-read some books whenever some film/TV series is about to be shown. In this case, I am now in book 4 of the Dark Tower series coz I'm planning to watch the Dark Tower film.I must admit for the past 5 years, one of the major factors on which book I need to prioritize, was heavily influenced on schedules of upcoming TV shows or films.To some friends, I advice them to try a book which is somewhat connected to their favorite shows. For first time readers, it is very important that they have strong motivations to keep up the hobby. ",
