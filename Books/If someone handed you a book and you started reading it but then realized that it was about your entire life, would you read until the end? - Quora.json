            "answer_text": "Absolutely, I would read it from beginning to end in one sitting. Hopefully, the author of the book would be myself because writing my life story is a dream for me. I would read the book multiple times and I would study it and see if there is anything in it that I can change to make my life better. I would use the book as an experiment. I would take one small decision and do something different and see the effect of that one small decision on my life. Then I would try it with bigger and bigger decisions. I wonder if I make changes in my life, would those changes then be reflected in the book? If the book really is about my life and I do something that was not originally in the book and then went back to the book and saw that what was there had changed, then I could also see from the book how big of an impact that one minor change had by looking to see how much of the book had changed. For example, if one day I was driving somewhere and I took a right turn which resulted in an accident and so after reading about this in the book,  I decide to instead turn left and avoid the accident. I would then go back to the book and see what else had changed in my life as a result of not having an accident. Maybe, as a result of the accident I met someone who I would not otherwise have met. Like how I met people who got me into situations that were bad for me but those situations introduced me to new people who eventually helped me get to where I am now. One minor change could mean that I would not be the person that I am today. So it would be very interesting to use this book as a way to kind of test things; of course, I would have to be willing to take the risk of making my own life and the lives of others worse. But it is a risk worth taking because it could result in actually making lives better. I think this would be an amazing discovery and certainly one that a curious mind could not pass up. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd read the first 50 pages or so, then cut ahead to the end to see if the bits in the middle are worth reading.  I do that with lots of books, at least the ones not on Kindle.   I've heard repeatedly (in writing classes) that \"character is destiny\".  I'd want to see from a presumably omniscient perspective how my character has revealed itself over time.  I'd also like to see whether the story is interesting or well-written.  I have a feeling that the Author will not resist throwing in a few Deus ex machina moments, and that could be very frustrating as it makes for cheesey writing.  But maybe that's my destiny, too. I don't know if I'd bother to read much more. I might read through the part that says \"and then she started reading the book that was about her life\". I should know by then more or less how things will turn out, barring those things that are completely out of my control.   I'd hope there was an epilogue; the part that tells you what happened to everyone after the main story was over. I'd read that straightaway.  I'd want to know what happens to my kids and their kids if they have any, and to my friends.  It'd also be good to know what happens to me after my body's over.  If there's a heaven, that's great; if there's nothing, that only makes the present so much more important.  And if there's a hell I better get damn busy, because I haven't been nearly as good at being bad as I've been mediocre at being good.  If I know that I'm going to burn, I'd better get busy stacking the kindling and firewood. And if there are any other options, well now. That would really be something, wouldn't it? ",
