            "answer_text": "Nothing to worry about cause I have a perfect answer for you. *Claps goes to me* I am a reader and even I find some books boring. But in your case you find every book, which just means that you are not the reader type. More of a movie type maybe? Well, the Alchemist by Poelho Coelho was book which made me glue to my bed for hours until I finished it. I found it really interesting. And I thought of giving it to my brother who is very much like you. Anddd\u2026\u2026 and he read it for a few minutes (didn't even read through the prologue) and asked me if there was a movie on this books? And I was really really pissed by that but I knew he would take his time to read it. When the internet went down, he read it. When the Facebook was out of new posts, he read it. When movies were over, he read it. When he lent his hard drive of movies to his friend, he read it. And after 2 weeks he said it was good. Just that no excitement or discussion and said that they should make a movie on it for people like him. So that's it. Not an issue at all for him which should be same for you. Every person has his own preferences, one might like Leonardo ( my painter/architect/what not boii!) Or Leonardo (my actor boii). So it's all about interests. ",

            "answer_text": "Not an issue. It is completely understandable if you do not like to do something that is generally considered to be a good habit. Not all people find the same interest in reading books. This is because reading any type of long text requires patience; and patience is a habit that is difficult to acquire. Concentration is not something that everyone has in equal amounts, so don't feel badly about yourself if you feel you're lacking in it. It is true that concentration is something that everybody should have, so you can try to improve your concentration power( 3 Ways to Improve Your Concentration ). However, there's no point forcing yourself to read books if you feel it's not your thing. There is nothing unnatural or wrong in your case. ",
