            "answer_text": "What ever book you are reading, drop it! Pick another one. Do this for every book unless it\u2019s easy to read. In a comment you say you are reading \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d. If it helps at all, that\u2019s a book I had trouble with. I started reading just few years a go, \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d was about the tenth book I picked up and I could not \u201cimagine the backgrounds\u201d (settings) either. Not sure why. I just dropped it. Since then I have read 428 books. I have 69 books that I consider my favorite and probably half of those I would list as having come close to changing my life. The point being you do not need to stick with books which, for any reason at all, you do not understand or don\u2019t like. There are so many books to read that even if you spend all your waking hours reading, you\u2019ll never be able to read them all, so why waist time trying to understand something that you just don\u2019t, when you could spend that time discovering things that truly speak to you.  I read \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea\u201d. Many people love that book. I really dislike it. To me it depicts exactly what\u2019s wrong with the world. I might be wrong. I do not care. But my life experiences, unique to me, makes mw come to the conclusion that to make your hand bleed just to get a fish is the most foolish thing in the world! Let the fish and the blood be a metaphor for anything you want. Again, I might be wrong, but I was so proud that, (a) I understood the books, but (b) had a personal reaction to it that wasn\u2019t influenced by me being intimidated by the popularity of the book. The point being, you will find amazing gems if you get over the idea that you need to read books that you do not like or do not understand. So, just tell yourself that \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d is not the right book for you - if just for now - and move on. You can come back to it later on. I have dropped many just to come back to them later. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the first line of yours \u201cI usually don\u2019t read books.\u201d So am assuming that all this while you were seeing things, talking to people and your interaction was more real, than what your current phase is.I don\u2019t know if the book you are reading is fiction or non-fiction. So it largely depends on the genre. Fictional novels / books have nine out of ten times detailed explanation of the scenario and background, so readers usually put themselves in the place of the event and look around (which is what I do). When characters (from the book) are interacting, or eating or traveling or anything they are doing physically, put yourself there in between characters and be their third or fourth person, and imagine the next question is directed towards you.Try reading books with simple words and ease in understanding. Do not complicate yourself and lose interest in reading.Cheers!! ",
