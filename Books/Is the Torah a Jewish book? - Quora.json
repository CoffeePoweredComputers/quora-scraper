            "answer_text": "Yes and no. \u201cTorah\u201d often refers to the first five books of any given bible or scripture. It\u2019s probably about the one section in every canon that all biblical-based religious groups can agree upon. Jews, Eastern Orthodox, Western Catholics, and all variations of Protestants all fully agree that their bibles begin with the Torah. Torah is the term applied by Jews to categorize the first section of Scripture. The books within this category are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These five books are often considered the most important, as they are traditionally attributed to the books of Moses who spoke face to face with the Lord. Torah usually translates as \u201cLaw,\u201d to be understood as God\u2019s Law as handed down by Moses. Torah in its more literal sense would refer to teaching or instruction; but as \u201cLaw,\u201d it gives it more importance. Outside of Jewish tradition, the grouping of this collection of books is still retained, but more often by giving it a Greek name; rather than Torah it\u2019s called Pentateuch (which references the five books). For both Jews and Christians the Torah / Pentateuch was the origin of their individual sacred library. \u201cJews\u201d are a people that had a foundation in Israel (seeing themselves as the remnant of Israel); but they really only come to identify themselves as \u201cJews\u201d after leaving Babylon (and the beginning of the second temple period). From out of Babylon the Torah was assembled and canonized. Other biblical books may have been in the works, but only the Torah was collectively considered sacred. The Hebrew Scripture follows an Aramaic form of block-lettered script; meaning the alphabet was not the same as Hebrew\u2019s original more or less Phoenician-adopted style we usually call Proto-Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew; but the block-lettered Aramaic script is a Hebrew-transliterated canon. This \u201cTorah\u201d came out with the newly at the time self-designated \u201cJews\u201d after Persia conquered Babylon, in the 6th Century BCE. \u201cJews\u201d were granted permission to return to their homeland, and establish \u201cJudea.\u201d (Not quite the same as its prior name of \u201cJudah,\u201d before being sacked by the Babylonians.) Judea was to be a Jewish autonomous region, or providence, of the Persian Empire. The Jews\u2019 collected literature that went with them was the Torah. For Christian origins, before Christianity even existed, the Jewish canon was commissioned under the Ptolemaic kingdom to be translated into Greek, roughly in the 3rd Century BCE, in Alexandria, Egypt. The results were coined as \u201cSeptuagint,\u201d in reference to seventy commissioned bilingual Jewish scholars. (A tradition has it that seventy translators worked independently for seventy days, and each determined the same wording, that not one translation varied from the next; and thus was considered precise and authoritative as a Greek version of God\u2019s Law.) The original Septuagint was a Greek translation of the Torah; later in time the other biblical books would follow after in Greek translations, though generally included under \u201cSeptuagint\u201d as its title. By the 1st and 2nd Centuries CE, and the beginnings of Christianity, the Greek translations were the sources that New Testament writers relied upon. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it\u2019s a Jewish book, in fact that\u2019s why we are called the People of the Book.\u2014-Which Book? THE TORAH silly. Or did you think it was Catcher in the Rye.[ Second choice : THE CHOSEN?] Well who says the Torah is a Jewish Book? Not the Christians. They see all kinds of hints about Jesus cleverly hidden in various places. How could that be a Jewish book ! Jews don\u2019t believe Jesus was a god, nor His son, and not even a human Messiah, so those clever \u201chints\u201d are incorrect translations desperately trying to predict the sad fate of the Nazarene in G-D\u2019s only original word. They also like to take a passage out of context, ignoring the true intent conveyed clearly by all the previous chapters. Of course no Jew adept in Torah knowledge finds any credibility in these blatant distortions. And it sure isn\u2019t a Moslem book. They realized long ago that the Torah\u2019s recording G-D\u2019s choosing Isaac over Ishmael casts a doubt on the primacy of Islam. Their solution? Their doctrine of \u201c TAHRIF\u201d that says that the Jews corrupted the Torah , packing it full of lies, untruths and falsehoods. No wonder their history books read like part of a parallel universe, where Solomon did not build a Jewish Temple on top of Mt.Moriah [The Temple Mount], but might have built one in Nepal. So SUPERSESSIONISM has infected both Christianity as well as Islam. The core Christian theology for most of its existence taught that the Christian Church has succeeded the Jewish People as the definitive People of G-D, and that the New Covenant has replaced or superseded the Mosaic Covenant.[ A sign that the Messiah is not far off is that the Catholic Church has dropped Supersessionism in favor of Dual Covenant Theology.] The Islamic tradition views Islam as the final and most authentic expression of Abrahamic Prophetic Monotheism, superseding both Jewish AND Christian teachings. So where does that leave us concerning the Torah of the Jews? Well, it was translated into Greek by 72 Rabbis at the request of Ptolemy II Philadelphus [285\u2013247 BCE] .And once that happened ,the Torah was up for grabs. Anyone who knew Koine Greek could read it , mess with it, and claim it as their own book. While tradition views this as a sad event, Maimonides and later the great Rabbi Yaakov Emden , viewed this as the hand of G-D planting Ethical Monotheism into the pagan idolatry that existed in 1st century Rome and 7th century Arabia. The seeds took root and produced daughter religions of Judaism , now blessed with moral and ethical convictions , each a step closer to the wondrous day when \u201c Nation will not lift up sword against nation and will not learn war anymore\u201d. The history recorded in the Torah is all about Jews. It\u2019s laws and traditions were uniquely adapted by G-D to fit the nature, character and abilities of this one specific people. But in the words of Aron Barth, \u201c We are not a master people and it is not our intention to rule over the nations.But the Holy One , in His supreme wisdom , foresaw that it is not possible to train all the nations of the world towards that lofty cosmic goal by one educational method. Therefore He set aside for His nation , Israel, those laws and teachings in the Written and Oral Torah which alone are adapted to its nature , character and task\u201d.  This Torah is the path to G-D for Jews. Christians and Moslem have been given their own unique paths. Solomon Ibn Gabirol, a 11th century Andalusian Rabbi and poet famously saw all three monotheistic religions as honestly searching for G-D , albeit, in different paths. Let us pray that we all find Him as Zacharia foresaw \u201c And the L-RD shall be king over all the earth; in that day there will be but one G-D , and His name shall be One\u201d ",
