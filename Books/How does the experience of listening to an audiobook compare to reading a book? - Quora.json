            "answer_text": "Reading is an inculcated habit for many people. In our digital age, everything we read is pretty much available on digital platforms, whether it's novels, comics, or any other type of literature. The most interesting medium, to me, is the audiobook. Listening to an audiobook is a better utilization of my time compared to physically reading a book. It\u2019s fairly obvious why. We take a book somewhere and read its pages at the expense of other activities because reading that particular book holds more value for us at the time. With an audiobook, I can let it play on my phone while heading to work, going grocery shopping, or cleaning the house. In my experience, you can do any number of things while listening to audiobooks and derive the same value from the content. And audiobooks are great for the visually impaired as well. They also allow me to quickly revisit any part of the book I want to look up no matter where I am, which is a priceless advantage. All things considered, audiobooks are great timesavers. The only downside of replacing physical books with audiobooks is that we all might have to replace our book racks/reading shelves at home with some other elegant furniture! Companies like Timbre Media have made impressive strides in audiobook production in India. They have produced audiobooks for large publishing houses like DC Books (Kerala) as well as global platforms like Audible. To find out more, check out www.timbremedia.in. ",

            "answer_text": "Saving time will depend on your personal reading speed.  I can typically crank an audiobook up to 1.3x or 1.4x and it is still typically slower than my normal reading speed.  Where it makes up for it is that it is more passive.  I can listen to an audiobook while driving, or while cleaning, or while doing any number of other activities.  As a result I can get through audiobooks much faster than hard cover books due to the additional time available to listen. I do find myself tuning the book out from time to time, but I do that when reading a physical copy as well.  The difference is that with an audiobook my attention is forcably diverted, say by heavy traffic, where when reading print if I tune the book out it is typically more similar to a daydream, sometimes related to what I am reading, sometimes not.  It's an interesting experience to look back over a page you read and realize that you don't remember a word. Regardless it is worth trying out an audiobook.  The barrier to entry is negligible, assuming you have access to a public library you should be able to find something interesting at little to no cost to you other than your time. ",
