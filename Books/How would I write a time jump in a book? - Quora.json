            "answer_text": "Time jumps require transition paragraphs. A transition paragraph associates what is last known with what is now known. Some ways to show a time jump with ease include: Use of a date such as last date was Friday, this section now starts on Monday or Star date xxxxccA narrative clause such as over the weekend nothing happened or I restedUse of daylight i.e. last scene the stars were twinkling, this scene, midday sun beat.on your headUse of seasons, last scene snow falling, Christmas lights on houses, this scene the tulips are swaying in a mild breezeUse of a time 1:00, 3:00, 5:30Use of daily habits, I snagged a hot dog for lunch, predinner workout, pancakes at the after hour joint, cocktails before the dance club, toothbrush in mouthUse of holidays or school examsThese indicators can be placed in the narration, in the dialogue or used as a header. The transition paragraph (often seen in detective novels), describes what has happened since the last scene, such as: I interviewed three suspects, or I stopped at the dept. of motor vehicles, but then the Captain called us in for a staff meeting and so I wanted an early morning start. Any amount cue for the reader is passed over easily and still allows the reader to go with the flow. ",

            "answer_text": "I have read the question and thought about the time travel. Then I read the details. I just marked \u201c???\u201d the sentence \u201cthe hot and humid summer changed into the less humid, but not less hot autumn, then came the rains of the winter, the dusty winds of the spring, and then it was a hot and humid summer again\u201d in the story that I am working on. Too long. I think that \u201cfive years later\u201d is good. Want to be a bit obscure? Write something to the effect that a neighbor\u2019s kid is starting a first grade and it looks that she was born only yesterday, or if I was in the Soviet Union, another five-year plan would have started, or somebody celebrating the fifth anniversary of something, or a billboard, that for some reason shows a year. In Israel I can write that the current president has two more years to go, in the USA, that the new president is at the end of their first year/first year of their second term. Still, I am all for \u201cfive years later\u201d. ",
