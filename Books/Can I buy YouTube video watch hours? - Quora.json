            "answer_text": "Sure you can, and I guess you want to do that so you can reach monetization, so you need your 4000 watch hours. First, from what I know, most services do not supply watch time and lie about it, saying they do, and you end up with bots that drop. Trust me, I did some testing. One service I checked and went through, was the views service of getfans. I sent them a ticket asking about their watch time and they said their viewers watch somewhere between 50% of your video to 90%, so that\u2019s significant, so I wanted to test them and see if it\u2019s true, and I did. I added a 44:30 minute video to one of the channels I promote and ordered a 1000 views. After a few days, it had an average retention of 33:02 minutes, that\u2019s almost 75%. That was about a year ago, since then they are my go to service, and not just for views. Now, you do need to take into consideration, that if you reach monetization, it\u2019s not the end of the road. You have to work to keep people coming and watching your videos and subscribing to your channel, so make sure you invest time in making good content and keeping your channel going. ",

Luckily to you I did a few in the past and one of them stands out more than others. The site called as Appsally. You will be getting real users views and you only need to supply them with your YouTube preferred video URL or link. You can buy from as low as 16 hours watch time until 254 watch time. You also can select how many minutes per session and Geo-target you prefer. You can get up to 50% to anywhere to 80% video rate retention I had added over 40:01 minutes of retention rate based on my last purchased that was a few months ago. Since then I keep on coming back for other services as well. You may check them out and see for yourself. In addition to that you also don\u2019t forget to keep on improving the quality of your video content and get engagement more to your video so that it can be ranked higher on the search engine result. The algorithm still a mystery but it doesn\u2019t that you shouldn\u2019t try to get more engagement to your video. Plus you will get al sorts of new ideas to enhance the quality of your video in the future. Other than that optimize the quantity and quality of your video by using the right keywords using the tools on the internet, appealing thumbnail photos as front cover of your videos, tags, promote your video in other sites, embed your video with easily recognized links (*customize one) and many others. Last but not least optimize the quality of your viewers experience by choosing all the best videos that you have and make a playlist so that your viewers can see the best of your videos back to back without having to select one by one.

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can, but don\u2019t expect it to be easy. You see, most websites that sell YouTube watch hours are pure scams and frauds. And they use Bots to give fake watch hours which only cause troubles later on. For instance, YouTube can easily detect that the views you are receiving are coming from one IP address and at a one go. So they will flag your channel for suspicious activity. And when you request them later on for activating the Monetization feature, your request will be denied. So buying YouTube watch hours is not easy given that there\u2019s a good chance for you to be scammed and end up causing damage to your channel. So be careful when you buy Watch hours. One website, however, which I can recommend you here for buying real and safe watch hours or views is #InstantViews They use an amazing strategy for driving views to their clients videos, and it is Incentivising people for watching their clients\u2019 videos. InstantViews has couple of large networks and partnered groups filled with hundreds of active Instagram users. And when you contact InstantViews for views or likes, they will simply promote your channel to those groups and incentivize different people for giving real and genuine interaction to your videos. So for safe, authentic, and of course, premium views, you can try out InstantViews. They have affordable packages as well, so I think their services will fit both your taste and budget. Hope this helps Cheers\u2026 ",

But I can\u2019t guarantee you will get monetization enable, because it is really depending on your content and Google decision. Using good quality content on your videos. Your content should be useful, original and the videos should be have meaning. Better have at least one video have long time more than 2 hours. One of the most reliable places to buy the Youtube watch-time is EazyViral, you can google it and buy watch hours from this website. ",
