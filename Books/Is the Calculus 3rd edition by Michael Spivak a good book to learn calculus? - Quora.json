            "answer_text": "Spivak's calculus is a great text to read after you already know calculus and want to get in-depth with the theory of everything. It's a terrible choice though if you're just learning the subject for the first time. The exercises are often extremely challenging to the point of being unsolvable by many students working alone. You need a gentler introduction to calculus. I would say get \u201ccalculus made easy\u201d by Sylvanus Thompson. Then go for Serge Lang's \u201cShort Calculus\u201d followed by his \u201cA Second Course in Calculus.\u201d At this point you would be ready to give Spivak's text a try. ",

There is not much difference between 3rd and 4th edition, so the answer is YES! ",
