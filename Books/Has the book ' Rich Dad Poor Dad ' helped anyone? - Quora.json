            "answer_text": "It has helped me a lot! A lot of people who diss Robert Kiyosaki are people who see Rich Dad Poor Dad as a get rich quick book. I see it as a book that increases your financial IQ. Two of the most valuable lessons I learnt in the book are: Lesson #1: \u201cBuy assets, not liabilities.\u201d That one sentence alone will change your life. Here is a question. Do you know a 100% guaranteed method to become poor and stay poor and 90% of people around you are actually doing it? . . . . Answer = Keep spending a big chunk of your income on liabilities. Most people can spend 50% of their post-tax income on 80\u2033 TVs, iPhone 18s and that new Audi on a 5-year loan but only allocate 5\u201310% to investments. It is not rocket science but it is not common sense too. How many of the people around you are spending more of their money on liabilities than assets? Lesson #2: Not all millionaires are created equal. One of the quotes that Robert said that he received a lot of criticism for is \u201cYour house is not an asset.\u201d A millionaire is nothing special today. Just search questions on Quora regarding networth and you will find a lot of Quorans are millionaires. However, the majority of their networth is in their homes. Here is an example of two fictional millionaires, Bob and Kate: Millionaire #1: Bob owns a $1,000,000 house fully paid off. No mortgage.Millionaire #2: Kate has an investment portfolio worth $1,000,000 which pays her $80,000 per year.Both are millionaires. BUT\u2026 What happens if Bob stops working? Bob still needs to work because his house doesn\u2019t produce any income. What happens if Kate stops working? Kate doesn\u2019t need to work. She has an asset that pays her $80,000 per year. Who do you want to be? Bob or Kate? Lesson #1: \u201cBuy assets not liabilities.\u201d Lesson #2: \u201cNot all millionaires are created equal.\u201d COVID-19 Update During COVID-19, you can start to see the importance of the two lessons in this post. Lesson #1: \u201cBuy assets, not liabilities.\u201dLesson #2: Not all millionaires are created equal.Unemployment is going through the roof. The millionaires with a $1m house still needs a job to pay for their living expenses whereas the millionaires with real assets that are cash flowing can get through these tough times. What do you think will happen to the millionaires with the $1m house and no job? The millionaires with the $1m house isn\u2019t financial independent whereas the millionaires with real cash flowing assets are the ones who are truly financial independent. ",

Robert Kiyosaki dives into assets and liabilities in the book with lots of life stories, simple explanations about finances, and bring a new perspective into the people of the corporate to see behind counters how the rich gets their income. Let me tell you, I was surprised and also inspired. I even made an animated book review on YouTube summarizing the important points of the book like what is assets and liabilities. Feel free to check it out! ->  So short answer, yes. I found new ways to make multiple assets that\u2019s been helping me financially that I wouldn\u2019t really known to do otherwise if I hadn\u2019t actually read this book. ",
