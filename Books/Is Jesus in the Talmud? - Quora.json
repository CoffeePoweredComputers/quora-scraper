            "answer_text": "That depends if you believe Yeshua ben Panthera or Yeshua ha Notzri are Jesus. Both figures have alleged similarities. Yeshua ha Notzri is probably not Jesus because he died under the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus, and died by hanging on the eve of the Passover. The Sanhedrin handed down the sentence because they still had that authority then. Yeshua ben Panthera has been alleged as being Jesus by two sources I\u2019m aware of. Origen claims Celsus said they were the same, and the Toldeth Jeshu a Jewish work agrees. There is one telling similarity in that Yeshua ben Panthera\u2019s parentage was doubtful. Celsus and the Toldeth Jeshu both say he was the son of a Roman soldier. What makes them being the same doubtful is if you accept the virtuous portrait of Jesus in the gospels to any degree. The Talmud claims Yeshua ben Panthera knowingly and (somewhat like a troll) playfully tried to get Jews to engage in idolatry. As though he were just a troublemaker engaged in a playful past time. It is alleged that the Rabbi that taught Panthera Judaism said that he hung up a brick in a crowded place and encouraged Jews to worship it. Jesus might be the same as any of the many \u2018Yeshua personages\u2019 from the first century. ",

            "answer_text": "No. He is not in the Talmud at all though many try to claim he is and that itnis to insult him. Sometimes this goes as far as claiming that others referred to are actually him such as claiming a reference to Bilaam is actually Jesus! Too bad for those trying to claim this that Bilaam is actually discussed in Judaism and brought in the Torah and Jesus is not! Then there are two people that some like to claim are Jesus. The problem is that based on the people involved they lived either a century before or a century after Jesus. S those trying to claim that the Talmud proves Jesus existed by citing these examples are also claiming the Christian gospels are wrong! ",
