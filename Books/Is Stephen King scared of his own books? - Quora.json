            "answer_text": "When Stephen King was asked in an interview why he chose to always write the types of books that he does, he answered: \u2018What makes you think I have a choice? Maybe he isn\u2019t necessarily scared of his own books, but rather uses them as an outlet for the demons he houses in his mind. Maybe his imagination scares him? Writing his fears into a book could be a good way to confront them and overcome them. One thing is certain though - a strong writer will write for his reader instead of for himself. On that note, Carl Jung said of art: \u201cWhat is essential in a work of art, is that it should rise far above the realm of personal life, and speak instead from the spirit and heart of the poet, to the spirit and heart of mankind.\u201d So his first objective would hopefully be to scare his reader, regardless of if he himself is scared.
