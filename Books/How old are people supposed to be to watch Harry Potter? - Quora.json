            "answer_text": "I think the age appropriate level is completely dependant upon the child. I have three kids who all saw movies 1 through 5 together at home with my husband and I, then 6 through 8 in the theaters, again with us. All of the more sensitive or frightening situations had been discussed by the fall after the final movie, when my daughter began to read the series at the age of 9 in 4th grade. She took her time with each book and finished them over the course of a school year as part of her required reading logs (the previous year she had done the same with A Series of Unfortunate Events, so she had some experience with series reading). As she finished each book, she passed them to her older brother who was a grade above her They both were able to follow the story as it progressed and truly got how everything fit together, especially the parts that differed from the films. My youngest son who was a very strong reader, borrowed the books and tackled the entire series that following summer at the age of 8 before going into 3rd grade. It was the first time he had read a series, and I noticed that he didn\u2019t seem to recall the smaller nuances as the story progressed, and when we discussed each book as he finished it, he didnt recall all the details from previous books that helped make the recent book clearer. This could have been because it was his first series, or because the books were a little more complex than the books he was used to at the time. Happily, he has since re-read them and can carry his own weight when Harry Potter discussions erupt in my house, which is probably more often than the average family. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on the child. If your child is fearless or generally does not get scared, then they can watch them in any age and vice versa: The first 3 movies are PG but all 3 have some pretty dark and creepy moments especially the 3rd one. I was personally never frightened by them but some kids would be. I\u2019d say kids at the age of 7 can watch those 3 movies but I think they should be accompanied by adults. Now, it all depends on the child and what scares them or not but overall, while the 3 movies have some creepy and frightening moments, it\u2019s not that frightening but I still suggest parental guidance for kids between 7 and 10. The 4th, 5th, 6th (it\u2019s PG but I really don\u2019t know why. It should be PG-13), 7th and 8th one are all PG-13 but it\u2019s not violent PG-13. It\u2019s on the lower end. I watched them when I was 9 or 10 and I was never frightened by them but I\u2019d say 9 is the minimum age. The 4th movie does contain quite a bit of violence and action and stuff to do with romance. The 5th also has violence and deals with anxiety and corruption. The 6th one deals with romance a lot and there are some pretty violent moments throughout. The 7th and 8th one also has a lot of action, violence and some very sunsettling scenes here and there. I was never bothered by them but some will definitely be. I\u2019d say people at the age of 9 or 10 should watch these movies with parental guidance. ",
