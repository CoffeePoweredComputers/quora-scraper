If your app didn\u2019t pick it up automatically, you can use the drop-down to send it to the Cloud or wherever is available. All physical reader devices should be registered with Amazon. I have Kindles, cell phones with the app, computers with the app, and pads with the app all registered as my devices at Amazon. The ebooks show up almost automatically if you have a registered Kindle device. I have to keep removing my husband\u2019s military SF books from my Fire. He gets a lot of freebies to check them out. I don\u2019t know how many he actually reads. ",
