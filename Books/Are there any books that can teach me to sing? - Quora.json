            "answer_text": "There are many books that claim to be able to teach you to sing. Do not read these books. They lie. There is one book that claims NOT to be able to teach you to sing, (On Studying Singing by Sergius Kagen) but it actually teaches you quite a lot: How to determine if you would benefit from lessons (i.e. do you have a fair amount of talent) When to go for lessons How to practice. This book is over fifty years old, and probably out of print. Do not buy it on Amazon, even if they have it. Go to your local library, and have them get it for you (an interlibrary loan). You only have to read it once. ",

            "answer_text": "So I have a masters degree in vocal performance so I defiantly have credentials. There are books on how to sing but alone they can not help you. If you wanna learn to sing get a voice teacher. The main reason you need a voice teacher is because you can't hear yourself. You can record yourself singing but would you be able to listen and hear what you are doing incorrectly and know how to fix it? That's why you need a voice teacher. It also helps to listen to good singers and try to model their technique. ",

However, if you like to read and want excellent technical information and useful exercises, Richard Miller\u2019s The Structure of Singing is fantastic. Available on Amazon, but expensive. Check it out of the library. ",
