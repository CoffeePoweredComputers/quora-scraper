            "answer_text": "I don't think any type of reference books are needed if you have ALLEN DLP. It almost covers all kind of questions and fundamental things asked in NEET. You should also join ALLEN test series for practice and self analysis. You will get good competition through this test series which is necessary for a better result. Still for the MCQ practice based on the questions of NCERT you should prefer MTG's book for biology and Tata McGraw hill's book for chemistry H.C. Verma for physics to clear the conceptual basis of physics. ",

Rather than examples as given in the biology modules. For chem n physics, solve the question at the back of each chapter. There are many concepts which are not given in ncert but are there in the modules. In such situations try to learn only such concepts which have been used more frequently in the questions. All the best!!! ",
