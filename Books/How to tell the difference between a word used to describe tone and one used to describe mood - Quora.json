            "answer_text": "It really depends on what you mean by \u201ctone\u201d and \u201cmood.\u201d See, in literature, we talk about tone as the writer\u2019s attitude toward a subject and the mood as how we are \u201cmade to feel\u201d as readers. Your question was: How do I tell the difference between a word used to describe tone and one used to describe mood? In this situation, you CAN\u2019T. From the writer\u2019s perspective, the only thing they can \u201ctechnically\u201d do is to write with whatever attitude, whatever opinion they have of the subject matter. They can\u2019t write as anything other than themselves. Even if the writer wrote something because he was trying to make you feel a certain way, it would still be considered tone because he may not have succeeded. Essentially, the mood isn\u2019t determined when the writer writes; it\u2019s determined when the reader reads. That\u2019s my take, anyway. It\u2019s a very interesting question; thanks for requesting my answer. Good luck on your English endeavours! ",

            "answer_text": "Tone and mood are different things, but the same words can describe them. So it\u2019s all about context. Tone comes from the writer, mood describes the reader. Whatever you\u2019re reading, just remember: Tone went in, mood comes out. Sometimes, the same word can describe both. If someone is sad about what they\u2019re writing about (their tone), hopefully they can convey that sadness to the reader (their mood). ",
