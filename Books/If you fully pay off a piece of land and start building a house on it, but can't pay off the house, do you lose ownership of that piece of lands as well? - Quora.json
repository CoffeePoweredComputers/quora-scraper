            "answer_text": "Yes, the only exception, is if the land is owned by an entity which is separate from the entity who has the mortgage obligation. The smart thing, if you can do it, is to divide part of the land away into a separate ownership. Use part of the money to build a small free and clear house on that land. This way if you lose the first house, you can move into the 2nd house, which does not have any mortgage. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the loan you took for the house. Was the land part of the security? If so, yes, you\u2019ll lose it. But if you took out a personal loan for the \u2018improvement\u2019 of a house, possibly not. I suppose it\u2019s even possible you got a loan for which the house is security but the land is not, but I must admit I\u2019ve never seen such a thing. ",
