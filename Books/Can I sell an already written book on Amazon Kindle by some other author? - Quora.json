            "answer_text": "The only scenario where this is possible, as far as I can see, is if the author has for some reason appointed you a representative. In such a case, you can sell his or her book after discussing it with him or her and drawing up some legal agreement. However this is someone else\u2019s work. So, if the above is not true, you can\u2019t sell it. In other words, if your question is \u201cCan I make money on Amazon by selling a book written by someone else?\u201d, the answer is a strict NO. You will find yourself in all sorts of legal entanglements, and perhaps rightly so. On the other hand if your question is \u201cI\u2019ve purchased a kindle edition of a book by an author, and can I sell it to someone else?\u201d, again the answer is NO. However Amazon allows lending of a sort; you can lend books using KOLL (and the decision on whether lending can be done or not is up to the author who published it on KDP, not you). You will not be making any money of this. Note: I am not an Amazon representative, but I know enough of the rules to be sure of the answers above. ",

Putting up public domain material is against Amazon's terms of service (although you can add your own content to make it a new work, such as copies of Shakespeare's plays that have notes on what the older words mean) ",

However, there are lot of books that are copyright free. You can publish them on kindle, but only after mentioning the original author name/s. A few examples of such books are The Power of your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill etc. ",
