            "answer_text": "Whilst Bram Stoker wrote the novel Dracula, and he derived a lot of material from the legends associated with Vlad the Impaler, he combined those legends with literary material about vampires that had been extent in literature since at least the 1820s. Stoker clearly did not invent the historical person Vlad Dracul, but we can go along with the fact that the fictional character Dracula was his invention. Stories about werewolves show up through antiquity, but the appearance of the werewolf as a creature of demonic evil and violence shows up in the mid-19th century. Some examples are in Frederick Marryat\u2019s The Phantom Ship (1839) and G. W. M. Reynolds\u2019 tacky gothic, Wagner the Wehr-Wolf (1846). The idea of the mummy was derived from Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s story, \u201cThe Ring of Thoth\u201d (1890). The 1932 movie was also inspired by the discovery of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb, and the rumours about curses attached to the discovery. The Invisible Man is, fairly clearly, from H. G. Wells\u2019 novel, The Invisible Man (1897). As for the Creature from the Black Lagoon, that was invented by American film writer Maurice Zimm. I always suspected it might have been somewhat suggested to him by the Deep Ones of H. P. Lovecraft, but the resemblance is very very slight at best. In summary, stories about vampires and werewolves go far back in European folklore, and such tales predate Stoker\u2019s novel, as well as the gothics like that of Reynolds. Werewolf - Wikipedia Vampire - Wikipedia Corwyn Berthier's answer to Did vampires exist in literature and popular culture before \"Dracula\"? The mummy ideas came partly out of Egyptian myth and folklore combined with current events. The Creature seems to be a Hollywood bogeyman. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say Bram Stoker \u201ccreated\u201d Dracula. He was an established Irish writer who was traveling in Transylvania. I imagine he bought the locals some brew in a pub and said, \u201cGot any good stories?\u201d The locals then told him about Vlad Dracul, who used to live \u201cup in that castle\u201d (now a ruin) and saved us from the Turks but was said to be a vampire. A what? So they talked about his supernatural powers and such. Also, the locals practiced that weird thing where they would occasionally open old coffins and make sure the dead were resting comfortably, or whatever. (Iroquois Indians did the same thing every seven years.) And usually the bodies had atrophied, but sometimes they found a body intact (because no oxygen got in), so they had to stake the heart. (Also happened in Rhode Island in Colonial America.) Which adds to the legend of the undead. Stoker went home, consolidated all the legends, renamed him \u201cDracula\u201d (with an A) and had him shipwreck in England to start a reign of terror. So not so much \u201ccreated\u201d Dracula as \u201csynthesized a bunch of cool stories, then added further adventures\u201d. ",
