            "answer_text": "Wondering if you\u2019re asking about the Coppola film, which I dislike intensely and which may have had a different escape \u2014 can\u2019t remember. In the novel, Harker has seen the Count climbing almost insect-like on the walls of the castle and down a steep cliff. He also notices that the Count is wearing his, Harker\u2019s, clothes, probably to build up evidence that Harker himself has left the castle. Harker made several failed attempts to post letters, or give letters to the local peasants, or enlist their help in some way. The Count has forced Harker to write three letters to his employer in London, saying all is well. The last letter says Harker has set out for home. This date is, Harker realizes, the date that the Count will kill him. So in the daylight hours left to him, Harker sets out for the Count\u2019s lair, which he had found before. He finds the Count paralyzed but more robust from a recent feed, and strikes him a glancing blow with a shovel. Then Harker prepares to make the hazardous climb to freedom, and Stoker leaves us wondering whether he makes it, until a later chapter. ",

There were indentations between the stones on the exterior walls of the castle, and he was able to crawl down the walls after Count Dracula left for England.
