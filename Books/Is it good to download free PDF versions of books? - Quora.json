            "answer_text": "Some authors and some publishers will give away pdfs in order to create buzz, or as a teaser for other products. If you\u2019re getting the books that way, then it\u2019s fine. Some libraries will lend ebooks (although pdf formats are rare for ebooks \u2014 the format just doesn\u2019t work well for ebooks), and those are legally purchased, and only one copy exists at a time within the lending software, so that\u2019s legal, too. BUT if you\u2019re talking about \u201cshared\u201d ebooks, then that\u2019s stealing. There is only one way for most authors and publishers to support their effort in creating the book. That involves the control over the right to make copies. Piracy removes that control, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re really stealing \u2014 their ability to make a living from the work you obviously want (or want enough to bother finding, stealing, and reading it). There are some folks out there who have believe that paying for books is somehow unethical. Their logic has always seemed to me to be based upon egregiously false assumptions. If you think that writing for pay (or publishing that writing) is somehow wrong, the solution is to boycott those books, not to steal them. It\u2019s the same way with all products that you feel are ethically challenged. You don\u2019t buy them, but you also don\u2019t steal them. ",
