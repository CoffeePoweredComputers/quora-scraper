            "answer_text": "It most certainly is. Many people have got stranded or lost in the Australian outback over the years, and unfortunately many of them died. Approximately 40 people per year die in the outback. A large proportion of them are tourists who were unaware of how dangerous the outback can be. The temperatures can reach close to 50\u00b0C in places at certain times of the year. So the key is to be prepared. Carry enough water for at least a week, count on a bare minimum of two litres per day drinking water, more is better. Carry a PLB (personal locator beacon) with you. The actual list is much bigger but those two things are crucial. And the number one rule is, if you are stranded, never, ever leave your vehicle. Your vehicle can be seen from the air very easily, you cannot. You cannot walk more than a few kilometres in a day and you cannot carry enough water. If you leave your vehicle your chances of survival are extremely small. Almost every report I have heard says that the vehicle was found in a day or two and then the bodies are found a few kilometres away several days later. Here is a good article: Australian Outback Survival ",

            "answer_text": "My first anthropology teacher (Dr. Larry L. Leach) went to Africa to do his dissertation research. There was construction on the Niger River. But some how he fell into that polluted river. Later (how much later I don\u2019t remember) he was fished out of the river by the Fulani. (Pastoralists). The Fulani nursed him back to health (he still had contracted liver flukes from his time in the Niger). Their medicine was cows milk mixed with cows urine. I still remember him standing in the hall of the Social Science building - a tall 6ft 7\u2033 guy, with one leg elevated -resting on the inside of the opposite legs knee. (This stance is characteristic of the Fulani). When I got to San Diego, I had the good fortune to be assigned as one of Dr. Leach\u2019s T.A.s. Needless to say, I learned a lot more about anthropology, than one usually gets from just studying text books. I learned, if possible do not fall in the river! ",
