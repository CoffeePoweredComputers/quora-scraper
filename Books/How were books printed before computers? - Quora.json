            "answer_text": "Well, how far back do you want to go? A long time ago, all books were handwritten. Then the printing press was invented. The earliest printing presses used printing blocks carved from wood or etched from metal, with each block being for one particular page of a book.  Next came movable type, where individual letters or characters were carved, and these were held in place in a framework for printing:  (If you magnify or look carefully, you can see each letter is on its own block.) Then came the rotary press, where pages were on rollers instead of plates, allowing sheets to be fed through at a much faster rate, as machine power could rotate the rollers, feeding pages through and continuously re-inking. Next came optical typesetting systems, where a page mock-up would be created, then photographed, and the photograph would be used to create the printing plates. Type in some cases came as letters attached to a clear surface, and would be \u201cpunched\u201d onto a clear strip to create headlines and such:  These would be placed onto paper, often with guidelines and such printed or drawn in what was called \u201cnon-photo blue\u201d, a shade of blue which the cameras used would ignore. Of course, making full-color prints required somewhat different techniques. ",
