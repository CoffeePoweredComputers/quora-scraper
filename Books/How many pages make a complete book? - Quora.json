            "answer_text": "My thoughts on this are not very popular, but I believe the answer is what my Advanced Writing teacher told me about paper length and I think that extends to books and novels as well. \u201cIt should me no shorter or longer than it has to be.\u201d A lot of people say 300 pages, but for some books, that is way too long, as in they shouldn't be books at all but maybe short stories or novellas. If it\u2019s a writer I love, like Stephen King, I feel like the answer is \u201cthe longer the better.\u201d Although there have been a few books of his I wasn\u2019t crazy about, Under The Dome being the one that comes to mind. I liked the premise of the book, but it didn\u2019t really go anywhere for me. And as some have said, Stephen King would probably get a 2.7 from the east German judge because his dismounts or endings can be not so great. But, for the most part, the joy is in the journey. Right now I am rereading his Wolves of the Calla which weighs in at 246,605 words. I think that is right fine as a novel length, but for me over the years it\u2019s more about the experience than it is about \u201cfinishing\u201d it. Once you finish your book or novel, and get a reader or two, they will tell you if it\u2019s too long or short. For me, more often, if I don\u2019t like the premise of the story or it lacks cohesion,it\u2019s difficult to read no matter what length it is. If the story is interesting to me, then it can never be too long. ",

            "answer_text": "In NaNoWriMo they recommend 180 pgs since that counts as a novel (but there are novels shorter than that out there including The Time Machine by H. G. Wells). But like average book length is like 200\u2013300, but I\u2019ve read a lot of YA so depending on what genre you mean that might be lower or higher. Also, the font and size of text matter so it could be lower. I prefer books where the height isn\u2019t too tall since it\u2019s annoying to hold and to put in my smaller bags. Tiny books are also not ideal since the font can be hard to read in more dark places or at night\u2026. So it depends. Ideally, it matters that the content is good, the page count only matters if you realize that you add unnecessary detail or the world-building is just basically dumped on you in the intro and not spread out throughout the book in a more easily accessible way. If you don\u2019t describe enough it can also be a problem since it might leave out key point about what the characters think\u2026. so make sure that the book is easy to read and don\u2019t worry so much on page count. Some people like me love big books, others like shorter novels, it\u2019s all just a matter of taste. Plus those that like certain genres are bound to flock to read your book. ",
