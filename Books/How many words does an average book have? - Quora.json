            "answer_text": "By book do you mean novel or non-fiction? Novels in general are anything over 59k. Novel length depends a lot on genre. YA novels are rarely over 75k, historical novels go up to 120k, ditto speculative fiction. Mysteries really vary by sub-genre. Cozies rarely exceed 70k, while thrillers can go to 120k. Romances also vary from Harlequin types up to 75k and category romances (romantic suspense, historical romance, paranormal romance etc going up to 100k) None of these rules are fixed. But an unpublished author is better off erring on the side of shorter. Even Stephen King, though he had some fame already, had to cut The Stand by 400 pages or around a 100k the first time it was published because it was deemed too big. The original Lord of the Rings was meant to be a single volume. The publisher insisted it be broken into 3 volumes. I've heard some rumors that readers want shorter books these days. I personally still like large ones but then I also prefer real books to electronic or audio ones though I do have and use a Kindle account. Non-fiction is another kettle of fish and I'm not really qualified to respond since I don't write it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, word count varies across the genres, but 40k is considered being a novel. They are generally higher than that, depending on the genre you are writing. The average length sits between 50k to 70k. Below is a brief list of average word counts for different genres (general guidelines if you want to traditionally publish): Young adult: 55k to 70k Mystery: 75k to 100k Thriller: 90k to 100k Memoir: 80k to 90k Western: 45k to 75k Non-fiction: 50k to 75k Some genres allow for higher word counts, for example, fantasy. There is a lot of worldbuilding in those types of stories compared to a western novel. ",
