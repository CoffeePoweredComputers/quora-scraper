            "answer_text": "Before I start, here is a picture of 38 year old Harry that I found to be very accurate to the description in the books. Age him down and remove the beard. I know Jo has said the film cast was too attractive for her idea of the characters, but Jo often exaggerates in her shrewdness.  Harry is often described as being very skinny and pale. And in the first few years of his education at Hogwarts, he probably wasn't very attractive. But as so many have stated, he had unusually bright green eyes, described even as \u201cstartlingly green\u2026\u201d Eyes are one of the most prominent features of the human body. He had untidy black hair that stuck up in the back and was untameable. He had a narrow face and straight nose that was just shorter than James'. Later, in the books, Harry grows quite a bit and is theorized to be around 5\u203211. He spends a great amount of time playing quidditch, so I would guess he had a lean build by the time he was 14 (Yes, \u201cQuidditch toned muscles\u201d would be a thing considering all of the work your core would have to do.) He also appears to be able to eat whatever he wants and gain very little weight. It's been pointed out that the Dursley's don't actually starve Harry, he just isn't allowed to eat as much as he would like or as much as Dudley. But the times he is denied food are very rare. Harry is small and skinny in the beginning because that's genetics. He and James are both skinny. Let's go back to his parents. Both Lily and James are described as being very attractive. Both were very appealing and popular in school. Harry is always described as looking almost exactly like James aside from the aforementioned nose length and James' hazel eyes. Add to this, Lily and James were both extremely confident and even defiant. From the very beginning, Harry seems to share this attitude, even when he has been beat down emotionally, mentally, and (to a small degree) physically. He still manages to retort and talk back to the Dursleys, despite knowing that he may be punished. Funnily, there a many times when he can't seem to hold his tongue. But I digress. Confidence is a key factor to being attractive. It seems to transcend the physical appearance. The Potters were both held in very, very high regard by not only their peers, but also their teachers. James was extremely popular with the student body despite randomly hexing those that annoyed him in the halls. Despite his pranks, he was respected by his peers. An aside, this has always been an indicator to me that James was not nearly as bad as some have made him out to be. But that's another topic. Lily was adored by Slughorn over even his select collection. Both were described as Minerva McGonagall\u2019s \u201call-time favorite students\u2026\u201d And James (I assume Lily as well though she is not mentioned) was also close to Dumbledore. All this is to say that personality wise, the Potters, including Harry, were seen as confident (if not arrogant), funny, intelligent, and firm in their convictions. Anyways, I've droned on for too long, but that's because I really admire them as a family. But in summation, in his early years, Harry was probably a bit sad in appearance. But by the time he is 14, he is being actively pursued by girls, at least one of which was a sixth year. Edit: I'm in the middle of a reread right now but I've noticed a few additional details and some things I just forgot to mention. First being that all of the girls that Harry goes out with during his time at school are all considered \u201cvery popular\u201d and the even, \u201c\u2026 the best looking in our year..\u201d Parvati is actually Harry's type, at least physically. Harry likes girls shorter than him that are athletic and have very long, straight, shiny hair. And Parvati has all of those traits and Dean and Seamus seem to think very highly of her as well to call her and Padma the best looking in their year. We all know how popular Cho and Ginny are too. Cho dates what.. like four different guys in the last three years and Ginny three? And Harry has made both of them blush quite frequently. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Harry Potter is supposed to be attractive. He looks like James, his dad, who was good-looking, so Harry is handsome. Plus he has his mum\u2019s eyes, so Harry is basically a tallish, thin guy with thick black hair that is untidy (which is actually very in-style these days) and a good strong face with almond-shaped green eyes.  (I like Eleanor Tomlinson as Lily. These two are closer to what Lily and James would look like, but not quite\u2026..) That put together is a good-looking guy. He still has a lightning bolt scar on his forehead, but people have tattoos of such things inked on their faces, so maybe he could do that. The books talk about James knowing how good he looked. He\u2019d ruffle his hair while trying to get Lily to notice him. Both Lily and James were popular too, so they have decent personalities especially once they outgrew their childish ways, mainly James bullying Snape. The confidence this beautiful couple had, made people gravitate toward them.  (Yup, this works. Just put in Elanor Tomlinson and that\u2019s Harry\u2019s parents. Very much so.)  (There she is! Though Elanor Tomlinson could have been Ginny too\u2026) Don\u2019t forget that it wasn\u2019t just Harry who had an athletic build, so did his father. James played Quidditch too, which means he enjoyed sports and had to have the body to go with it. James would have been coordinated and quick; all characteristics of a good-looking person in general. The people who are clumsy and bumb into things usually aren\u2019t not in sports, because of their innate inability to be coordinated. Generally speaking.  (Black hair and then this guy is Harry.) I don\u2019t pay attention to what JK Rowling says anymore. I cannot keep up. I just follow the books and what they say. Harry has a lot of girls wanting to date him, so it can\u2019t just be his celebrity status that pulls the girls in. Cho went out with the Tri-Wizard Champion from Hogwarts (the one the Goblet chose first besides Harry), Cedric Diggory and he was very athletic, handsome and popular. Cho Chang has a particular taste in guys, and she dates Harry so it\u2019s inferred that he\u2019s good-looking. Harry doesn\u2019t have the conceit of his father, though, and it only makes Harry more appealing. He\u2019s the handsome guy who really doesn\u2019t know it. Did Aunt Petunia tell him what a cute boy he was? Who told him these things? Harry looked in the mirror and saw cowlicks in his hair and that damned scar and probably focused on the negatives. So many teens do that. Most.  (He works. I think Harry is this handsome.) Even truly stunning looking people have no clue. They think they\u2019re ugly. And good-looking girls so often think they are gangly, too flat-chested and hate their hair. Most teen girls feel that way. Harry\u2019s being oblivious to how good he looks, just makes him that much more appealing. He has a certain sarcasm about him too, so if a girl \u201cgets it\u201d, she\u2019ll want to be around him even more.  (Yes?) Danial Radcliffe turned out to be short. Harry Potter wasn\u2019t short; his dad certainly wasn\u2019t. We can\u2019t just look at Radcliffe and decide he\u2019s the perfect Harry Potter. I like Radcliffe and his portrayal, but he should have been a lot taller. (I get it for casting purposes, but still I wish the casting director had checked the height of Radcliffe\u2019s parents, because Daniel is shorter than Ginny and Ron.) No way is Harry shorter than Ginny. That\u2019s never written in the books. I like some of the images I come across of other\u2019s renditions of what a truly younger and better looking James and Lily Potter looked like. I\u2019ll try to find them, since I think they are a stunningly handsome couple, and people are taken aback by how beautiful they are. We know James would want the best girl in Hogwarts, and that\u2019s Lily, so I\u2019ll try to find some good images of the couple.  I love Elanor Tomlinson as Lily Evans Potter\u2026. ",
