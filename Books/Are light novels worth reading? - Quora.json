            "answer_text": "Oh yeah definitely, one thing you must know is LN is the original source for many anime/manga. So, basically when you read LN, you get the complete story unlike anime where they omit some parts due to less screen time. LN are fairly small, one volume is usually 180\u2013200 pages and are far far ahead of the story going on in the anime. Many popular anime such as Sword Art Online, Highschool DxD, Chivalry of a failed Knight, Irregular at magic high school, baccano, Fate/zero, Durarara, Golden Time, No game no life, My Teen Romcom SNAFU, Date a live etc were originally LN. My favourite LN are Highschool DxD and Chivalry of a failed Night. Highschool DxD currently has 21 volumes and the 3 anime seasons cover only first 7 volumes. ",

            "answer_text": "I started reading Light Novels a couple of years ago, and right now they are primarily what I read. Not sure when the transition happened, but it did, and I don\u2019t regret it at all. They cover a large range of genres, are an easy read, and I find myself enjoying them far more than I do other novels. I do like how they become anime, though I find that I still prefer reading the LNs over the animes as they often don\u2019t live up to the hype of the book, though in some cases the animes are actually better because they streamline things.Anyway, I think they are totally worth reading!

            "answer_text": "Novels being light or hard is highly relative. I know people who find it hard to read some quite simple books (like those of the Indian auhor Chetan Bhagat), while there are many others who can easily read some comparatively harder ones. If you deem reading as a hobby, you may go for the light ones. Anyway, who wants to put in some hard work on a hobby.(again relative). ",
