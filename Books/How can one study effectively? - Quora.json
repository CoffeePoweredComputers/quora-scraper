            "answer_text": "I see most answers here about environment and timings and breaks, but I wanted to mention something else. I want to tell you about how to optimize the text you\u2019re reading. Disclaimer: NOT APPLICABLE FOR MATHEMATICS AND SIMILAR SUBJECTS. ONLY USEFUL FOR ENGLISH, SCIENCE, SOCIAL SCIENCE AND SIMILAR KINDS. Now that the disclaimer\u2019s out of the way, let me tell you to what we\u2019ll require. Requirements: Pen/ Pencil, a notebook, study material. The text I\u2019ll be using to explain to you my trick is from my Science textbook, under the Biology section in the chapter \u201cConservation of Animal and Plants\u201d.  I want you read the text bracketed in red. (word count: approx. 89 words) It\u2019s a huge text right? Paradoxically, the definition of \u201cdesertification\u201d isn\u2019t even given here clearly. I know it might be in the glossary section, but why not mention it properly here? Now let\u2019s make adjustments to this very text. You can try first. Did you try? Did it work? Did it shorten the text without removing the important points?Well if you\u2019re answer to all these questions is \u201cYes\u201d, then bingo! But if your answer is \u201cNo\u201d, then let me help you out. Soil erosion: takes place when trees and grasses are absent which causes it to get exposed to Sun\u2019s heat, which causes the moisture in it to dry up, the nutrients to evaporate and the bacteria needed for the breakdown to form humus gets affected. The rain then washes away it and causes soil erosion. It makes the land infertile and exposes the rocky surface. This is also known as desertification. (word count: approx. 70 words) Now, what if you could do this for all your subjects? You can also remove articles from your modified text, I haven\u2019t due to the fear of the answer getting reported for poor grammar. Make your own notes instead of asking the topper of the class for some of theirs. Their notes are unique to them, and your notes will be unique to you. You can write them in the handwriting which is only legible to you, or make it super organised. I hope this answer will potentially be helpful to you in your exam preparations.
