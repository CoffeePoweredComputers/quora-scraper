            "answer_text": "I would say yes and no, it depends on the sort of books and movies in question. If it\u2019s something immersive, willing to detail a thoughtful idea or concept; then either way it\u2019s fine. But if it\u2019s just an action movie, or a love drama, or some kind of tie-in movie for a toy; then I would be genuinely concerned about your choice of influences. But as I said, so as long as it\u2019s proper, the medium it\u2019s delivered on doesn\u2019t matter much. ",
