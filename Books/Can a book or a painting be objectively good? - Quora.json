            "answer_text": "I really like this question, I was meditating about this the other day. I reached the conclusion that there is a subjunctive bias in almost every piece of art we like. What we like is influenced by our idea of beauty. So it\u2019s very difficult to look at artwork in an objective way. Although, there are some things everyone can recognize as good, these things also live in a inter-subjective network created by the common idea of what\u2019s good or bad, for example, something everyone can appreciate (not necessarily like) is complexity. I\u2019ll leave a link to my medium article about this, if you want you can give it a read, also feel free to pm me, this is a topic I\u2019d love to discuss.

            "answer_text": "Thinking a book is good or a painting beautiful is called opinion and is subjective. An opinion has never been objective and probably never will be because in order for an opinion to be objective, the entire world would have to agree on it and we all know the entire world coming to an agreement on something\u2026 has never happened before.
