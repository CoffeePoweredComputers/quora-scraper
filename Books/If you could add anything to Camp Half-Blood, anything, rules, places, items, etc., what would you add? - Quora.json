            "answer_text": "How about this\u2026. A CITY?! How is it that the Romans had New Rome attached to Camp Jupiter, but the Greeks had\u2026 Nothing? So you train the kids- and then kick them out into the big, bad world? Some of them, like Annabeth and Thalia ran away from home, others like Leo had dead parents and a large number had nowhere to go- that\u2019s why some of them stayed as year-rounders. You take them in and kick them out, to survive on their own? Most people who stay at camp don\u2019t go to school, their entire education is at camp. Do universities accept such students? Does this qualify them for any job in the real world? Unlike New Rome, they don\u2019t have a university. So what will happen when they\u2019ve left, how will they survive in the mortal world? And they\u2019re still in danger from monsters. Camp Half-Blood was the only safe place for demigods, so it was the only place they could relax and let their guard down, technically speaking. And what about the Legacies, then? If the Romans felt the need to take and train descendants of demigods and gods, then surely it must be dangerous for them too? Imagine having two powerful, well-known demigods, like Percy and Annabeth for parents. Why is it that the Greeks, who were a such a great culture and civilisation, so much that the Romans based their own civlisation and culture on much of theirs, are don\u2019t have all that? No watch towers, just trees for look-outs? Cabins only for the children of certain gods? Sleeping on the floors, like their in some temporary shelter after a natural disaster? The Greeks were never less advanced or more barbaric than the Romans. They didn\u2019t need to sleep on floors like in a refugee camp. They had beds, while the Romans actually slept on couches. So why portray the Greek demigods as anything less? Why do Percy and Annabeth have to go all the way to New Rome to study and hopefully retire? There\u2019s New Rome. Where\u2019s New Athens? ",

            "answer_text": "1. I think the rule about cleaning up properly fast when leaving camp or else harpies will eat you is unnecessary. No one must be eaten up by harpies just because they\u2019re slow at cleaning. 2. The whole get the flag game is done in the forest, which is occupied by many, many dangerous creatures like poisonous scorpions and myrmykes, so I would either do the game somewhere else or patrol the forest to remove dangers lurking there. 3. I mean, just taking a random person off a street or a school or something, bringing them to Camp and saying \u2018yo, your daddy\u2019s a greek god and you\u2019re a demigod so we\u2019re gonna train you and stuff so come with us\u2019 is crazy. No one will believe you. So, I WOULD: buy a taxi, whenever the demigod orders a taxi, make sure my taxi is the one he or she orders,and then you can show him a video all about gods and demigods and monsters and blah blah while driving to Camp Half-Blood. Make sense? SO YEAH THOSE ARE 3 CHANGES I WOULD BRING TO CAMP HALF BLOOD I COULD! VIEWS, UPVOTES, AND COMMENTS/REPLIES ARE WELCOME! ",
