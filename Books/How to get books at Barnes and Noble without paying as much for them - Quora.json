            "answer_text": "There are several options: Get the membership and save 10% off, along with using coupons you get in emails (they are sent monthly, if I'm correct, and don't require membership to receive).Ask an employee or manager (they patrol the stores) for a coupon. Normally, they have little paper coupons handy as an incentive for customers to buy more. If they don't have any, don't be rude.Work at Barnes & Noble and get a 30% employee discount (40% on employee appreciation weeks).Buy on the Barnes & Noble website instead, which ships books right from the company rather than from a store. The books online are cheaper since the taxes added onto books in the stores also add a certain amount on the books to help pay employees. So this option is essentially just buying off of the website, which I believe also accepts coupons as well (if it doesn't, my mistake and sincere apologies). A lot of customers complain about why books online are cheaper than in the store and, without getting technical, here's my way of looking at it: the online portion is an entirely different company, if you will, from the store itself, a company not required to make the books cost extra to pay employees and keep the particular store running.Now, how do I know this stuff? What qualifications does this Alberto (please call me Albert, I hate the \u201co\u201d in my name) guy have? I worked at Barnes & Noble, so I know quite a bit about saving money there. I also shop for books frequently and try saving money on them. Hope the answer helped. ",
