            "answer_text": "That\u2019s like asking \u2018how long is a book?\u2019 If you\u2019re writing fiction about a subject you\u2019re au fait with and have an excellent memory for detail, then probably not very long at all, and you\u2019d probably be able to research as you write. Potentially, no longer than it would take to write the actual text. On the other hand, if you wish to write the definitive reference collection on a subject you\u2019re barely familiar with, it may take years just to begin to develop your understanding before deciding your angle, style or putting the content into a coherent library to work from. An accomplished writer can knock out a bestseller in a few weeks. Nora Roberts has published over 200 novels in 35 years, Dame Barbara Cartland averaged one book every 5-6 weeks of her 80-year career. This doesn\u2019t leave a lot of time for research, but when writing from memory, or for a convincing author, not much is needed. On the other hand some books can take 10 years or much more to research. ",
