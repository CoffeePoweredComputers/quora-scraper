            "answer_text": "What the biological environment is, is almost given in the name. Biological stands for everything that is alive, and the environment is where it lives. Biological environments can include any living animal, plant, bacteria, fish, etc. (maybe even Archea?) that is alive. It\u2019s possible that the human factor is also important here, and that the generally accepted definition only includes living factors that affect us humans, in a particular place or period. You can for example refer to the biological environment in a location as opposed to the geographical environment. ",
