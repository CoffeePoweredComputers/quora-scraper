            "answer_text": "Very simple. Using his name as a brand, he employs a number of co-authors. From what I hear, he is deeply involved in plot and character development but leaves the actual writing to his team. Many of them are mentioned on the book covers as well. You\u2019ll find some information on this in his Wikipedia article: James Patterson - Wikipedia This is not as unusual as it may sound. There have been rumors about other authors employing similar strategies, including full-on Ghost Writing. I even know of at least one published, best-selling author, who is entirely fictional and the product of a \u201cwriting factory\u201d: \u201cHans Ulrich Horster\u201d. You\u2019ll find this name on a number of German best-sellers from the Sixties and Seventies - but he doesn\u2019t exist or has ever existed. He was an invention of the editing staff of a TV magazine. By the way: One of my favorites, Philipp Kerr, wrote a satirical thriller on this topic, which may or may not refer to Patterson. It is called \u201cResearch\u201d: Research ",

Patterson is a master at marketing, but I don\u2019t know if he actually writes anything. He knows how to sell books. Probably wrote the Alex Cross series, but the other books are written by people like Maxine Pietro, I strongly suspect. Nobody can write that prolifically. ",
