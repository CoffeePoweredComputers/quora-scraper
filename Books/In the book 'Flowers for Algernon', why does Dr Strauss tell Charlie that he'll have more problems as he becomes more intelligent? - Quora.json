In the beginning Charlie's life is so simple work and go to school and his problems are pretty simple around that. As he gets more intelligent he tries to understand things apart from him more and has relationships and has to try to upkeep them. He understands not just the problems he has today but the problems humanity will have tomorrow. ",
