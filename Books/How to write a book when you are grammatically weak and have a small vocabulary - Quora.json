            "answer_text": "First off, I applaud you for asking this question. It shows that you have a will, and where there\u2019s a will, there is a way. That being said, I won\u2019t water this down, or make it easy on you. A lot of people have good ideas. Having a good idea is one half of the story. In order to make a good idea work, you need to work. And you need to work hard. Here are some preliminary observations for you: Good writing is not an innate talent. Some people have more of a way with words than others, but this is not something you come into the world doing automatically. Language is a learned skill, and while it is easier to learn in the formative years of your life, it can be learned later on.The methods of good writing are hard to define, but they are not mysterious. I say this because writers - and people who admire good writing - often talk like there is something undefinable in good writing. They say this for a good reason: it\u2019s impossible to scientifically define what goes into good prose. You cannot simply study a rule book and learn how to do it (some people tried and failed to: see W.V.O Quine). Nevertheless, like all the arts, writing can be studied, imitated, and learned. There are general good practices and rules which - if followed carefully - will create good prose in time.\u201cGenius is one percent inspiration, ninety nine percent perspiration\u201d - this is a banal platitude. It is a true banal platitude; most banal platitudes are. Your idea may be awesome, but if you really love it, you will work hard to attain it.Humility is a writer\u2019s greatest virtue. Many novice writers like to be innovators; that\u2019s a noble goal. But you cannot break rules unless you first understand how the rules work. Before Bach became a composer, he became proficient in music by listening to performances in his home town, and copying them note for note. You will need to copy before you become good; you will develop your own voice in time.In your specific case: You said you are \u201cgrammatically weak\u201d and possess a \u201csmall vocabulary\u201d. First of all, don\u2019t worry about this at all. Having more words at your disposal can be helpful, but in the end, words are tools in the hands of those who wield them, and you can become a better writer without necessarily learning a tremendous number of words. I will give you two examples: take children\u2019s writers like C.S Lewis, or E.B White. While these authors were highly literary, intelligent people, they wrote in simple ways that children could understand, and still managed to produce classics that are on required reading lists. Second, take Gadsby by Ernest Vincent Wright. This entire novel was written with a rule: no words containing the letter \u2018e\u2019. This was a tremendous limitation which Wright placed on himself, but nevertheless, his prose is highly readable. A critic called it: amazingly smooth. No halting parts. A continuity of plot and almost classic clarity obtains For you to do: Read. You\u2019ve got to read books, and you\u2019ve got to read them often. Don\u2019t think you have to start with the classics - read anything you enjoy reading, because what you enjoy reading is what you\u2019ll enjoy writing. You cannot learn to write if you do not read.Write, every day. Write anything. Write journals, write short stories as they come to your mind, try freewriting if you don\u2019t know what else to do. Force yourself to write even when you don\u2019t want to.Read books about writing. Don\u2019t read a lot of these. Different people will say different things, and it\u2019s best for you to select one or two well known writers and practice what they preach in order to cultivate your style.Here are two resources I highly reccomend. They have exercises for you to do, and advice from well-respected seasoned professionals. They are short, and easy to read, and highly motivating:On Writing: A Memoir of The Craft by Stephen KingThe Art and Craft of Fiction: A Writer's Guide by Michael KardosDo not put your project on hold. If anything deters you from following these isntructions, it\u2019s that you\u2019ll get bogged down in the details. Don\u2019t. Start following this advice. Make a habit, and do it regularly. Work on your book, or story - whatever it is. It\u2019s okay if the first draft sucks: the first draft is always bad. You can revise it as you mature.You asked how to become a better writer. Now you have the answer. This is hard work, but very, very doable work. So get started now! I believe in you! ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How do you write a book when you are grammatically weak and have a small vocabulary? In this case, only two avenues are open to you: 1) you address your weaknesses as a writer, or 2) you write a lousy book. Having said that, opinions vary widely when it comes to literary taste, and one has only to look at the success of Fifty Shades Of Grey to see that literary \u201cbrilliance\u201d is not the only determinant of success. On the one hand, mastery of craft is of unquestionable value to any serious writer. On the other hand clarity, taste, and luck should not be undervalued. One does not need the vocabulary of P. D. James to write a good and successful book, and indeed, the sophistication of her vocabulary undoubtedly drives away whole swathes of the public. Andy Weir\u2019s The Martian is essentially 300 pages of info dump, tied up in snark and service with Disco music. Yet it took him from wannabe to superstar in one, well-earned leap. But beware the great orator, Christopher Hitchens\u2019s line, \u201cI believe everyone has at least on novel in him, and in the great majority of cases, that\u2019s exactly where it should remain.\u201d That\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t try. It\u2019s just that, you shouldn\u2019t try expecting easy success and be crushed when it doesn\u2019t happen. The path is generally more complicated than that. Here\u2019s the thing. Writing is like singing, doing it is easy, but doing it well enough to get paid for it is hard. And doing it well enough to be \u201cgreat?\u201d Well, that requires a perfect storm of fortune, only some of which you can control. Why you want to wright this book? If you want to write to try your hand, fine. If you want to write to record your unique life events\u2026.fine. If you want to write because there is, as David Gerrold says, an itch within you that can\u2019t be scratched any other way\u2026great (God help you, you\u2019re a writer.) But if the answer is because you think it will be the next Harry Potter and allow you to retire from the day job to an estate in the English countryside, I would caution you not to be fooled. Even the best writing with the freshest ideas faces soul-crushing competition from all angles. Writing can be amazingly cathartic, transcendently moving. But it can also be a long slog, alone in a cave of your own making. The loner, alcoholic writer is a stereotype for a reason. So are the many metaphors comparing writing to religious self-flagellation (just sit down in front of the keyboard and open a vein\u2014the act of staring at a blank sheet of paper till drops of blood form on your forehead, etc.).  It\u2019s generally held to take about a million words to achieve professional mastery of the craft. That\u2019s not greatness, that\u2019s competence. And that\u2019s not writing for you and the cat\u2014that\u2019s writing, seeking critique, and improving. Some get their word in growing up. Some pause (for a few years) to do it as an adult. Some fake it and somehow get away with it, but not very many. Some do all that is required and still achieve little. But here\u2019s the thing. I submit that, within the first few tens of thousands of words, if you really want to write, and if you really suffer from deficiencies of grammar and vocabulary that are obstacles to your art, these will quickly become deficiencies you are keenly and internally motivated to rectify. If they aren\u2019t, then perhaps this writing thing isn\u2019t really your shtick. Write because you love to write, because a part of you will die if you don\u2019t, and not because you dream of fame or fortune. Those are occasional, but unreliable side products of the artistic process. But if you decide to give it a go, don\u2019t go it alone. Join online critique groups (or local ones). Take classes. Meet people. Writers are a diverse and interesting lot, and can be pretty cool people to share your life with.  ",
