            "answer_text": "The standard royalty rates for traditionally-published books in the United States: Mass-market paperbacks (the smaller ones): Normally 6%-8% of cover price. There may be an escalator clause so that above a certain number of sales it increases to 10%, and there are certain categories where there\u2019s a small but devoted fandom where royalties only run 4%. Trade paperbacks (the larger ones, also sometimes called \u201cpaperbound\u201d): Normally 7.5% to 12.5%; may go as high as 15% in special circumstances. Hardcovers: Normally 10% to 15%. E-books: 25% to 35%, but this is still in flux. Sometimes royalties are based on receipts, rather than list price, in which case 40% to 50% is possible. But these can vary a lot. By \u201ccover price,\u201d I don\u2019t mean what a reader actually pays; I mean the manufacturer\u2019s recommended retail price. If a retailer discounts a book, that does not usually affect the author\u2019s royalties. There are a couple of exceptions \u2014 some e-book contracts (as mentioned above) are based on receipts, rather than list price; and books sold below the cost of production to clear warehouse space, or because the publisher grossly over-estimated demand and printed too many (sometimes known as \u201cremainders\u201d or \u201coverstock\u201d), don\u2019t pay the author anything at all. So, as an example, if the contract says I get 8% royalties on a $7.95 paperback, I get 64 cents for each copy sold. If it\u2019s a $24.95 hardcover with a 10% royalty, I get $2.50 for each copy sold. You need to sell a lot of books to make decent money. ",

            "answer_text": "Royalty/author profit is the amount one gets on the sale of each book. Royalty might or might not be a direct percentage of the MRP (Maximum Retail Price) of the book. Quite often, I hear this doubt from writers - How much royalty would I get for my book? How much is this royalty amount as compared to what traditional publishers offer? In case of publishing an ebook, one gets royalty as a percentage of the Selling Price one fixes. For example, we have 35% and 70% royalty on the selling price on Kindle. Or say, 45% of the selling price is what you would get on Google Play. Ebooks do not have any upfront cost as in the case of print books \u2013 printing cost, packaging, shipping, etc. The percentage commission of the publishing platform is their margin for facilitating the entire set-up to authors. In the case of printed books, printing costs, packaging, shipping costs are incurred while selling them apart from the commission of the e-commerce platforms that enable online selling of the printed books. So the profit that remains after deducting all these costs goes to the author. This method of calculating royalty is prevalent in self-publishing. In traditional publishing, royalty is a fixed percentage \u2013 say 8% of the MRP. On the basis of the above comparison, I can definitely say that self-published authors receive more royalty as compared to traditionally published authors. If you are looking to self publish your book in that case BecomeShakespeare is the best option to consider. ",
