            "answer_text": "Reading is a good habit.Reading helps you to overcome fear of expression.You gain knowledge of a particular subject by interest,the books on that subject.You wish to read but you said that you get bored after reading  two three lines.It happens.In my opinion you should first start reading articles, short stories, comments or even films review in Weekly newspaper say Sunday editions of newspapers of your own mother tongue.Once you start reading current affairs you will see that you will start taking interest in that subject.If you are interested in sports, lot of books are available.In my case I started reading short stories in Marathi  & Hindi.Reading habit develops day by day.Once you start taking interest you will be in a position to read more than 2 or  3 lines.Reading is such a pleasure,you will realise it after reading good books.Just do not stop here.Start reading in any language of your choice,your mother tongue,Hindi or English. Best wishes. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the problem is you don't want to read like you think you should. That's not how reading takes place. You can only push yourself to read. But unless the topic appeals to you, you won't be able to keep up the same level of enthusiasm that you started out with. I'd suggest that you read books and articles on subjects/ topics you're interested in. That should help you build your reading habit. It's not something that can happen overnight. You'll have to do it over a period of time to make it interesting for yourself. I'm happy you're willing to inculcate it. All the best! ",

Start with something that interests you, instead of forcing yourself to like any random article that get your hands on.Try figuring our your areas of interest. Things that get you curious. Thing that you naturally find intriguing.Start with something lucid. Simple language does not translate to lame content.Also there is no rule as such that expects you to finish every book /article, you start. If you don't follow or lose interest halfway, it is absolutely okay to drop it. ",

If you find yourself disagreeing with the text, read on, instead of tuning out, it will help you formulate your views and opinions on the subject, better. ",
