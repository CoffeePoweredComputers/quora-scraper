            "answer_text": "The author of Revelation was certainly not John the Baptist, who died in 44AD, while the earliest date for the writing of Revelation is around 69AD. As to whether John the Apostle wrote the Gospel, or Revelation, or both : this has been in dispute among scholars for a very long time, and no agreement is likely. Indeed, some scholars claim that the two books were by different authors, neither of whom was the Apostle, and things are further confused when you add in the authorship of the three Epistles of John. Since agreement is impossible, each reader must make up his own mind. My own belief is that the Apostle wrote all three books. ",

Some say that the author of Revelation could not have been John the Revelator/Beloved. However, that is who the author identifies himself to be. ",
