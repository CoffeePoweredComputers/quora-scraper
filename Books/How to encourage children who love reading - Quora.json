            "answer_text": "Reading was a big part of our day. I love to read and that sets the example. Our Public Library had programs we attended. We raised our children without TV so we read before naps and going to bed. I was raised by a Librarian and my husband\u2019s Aunt was the National Librarian so she kept us informed of great new writers. Our Library had a Summer Reading Program. There were prizes for each set of books you read in your reading level. My daughter chuckled that she felt punished for reading at such a high level having to read huge chapter books when other kids her age read little books. She spoke to the Children\u2019s Librarian about it and the woman did agree to give double points to the kids in my daughter\u2019s situation. She just hadn\u2019t thought about it. If you met all of the qualifications you won a free pair of tickets to Tweetsie Railroad, the local historical Amusement Park with a huge train. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you encourage children who love reading? \u2014\u2022\u2014 I loved reading as a child, I didn\u2019t need encouraging I loved it. What I needed was opportunity. Take them to bookshops or join a library, allow them to select their own books to read and allow them to have more than one book available to read. I would buy my own books out of my pocket money, I would always take the full half a dozen I was allowed out of the lending library and I would have 3 or 4 books on the go at the same time. One in my bedroom, another in the living room, one in my back pack for school and even one I might be reading in the bath. That last one could be annoying if you let the book slip. So in summary \u2026 Let them chooseAlways have more than one available.When I was a child the most horrendous thing would be to not have something new to read. ",
