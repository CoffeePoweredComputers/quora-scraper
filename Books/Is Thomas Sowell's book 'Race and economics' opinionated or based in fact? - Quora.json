            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t read this particular book, but I\u2019ve read other stuff by Sowell It\u2019s certainly opinionated. All books are opinionated and books on topics like race and economics are usually very opinionated. And Sowell has opinions, for sure. Is it \u201cbased in fact\u201d? I certainly hope so. I disagree with Sowell on a lot, but he does base his opinion on fact. But which facts? There are always a vast oversupply of facts and no single book can look at them all. Authors choose which facts to look at. And then what does he do with the facts? Well, he thinks about them and forms opinions about them. A book of all facts would be something like an almanac (and, even there, the author has to choose which facts). Sowell isn\u2019t writing almanacs. Nor are authors who I agree with more than I do Sowell. Of course, some books are just opinions without any facts at all. But I don\u2019t think Sowell does that. ",

            "answer_text": "Sowell is one of the smartest men alive today outside of theoretical physics and specialty doctors. He bases everything on facts, observations, and models that actually work. He is also very open minded, in that if something that seems like it should be right isn\u2019t working, he will look into why and update his model. Amazing things would happen if people would just follow his advice. ",
