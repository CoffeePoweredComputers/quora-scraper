            "answer_text": " When I first heard of meditation I was a complete cynic. It sounded like a waste of time and, like many, I thought it was immediately about emptying my mind of all thoughts and it would take hours. But giving up a few minutes a day has quite literally changed my life. Meditation Labs has a free audio-book with a 28-day program for you to see for yourself if meditation isn\u2019t already a big part of your life: https://meditatin.co/free-audiobook/. Some traditions of meditation insist that there is no such thing as a good meditation book: Taught by an inferior man this Self cannot be easily known, even though reflected upon. Unless taught by one who knows him as none other than his own Self, there is no way to him, for he is subtler than subtle, beyond the range of reasoning. Not by logic can this realization be won. Only when taught by another, [an enlightened teacher], is it easily known, dearest friend. -Katha Upanishad, I.2.8\u20139 You have two choices with this type of meditation: find an enlightened teacher (not available for teaching online no matter what people online claim) or, if you believe that he managed to pull it off, seek someone trained by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi to play the part of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi when teaching meditation. Several governments in South America have contracted to have government employees trained in this teaching method. You CAN find contact info for such people online, but they won\u2019t teach you online nor via books or videos. Here\u2019s the most famous such teacher in the world. He\u2019s been nominated for the Nobel Peace prize and was recently given a \u201cHero of World\u2019s Children\u201d prize by the Queen of Sweden for his work with kids that includes teaching meditation: Gabriel Mejia Montoya - World\u2019s Children\u2019s Prize Any of his fellow mediation teachers will do just as well: Find a Transcendental Meditation Teacher\u2026 This answer is worth paying attention to.

            "answer_text": "There are various kinds of m\u00e9ditation and so many good books. One which I often recommend is Making Space: Creating a Home Meditation Practice \u2013 because it is so practical. Besides being a good basic handbook to meditation, it gives meditation grounding in everyday life, situating it in terms of daily affairs. Joining a meditation community for regular practice is excellent, as is an occasional meditation retreat. The real challenge for many is to have a regular home practice, and Making Space makes good on that promise. ",
