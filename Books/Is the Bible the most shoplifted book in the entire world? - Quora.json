Acts 4:10-12 10 then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the NAME of Yahusha of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom Yahuah raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. 11 Yahusha is the stone you builders rejected,which has become the cornerstone.\u2019 12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is NO OTHER NAME under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.\u201d The letter J was only invented 400 years ago making it impossible for the English name Jesus to be the Hebrew name of the Messiah. Christian Bibles use the false name Jesus Christ. ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE THERE IS NO SALVATION IN THE NAME JESUS. We are Yahuah\u2019s children on the condition that we accept the NAME YAHUSHA. (Yahuchanon (Jn) 1:12.)Also 1 Yahuchannon 3:23 And this is his COMMAND; to believe in the NAME of his Son Yahusha ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. Let\u2019s look at this in two ways: Probably not, since Bibles are available free of charge from most Christian churches. Think of it like advertising leaflets - nobody charges for those.Possibly yes, since the Bible is one of the most widely published books. available in almost all bookstores, and, it has been \u201cin print\u201d for a long long time. So, going by how widely it\u2019s available, it\u2019s possible that more Bibles have been stolen over time than any other book.",
