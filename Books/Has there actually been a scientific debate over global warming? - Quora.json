            "answer_text": "There is extremely significant debate; we actually know very little about how our climate system works. And we absolutely cannot model it. But don\u2019t take my word for it; read Section 14.2.2.2 of the Third Assessment Report by the IPCC: \u201cThe climate system is particularly challenging since it is known that components in the system are inherently chaotic; there are feedbacks that could potentially switch sign, and there are central processes that affect the system in a complicated, non-linear manner. These complex, chaotic, non-linear dynamics are an inherent aspect of the climate system.\u201d \u201cIn sum, a strategy must recognize what is possible. In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\u201d Read that last line again\u2026 and again if you need to: \u201cLong-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\u201d Not \u201cwe have a pretty good idea what\u2019s coming, within a margin of error.\u201d Not \u201cwe have some excellent theories, we\u2019re just ironing out the bugs.\u201d And sure as heck not \u201cthe science is settled.\u201d Long-term prediction of climate simply isn\u2019t possible. And again, this is from the IPCC itself, not from some token \u201cdenier\u201d the media trots out to make fun of (in their incredible arrogance). Once you understand that even the IPCC admits that long-term prediction is not possible, then you might start to wonder: Where is all the alarmism coming from? We\u2019ll attempt to answer that in a moment. But first: If you need more evidence that we don\u2019t understand climate, read Technical Section 6.6 of the Fifth Assessment Report from the IPCC. What you\u2019ll find buried therein is a list of dozens of critical climate building blocks, such as clouds, cyclone activity, precipitation, sea ice extent, radiative forcings, drought, ocean heat content - and for virtually all of them, the IPCC quietly admits that it has low confidence in its ability to model or even to estimate. Few people read anything other than the topline conclusions \u2014 but as with most things, the devil is in the details. Deep in the rarely-read technical portion of its report, the IPCC admits we are mind-numbingly ignorant about how climate works. We don\u2019t understand the constituent PARTS of this complex, chaotic system, and we sure as heck don\u2019t understand how all those parts work together to drive the whole. Now, this is not to say that there isn\u2019t any good science happening. Surely there is. But \u201cwhat (little) we do know\u201d about climate is massively overshadowed by \u201cwhat we DO NOT know.\u201d Need even more evidence? Look at failed historical prediction after failed historical prediction: (Note: We\u2019re 6 months from 2020; the Earth did NOT warm by 3 or 4 degrees. Not even close.)  Below is the UN\u2019s 1989 prediction. Note that we\u2019re now 20 years past \u201cthe point of no return\u201d \u2014 so what did they do? They assumed all of us tiny-brained sheep (that must be how they think of us, to keep pulling this stuff over and over) forgot, so they ran the exact same play again, and recycled the old prediction with a NEW date of 2030 (just like Doomsday Cults do when the \u201cend of the world\u201d date passes \u2014 they just come up with a new date, and the followers go, \u201cOh, okay! Thanks, Reverend!\u201d). Mark my words: 2030 won\u2019t work out EITHER.  How \u2019bout this next one? Britain will be \u201cSiberian\u201d within the next six months:  I could go on and on here with failed prediction after failed prediction, from \u201crespected non-political\u201d (coughs) organizations like those above (NASA, the UN, the Pentagon) and the only consistency you\u2019ll see is that they\u2019ve consistently been WAY OFF. Some of the predictions are so bad that it would be amusing if it weren\u2019t so polarizing and damaging to society \u2014 and so dangerous. The bottom line is: The models don\u2019t work. And they KNOW they don\u2019t work! Frankly, having studied this stuff ad nauseum, my sense is that certain politicians are using climate change as a trojan horse to sneak in another agenda. Unfortunately, more and more of the people these politicians want to (ahem) \u201cgovern\u201d are falling for it. And it\u2019s hard not to, as they\u2019ve silenced almost all of the dissenting voices, at least in the mainstream media outlets. Just look at all the answers to your question that are \u201coh, there\u2019s no debate, everything is figured out\u201d \u2014 when even the IPCC disagrees with that attitude. It\u2019s a sad commentary on so many things. Need MORE evidence? Look at the politicians' language and actions: \u201cThe science is settled.\u201d What a sick joke that is. Obviously, the science isn\u2019t even CLOSE to being settled. But that doesn\u2019t stop \u201ctrue believers\u201d from using it as an excuse to censor contrary views: Chuck Todd Refuses To Give Air Time To Climate Deniers: 'The Science Is Settled' \u201cDeniers\u201d \u2014 this term is another sick joke. It\u2019s meant to draw parallel to holocaust deniers, which is both disgusting and wholly unjust, especially given that\u2019s not how real science works. That\u2019s how BAD RELIGIONS work. Science is BASED on skepticism, not based on blind acceptance. Plus anyone who\u2019s done the research on this issue \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean reading 5 articles on CNN and MSNBC, I mean hundreds of hours of genuine research of source material, especially of material that countermands one\u2019s own biases \u2014 understands that skepticism is the correct scientific response. They are actively trying (and largely succeeding) to suppress any debate on this topic, because an honest debate would QUICKLY reveal the very weak ground that the alarmists are standing on. Which is exactly why you asked the question in the first place \u2014 any skepticism (and there\u2019s been a LOT of skepticism in the scientific community) is suppressed and MOCKED. So who wants to stand up and have their science career destroyed by activists? It\u2019s already happened to more than a few good scientists. Climate alarmism has essentially become a RELIGION BASED ON PURE BLIND FAITH IN THE \u201cAUTHORITY\u201d OF OUR ILLUSTRIOUS LEADERS. Yet this issue is so horrendously misrepresented by the media that few people are aware of where the actual science stands. As another example, are you aware that the current climate models can\u2019t even hind-cast before 1980? If we can\u2019t come up with a model that works BACKWARD and reproduces what we ALREADY KNOW, then our model will most certainly not give accurate projections going FORWARD. Obviously. And let\u2019s keep a little perspective, because those \u201chockey stick 400 parts per million\u201d CO2 charts are pretty clearly designed to elicit an exaggerated emotional response. This is what we\u2019re actually talking about here:  So now you might wonder: If our models are built on the presupposition that an infinitesimal amount of CO2 (400 parts per MILLION vs. 300 parts PER MILLION \u2014 i.e. 0.01%) is the primary driver of climate, but we do not understand the system or the parts of the system, we cannot explain multiple significant factors, and the models don\u2019t work either forward or backward \u2014 what might those models be trying to tell us? The models might very well be trying to tell us that minor amounts of CO2 are NOT driving our climate. So yes: To say \u201cthere\u2019s a scientific debate over global warming\u201d (or climate change) is a HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT. CO2 as a primary driver of climate doesn\u2019t even merit the rank of \u201ctheory,\u201d it\u2019s still in the \u201chypothesis\u201d stage. But the good news is that we\u2019re currently living in one of the most stable climate periods in Earth\u2019s history. It\u2019s unlikely to last forever, because climate is CONSTANTLY changing (and I suppose that\u2019s what the alarmists are counting on). For example, in only the past 20,000 years: Sea levels have risen an amazing 400 feet.Earth\u2019s temperature has warmed by about 10 degrees.Dust levels on Earth are 1/20th what they were 20,000 years ago.All of these changes occurred naturally, before the industrial age of mankind.If any of the above things happened NOW, or even if we got another Yangtze River Flood of 1931 (or anything similarly disastrous), the alarmists are GOING TO BLAME CLIMATE CHANGE. Be ready for it. Truth is the inoculation against manipulation.  ",

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question because it sheds light on how science is done. Debate isn\u2019t as big a part of scientific discovery as the average person might think. That\u2019s not to say there have never been debates in science. Debates were bigger in the early 20th century. Einstein used to debate quantum physics with Neils Bohr. (Final score, Bohr 14, Einstein 0). Bohr\u2013Einstein debates - Wikipedia There was a rather famous event that was actually called \u201cThe Great Debate\u201d, held in 1920, on whether there were other galaxies. At the time, telescopes weren\u2019t good enough to see other galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy has been observed, but it was impossible to see how far away it was, or to identify individual stars, so they called it the Andromeda Nebula. Two scientists debated whether the Milky Way was the Universe, or if there were other galaxies. Great Debate (astronomy) - Wikipedia Here\u2019s the point. Debates are fun. Debates can be entertaining and can fill an auditorium, but the \u201cGreat Debate\u201d didn\u2019t answer the question. What did answer the question was a better telescope 3 years later, when Edwin Hubble provided the first solid evidence that there was a star outside the Milky Way. Other galaxies exist The 100 inch Hooker telescope was completed in 1917, but it wasn\u2019t until 6 years later that the more distant stars were observed and confirmed by Mr. Hubble. (or is that Dr. Hubble). Mount Wilson Observatory - Wikipedia I always thought we should make a joke about that, like, Edwin Hubble used Hookers, but . . . it\u2019s probably not very funny. Here\u2019s the point. The debate solved nothing. The telescope and Edwin Hubble solved everything. Science doesn\u2019t use debate to move forward, it requires evidence, and people smart enough to understand the evidence. Getting back to Einstein vs. Bohr (not to bore anyone . . . he he, see what I did there), and this will come back to global warming, I promise. A physicist named John Stewart Bell didn\u2019t like the general acceptance that Bohr was right. Bohr\u2019s definition of how quantum physics worked bothered him, and he wrote a paper about it in 1964, which wasn\u2019t published until 1966, and raised some debate (there\u2019s that word again), on the Einstein vs. Bohr disagreement on how quantum physics worked. But, that\u2019s an oversimplification. John von Newman wrote an argument that some people said \u201cproved\u201d Bohr was right and Einstein wrong. Don\u2019t get me started on the use of the word \u201cproof\u201d, which is often used out of convenience, but never truly accurate in science. Proof is a mathematical word, but out of convenience, we use the word incorrectly, fairly often, in science. It was common among professors, at the time, to say that von Newmann\u2019s argument proved Bohr correct. John Stewart Bell - Wikipedia The problem. There was a flaw in von Newmann\u2019s proof, and let me just point out, John von Newmann was brilliant. He was a mathematician, a physicist and one of the key designers of modern computers, so, he deserves mad respect. A flaw in his \u201cproof\u201d doesn\u2019t take away the brilliant contributions he made to science, just as Einstein being wrong about quantum physics doesn\u2019t undo his brilliance. Nobody is going to be right about cutting edge physics every time, in fact, just being smart enough to make a wrong argument speaks well of a scientist\u2019s abilities. First you have to understand it, then you can make an argument that may turn out to be right or may turn out to be wrong / both are valid for publishing if the science is sound. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wronger-than-wrong/ Not even wrong - Wikipedia So, von Newmann\u2019s intelligent argument had a flaw, that was identified in 1935, by Grete Hermann, but her correction went unnoticed, perhaps because (and I\u2019m tempted to say, probably because) she was a woman, and as a result, von Newmann\u2019s argument was taught in universities as a \u201cproof\u201d of Neils Bohr\u2019s no hidden-variable theorem for about 30 years. Imagine that. For 30 years, a correction went unnoticed. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough, at least, until John Bell, who made the same observation as Grete Hermann (and Bell is an everyday name in physics, Hermann is not - there is no fairness in this world sometimes) Grete Hermann - Wikipedia But, Bell, like Hermann, found the flaw in von Newmann\u2019s argument. Bell identified this in 1964 but had some details to work out and some delays and wasn\u2019t published until 1966, and a few years later, in 1972 the first Bell\u2019s test as done and it came down on the side of Bohr. Interestingly, Bell thought Einstein was right, and Bohr was wrong. His test, came down on the side of Bohr. So, I\u2019m going to have some fun with words. Einstein\u2019s argument was logical, reasonable, and wrong. Bohr\u2019s argument was counter-intuitive, and right von Newman\u2019s argument, ended up being technically right, on the no hidden-variable argument, but had an error. It wasn\u2019t a sound argument. It didn\u2019t demonstrate what von Newmann clalimed. Bell\u2019s belief was wrong, but his test was sound and wound up demonstrating that Bohr was right. Got all that? You have to be smart and understand something, and you have to understand something before you can be wrong and being wrong, frankly, it\u2019s OK, because right or wrong isn\u2019t the issue, what counts is what can be shown, or word I don\u2019t like \u201cproved\u201d. Like Tom Cruise said in that movie. \u201cIt doesn't matter what I believe. It only matters what I can prove. So don't tell me . . . \u201c Kaffee: I know the LAW quote Debate doesn\u2019t answer questions, it raises them . . . which is OK, but it\u2019s not an answer. Evidence answers questions. \u201cWas there ever a debate\u201d isn\u2019t the right question, the question you should be asking is \u201cis there evidence\u201d and the answer to that question is yes. Mountains of evidence. That\u2019s why the vast majority of scientists understand and agree with the man made climate change argument - because it\u2019s sound, and it passed many tests, and every year the evidence gets stronger. People often say 97% of scientists agree with man made climate change, well, frankly, those who understand it, it\u2019s more like 99.8% and the 0.2% who don\u2019t, most of them don\u2019t agree in exchange for a paycheck, or for some philosophical \u201clets keep an open mind reason because, I also want to keep an open mind on vaccines causing cancer and tin foil hats blocking telepathy. We don\u2019t need a debate, we need people who don\u2019t agree to put their time and effort into reviewing the evidence, and if they can find flaw - not jibberish, but actual flaw, then scientists will listen. And, yes, once in a while, the scientific community will miss a correction, or not understand a new discovery. Einstein\u2019s 1905 publications were met with silence for 6 months, until Max Planck sent a messenger to in, inviting him to his institute, which, if you think about it, is really quite something, for a couple of reasons. New ideas often take time to digest, though at the time, it bothered Einstein, and lead him to doubt his own work for a while, but what\u2019s cool, is that Max Planck was the premier physicist in the world at the time, and Planck had taken an interest in Einstein\u2019s work. To put that in modern terms, it\u2019s like submitting an script to a movie studio, not hearing a peep for 6 months, then one day, Francis Ford Coppola knocks on your door and tells you that he\u2019s going to make your movie. Einstein\u2019s ideas were very different and it took time for the scientific community to accept them, and if not for Max Planck, it might have been quite a bit longer before Einstein\u2019s ideas went mainstream. But, I digress. I just like that story that Einstein went from 6 months of silence to an invitation from the top physicist in the world, one day, and he went from the patent office, to fame, almost overnight, because Max Planck recognized his brilliance. It\u2019s a bit like the Ramanujan story about the genius discovered, as story which has had a movie made of it, and many people know. Einstein\u2019s 6 months of waiting is rarely mentioned, but it must have been a very trying time for him. I\u2019ve heard climate skeptics compare themselves to Galileo, which could not be more wrong. Galileo wasn\u2019t tried for his science. He was tried for disagreeing with scripture. Galileo brought his evidence to court. He was prepared to argue his reasons for how he know Venus orbited the sun, or why tides followed the Sun and Moon, but his science was never questioned, only that scripture said this and Galileo said that - and based on scripture and scripture along, Galileo was found guilty. If he\u2019d lived in a nation where the church wasn\u2019t so powerful, Galileo\u2019s ideas would probably not have lead to a lifetime house arrest and nearly his death. Galileo also was very good at making enemies. He called fellow professors and high ranking church officials \u201cmorons\u201d regularly, so, his tongue as as much to blame for his trial as his science. Galileo is a terrible example of science misunderstood, because pretty much every scientist with any skill at all, in his day who looked at Galileo\u2019s work, found his arguments compelling, believable and verifiable. Anyone could look through his telescopes and see that Jupiter\u2019s moons orbited Jupiter, not Earth. Grete Hermann is a good example of when good science goes missed or ignored. Galileo really isn\u2019t an example of that. Galileo\u2019s science moved through the scientific community almost like a brush-fire, with rapid (for the time) acceptance and agreement, the only difference being, the scientific community was less comfortable publishing things that disagreed with scripture in those days. So . . . long and story filled answer is done. This is what matters. Debate isn\u2019t required. Only evidence. Understanding the evidence is required. Almost to a man, people who don\u2019t accept man made climate change don\u2019t understand how strong the evidence is. If you want to disprove an argument in science, and convince scientists - make a logically consistent argument or find the errors in the accepted argument. So called climate \u201cskeptics\u201d don\u2019t do that. They\u2019re not even trying to do science, they just do propaganda. Propaganda isn\u2019t evidence, even if sells to a large number of people. If any climate skeptic thinks they have a real argument, I invite them to share it, because they\u2019ve never presented a sound argument. Everything they claim can be debunked. Man made climate change can\u2019t be debunked, because it\u2019s backed by evidence. The last time team \u201cskeptic\u201d did any real science, the science agreed with man made global warming. Their study showed even more man made warming than NASA, NOAA or HadCRU. After that, team \u201cskeptic\u201d has switched gears to nothing but propaganda. Converted Contrarian Argues Humans \"Almost Entirely\" to Blame for Climate Change There\u2019s a guy on Quora who makes the claim that man made climate change is un-falsifiable. That\u2019s a bogus claim. The studies on man made climate change could have gone either way. Just because something hasn\u2019t been falsified, doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t un-falsifiable. That\u2019s not splitting hairs. That\u2019s fundamental. So, until climate \u201cskeptics\u201d start understanding science, this is my answer to every climate change skeptic out there. \u201cYou\u2019re no Grete Hermann, and you don\u2019t even know enough to be wrong.\u201d I\u2019d respect them, if they\u2019d reach the level of actually being wrong. They\u2019re below that. So, please, get an education and stop \u201cdebating\u201d until you understand the evidence that\u2019s already out there. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes there has been a lot of debate. Science is not really a process of \u2018debate\u2019 Science is a process of investigation and correction. Debate happens as part of the process. What some people want though is a public debate where say one scientist is lectured to by an ignorant non-scientist trying to convince the audience that the clever words you can use when you are not trying to be accurate are actually better than actual science. It\u2019s much harder to explain the structure of the electron cloud round an atom than it is to say it looks like planets orbiting a central object. That neat diagram is wrong but very simple to make people understand and believe. In fact the electron shell is more like a probability wave function and nothing like orbiting planets. So reality is much harder to explain. In a debate though someone pushing the orbiting planet idea would win. After all a probability wave function is counter intuitive. Makes no sense right???? What has to happen is that those that understand science need to debate it - and not some sort of show debate for the ignorant to choose what to believe. And those that understand the science have debated it endlessly. People do research and write papers, papers get peer reviewed then published. Other people check the papers and try to find flaws. More people do research and see what holds up - and also collect more data related to it. At any point if the earlier work does not match the new evidence then people try to find out why - and ask was the original hypothesis wrong or is there something about the new evidence that is not understood and how and why? This is the constant thing we call scientific method. Back in the 1800s the idea that CO2 would trap heat and warm the planet was much debated. The work has continued since then. A lot of people claim this is all some new thing made up in the last few years and blame a politician or \u2018the left\u2019 or something. It is a debate from almost 200 years ago! And has been examined repeatedly ever since! So yes it has been scientifically debated. The question is why is anyone thinking they can suddenly disprove it based on politics? Or Politcal Science? Or Engineering? Or just plain \u2018I don\u2019t get it so it must be wrong!\u2019 And the other explanations offered have been examined - the suggestion that it\u2019s increased solar output - well no - the solar output has been reducing and the temperature has been rising - so that\u2019s been looked at and shown to be false. And clever debating tricks like \u2018CO2 is plant food\u2019 - that is meaningless - that does not mean it does not cause global warming. It\u2019s an illustration of debating instead of science. ",

            "answer_text": "Has there actually been a scientific debate over global warming? There has been plenty of debates over global warming from the 70s onwards, but lately the only debate concerns the speed of warming and what will be effective against it. There have been counter arguments made against anthropogenic global warming (AGW) such as the article titled \"500 Scientists Whose Research Contradicts Man-Made Global Warming Scares\", written by a food policy analyst Dennis T Avery of the Hudson Institute and was published by The Heartland Institute in 2007. The list was immediately called out for citing discredited work, misunderstanding the findings and generally seeking to distort the truth. Many of the scientists that were mentioned tried to get their names removed because of the misrepresentation of their work, but the Heartland Institute refused to comply. At present the more qualified the researcher, the higher the consensus is concerning the reality of AGW, although there is plenty of room for argument concerning the accuracy of models and the strategies that can be employed.  According to the United States National Research Council, [T]here is a strong, credible body of evidence, based on multiple lines of research, documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities. While much remains to be learned, the core phenomenon, scientific questions, and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. * * * Some scientific conclusions or theories have been so thoroughly examined and tested, and supported by so many independent observations and results, that their likelihood of subsequently being found to be wrong is vanishingly small. Such conclusions and theories are then regarded as settled facts. This is the case for the conclusions that the Earth system is warming and that much of this warming is very likely due to human activities. Science is a continual debate based on research, published papers, peer review, and specialist conferences. This process never ends and is never totally \u201csettled\u201d, since there is always new information and discoveries to bring to the table. This is why the term \u201claw of science\u201d has fallen by the wayside except as a mark of respect for the greats like Newton, now preferring the term theory, since it implies that there is still room for improvement.

            "answer_text": "Yes. The central part of this question is what is \u201cscientific debate\u201d. As \u201cscientific debate\u201d is often misunderstood by those outside of science, it is necessary to unpack that a bit further to answer this question. In particular, anti-science groups have been known to argue that there was a controversy in science, in fact, there wasn\u2019t one[*]. This happens so often that it is described as manufactured controversy. As I am sure you know there is a huge politically motivated anti-science group attacking climate science and sponsored by the fossil fuel industry (see Anton Carver's answer to Is there a large-scale effort to spread misinformation on climate science and, if so, who funds it?). It isn\u2019t possible to \u201cdebate\u201d things with anti-science groups, because they disregard facts, evidence, logic and all the precepts of science. The thing about a scientific debate that makes it different from other forms of debate is that science is based on evidence and study. To have sufficient evidence to make any meaningful contribution to science will take years of study. Consequently, there is a more sedate pace to debate with the resolution of doubt being established gradually over the years through the accumulation of knowledge. Eventually, a very high level of agreement and is reached \u2014 this is called consilience. The strength of agreement in climate science has been increasing for some time now and investigators who conduct meta-studies on the literature are now seeing near unanimity.

            "answer_text": "Yes, there have occasionally been scientific debates about the cause(s) of climate change and global warming, particularly about whether human emissions of CO2 are the primary driver of climate change, and whether the slight warming trend that we have recently experienced will continue and whether it will be catastrophic to earth\u2019s inhabitants. Unfortunately, many alarmists have tried to stifle such debate using multiple tactics: Spuriously claim that the science is completely settled and in no need of further debate- a sure sign that the complete opposite is true and a typical excuse used by many alarmists to avoid having to actually debate the subject because he/she has insufficient evidence to support their position.Spuriously claim, based upon flawed studies, that 97% of all climate scientists (and even all scientists as Obama and Kerry have claimed) agree with greater than 95% confidence with the UN IPCC consensus statement that human emissions of CO2 are the primary cause of the vast majority of global warming. This claim has been resoundingly debunked by numerous scientists and scientific organizations, the latest being a scientific division of the Dutch government in 2015 which concluded that only 43% of the 1868 climate scientists they surveyed agree with that so-called \u201cconsensus\u201d statement.https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/97_Consensus_Myth.pdf 97 Articles Refuting The \"97% Consensus\" | Climate Dispatch New Study: Majority of Climate Scientists Don't Agree with 'Consensus' | Climate Dispatch Launch vehement and vicious personal attacks against anyone who expresses skepticism about the unproven theory of Catastrophic Anthropogenic CO2 Global Warming, often using vulgar pejoratives, fallacious terms such as \u201cclimate change deniers\u201d, and inappropriate insulting terms such as \u201cuneducated flat earthers\u201d to describe them. Such actions are juvenile and a type of logical fallacy frequently used by those who do not have sufficient evidence to back their tenuous claims.Advance straw man arguments rather than respond to specific criticisms of the theory of CAGW. One such example is claiming that skeptics of CAGW are \u201cclimate change deniers\u201d, thereby mendaciously implying that skeptics do not believe that the climate changes, when, in fact, virtually all skeptics of CAGW know that the climate has always changed over time. Their skepticism is towards the unproven claim that human emissions of CO2 are leading to impending apocalyptic global warming which will kill millions and destroy the earth.Attempt to block the publication of articles skeptical of CAGW and refuse to allow skeptics to speak in most main stream media venues:Chuck Todd Refuses To Give Air Time To Climate Deniers: 'The Science Is Settled' \u201cWe\u2019re not going to debate climate change, the existence of it. The Earth is getting hotter, and human activity is a major cause. Period.\u201d -NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd Notice the fallacious use of \u201cClimate Denier\u201d. So much for legitimate debate! Editorial bias and the prediction of climate disaster: the crisis of science communication \u201cFor the last 10 years or so, there has been a relentless outpouring of disaster predictions that have been published with little hesitation and rising alarm by the world\u2019s leading science journals. Any lingering reservation about looming catastrophe has been silenced by science editors and environmental journalists. Uncertainties have been conveniently disregarded and highly unlikely worst case scenarios exaggerated. The scientific endeavour involves both the protectors and challengers of each and every paradigm. Both are essential to the health and dynamic of a highly competitive enterprise that is science. No consensus is sacrosanct. And it is in the very nature of science and science communication that all reasonable positions and counter-arguments should be heard. Instead of serving as an honest and open-minded broker of scientific controversy, science editors have opted to take a rigid stance on the science and politics of climate change. In so doing, they have in effect sealed the doors for any critical assessment of the prevailing consensus which their journals officially sponsor. Consequently, their public endorsement undoubtedly deters critics from submitting falsification attempts for publication. Such critiques, not surprisingly, are simply non-existing in the mainstream science media.\u201d This is, indeed, a sad and tragic devolution of scientific endeavor. Failure to consider both sides of a controversy with open minds is how humankind makes horrific and costly mistakes. ",

            "answer_text": "Has there actually been a scientific debate over global warming? I\u2019m just going to put this answer here, in response to some very long complex answers which include sentences such as: \u201cThey (?) are actively trying (and largely succeeding) to suppress any debate on this topic, because an honest debate would QUICKLY reveal the very weak ground that the alarmists are standing on.\u201d I don\u2019t know who \u201cthey\u201d are in this sentence. I tried to work out who this word was referring to, but couldn\u2019t. \u201cUncertainties have been conveniently disregarded and highly unlikely worst case scenarios exaggerated.\u201d Let me just say that part of the presentation of scientific papers has been to acknowledge the uncertainties in climate modeling: because you need to express these weaknesses as a part of the presentation of your study. This is the current situation in Australia:  Australia\u2019s average (mean) temperatures show steady and significant rises over the last hundred years.  Australia\u2019s maximum temperatures show steady and significant rises over the last hundred years.  To compound this problem Australia has received it\u2019s lowest rainfall in the previous one hundred years. The bushfires that have devastated Australia\u2019s East Coast are catastrophic and thought to have destroyed 10 million hectares and killed 1 billion animals. Thirty-three people have lost their lives and thousands of homes have been destroyed. The fires are frightening in their speed and ferocity.        After weeks of fighting off these fires, the town of Bateman\u2019s Bay was evacuated when they crossed a river 3,700 metres wide. Businesses and homes were lost.  Main street at popular holiday spot Bateman\u2019s Bay  Nearby residents were evacuated onto the beaches.  Some returned to homes and property destroyed.    The fabulous historic town of Mogo was brought to its knees and badly damaged.   And Cobago   This photo was taken from the car park of an Aged Care facility north of Sydney - a rest home!  Animals have been severely affected.  Habitat has been decimated.  Thousands of holiday-makers had to be evacuated by sea.  A further complication is the ash and debris washing into the rivers resulting in thousands of fish deaths.  Here\u2019s a map of Australia comparing the size of the country with the United States.  This is the area around Sydney showing bushfire activity on just one day.  Another screenshot of bushfire activity to the south of Sydney when the towns of Bateman\u2019s Bay and Mogo were on fire. To sum up - if you are still with me - it is clear we are undergoing a significant rise in temperatures. Ocean temperatures are also on the rise, which not only affects the local sealife environment, but also ocean currents and rainfall. Australia\u2019s lack of rainfall has been linked to currents in the Indian Ocean. The issue is the rapid rate of change which outpaces any chance animals and plants have to adapt to the new conditions. Added to this, devastating loss to the environment like this makes it almost impossible for the natural habitat to recover. And these high temperatures will continue. Scientists have been taking core samples of the ice in the antarctic to plot the relationship between CO2 in the atmosphere and found a strong correlation, supporting the relationship of the rise in temperatures with human activity. Cities are filled with smoke, temperatures are increasing, habitats are been destroyed, not to mention farms, businesses and homes. Extraordinary fires have affected California, Brazil, Greece, Spain, France and Sweden. Tourism, a major industry is being disrupted, highways are closed, power, internet and phone infrastructure has been burned and destroyed. The production and transportation of food could be impacted and the cost to the economy is in billions. In my area a truffle farmer lost decades of work in research and stock. Another research institution lost millions when their agriculture projects were destroyed. One of the frightening aspects for the thousands of people caught at beach-side towns during the holiday period meant there was no phone, internet or electricity for days - think of this - the sky is black, you can\u2019t see for smoke and all our modern communication channels are lost. I would argue that people who have been impacted by these unprecedented fires, are very alarmed at situation. And not least among them are the firefighters, who have been fighting fires and protecting property for months now, many as volunteers, and hundreds from other countries. Sadly many of the 31 human deaths in these fires have been firefighters. The fires are so hot, and the speed of them so extreme, they create their own weather systems, starting thunder storms and sparking lightning strikes which ignite almost all of these fires. Flaming embers fly out for kilometres in front of the fire, borne on the unusual high-speed winds battering the country all summer. These winds are constantly changing direction, so land and property previously thought to have been saved is destroyed as the fire turns back and consumes everything in its path. No one can outrun these fires. Just imagine what it would be like if they engulfed your city or town. To those who might argue that Australia has always been prone to bushfires, ancient forests tens of thousands of years old have been lost, as well as severe burning in subtropical forests which are normally too wet, and not known to have burnt before. Finally here\u2019s astrophysicist and science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson explaining why lawmakers and the media should stop cherry picking scientific papers to reinforce their political ideals on climate change, saying it's irresponsible to create public policy while ignoring the scientific community's consensus.

            "answer_text": "Most of the other answers are good, but it\u2019s worth talking about the process of scientific debate so that\u2019s understood to be different than the other forms of debate out there. Let\u2019s define a couple of the other types of debate we are exposed to. Formal debate - This is typically done in clubs in context of academic settings. Individuals take positions on a single issue, whether they believe them or not, and argue with another individual, typically in a moderated setting and under specific rules of order that keep the debate on track. The vast majority of people never witness a formal debate. It\u2019s a scored game of rhetoric, not a meaningful intellectual exercise most of the time. Political debate - During campaigns, politicians end up on stage together and some moderator asks a series of questions of each of the politicians. Often this results in canned platform responses and politicians staying on message rather than responding, but it does lead to emotional theater which sways some people. It\u2019s not typically meaningful in terms of semantic comment, and once again is more an opportunity for jostling for position of a certain type. The smaller the number of politicians on stage and the better the moderators, the more it becomes meaningful. But it\u2019s still an exercise in messaging not in intellectual discovery or logical step-by-step refinement of an argument. Lots of people end up watching them in much the same way that they watch horse races and football. They cheer their team, boo the other team and go home thinking something happened when nothing really did. Punching down debate - This is a very common form of something that is thought of as debate on the right at present. Ben Shapiro is the current master of this form of argumentation. It\u2019s unmoderated and allows the primary focus of attention, e.g. Shapiro, to indulge themselves and their fans by using their position of authority, control of the microphone and a variety of rhetorical tactics to humiliate someone who disagrees with them. It\u2019s a form of entertainment and indoctrination, not an honest debate. It is unmoderated and circulates on YouTube ad nauseam with titles like \u2018Shapio pwns LIBTARD FEMINAZI!\u201d. Far too many people on the right are watching this sort of thing and thinking that it\u2019s a debate. For the conservatives in the crowd, it\u2019s specifically sophistry and you know how Plato felt about the Sophists. Informal debate - Also known as shooting the shit. Some number of people get together and argue vague positions badly, often while acting under the influence of undergraduate education or social media. Almost everyone has witnessed or participated in this, including yours truly. These forms of debate are notable for their unity of location, members and time. They occur, then it\u2019s like the discussion never happened.  Then there\u2019s scientific debate. It\u2019s very, very different than the others above. First off, it takes a long time, sometimes decades. Secondly, it takes place in two forums, peer-reviewed scientific journals and to a lesser extent conferences and classrooms. Thirdly, it takes place among a lot more people. Finally, it isn\u2019t human beings talking at and over one another, it\u2019s written and documented. Scientific papers have up to a dozen authors, after a team has moved through an experiment to publication. Peer-reviewers moderate what content gets into journals. Completely unrelated groups in the same field critique the published paper in the form of formal letters to the editor pointing out challenges, or in the form of additional peer-reviewed papers contradicting, supporting or refining the results. Typically different data sets and methodologies are used to assess consilience. Unlike the debates above, it\u2019s not 2\u201310 people on a stage for a couple of hours, it\u2019s an ongoing set of theories, hypotheses, experiments and publication that sometimes takes years or decades to finally establish results that are generally agreed upon. Scientific paradigms do not arise overnight. What scientific debate doesn\u2019t have is one person taking a position against the evidence, and one person taking a position for the evidence talking in a formal or semi-formal setting and reality being decided by who is the better speaker.  So let\u2019s ask the question of whether there has been a scientific debate about global warming. The answer is a resounding yes. Carbon dioxide was first experimentally proven to be a greenhouse gas, one that traps infrared more than other spectrums of light, in the 1850s. That was published. Global warming due to emissions of carbon dioxide from use of fossil fuels was hypothesized in the 1890s. Data sets with satellites and global temperature readings started emerging and stabilizing in the 1960s. Innumerable published papers in the 1970s showed that the warming hypothesis was correct and identified most of the major contributors. Since the 1970s, it\u2019s been refinement of the magnitude and direction of feedback factors, intensive modeling of global climatic changes and isotopic analysis. And here\u2019s the result. Global warming is real, it\u2019s serious and it\u2019s caused by us. That scientific debate has been occurring since the 1850s, reached the point of strong scientific agreement in the 1970s and has only been getting firmer since. We\u2019re now at 99.9999% confidence that humans are causing global warming. One of the last real scientific contrarians laid down his axe recently. Dr. Richard Muller thought that manual adjustments to temperature data sets had been inconsistently applied and that much of the observed warming was an artifact of this. He didn\u2019t ask for a one-on-one televised debate with Michael Mann. That\u2019s not how scientific debate works. He had a hypothesis, he defined a means of testing his hypothesis, he assembled grant funding and a team to run his experiment. He and his team automatically and consistently applied adjustments to the base temperature readings. And he found the opposite of what he expected, that with consistent and automated adjustments, warming was slightly higher. And he accepted what the evidence showed him and his adjusted data sets are now widely used. That\u2019s another thing that occurs with scientific debate that rarely occurs with other things that are called debate. The opinions of the people engaged in scientific debate often changes. The evidence convinces them. Scientific debate that is occurring around global warming right now is around edge conditions, model refinement and about data set / methodology pairs which disagree and why. There is no scientific debate of any merit that would fit the definition of other forms of debate. Note: my personal policy is to block and mute climate change and other science deniers. Yours should be too. ",

Here is its statement on climate change, which is similar to that of virtually every scientific association, both general and specialized: \u201cThe overwhelming evidence of human-caused climate change documents both current impacts with significant costs and extraordinary future risks to society and natural systems. The scientific community has convened conferences, published reports, spoken out at forums and proclaimed, through statements by virtually every national scientific academy and relevant major scientific organization \u2014 including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) \u2014 that climate change puts the well-being of people of all nations at risk. \u201cSurveys show that many Americans think climate change is still a topic of significant scientific disagreement. Thus, it is important and increasingly urgent for the public to know there is now a high degree of agreement among climate scientists that human-caused climate change is real. Moreover, while the public is becoming aware that climate change is increasing the likelihood of certain local disasters, many people do not yet understand that there is a small, but real chance of abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts on people in the United States and around the world.\u201d http://whatweknow.aaas.org/get-the-facts/ ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, there hasn\u2019t been much debate on the Global Warming theory, mostly due to the sad fact that proponents refuse to engage in an honest, bilateral discussion and exchange of ideas, much less a full on debate on the validity of the theory. If the scientific evidence was so strong in favor of their point of view, they should welcome the opportunity to wipe the floor with deniers\u2019 fraudulent claims, yet they refuse to talk. Not only do they refuse to engage, they actively encourage any and everyone to ignore us skeptics and to not even listen to or read about our side. Why? My guess is that they\u2019re simply afraid to lose the argument or at the very least to be forced into recognizing that skeptics have legitimate reasons for doubt. So let\u2019s start at the beginning, the current term of Climate Change is used in a misleading way, simply because it means both warming and cooling trends and both natural as well as human causes. It was adopted to try and muddy the waters, to more easily label skeptics as \u201cclimate deniers\u201d (more on that later) and because it\u2019s easier to blame a snow storm on \u201cclimate change\u201d than on Global Warming. Global Warming (thank you for using this term) is much better, but still incomplete, because it lacks a few of the characteristics of the theory, specifically because warming can be natural or human caused, so a much better term is (the now almost forgotten) Anthropogenic Global Warming or AGW. AGW while better still isn\u2019t the perfect name for the theory, it lacks one final but crucial element, severity. As you well know, many an alarmist voice is constantly being raised on the catastrophic effects of AGW, because clearly, if a warming trend was occurring that was mainly caused by human activity, but lacked any dire consequences, there would be no need for action much less drastic action. So the better and more complete term should be [C]AGW or Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming. By now you may be starting to understand the unwillingness of proponents to engage in debate. They can\u2019t defend the use of the clearly lacking, insufficient and misleading term of their preferred \u201cClimate Change\u201d. So when someone argues that climate change is real, ask them: what exactly do you mean by climate change? Let us now consider the evidence. [C]AGW proponents for the most part rely on logical fallacies, exaggeration and wild leaps in logic. The first is the well known \u201cthe experts agree\u201d. This off course is not scientific evidence nor is it accurate. It isn\u2019t evidence because it\u2019s actually nothing more than a logical fallacy known as argumentum ad verecundiam (argument from authority) best described as \u201cbecause they said so\u201d. They claim that 97% of experts agree, climate change is real (see why using accurate terminology is important?). Let\u2019s consider two examples. Case a) If we asked religious experts (priests, monks, rabbis, mullahs, imams, etc) if they believed that a god exists, my guess is that a vast consensus would agree that yes, a god exists. Does this then scientifically prove that The God exists? Clearly no. Case b) A vast overwhelming consensus exists among all scientists that somewhere there exists extraterrestrial life outside our solar system. Does this prove that alien flying saucers have visited, that they have abducted people and that aliens from another planet built the pyramids? Nope. Exact same leap in logic. Next is the observation that, yes, some warming has occurred and that, yes, CO2 levels have increased and yes, CO2 is a greenhouse gas. They then immediately jump to the conclusion that human activity is the main climate driver and that the consequences have been or will be catastrophic. This is another huge leap in logic. They do not stop and ask the obvious questions. Has it ever been as warm as today, before human activity had the chance to influence the climate? Yes, in fact for much of the worlds history (millions of years) it was much warmer than today. This inconvenient fact is often hidden by claiming \u201chottest on record\u201d and then cherry picking a start date that suits their narrative. Have CO2 levels ever been as high or higher than today? Yes, in fact much, much higher. Again taking the entire history of the world in millions of years there have been times when CO2 levels (before humans) were 3, 4 and up to 17 times higher, all without this ever being the cause of mass extinction events. Has the current warming trend resulted in catastrophe? No. In fact deaths from natural disasters have been dramatically plummeting. Yet those of us skeptics are referred to as \u201cclimate deniers\u201d. The irony here is that us skeptics are the ones to point to past climatological history and how that doesn\u2019t fit with the [C]AGW theory, we don\u2019t deny the climate, but they do. They actively try to erase past climate periods like the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age and ignore millions of years of climatic history that proves, beyond any doubt that CO2 has never before been the main climate driver on planet Earth. So the next time a [C]AGW proponent tells you that you should ignore what we skeptics say and that debating us is a waste of time, ask them\u2026What are you afraid of? ",

            "answer_text": "Historically, yes. An important thing to understand about science is that in any given field, there will always be some number of angry loners who don't want to get on board with the consensus. They're usually smart but self-absorbed, often have difficulty working with others and skew toward oversimplified or otherwise evocative assertions with dubious support, frequently base their confidence on the imperfection of other models rather than the success of their own, and tend to be elders in the community who feel left behind and betrayed because the community never embraced their ideas as fully as they would have liked. This basically means there will always be some fringe of debate, no matter how settled a matter is in the consensus. The \u201cdebate\u201d typically consists of a loner calling everyone else charlatans and idiots, and everyone else sighing and rolling their eyes. Ideally a scientist is impartial and honest, but actual scientists are people and get emotionally invested in their work. Government funded science especially pays so poorly for the required personal investment that you really have to love the work to stick around. There's a (somewhat grim) old saying that scientific progress advances one funeral at a time. In other words, it's hard to shake off the paradigms of one's youth. When the consensus does move on, it tends to leave behind a vocal cloud of angry professors emeritus. The big difference in climate science, as opposed to, say, plasma physics, is that a lot of very wealthy people have a lot of money invested in the current status quo, and the bitter outliers happen to be saying what those wealthy people want to hear.

TLW's Climatescope\u2122, by T.L. Winslow (TLW), \"The Historyscoper\"\u2122 In Oct. 1824 French mathematical physicist Baron <a href=\"Joseph Fourier - Wikipedia\">Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830)</a> published the paper <a href=\"Fourier (1824) Translated by Burgess (1837)\"><i>Remarques generales sur les Temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires</i></a> (General Remarks on the Temperature of the Terrestrial Globe and the Planetary Space) in <i>Annales de Chimie et de Physique</i>, in which he calculated that the Earth would be far colder if it had no atmosphere, allegedly discovering the <a href=\"Greenhouse effect - Wikipedia\">Greenhouse Effect</a> (talking about a glass box) and launching climate change science. \"In short, if all the strata of air of which the atmosphere is formed, preserved their density with their transparency, and lost only the mobility which is peculiar to them, this mass of air, thus become solid, on being exposed to the rays of the sun, would produce an effect the same in kind with that we have just described. The heat, coming in the state of light to the solid earth, would lose all at once, and almost entirely, its power of passing through transparent solids: it would accumulate in the lower strata of the atmosphere, which would thus acquire very high temperatures. We should observe at the same time a diminution of the degree of acquired heat, as we go from the surface of the earth. The mobility of the air, which is rapidly displaced in every direction, and which rises when heated, and the radiation of non-luminous heat into the air, diminish the intensity of the effects which would take place in a transparent and solid atmosphere, but do not entirely change their character. The decrease of heat in the higher regions of the air does not cease, and the temperature can be augmented by the interposition of the atmosphere, because heat in the state of light finds less resistance in penetrating the air, than in repassing into the air when converted into non-luminous heat.\" Too bad, Fourier never mentioned CO2 as having anything to do with it. That\u2019s where the other scientists in the list above came in. We\u2019ll skip them for brevity, except Arrhenius. In Apr. 1896 Swedish chemist <a href=\"Svante Arrhenius - Wikipedia\">Svante August Arrhenius (1859-1927)</a> pub. <a href=\"http://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf\">On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Earth</a>, which first describes the effect of CO2 in raising atmospheric temps via the greenhouse effect, using values for the radiant heat of the full moon at different elevations above the horizon supplied by Samuel Pierpont Langley to compute the heat absorbed by the atmosphere, calculating the effect of a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) to be an increase in surface temp of 5C-8C, while a halving of it would produce a new ice age, with the conclusion: \"If the quantity of carbonic acid increases in geometric progression, the augmentation of the temperature will increase nearly in arithmetic progression.\u201d Too bad, he only proves that atmospheric CO2 absorbs and blocks infrared energy before returning it to space, not that it can return any of it to the surface. \"The atmospheric greenhouse effect, an idea that many authors trace back to the traditional works of Fourier (1824), Tyndall (1861), and Arrhenius (1896), and which is still supported in global climatology, essentially describes a fictitious mechanism, in which a planetary atmosphere acts as a heat pump driven by an environment that is radiatively interacting with but radiatively equilibrated to the atmospheric system. According to the second law of thermodynamics, such a planetary machine can never exist. Nevertheless, in almost all texts of global climatology and in a widespread secondary literature, it is taken for granted that such a mechanism is real and stands on a firm scientific foundation.\" From \"Recent Changes in the Climate: Natural or Forced by Human Activity\" - Natural or Forced by Human Activity In Jan. 1901 Swedish meteorologist <a href=\"Nils Gustaf Ekholm - Wikipedia\">Nils Gustaf Ekholm (1848-1923)</a> (lifelong friend of Svante Arrhenius and believer in the ability of atmospheric CO2 to control the mean temp of the Earth) pub. the article <a href=\"A Timeline of Climate Science and Policy\">On the variations of the climate of the geological and historical past and their causes</a> in Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society>, containing the soundbyte: \"Yet we must expect that secular variations of the quantity of carbonic acid in the atmosphere will occur and cause climatic variations of the same kind as those revealed by geological science. Thus a future Ice Age might possibly occur. But here we find a remarkable circumstance that has hitherto been unexampled in the history of the earth. This is the influence of Man on climate... Thus it seems possible that Man will be efficaciously to regulate the future climate of the earth and consequently prevent the arrival of a a new Ice Age. By such means also the deterioration of the climate of the northern and Arctic regions, depending on the decrease of the obliquity of the ecliptic, may be counteracted. It is too early to judge of how far Man might be capable of thus regulating the future climate. But already the view of such a possibility seems to me so grand that I cannot help thinking that it will afford to Mankind hitherto unforeseen means of evolution.\" In 1906 after winning the 1905 Nobel Chem.

There does not appear to be much ground for such an apprehension. The enormous combustion of coal by our industrial establishments suffices to increase the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air to a perceptible degree.\" Too bad for modern climate alarmists, in 1906 Arrhenius pub. <a href=\"Worlds in the making; the evolution of the universe : Arrhenius, Svante, 1859-1927 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive\"><i>Worlds in the Making: The Evolution of the Universe</i></a> (\"V\u00e4rldarnas utveckling\"), which is trans. to German in 1907 as \"Das Werden der Welden\", and to English in 1908, containing the soundbytes: \"Another process which withdraws carbonic acid [carbon dioxide] from the air is the assimilation of plants... [If] the percentage of carbon dioxide be doubled, the absorption by the plants would also be doubled. If, at the same time, the temperature rises by 4C, the vitality will increase in the ratio of 1:1.5, so that the doubling of the carbon dioxide percentage will lead to an increase in the absorption of carbonic acid by the plant approximately in the ratio of 1:3. An increase of the carbon dioxide percentage to double its amount may hence be able to raise the intensity of vegetable life... threefold\"; \"We often hear lamentations that the coal stored up in the earth is wasted by the present generation without any thought of the future, and we are terrified by the awful destruction of life and property which has followed the volcanic eruptions of our days. We may find a kind of consolation in the consideration that here, as in every other case, there is good mixed with the evil. By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the colder regions of the earth, ages when the earth will bring forth much more abundant crops than at present, for the benefit of rapidly propagating mankind.\" Hurray, in 1909 Am. physicist Robert W. Wood laid the greenhouse warming theory to rest in his paper \u201cNote on the Theory of the Greenhouse\u201d, with the soundbytes: \"There appears to be a widespread belief that the comparatively high temperature produced within a closed space covered with glass, and exposed to solar radiation, results from a transformation of wave-length, that is, that the heat waves from the sun, which are able to penetrate the glass, fall upon the walls of the enclosure and raise its temperature: the heat energy is re-emitted by the walls in the form of much longer waves, which are unable to penetrate the glass, the greenhouse acting as a radiation trap. I have always felt some doubt as to whether this action played any very large part in the elevation of temperature. It appeared much more probable that the part played by the glass was the prevention of the escape of the warm air heated by the ground within the enclosure. If we open the doors of a greenhouse on a cold and windy day, the trapping of radiation appears to lose much of its efficacy. As a matter of fact I am of the opinion that a greenhouse made of a glass transparent to waves of every possible length would show a temperature nearly, if not quite, as high as that observed in a glass house. The transparent screen allows the solar radiation to warm the ground, and the ground in turn warms the air, but only the limited amount within the enclosure. In the 'open,' the ground is continually brought into contact with cold air by convection currents\"; \"Is it therefore necessary to pay attention to trapped radiation in deducing the temperature of a planet as affected by its atmosphere? The solar rays penetrate the atmosphere, warm the ground which in turn warms the atmosphere bycontact and by convection currents. The heat received is thus stored up in the atmosphere, remaining there on account of the very low radiating power of a gas. It seems to me very doubtful if the atmosphere is warmed to any great extent by absorbing the radiation from the ground, even under the most favourable conditions.\" Robert W. Wood - Wikipedia R. W. Wood: Note on the Theory of the Greenhouse This didn\u2019t stop the erroneous CO2 greenhouse warming theory from spreading, as seen by an article in The Pueblo Leader on Jan. 28, 1913 claiming that because of the work of \"one of the greatest scientists in the world... Arrhenius of Sweden\", the \"proportion of carbon dioxide in the air will make the climate warmer, by acting like the glass roof of a green house. With the carbon dioxide increased from two and one-half to three times, the temperature of the whole world will be raised 3 to 9 degrees centigrade - and Greenland will have a good climate for farming. All the good soil of Canada will be in as temperate a climate as that now enjoyed by Missouri.... The increased heat will cause more evaporation of water vapor from the oceans - and as what goes up must come down, this will cause moister climates almost everywhere, and our dry-farming sections will become as wet as Ohio. And thent the passengers on this Good Ship Earth will have vast fields of good land, which are not good now, upon which to multiply - as it seems to be their fate to do.

Some scientists believe that this may have presaged the onset of the dramatic climate anomalies of 1972 that brought far-reaching adversities to the world's peoples. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that the bad climate of 1972 may be the forerunner of a long series of less favorable agricultural crop years that lie ahead for most world societies. Thus widespread food shortages threaten just at the same time that world populations are growing to new highs. Indeed, less favorable climate may be the new global norm. The Earth may have entered a new \u2018little ice age\u2019. Perhaps this future period will not be extreme as that around 1700 AD, but it seems likely, at least, to be a cooler period resembling the hemispheric climatic regimes of the period from 1880-1920.\" In 1975 the Nat. Research Council\u2019s U.S. Committee for the Global Atmospheric Research Program published the paper <a href=\u201dFull text of \"Understanding climatic change\"\u201d>\u201cUnderstanding Climatic Change: A Program for Action\u201d</a>, which talks about recent global cooling and only casually mentions CO2 as a potential source of AGW, waffling about the future trend and calling for more research: \"A striking feature of the instrumental record is the behavior of temperature worldwide. As shown by Mitchell (1970), the average surface air temperature in the northern hemisphere increased from the 1880's until about 1940 and has been decreasing thereafter. Starr and Oort (1973) have reported that, during the period 1958-1963, the hemisphere's (mass-weighted) mean temperature decreased by about 0.6 \u00b0C. In that period the polar and subtropical arid regions experienced the greatest cooling. The cause of this variation is not known, although clearly this trend cannot continue indefinitely.\" \"These climatic projections, however, could be replaced with quite different future climatic scenarios due to man's inadvertent interference with the otherwise natural variation (Mitchell, 1973a). This aspect of climatic change has recently received increased attention, as evidenced by the smic report (Wilson, 1971). A leading anthropogenic effect is the enrichment of the atmospheric C02 content by the combustion of fossil fuels, which has been rising about 4 percent per year since 1910. There is evidence that the ocean's uptake of much of this C02 is diminishing (Keeling et al., 1974), which raises the possibility of even greater future atmospheric concentrations. Man's activities are also contaminating the atmosphere with aerosols and releasing waste heat into the atmosphere, either (or both) of which may have important climatic consequences (Mitchell, 1973b). Such effects may combine to offset a future natural cooling trend or to enhance a natural warming. This situation serves to illustrate the uncertainty introduced into the problem of future climatic changes by the interference of man and is occurring before adequate knowledge of the natural variations themselves has been obtained. Again, the clear need is for greatly increased research on both the nature and causes of climatic variation.\" Full text of \"Understanding climatic change\" Meanwhile on Aug. 8, 1975 Chicago, Ill.-born Columbia U. geophysicist Wallace Smith Broecker - Wikipedia published the paper <a href=\"https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu//files/2009/10/broeckerglobalwarming75.pdf\">Climate Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?</a> in Science mag., coining the terms \"global warming\" and \"climate change\", predicting an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 403 ppm by 2010 along with a global temp increase of 1.10C, with the soundbyte: \"If man-made dust is unimportant as a major cause of climatic change, then a strong case can be made that the present cooling trend will, within a decade or so, give way to a pronounced warming induced by carbon dioxide. By analogy with similar events in the past, the natural climatic cooling which, since 1940, has more than compensated for the carbon dioxide effect, will soon bottom out. Once this happens, the exponential rise in the atmospheric carbon dioxide content will tend to become a significant factor and by early in the next century will have driven the mean planetary temperature beyond the limits experienced during the last 1000 years.\" He went on to utter the soundbyte: \"Climate is an angry beast and we are poking at it with sticks\", becoming known as \"the Godfather of Global Warming\". Clear through 1979 papers were being published in the peer-reviewed scientific journals about global cooling, and had been increasing every year since 1960, although they were being overtaken by global warming papers.  So, the debate was far from settled in 1981 when NASA head climate scientist James E. Hansen hooked up with Canadian Marxist Maurice Strong of the U.N. and American Democratic politician Al Gore to hijack the debate into a plot for Marxist world government, first by resurrecting the almost dead greenhouse theory and later by inventing incredible \u201cback radiation\u201d powers for CO2 to get around its limitations. James Hansen - Wikipedia Maurice Strong - Wikipedia Al Gore - Wikipedia On Aug. 22, 1981 The New York Times published a front-page story by Walter Sullivan titled STUDY FINDS WARMING TREND THAT COULD RAISE SEA LEVELS about NASA's James Edward Hansen and his forthcoming global warming paper in Science, conceding that the past century's warming lays within the range of historical averages but predicting the emergence of an anthropogenic global warming signal, with the soundbytes: \"A team of Federal scientists says it has detected an overall warming trend in the earth's atmosphere extending back to the year 1880. They regard this as evidence of the validity of the 'greenhouse' effect, in which increasing amounts of carbon dioxide cause steady temperature increases. \"The seven atmospheric scientists predict a global warming of 'almost unprecedented magnitude' in the next century. It might even be sufficient to melt and dislodge the ice cover of West Antarctica, they say, eventually leading to a worldwide rise of 15 to 20 feet in the sea level. In that case, they say, it would 'flood 25 percent of Louisiana and Florida, 10 percent of New Jersey and many other lowlands throughout the world' within a century or less.\" \"Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is primarily a result of mankind's burning of fuels, is thought to act like the glass of a greenhouse. It absorbs heat radiation from the earth and its atmosphere, heat that otherwise would dissipate into space. Other factors being equal, the more carbon dioxide there is in the atmosphere, the warmer the earth should become, according to the theory.\u201d \"Dr. Hansen and his colleagues cite the observed surface temperatures of Mars and, particularly, Venus as support for their predicted greenhouse effect. The surface of Venus, with an atmosphere formed largely of carbon dioxide, is at about 900 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201d \"The possibility that the greenhouse effect could alter the earth's temperature has long been debated. Scientists have agreed that carbon dioxide is increasing, but disagree on whether temperatures are also increasing. The major difficulty in accepting the greenhouse theory 'has been the absence of observed warming coincident with the historic carbon dioxide increase,' the scientists wrote.\u201d \u201cResearchers were further confounded by an apparent cooling trend since 1940. As a result, many atmospheric scientists concluded that the climatic effects of increased carbon dioxide might not become detectable for many decades. But the Government scientists say they see clear evidence that carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution has already warmed the climate.\u201d \"Their conclusion that the climate has warmed by almost one degree in the last century is based on a re-analysis of global observations, paying special attention to the Southern Hemisphere. 'The common misconception that the world is cooling,' they say, 'is based on Northern Hemisphere experience to 1970.'\" Notice where it says Federal Government scientists. James Hansen was their leader, coopting NASA\u2019s Goddard Inst. of Space Studies (not the entire space org., just one part connected with Columbia U.) to his views to this day. From day one they\u2019ve had an agenda to push CO2-driven global warming with not even the slightest hint of fairness and objectivity. So much for debate. So no surprise, in 1988 Hansen, in cohoots with Al Gore, Tim Wirth, Maurice Strong and other leftist and globalist Marxist scientists and politicians gave a big speech to Congress claiming that global warming has been detected and is due to CO2, launching the globalist Marxist U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with much fanfare and funding, like a NASA rocket taking off from Cape Canaveral. Ever since it has compromised scientists, academics, and journalists to push their agenda and shut down all debate, so if there ever will be a real honest fair one it will be possible only after they\u2019re gone, sorry. Only Pres. Trump is attempting to organize a fair panel to investigate, which predictably is drawing howls from the IPCC octopus, who don\u2019t want any debate to mess up their plans to bilk trillions in order to end capitalism and set up a Marxist utopia.

That is, are we humans responsible?And arguably a third question that I\u2019ll address at the end.Are we in for much more of it?Science is evidence-driven: a theory without supporting evidence is \u201cjust a theory\u201d. The work of Horace de Saussure (late 18th century), Joseph Fourier, John Tyndall, and Svante Arrhenius (all 19th century), dealt not with global warming per se but with the role of greenhouse gases in the greenhouse effect. They considered that effect a Good Thing because without it the oceans would be frozen solid. No one back then envisaged it ever becoming a Bad Thing. In fact Arrhenius said he\u2019d welcome any additional warming (but then he lived in Sweden, a relatively cold country). In those days it seemed inconceivable that a single terrestrial species could significantly heat an entire planet all by itself. (It is still inconceivable today for some, or at least so they would have you believe.) The evidence today for a \u201cyes\u201d answer to 1 is pretty clear from the red curve in this graph, which plots global mean land temperature since 1850 (CRUTEM4).  But if you block off everything past 1980 then the picture up to that point is nowhere near as clear. In 1980 a few theorists were predicting not just global warming but anthropogenic global warming. But as of 1980 there was no substantial evidence that this would actually happen, or even could happen! And without evidence AGW is Just A Theory. Nevertheless the governments of a few countries felt it might be advisable to keep a weather eye out on the situation, since any such global phenomenon could potentially have a huge impact on the whole planet if what the theorists had been envisaging recently came to pass. So in 1988 the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the younger United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) joined forces to form the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). As the situation unfolded during the following decades 1990\u20132020, this precaution turned out in retrospect to be well-advised. In 1980 it was perfectly reasonable for scientists not to worry, but any doubts about significant global warming gradually evaporated during the following decades. Ok, so that pretty much settles the first question, while also showing why it took decades to settle. But then what about the second question? How much of that can be blamed on us? The AGW hypothesis is based on rising CO2 causing rising temperatures. But we know that warmer water expels CO2, the mechanism by which warm beer goes flat faster than cold beer. So perhaps this rise in temperature is all due to the accompanying rise in CO2 plotted by the blue curve. Much of climate denial is based on this (quite correct) observation that rising temperatures cause rising CO2. Climate deniers love to appeal to what happened during the Medieval Warming Period (MWP), roughly 1000\u20131200 CE. Since we have reasonably good data on CO2 since the year 1 CE based on ice cores from Antarctica, let\u2019s take a look at that.  According to Michael Mann\u2019s critics, the MWP was even hotter than today\u2019s climate. And indeed we can see the expected accompanying rise in CO2. For the Christian Era this was an even higher rise than for 150\u2013300 CE, which the Hatepe Eruption of the supervolcano Taupo (Volcane Explositivity Index 7) would appear to have brought to an end. But if the MWP was even hotter than today, then today\u2019s heat cannot explain any rise higher than 285 ppm! That is the fatal flaw in the arguments of the critics of Professor Mann\u2019s hockey stick. The Scottish inventor James Watt was an 18th century precursor of the 19th century American inventor Thomas Edison. Whereas Edison spent years making the incandescent light bulb a practicality for indoor and night time lighting, Watt spent years making the steam engine a practical replacement for water wheels and windmills. In 1776 he made the first sale of his new and improved steam engine to the Carron Company. The conventional wisdom is that the Little Ice Age ended of its own accord without any help from us. This would seem to be borne out by the accompanying rising CO2, beginning in the 1770s. But when you consider how successful Watt\u2019s engine became thereafter, it is just as plausible that this rise in CO2 was not caused by any rise in temperature but by the emissions from the coal-burning clones of the Carron Company\u2019s pioneering steam engine. The VEI 7 Tambora eruption of 1815 made 1816 \u201cthe year without a summer\u201d. So cold in fact that it was able to push down the rising CO2, at least briefly relative to the pace associated with the many preceding eruptions. But then CO2 shot back up, and with the exception of another smaller pause in 1850 that I can\u2019t explain, has not stopped increasing ever since, today reaching 410 ppm. But surely humans couldn\u2019t have emitted that much CO2? Well, according to the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), we humans have burned enough fossil fuels to account for roughly twice the CO2 presently in the atmosphere, above and beyond the natural background of 280 ppm. The blue curve in the following graph plots rising CO2 (y-axis) against accumulated fossil fuel emissions (x-axis), both in units of gigatonnes of carbon (GtC, nowadays called PgC for petagrams of carbon, same thing but an official SI unit).  As can be seen from the red trend line the relationship is remarkably linear! Of the 400 gigatonnes of carbon emitted during 1900\u20132014, slightly more than 200 gigatonnes has been added to the atmosphere. The remainder has been drawn down by increasing levels of photosynthesis (happy thriving plants!), along with Le Chatelier\u2019s Principle shifting the equilibrium in the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s surface, both terrestrial and ocean. And since it might not be immediately obvious how the y-axis of this graph relates to that of the preceding graph, here\u2019s CO2 for 1006 CE to 2017 CE.  Professor Mann\u2019s critics have objected to his \u201chokey stick.\u201d But this plot of CO2 since 1006 CE has nothing to do with Mann, the work having been an international effort with much of it being done by Australian scientists working in the Australian Antarctic Territory and in Adelaide, South Australia, where they analyzed the cores they brought from Antarctica. This graph is clearly no \u201chokey stick\u201d but a real hockey stick of a graph. So what\u2019s happening \u201ctoday\u201d, namely since 2000? Well, here\u2019s rising atmospheric CO2 as observed at 9000\u2032 on Mauna Loa on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island.  The simple \u201craised exponential\u201d formula [math]280 + 1.0203^{y - 1776}[/math] not only covers the whole period since 1006 CE to within \u00b15 ppm, but matches recent rising CO2 even more accurately! And note how even in the past two decades the annual rise in CO2 has grown from 1.83 ppm in 2000 to 2.24 ppm in 2010 and 2.68 ppm in 2019. Now I suggested at the outset that there might be even a third question, are we in for much more of this? Well, if this keeps up, by 2050 the annual rise will be 5 ppm per year, and by 2100 it will be 13.6 ppm per year! There seems to be this wishful thinking that something will slow this growth rate down. Many decades ago this was based on the \u201cpeak oil\u201d theory. But just as Mark Twain once supposedly wrote, \u201cthe reports of my death are greatly exaggerated\u201d, so have the reports of peak oil also been greatly exaggerated. No one has a clue when, or even if, peak oil will be reached before 2100. There is certainly no shortage of carbon in Earth\u2019s crust to maintain the supply long after 2100. My projection, FWIW, is that not only is global warming happening (my answer to question 1), and not only are we humans responsible for it (my answer to question 2), but (my answer to question 3) it is going to get much worse before we humans collectively acknowledge that we need to take it far more seriously than we have to date, and actually do something that will mitigate the exponentially rising level of anthropogenic CO2 defined as the excess over nature\u2019s natural background of 280 ppm.
