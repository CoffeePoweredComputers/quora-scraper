Even if I do read only half of them but retain its crest, master my reading potentially, I will be more satiated. These are the books that by all means I aspired to read from a long time but couldn't manage to do so. Now, since I have got ample hours, I keep drumming this long yearning of mine. Here is the bucket list: Premchand's Collection A House for Mr Biswas The Tale of Two cities The Three Musketeers Currently, I am on a beautiful journey with Mr Mohun Biswas to own his long yearned house. Good Luck! ",
