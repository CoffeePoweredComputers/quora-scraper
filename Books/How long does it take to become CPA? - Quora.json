            "answer_text": "First of all you need to know the requirements of the State Board of Accountancy in the State in which you live in order to have some idea. At its simplest, however, you need: college degree with a minimum 30\u201340 hours in accounting, auditing, tax, business law. Basically, a masters degree.Then you must pass the CPA exam itself which is no small task, although it is easier now than when I took it in 1985. I had to take all four parts of the exam at my first sitting, which is no longer required. Now you can take one part at at time but the kicker is once you pass one part you have only two years to pass the other parts or you lose the first part you passed. I was an instructor for Becker-Conveiser CPA Review course for 20+ years, and I\u2019ll honestly tell you any reasonably intelligent person who\u2019s willing to put in the work can pass the exam. In all the time I was an instructor I began to be pretty good at foreseeing who would pass and who wouldn\u2019t [at least not initially]. I remember two candidates in my 20 years I KNEW would NEVER pass the exam no matter how many times they took it. In fact, I don\u2019t know how they even graduated college\u2014they were completely lost. They didn\u2019t even understand the basic accounting equation.IF you plan to work in a CPA firm or some other type of private/corporate environment, in which being Licensed is in your best interest, you are required to put in a certain number of years [two for me] working in the profession under a licensed CPA who would be able to verify the type of work you did in the profession.Keep in mind, however, even if you don\u2019t want to practice as a licensed CPA [someone working in government, for example, although I did stay licensed], the paper with your name on it saying you Passed the CPA exam is still yours whether you become Licensed or not. You can put that in a frame on your wall at work, even if you don\u2019t license\u2026you still earned it.I forgot to add one little detail: I PASSED ALL 4 PARTS OF THE EXAM AT MY FIRST SITTING [sorry, but it still feels good to say that even now].That\u2019s all there is to it! ;) Good Luck!

            "answer_text": "Congratulations! You have taken and passed all four sections of the CPA Exam. (1) Are you a licensed CPA? (2) Can you put the three letters CPA behind your name on your brand new business cards? The answer to the first questions is most likely no. Concerning the second question, until you become a licensed CPA, you definitely should not consider putting the letters CPA on your business cards. CPA Licensing: Time Varies by State You may be wondering if there is a set of uniform education, examination, ethics, and experience requirements to become a CPA. After all, that is a great question. You just finished taking the Uniform CPA Exam, meaning the exam was the same regardless of where you took it. However, CPA licensing is not performed at a national level; it is administered at the state level, meaning state licensing procedures tend to vary from state to state. You can find up-to-date information about CPA licensing at your specific State Board of Accountancy website. However, the AICPA has developed a centralized website to assist aspiring CPAs navigate the nuances of each state licensing process. \u2018Show Me\u2019 an Example For example, if you were considering becoming a licensed CPA in the Show Me State, Missouri, you would need to verify that you meet its unique requirements. In particular, This Way to CPA indicates that for Missouri, you would need to be at least 21 years old and a resident of the state of Missouri. In addition, you would need to have a social security number, a bachelor\u2019s degree with 150 hours, 33 hours in accounting, one year of accounting work experience, and a completed written ethics exam. So how long will it take for you to become a licensed CPA in Missouri? Assuming you have met the education requirements to sit for the CPA Exam in the first place, the major time constraints that you could encounter would be age and work experience. If you are younger than 21 years old, then the constraint you face is time itself. However if you are like most candidates wanting to become licensed in Missouri, then you will need to wait a year after working in the accounting profession to qualify as a licensed CPA. Therefore, if you are like most candidates, you can stick to the following formula: 5 years of school + 1 year to pass the Exam + 1 year of work experience = 7 years to become a CPA While every state\u2019s licensing requirements are different, you can expect that it will take about 5 years of college plus 1 or 2 years of working and studying to become a CPA. To figure out your specific requirements, please review or your State\u2019s Board of Accounting Website. And as always, remember to breathe. ",
