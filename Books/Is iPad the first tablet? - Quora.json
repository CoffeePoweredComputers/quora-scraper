            "answer_text": "Definitely not. The first tablet was perhaps the Styalator pictured below. This piece of hardware was released in the '50s and capable of a real time handwriting recognition.   In '93 Apple (company) released it's first shot at a tablet, a machine running the Newton OS by the name of MessagePad. It featured the revolutionary idea combinging handwriting recognition with editing.      Come 2002, Hewlett-Packard (company) released the Microsoft Tablet PC which brought a decent user interface to the tablet experience. This beast was running a slightly modified Microsoft Windows XP.    In 2007, Dell (company) produced an equally clunky Latitude XT, featuring a multitouch screen.    In 2008, HP released a decent tablet/notebook called the Touchsmart TX2. The computer was widely praised for combining strong hardware with intuitive software. It had a 2.1GHz CPU, discreet graphics, 8GB RAM, 500 GB hard drive and a webcam.     Then at last, Apple produced a pretty device called the iPad with a 1GHz CPU, and a whopping 256MB of RAM running iOS (like the iPhone) on 64 GB of memory. The lack of webcam didn't stop 300,000 of them being sold on the first day of release- in April of 2010. This was a true tablet, it was a screen without a keyboard or stylus. While previous tablets could be interfaced with by fingertip- this was intended to be interfaced primarily by fingertip.    In October of that year, HP released the Slate 500 running Windows 7. This device was also intended to be interfaced by fingertips, featured a screen and no keyboard. It featured a webcam, 1.8GHz processor, 2GB of RAM, and a 64 GB memory. HP was able to sell about 9,000 of these in a month's time.

            "answer_text": "Apple created the first tablet with the Newton MessagePad in 1993. This is what we know and recognize as a tablet computer. The media lambasted the handwriting recognition in the MessagePad (which actually did work, the media simply expected absolute perfection with the first word you wrote, which is not how recognition works, it learns your specific handwriting and gets better over time) so Apple had to drop the MessagePad, fortunately Apple expends years of effort and then created the iPad which is the first successful tablet as we know it today. Naturally there will be folks who are disagreeable with acknowledging that Apple is such a great innovator and will claim that there were many tablets before the Apple Newton MessagePad, and to those folks I say that using your flawed thinking would logically lead someone to conclude that Clay Tablets from thousands of years ago were the first tablets, yet we all know that if the original poster is using about an iPad then the subject actually is a digital personal electronics device that a normal human being could walk into an electronics shop, buy that device, take it home and use it for many different useful functions, in other words, what is the most iPad-like device that I would actually buy and use in real life, as an ordinary person and the answer to that is the mother to the iPad, the Apple Newton MessagePad.
