            "answer_text": "I believe that econometrics is useful for IB. Different types of regressions can be useful in figuring out relationships. For instance, you can run a regression on returns and  IPO related variables (e. g.Size, industry, CEO dummy) to figure out what factors are related with IPO returns. Also, you can use a logit regression to predict bankruptcy (very crude). Furthermore, you can use propensity score matching to see whether a certain event such as Seasonal Equity Offering has an impact on the firm's performance. Hence, econometrics can be helpful in IB. However, remember that econometrics entails certain strong assumptions and is far from perfect. Econometrics is just another tool and for rigorous analysis further investigation and usage of other methods is required. Personally, I find econometrics to be useful in helping me focus on important factors and narrowing down on firms of interest, saving me time on processing unnecessary information. ",
