            "answer_text": "Almost certainly. If something is in the public domain, it\u2019s perfectly legal to print it out, to make thousands of copies, to create derivative works from it, etc. You\u2019re not supposed to upload anything to Project Gutenberg unless it\u2019s in the public domain. That said, I don\u2019t know how they enforce that, so it\u2019s possible that something on that website is really under copyright protection. For example, the novel Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin is in the public domain. But somebody could write an introduction to it that would still be under copyright protection. If the introduction and the original novel were uploaded to Project Gutenberg, I\u2019d hope somebody would notice and remove the copyright-protected material. But if that didn\u2019t happen, you could be sued for reproducing the copyright-protected material without permission. ",
