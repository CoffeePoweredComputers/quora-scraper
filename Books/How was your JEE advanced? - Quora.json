            "answer_text": "Pre-exam \u201cHow hard can the paper be?\u201d were my thoughts after having practiced nearly a hundred JEE-Advanced mocks by the day preceding the exam. I had chapters like p-Block, d-Block left to revise, particularly the properties of compounds not in NCERT. That too at 6:00 pm on 26th when my plan was to be done by 24th. Then I called all my teachers to take their blessings and sat for the final time with the d-Block Sheet (Study Material) of Allen. It turned out I had not paid attention to Alloys, Ores and Uses of compounds in any of the blocks. So more tasks added. It was unexpected this would keep me busy till 11:00 pm. I had planned to sleep by 9:00 and had taken dinner before that but like many others, this plan failed too. So now I had alloy names, ores etc. in my mind and hopefully nothing was left. I went to bed at around 11:15, knowing that I could hardly afford 6 hours of sleep. And now comes the worst part - I couldn\u2019t sleep. It was not the pressure of the exam I guess but rather the exhaustion due to too much Chemistry. But I lay there, trying to force myself into much-needed rest. It didn\u2019t work until 1:00 am when I couldn\u2019t help crying. My mother suggested I try something that relaxes me and I did so by watching a MrBeast Gaming video.  Quite energetic, friends!!! This did help. Then my father came to the rescue and literally caressed the soles of my legs for an hour before he felt I was breathing heavy. So finally I had slept, thanks to my parents and God. I woke up at around 6:00 (again it was expected to be at 5:00). The center was around 2 km, so no pressure. I finally got ready fast, offered my morning prayers to God and left after a few quick rounds of Bhramri pranayam. The exam center was obviously well maintained and I couldn\u2019t spot any failures of SOP. I got seated still with a bit of nervousness over how my sleep could affect my exam. Noticing around 60 pages in the scribble pad gave me some relief. Paper 1 The pattern was quite common with 6 each of MCQs - Single and Multi as well as 6 Numericals. I progressed with my strategy of 60 minutes of Physics though I got a bit stuck on some questions and by the end of 70 minutes, I had one Physics question left. Then I moved to Maths where my expected time of stay was again 70 minutes. Maths felt easy until I met the estimation question (where I tried estimation after integrating). I marked one and then moved to numericals where again I left 2 due to time shortage. Next was Chemistry, quite simple (rather unexpected) and short. I finished Chemistry to have with me around 15 minutes for 4 questions (one with partials marked). Now came in my biggest problem of jumping fast over the questions when low on confidence. I could solve only one of these. I come out a bit sad thinking that only a miracle in Paper 2 could help towards a single digit rank. Break As instructed and understood, I tried to refrain from discussions with friends with my phone obviously switched off at home. I told my father I had performed around average in Paper 1 and he motivated me saying it must have been hard for all. While in the van, I suddenly figure out how another of them was to be done (the Physics magnet over Al disc one) and this made me a bit more morose. I reached home (not everyone is lucky enough to get a center so close), took lunch and tried to sleep for like 10 minutes before another round of the pranayam. Then I got ready for the next innings. Paper 2 The weird pattern surprised me but also brought a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be fun\u201d, I thought. As always, I started with Physics, realized that the question with the cuboidal water container had a square root of 23 in its answer, so obviously not an integer. Then I tried to see what they wanted us to i.e. the normal incidence and got 3. Confusion ensued and I finally marked 3 (the other one gives 4.5, again weird). Then came the piston question where I saw C_v of the gas was missing and thus another question in the same section turns out to be wrong. I felt they wanted us to take temperature to be constant throughout but some sense told me there would be more equations than variables. I still solved and got the answer of 6 in like 5\u20137 minutes. Rest of the Physics seemed easy compared to Paper 1 and finally I had 1 question left with 70 minutes gone (the two wrong ones under painful review). Then quick Chemistry time (a bit off my pattern) - I completed the integers and Multiple Correct Questions before going to Maths which again seemed easier compared to Paper 1. Leaving a question there, I was left with 6 Chemistry numericals and 35 minutes - quite an achievement I felt! The leftovers felt a bit lengthy. Finally I had 2 questions left by the time the exam ended. I came out happy, telling my father that this paper was easier and had some wrong questions. He gave a smile and asked if the lack of sleep affected somehow. I replied it didn\u2019t. I talked to my teachers who said the first paper was easier. What a contradiction!!! Post-exam With the Allen answer keys, I calculated while noticing each mistake of mine, to end up with a 326. I had expected borderline fight for IIT-B with this score and my Bhaiya even said that IIT-D was no less than IIT-B to cheer me up if possible. Then I got to know Muhender was also in the same range. It could have been the case that both of us messed up as many 100 percentilers had claimed they left none or 1\u20132 questions and I felt my mistakes were too silly to be repeated by someone. One answer was 13.32 and I marked 12.32 because of a calculation error in the last step. Similar sillies had cost me around 12 marks (3 questions). When the answer sheets were released and the situation started becoming clearer, I realized it was not bad at all. Now that the result is known, it might seem obvious to conclude that lack of sleep hindered performance but who knows!! It could have rather boosted my inner self/will in a better way than the energy a sound sleep could have imparted. After all, concluding something without experimentation is unscientific!!! Saying that I am not satisfied with my result would be being unthankful to God. However there remained some regret over a score lower than what could have been obtained one perfect day. My final scores - Paper 1 - 170/198, Paper 2 - 170/198 P - 114/132, C - 113/132, M - 113/132 A lot of equalities I see! Unintentional obviously xD\u2026 PS - I would still advise one to refrain from last-day studies, fun is better it seems :P !!  ",

            "answer_text": "I guess I am a little bit late to answer this question since I am describing the exam 7 months later but I would try to be best in describing those 8 hours . Prologue So after 2 years it was the final day for which I and lakhs of students prepared for one of the most difficult and prestigious exams of the country, namely JEE Advance 2016. Since it was May and I was giving the exam in Delhi, it was quite hot. Many instructions (some being funny) were given to the students like not wearing a full sleve shirt or any bracelet. I entered the examination centre (a normal school) and found my seat (the first bench in middle row) . I was not a little bit pressurized since I didn\u2019t had much hope left for JEE Advance due to my bad performances in JEE Mains (153/360) and BITsat (288/450). So I knew that it was one in a million chance that someone like me would get selected for IITs. So I just went in there and hoped to do my best, not for selection but for inner satisfaction. Enough with build up and coming straight to the main part :- How was your JEE advanced? Before seeing the question we had 5 minutes to do some formalities and study the marking scheme. I got amazed and happy at the same time after seeing the partial marking (with high negative marking). I planned to do as many as questions correctly, get the most from the partial marking and be careful about the -2 negative marking. And here comes the bell and I opened the seal to find the questions. Paper 1 (9:00 - 12:00) I attempted Maths Section at first (since I was least bad in it) only to find that I can\u2019t score in that section. Then came the Physics Section which is my weakness but desperate times call for experimentation in my case. I did some questions but lost enthusiasm in between due to some difficult questions and doing the same section for an hour or so. Then comes the evergreen Chemistry Section which is meant for scoring. I did some questions but the same Physics Section thing happened again . After it was just jumps from one section to other to do atleast some parts of question (I remembered partial marking). One thing I forgot to mention that the invigilator was very pretty. But as a motivation, I only looked upon her if I could complete a question. The Break (12:00 - 2:00) My father was waiting outside the school for me. I told him that I performed badly. He was dissappointed and we went to spend some time and fill our stomachs in the nearby Haldirams outlet. I ate a lot and called my IITian brother what to do in next exam. And as a reply that was surely not expected and was most accurate, he told me to do my best in next paper. We reached the exam building and I was ready for my Round Two with IITJEE believing that I would give a serious fightback :-P . Paper 2 (2:00 - 5:00) This paper was one of the worst paper that I had given in my life (still better than my JEE Mains). The Physics section was undoable for me. Chemistry Section was some relief but couldn\u2019t perform as expected. And the Maths Section gave a serious competition to Physics section. I went to pee and have some water to relax but neither the break or the attractive invigilator provided any relief. All this went till 4:30 pm and I realized that I hadn\u2019t attempted even 1/3rd of the paper. I thought of using all my strength, willpower and each of my brain cell in last half hour. Somehow I did a few questions and the nightmare came to an end. So thats how I performed In my JEE Advanced 2016. As everyone speaks (even the AIR 1), I would say that I could perform much better. But the most important thing was that I was satisfied. I tried each and every question and gave it all I had at that time. So, I couldn\u2019t ask for more (except a few more minutes during exam :-P). . . . . P.S. - I secured a rank of 2908 in that exam with a total of 151/372. ",
