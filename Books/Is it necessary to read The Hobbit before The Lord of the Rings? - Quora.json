            "answer_text": "Rather than telling you what to read first, I\u2019ll show you how to make up your own mind. The best choice is different for different people.  Frodo (left) and Bilbo (right). Who\u2019s story to read first? Background The Silmarillion is the entire background history, covering the creation of the world and the first several thousand years of the histories of elves and men. It is beautiful, but it is heavy going. It is more like reading the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) than it is like reading a novel. It takes a lot of motivation to go through - it may not hold interest. So it gives the whole background, but it is not the best place to start. The Hobbit occurs just before the Lord of the Rings, and at the tail-end times of the span of the Silmarillion. The primary character is Bilbo Baggins, age 50. The tale tells of how he helped 13 dwarves bring an end to Smaug the Dragon and, incidentally, found a magic ring and brought it home. It is a children\u2019s book, though it can also be read by adults because of its literary and moral depth. The Lord of The Rings begins when Bilbo is 111 years old, and tells of Frodo, Bilbo\u2019s nephew and heir. The magic ring Bilbo picked up turns out to be much more powerful, and more evil, than anyone knew at the time. It is Frodo\u2019s destiny to destroy it. The Lord of the Rings is a series of adult novels published in three volumes and often referred to as a trilogy, though it is broken up into 6 books plus an appendix. Recommendations Often, The Lord of the Rings is the best place to start for an adult reader, 16 years old or older. It has excellent continuity as a novel and great depth of spiritual and literary meaning. It has a lot of characters that you can relate to, as well. I\u2019ve read it 9 times through myself, and picked up parts again and again. There is always something new. Children age 10 to 12 who like to read can do well with The Lord of the Rings, as well. For children up to age 15, and for adults who like children\u2019s stories, The Hobbit is the best place to start. Also, if you already know you love Tolkien, and you want to understand the end of the Third Age in order in time, then read The Hobbit and then The Lord of the Rings. Whichever order you read them in, be prepared for a huge change in style. The Hobbit was written as a children\u2019s book, and The Lord of The Rings was written as a deep adult novel. If you have seen the movies, then you know how the stories relate to one another. Feel free to read them in either order. Most people find it best to tackle The Silmarillion last. It is a fun read if you ask, \u201cWhere did Wizards come from? How did elves, dwarves, and men all come to be? Who are the secret powers that seem to be helping Gandalf by sending sea-winds and eagles?\u201d But if you love languages and creation myths and stories of angels or gods, you could read The Silmarillion first. Wait, There\u2019s More J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s son Christopher has spent his life sorting through his father\u2019s notes and delivering something like 10 volumes of additional material. They provide a lot of depth and resolve most of the contradictions that appear to come up. Some of us like to read those, as well, even though they are fragmentary. You can also get a lot of background on the web by looking up The One Wiki To Rule Them All. Enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "I strongly recommend Stephen Benedetti\u2019s answer. I do know people who never read LOTR because they were so disgusted by the very first sentence, which more resembles the quaint and child-like quality you find in \u2018The Hobbit\u2019: \u201cWhen Mr Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence . . .\u201d One of the remarkable and delicious aspects of LOTR is that the story begins as a parochial children\u2019s comedy about every day hobbit folk in their home counties of the Shire, but as the canvas gradually enlarges to encompass a huge and exotic continental vista, it becomes darker, more epic and more psychologically complex. It is as if we have been taken from childhood, through adolescence to adulthood. In my opinion, it really does not do to read the Hobbit first, unless you actually are a youngish child, around 7 or 8. Tolkien did not intend us to read the Hobbit first; unlike the films, in which Peter Jackson rather unsuccessfully attempts to match the two styles, the Hobbit is very definitely written for children of a young age. We even know who they were, since Tolkien had his own family circle in mind. Also, Tolkien had no plans to write LOTR when he wrote the Hobbit. The idea of LOTR as a \u2018sequel\u2019 is misguided. It is not like Harry Potter, where there may always have been an idea of future volumes, and therefore a consistent style. It is more the product of a reverse process, having been written as a newly conceived story, but with a backward eye, to make it seem historically consistent with the earlier book. Tolkien was persuaded to write LOTR later, after the unexpected success of the Hobbit, and made it up, using some of the characters and ideas in the Hobbit. This was easy for him to do, since both draw on a much larger common history. Because it evolved this way, there is absolutely no need to read the Hobbit first; LOTR covers all the things you need to know about the earlier story, but in more appropriate grown-up language. It can be disappointing to go back, after reading LOTR, to read the Hobbit, because of the differences, although I found it charming also; but it is not half so disappointing as setting yourself to read an 8 year old\u2019s adventure story, when you are really ready for the great epic that is LOTR. That is enough to put you off entirely. ",
