            "answer_text": "In short yes but be careful. If you share an account with people try not to listen to the same book at once, let's say you stopped on chapter 5 and your family member started from the beginning and stopped on chapter 10. When you go to listen again it will start up on chapter 10 since that is where it was lasted stopped. (Although this might be avoided if you download the book and listen to it with out internet since it can't sync up to the account it will not move it forward for others. But I have not tested this) Also a huge problem is the fact that people like different things and you might have the problem of who gets to pick the next book you buy with the audible credits since they let you buy ANY book for about 12\u201315 bucks (that price depends on your subscription or if you get the 3 pack of credits) which is far cheaper than most audiobooks. And lastly if you have younger kids using the account that may not have the same level as self control as you, with audible you can buy an audiobook in a few clicks. So you could wake up with 10 new books and a huge bill if you are not careful. ",
