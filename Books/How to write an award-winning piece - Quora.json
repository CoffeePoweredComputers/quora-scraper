            "answer_text": "GIrl, you just have to write for months and months and probably years and years to get those muscles tones and sharp. No one (or a rare few) breaks out of the gate winning. Everyone has to earn her way up. You will win awards if you work hard at the craft, listen to criticism and learn from it, and be prepared to cut and edit ruthlessly. Develop a thick skin. And then, when you\u2019ve had some successes publishing, submit those pieces, or unpublished if the contest demands it, and you\u2019ll win. There\u2019s no magic trick. It\u2019s hard work. I look forward to hearing about your wins! ",
