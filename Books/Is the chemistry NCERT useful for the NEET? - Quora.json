Lets sum up altogher Theories: You have to follow NCERT theory whole heartedly because NTA is going to set the paper everytime out of it. Be it Physical or Organic give it a read! For Organic don't push your limit so much out of NCERT then you gonna miss practical organic chemistry, environmental chemistry etc. :)[These little chapters are so important and very exciting to go through them and all know about the Chromatography question that asked this year, believe me, most of the teachers dont teach it in class,so do it yourself, NCERT is with you!]. .. OMG I missed Inorganic !! You will miss all your marks if you left your Inorganic NCERT untouched! You gonna miss NCERT in your exam day Do NCERT INTEXT+EXERCISE, Its good And here comes NCERT EXEMPLAR, my fav book, according to me its like HCV CHEMISTRY. Dont miss chapters like atomic structure,metallurgy, environmental chem,chem in your everyday life,practical organic chemistry etc. from your NCERT. THANK YOU SK ",

The darmstadium question was probably the most annoying question in chemistry and it was picked from a previously insignificant table in class 11 ncert. Thankfully I happened to read it a few days earlier and managed to remember it through some weird abbreviation \ud83d\ude05 ",
