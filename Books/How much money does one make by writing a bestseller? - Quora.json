            "answer_text": "It depends upon what you mean by \"bestselling.\" And I only know US publishing. Some books are called bestselling when they hit top ten rank in an Amazon sub-sub-category. Others are called that after months in a row on a NYT list.  For traditionally published authors: If I recall correctly, and very roughly, the PW \"The Red and the Black\" series (once per year for many years), used to show that the top dozen books per year sell more than a million copies. The next hundred or so are between 100,000 copies and a million.  Most of them seemed to sell most of their copies as mass market paperbacks, with another 1/4 as hardbacks.  Let's run some numbers. A mass-selling hb probably has a list price of $22. Most of the royalties will be in the \"after 10,000 copies are sold\" level, so they get 15% of list price per copy sold. That's $3.3 per copy, or $330,000 per 100,000 copies sold.  For a mass market paperback, most of the royalties will be in the 10% level, and the price will be maybe $7.99 per copy, or $0.79 per sale in royalties. That makes it $79,000 per 100,000 copies sold.  Combine the two, and you're looking at an \"average\" of about $140,000 per 100,000.   Some bestselling authors actually get more per copy, because their publishers deliberately overpay on the advance. They do this so that they can pay more money without setting a precedent on royalty rates for other authors.  Self-publishing authors rarely sell many copies in paper (maybe 1 or 2% of their total), even if they're top-selling overall on Amazon.  So we'll ignore that side. They're making most of their money on ebooks, and mostly on Amazon. They sell as well as bestselling traditionally published authors -- on Amazon. But they don't generally take the risks required in order to sell many copies in the other outlets that traditional publishers exploit. Traditionally published bestselling authors get about 1/3 of their sales on Amazon, and as ebooks.  Using that, and the PW numbers, we come out that a handful of bestselling self-published authors will hit 300,000 copies per year, per title. Maybe a hundred of the rest will hit 30,000. They're usually publishing their books at about $4.99 per copy. And they get 70% of that, or $3.50. From this they pay any costs that they have, but let's ignore that side. They're getting about $1o5,000 per 30,000 copies. That's somewhere in the same range as the traditionally published author for the same level of prominence.  Does that help? ",

            "answer_text": "The range is so vast that any single-point answer will be almost useless. At the high end, a book that spends years on a bestseller list can generate many millions of dollars of income. Here's some sample math:   Assume such a book sells 1 million hardcover copies (at $25 apiece, list price), 500,000 e-book copies at $12.99 apiece and 1 million paperback copies (at $10 list price.) Hardcover royalties are about 15% of list price, so the author gets $3.75 million there. E-book royalties can be 25%, so the author gets approximately $1.6 million there. Paperback royalties traditionally have been 7.5% of list, which would generate $750,000 of royalties. So we're at about $6 million already. Throw in extra money for non-U.S. rights, movie rights, and other ancillary deals, and such a mega-hit could produce $8 million or more.  Authors of course get advances against expected royalties, and sometimes the advances prove more generous than the actual earnout of royalties. Publishing houses that think they are signing a future bestseller tend to offer advances of $250,000 or more. In some cases, books have made only fleeting appearances on bestseller lists but have still brought the author $500,000, $1 million or more in advance income. The fact is, though, that most bestsellers don't sell nearly that well. It's possible to make a brief spike appearance on a bestseller list and still end up with less than 50,000 copies sold in all formats. (Unusual, but possible.) In that case, total income may not be all that much beyond $100,000. I'm going to guess that the earnings distribution looks a bit like the gamma distribution in the upper right of this sampler. http://www.xycoon.com/gamma.htm. That would mean a mode of somewhere around $200,000, a very short tail to the left and a long tail to the right. There certainly are many, many books that spend a few weeks on bestseller lists and end up with no more than 100,000 copies sold in all versions. Also, consider the proliferation of bestseller lists these days. A book that is briefly No. 33 on the New York Times extended bestseller list for hardcover nonfiction may end up with smaller sales still. Upshot: even if you think you can write a best-seller, unless you're Stephen King or Walter Isaacson, it's not going to be a path to millions. ",
