            "answer_text": "Joe Biden will be a boring president. He will install knowledgeable, qualified people in his cabinet and key leadership positions. He will show up to work early in the morning, listen to his advisors, read his daily briefings, attend meetings and delegate tasks to the right people. He will hold press conferences where he answers questions fairly consistently. He will have a staff member who sends official tweets on his account that are checked for accuracy and that they meet administration guidelines. There won\u2019t be many of them - certainly not dozens in a single day. Tweets will never be in all caps. He won\u2019t fly all over the country holding \u201cCHEER FOR ME\u201d rallies. He will govern from DC most of the time, and will travel when necessary. He will play a reasonable amount of golf - mostly at Andrews Air Force Base. He will never fly to Florida for the weekend. He won\u2019t bring his kids to the G7 and let them push their way into official meetings and photographs. He won\u2019t give a young, unqualified relative charge of healthcare, criminal justice reform, the Middle East and pandemic response. And if a staff member fails their security clearance five times, that person will be unemployed, not sitting with the Joint Chiefs. His foreign policy will be reasonable, measured and expected. Under President Biden, the US will begin to regain ground on the international stage. Unreasonable tariffs will be lifted. Treaties will be carefully considered. Our allies will once again be able to count on us. Our enemies will stop celebrating their influence over the orange menace. I am looking forward to a world where I don\u2019t even hear about the president of the US for days at a time, where things are just running as expected, and I can stop worrying about what Combover Caligula is going to do next.

            "answer_text": "If Joe Biden wins, is he going to be a good president? Firstly, thank you for asking this question. I\u2019ve never seen so much nonsense poured into one question\u2019s thread* (and had to block and mute so many people over it) and it\u2019s up against some pretty stiff competition. Kudos! Secondly, you don\u2019t get to elect a good president this time. Biden, of course, by any reasonable means will be better than Trump, by miles - no wonder, a piece of plywood would do a better job - but he will, at best, be an okay president. He is too old and too conservative to make the difference that would be needed to lead the US away from the path to fascism Republicans led you on. But, you needed to have the most agreeable candidate possible to reduce the risk of Trump had he gotten another term to destroy the country once and for all. You actually needed a Sanders or a Warren to make this right, but\u2026 you would have voted Trump over them. So you only get a Biden. *Actually it\u2019s not that much nonsense at all. It\u2019s just the same nonsense over and over again. \u201cBiden is a socialist! If he is elected, the US will turn into Venezuela! Only Trump can save us!\u201d. That position has nothing to do with reality. ",
