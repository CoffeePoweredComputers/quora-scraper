            "answer_text": "Imagination is the key! And children have a wonderful sense of imagination. Why do we start with books that have pictures? This is to help the child visualize about the character and places. A book with pictures magnifies a child\u2019s world thus improving the imagination. When starting with books that have fewer pictures, start by dramatizing the story. Use your own words to explain the story the first time. This feeds the child\u2019s imagination and boosts the enthusiasm to know more about the story and to read more books as a result. There are a few words that a child may like from a book, for example, a book had the word \u201cupsidownosis\u201d where the plane gets dizzy and just turns itself upside down. Try using that concept while talking to kid even after the book has been read. It will stay in the child\u2019s memory and make the child want to go back to the book. Develop your own ideas once you get a hang of what the child is interested in. Each child understands things in a different way and parents are the best to know this and work on it. ",
