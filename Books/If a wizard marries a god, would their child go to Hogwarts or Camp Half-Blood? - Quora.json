            "answer_text": "I guess this could be handled in the matter of which power they have. I once saw a head canon saying Hecate, the goddess of magic, made her children go to Hogwarts. Now back to the question. If it is Hecate (or other minor gods), they would probably send their children to Hogwarts. If it were the Olympians, they would be sent to Camp Half Blood. The purpose of this camp in the first place is to protect them, and stronger the god is, more danger for the children. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean a goddess? Wizardfolk are still living in the Middle Ages; no way a wizard would have been allowed to marry a god. Gods can do as they like, or so I am told. Zeus could kidnap the beautiful wizard Ganymede, and he did. But, if they had any offspring, it was not recorded. Not even Zeus would have married a wizard, though. Hera would have been furious, and people, wizardfolk included, should be wary of a furious Hera. ",
