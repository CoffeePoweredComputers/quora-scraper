            "answer_text": "If you mean is he a good place to start reading Japanese fiction in Japanese, I\u2019d say yes. Murakami writes clearly and simply. If, however, you want an introduction to Japanese literature, per se, I\u2019d recommend something along the line of Ms. Temmer\u2019s list. In my opinion, Murakami\u2019s work probably should not be considered \u201cliterature\u201d, as such, but (sometimes) entertaining, usually well-written popular fiction.. ",
