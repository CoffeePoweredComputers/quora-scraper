            "answer_text": "No. Anyone who has tasted both will tell you that salt isn\u2019t really sweet at all, and sugar certainly is. You can taste both for yourself and prove this. We taste sweetness by the presence of, surprise, sugars. Molecules like glucose (in your blood), fructose (in fruits), sucrose (common table sugar). Or artificial sweeteners like aspartame or saccharine. Pure table salt consists of only one chemical - sodium chloride. While, perhaps, trace amounts of sugars or other sweet-tasting chemicals made their way into your table salt, there absolutely won\u2019t be enough in there to make the salt sweeter than sugar, unless you put them there intentionally.

            "answer_text": "In reality, the apple has the same amount of sugar than before, as well as the same amount of acids. But, the salt diminishes your perception of the acidity, allowing you to taste the sugar compounds better. So the apple is not really sweeter, you just have an enhanced ability to taste what sweetness is there.",
