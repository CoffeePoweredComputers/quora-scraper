            "answer_text": "Wiress, being a District 3 tribute, most likely used her skills on technology to win the games. An example of this was in the 74th Hunger Games where the District 3 boy used land mines in attempt to stop other tributes from stealing their food supply, or too kill them if they stood afoot on one of the mines.
