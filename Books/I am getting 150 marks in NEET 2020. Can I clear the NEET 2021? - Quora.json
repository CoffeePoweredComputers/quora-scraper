            "answer_text": "ofcourse you can if you study with full grit and determination this year. Do remember, for giving an exam like NEET your past doesn\u2019t define you but your present actions do. I can say this because i myself had been a dropper. In my first attempt i scored around 250 marks but in the next i did it. So, never lose hope.Nobody else but you yourself know your caliber and capacity to do hardwork. Also, new mistakes while preparation are always welcome but never repeat your previous mistakes. Learn from them and move ahead. That\u2019s the key.Therefore straighten up your back, have positivity in mind and prepare for the next year\u2019s exam. Best wishes. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all remember, never ever compare past with future. Future is in no ones hand but yes definitely we can expect a better future by learning from our mistakes in past. Be optimistic and not pessimistic. Everyone is not a valedictorian and hence some may take more than an year or two to clear NEET. Since you just appeared for the entrance exam, rest for a while maybe a week or two and then again start preparing with your full willpower. If you are appearing for NEET under someone\u2019s pressure then please I would like to request you to stop doing that, a time will come when you\u2019ll realise that whatever you were doing was giant piece of junk and that would be too late. Develop some high income skills along with preparing for NEET. Once you have developed such skills, you\u2019ll feel a lot more confident and motivated. These skills are copywriting, marketing etc. They\u2019ll help you get experience and even if you couldn\u2019t crack NEET you will definitely be worth a lot due to such skills. Best of luck ",
