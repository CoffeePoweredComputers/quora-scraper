            "answer_text": "This question wants a Bible perspective, not a Quran or a Mahabharata perspective, right? Angels? There is actually no such thing as \u201cangels\u201d in the Hebrew text of the Bible. I urge rabbis when not teaching in Hebrew or Aramaic, to no longer use the pagan term \u201cangels\u201d. But use the Hebrew/Aramaic term malakh when speaking in English. The concept of \u201cangels\u201d, archangels, hierarchy of angels, demonic angels, and angels battling Satan in heaven is of pagan origins. REJECTED by the Hebrew text of the Bible. Those pagan concepts had been very prevalent around Israel and yet Nahum, Nehemiah, Ezra, et al REJECTED them from the canon Hebrew text of the Bible. I mean, if they were true, why were these ideologies rejected from the Hebrew text canon? The term \u201canggelos\u201d originated from Hellenistic-Persian origins of messenger demigods. \u201cAnggelos\u201d is a completely inaccurate and too aliasing term to equate to \u201cmalakh\u201d. Because \u201canggelos\u201d would alias to pull in the undesirable pagan ideologies. Aliasing = terminology in signal-engineering/information-science to describe a signal/message masqueraded as another message by sharing a common subset. Satan? The Malakh Michael is a great and powerful Satan. Though not mentioned in name, in Numbers 22:22, the malakh MikhaEl became satan to defend Israel against the Balaam. So if Jesus or any \u201cangels\u201d were to battle the Satanic Malakh Michael, their defeat would be catastrophic. Only the most faithful are given the extreme honour to be a Satan for Almighty G\u2019d. IMO, Satanic powers enforce the laws of Physics in the Universe. Because in Hebrew, \u201csatan\u201d essentially mean \u201cimpediment\u201d or \u201cbarrier\u201d. They are brutally precise in enforcing divine laws. They are like quality control engineers of the Universe. Whereas, the term satan is also used for perverse human influences. Influences that would stand as impediment against your daily lives. Are you a Bible fundamentalist? The Hebrew text of the Bible is original and root text of the Bible. Which means you cannot contradict the Hebrew text of the Bible. Be a Bible fundamentalist - do not contradict the Hebrew text of the Bible. Any text that contradicts the Hebrew text (i.e. the Torah, the prophetic books, the philosophic books written in Hebrew) should be thrown out. Hellenistic Judaism (which gradually morphed in Christianity) were the primary cause of corruption and contamination of Israel. They were impressed with and beholden to the Hellenistic philosophies as well as the imports from Egyptian and Iranian mythologies. That is why they created the semi-translation known as the septuagint and the apocrypha, to project a new \u201cJewish\u201d ideology that would be inclusive of Hellenistic and pagan ideologies and mythologies. It was an ecumenical Roman nationalist movement to present their new concoction of \u201cJudaism\u201d as a universal religion to unite all the religions to unite the Roman empire under one-world religion. The septuagint more original than the Masoret? You must be joking: The septuagint originals perished with the burning of Alexandria in the Roman civil war. The septuagint was reconstituted in the 5th century and there is no proof of the originality. Whereas, regardless of the minor textual differences of various copies, the Masoret existed as individual books since the time of Ezra, as attested by the Dead Sea scrolls. To say that because the individual books were bound together only in 11th century proving the septuagint is older is very deceptive. Textual analysis: To read my dry and boring textual analysis: Genesis 2: There are no \"Angels\" in the BibleSatan does not existThere is no \"hell\" in the Bible",

            "answer_text": "Angels are created beings\u2026much higher than humans, they are nonetheless employed under God\u2019s direction. They aren\u2019t God\u2019s \u2018sons\u2019, more his helpers. I\u2019m going to disagree with other posts here and say categorically that yes, Jesus WAS a created being. Colossians 1:15, 16 15 He is the image of the invisible God,a the firstborn of all creation;b 16 because by means of him all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth, the things visible and the things invisible,c whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. All other things have been created through himd and for him. As the \u2018firstborn of all creation\u2019, Jesus was made before anything or anyone else\u2026so he\u2019s existed for aeons, BUT NOT \u2018forever\u2019. He then assisted God in the creation process. As God\u2019s Son, (and having given his life for mankind) he has been given great status by his Father, far above the \u2018rank and file\u2019 angels. But he is still very much subject to God. When on earth, he quite clearly told people \u201cOnly the Father knows\u201d (when the End will come.) Not \u201cI know but I\u2019m not telling you\u201d - quite clearly \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d There is no such thing as a \u2018trinity\u2019 . ",
