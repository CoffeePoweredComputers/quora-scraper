            "answer_text": "This is a difficult one. If I were to guess, I presume it would be something like \u201cThe Postmodern Punk\u201d. This title was once given to me as a joke, but for lack of a better choice, I wouldn\u2019t dismiss it as entirely trivial. For one, it makes for a distinctly cool title. Probably unique too. So it stays. Now for some context. Punk, hmm. Well, I don\u2019t quite think that it does justice to my usual demeanour, in fact, I consider myself as anything but a badass. I hope (although I am not too sure if I do), that this isn\u2019t the commonly held perception among my friends. But at the same time, the title as a whole does convey sincerity in its reflection of my ideals. Not that I consider a world devoid of meaning to be only capable of being scrutinised through the lens of postmodernism. Still, the disregard for belief systems while maintaining my own, or the assignment of equal credence to conflicting schools of thought while still choosing one over the other, are fallacies that I can never possibly hope to resolve.  So what remains is the sense in nonsense, the gibberish in prose, and the mediocrity in superiority. Everything being relative, I\u2019d happily be the postmodern punk than have to choose an alternative. By now, I guess I have chosen enough to know the fallacy of my choices. ",

This includes strangers, family and friends. My actions are second nature not calculated to get anything in return. We are here on this earth for a limited amount of time. The maker has endowed us with certain abilities and capabilities so why wouldn\u2019t we share and help others. My wife sometimes criticizes me for helping too much. We have agreed to disagree on that point. We are blessed with great health, good mechanical background and solid financial savings. Why not share these with others in need. Yes sometimes a person in need conflicts with other priorities; such is life. Rearranging our priorities works in most cases. It\u2019s just the way I\u2019m wired. ",
