            "answer_text": "There are good things. For instance, it was nice to read a novel \u2013 a romance novel at that \u2013 and not encounter a single sex scene. If Robert Pattinson hadn't decoded Bella's inner monologue about Edward for me, I could have gone on believing she just enjoyed him visually. And olfactorily. There was a genuine friendship between Bella and Jacob for a while, and a genuinely fake one between Bella and five or six classmates. Aside \u2014 do you think the human friends are a good paralell to the vampire friends? Like, Lauren being a human version of Rosalie? I'm not sure too much thought was put into it, but I suppose that would make Angela Bella, which would make Tyler Edward\u2026 maybe it just doesn't work. The stuff with the Classics was not well done, but it was nice. It wouldn't be much of a Classic if you could ruin it with YA. Can't you just see an American Idol judge going \"you are such a horrible writer I no longer enjoy any version of this story\". Especially when you have to dig so deep just to realize that, oh, right, Lizzie and Darcy hated each other at first, and so do these two. Alice was an interesting character. So was Jasper. I suppose there's a chance I'd read a spin-off with them. The opportunities for analysis are fun. You don't have to feel like a lit major to do it. Romeo and Juliet has plenty of light symbolism, that Robert Frost poem has heat and cold symbolism, but this series barely has any symbolism at all. What it wants to say it just says. Sure, there's the whole \"sexual attraction is vampirism\" thing and the \"young men can turn into ferocious beasts\" thing, and also Jessica's analysis of zombies, whether it was commies or consumers, but that might just have been in the movies\u2026 Another thing that's nice is when the Native American characters are written like any other characters. Some of the powers were pretty creative. More potential. I guess I'd also read a spin-off about the Volturi and their thousand years of vampire reign. ",
