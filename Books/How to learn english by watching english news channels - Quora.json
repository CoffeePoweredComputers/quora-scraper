            "answer_text": "Watch TV Online and Read the Newspaper at your Learning Level. If you know a lot of English, you may be ready to read the The Wall Street Journal or to watch videos from CBS News. If you are a beginner, no problem: you can watch and read the news online at a level that works for you, then go to more difficult stories at your own speed. The New York Times has a weekly column on its Learning Network just for American English language learners. The stories are written in a way you can understand. After you read, take the quizzes on punctuation and word choices. BBC offers a daily program Words in the News for British English fans. Commentators (the people who read the news) list important words then read a story that includes those words. The words can be tough (difficult), though. Don\u2019t be surprised if you need to review the words in the quiz that comes with the program. Voice of America creates two levels of news for English learners on its web site. You can listen to English podcasts or videos and read along with the text. The VOA Learning English Channel includes subtitles (the words at the bottom of the screen) and the commentators speak slowly and clearly, at about a third slower than regular broadcast. That gives beginning learners a chance to keep up. Plus, listening online means you can hit the pause button and read the subtitles at your own rate. ",

You could pay attention to the way they pronounce words to improve your pronunciation and diction. You might find out new words that you can learn the meaning of. But the most important benefit is probably the phrases they use. You\u2019ll be able to learn new ways of asking or stating the same thing, without sounding arrogant r impolite. Notice how news channel debates manage to extract answers out of their guests without actually accusing anyone of anything. ",
