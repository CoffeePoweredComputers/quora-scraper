SEBI Registered Investment Adviser regulations mandate that only paid service is valid, and RIAs can not provide free trials or free subscriptions. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 [Last amended on July 03, 2020] However, you can post your queries on any of the forums on FB, Quora for free and get indicative advice. Remember, nothing is free - if you won\u2019t work free for life, don\u2019t expect people to give free advice. ",

            "answer_text": "Finding a financial advisor is always free. Ask friends, ask your CPA, go to a Fidelity or Schwab office. Now, if you are asking for an advisor to help you manage your wealth and give sound advice that you do not have to pay for, then let me ask you: Now that YOU have paid for university and gained expertise in your field, are you willing to work, and enhance your employers income, for free? I didn\u2019t think so. Well, neither do I. If you want free - you do the research, study, screw up and gain experience on your own dime. ",
