            "answer_text": "Well, you can start by deciding what kind of comic books you want to read. There's a huge variety of comic books out there, not just superhero comics. If you've already decided on what you want to read (e.g. Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Uncanny X-Men,Jughead, etc.) you need to decide on how you're buying your comics. If you have a local comic book store they may be able to help you pick out a comic book title.  If you don't have a local comic book store, Marvel have a digital comic book service called Marvel Unlimited. It is very affordable, much more affordable than buying several printed titles. ",

Left to right, top to bottom, here\u2019s a semi-random page from Spider-Man. You start a the top left, and then work your right and then down.  The bottom with three panels\u2026 Same thing top left where Spider-Man says \u201cGood lord\u201d and then on to the next one top center, with the yellow box at the bottom and finally the yellow boxes at the bottom of the 3rd panel. Now to make it clear this is for Western style comics Magna are different. ",
