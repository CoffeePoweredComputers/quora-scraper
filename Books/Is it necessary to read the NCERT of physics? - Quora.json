But remember one thing, not ratta mar style you have to understand each and every concepts and formula as well. HC VERMA is a good reference book for physics preparation it helps you to practice in examples and also it helps you to understand concepts clearly\u2026 Other than NCERT I think you don't need to learn anything because NCERT helps you to practice more in Examples and objectives as well.
