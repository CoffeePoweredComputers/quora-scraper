            "answer_text": "As of 2020, Wishnet has come back with a new website and revised plans to fool customers. People talk of speeds. Let me tell you something more. Value for money: If you pay 590 rupees per month, you will get 100 mbps from Alliance but 70 mbps from Wishnet. That is not all. Today wishnet customer representative clearly mentioned that customer MUST use Wishnet's own DNS servers. This is technical but I will tell you what it means. It means monopoly. You cannot take advantage of other company servers which are faster on a worldwide scale. You will not be able to block advertisement directly in your network. Wishnet will keep the power to redirect you to websites which they like with their DNS servers. Now I know what you are thinking, doesn't Alliance do that as well? But let me ask you this\u2026if you are selling yourself to slavery\u2026would you settle for less like that? At least get the 100mbps speed for your hard earned money. ",

So out of curiosity I subscribed to wishnet and after using for almost 2 years here is my view. browsing speed is around 500kBps the best part is the torrenting speed\u2026on an average i get around 6 to 7 MBps and believe me in india this speed is more than any other famous service providers offer.. price:- my plan is of \u20b9550 per month most important part no caps i.e no limit on data usage unlike others who say unlimited but put a cap and throttle. same goes for alliance so go with any of them.

What is most unfortunate nobody is attending phone calls or dockets complaint at their help line numbers. The franchise only raising the finger to the Wishnet Center for their fault. Despite, WISHNET are sending SMS to pay the monthly charges and threatening of withdrawal of service. Between the time I contacted Alliance and they have provided the service within one day. ",
