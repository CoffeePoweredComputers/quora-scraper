            "answer_text": "By proximity. The books I care about, use and refer to most are those I shelve closest to where I sit and work. I call those my primary storage. Those shelves are regularly rotated as books fall in and out of favor. I\u2019m staring at 2 series right now, in fact, that ought to be moved off those shelves. Here are my current primary shelves:   Secondary storage are books I want to keep for historical (personal or genre) value but don\u2019t have room for in the primary storage. These live in the guest room and must be weeded once a year at least in order for them to not take over the room. This room also houses the English-language manga collection. I wish I had a better option for these. Tertiary storage is the office, given over to small press- and self-published comics, called doujinshi. I cull these every few years, mostly keeping historically important work, early amateur or semi-pro work by well known artists I like and especially awesome series parodies. That collection is way overdue for a weeding. It\u2019ll be a summer project. Quarternary storage is in my basement, where rare books, magazines and genre-critical items and the entire collection of all Yuri magazines live in containers to keep them free from moisture and bugs. If I have to go to another level of storage, it\u2019ll have to be a storage unit. Sadly, the units nearest me are not temperature controlled - they are glorified garages, in a moist area near the river. Fine for your old truck, not so for books. That means any unit I got would have to be a few towns over, which would make access awkward. I was really hoping that the town would greenlight a brand new temp-control storage unit within walking distance, but apparently I was the only one who wanted it. That would have solved a lot of issues and my house would have much more space. Oh well. (^_^); Here are all the photos of the 2019 state of the Yuri Collection. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm, I used to change the arrangement of my books in my bookshelves a lot when my collection grew through the years. Though now I\u2019ve settled with only one kind of arrangement in my bookshelves. The shelves farthest from the corner of my room is where I place the books I love to reread and in the order from the first book all the way to the last book. I even dedicate one whole shelf to the authors I personally like, Rick Riordan, James Dashner, and Haruki Murakami. There are a total of seven shelves I got in my room, (I\u2019ll take a picture of it when I get home on monday from my trip.) My system works that all new books, and all time favorite books occupy the first three bookshelves in my room, while the other four bookshelves are for books I most seldom in reading or are books that are from my sibling\u2019s collections. The corner top bookshelf is where I place the thickest hard bound books.  Here is the bookshelve of my favorite books. I would have taken a photo of the other five shelves but I had posters hanging over them hahaha ",
