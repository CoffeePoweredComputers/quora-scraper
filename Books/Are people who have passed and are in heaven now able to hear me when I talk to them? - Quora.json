            "answer_text": "I would say yes. Many times I have asked for them and most often they come to me in a dream state. I would question that but most are not the same age as I knew them and often I do not recognize them until the moment the dream ends. It is as if they are saying you can only go this far. In my youth I struggled with sleep paralysis and could often see what was around me as I slept. After years of learning how to counteract it, I began to go out of my body. But the connection was always in a dream state that they control. Be aware of your dreams practice remembering them when you awake. In my belief the dream state is the heaven we seek, ironic if we have been seeing it all along. I think dream is the easiest way for them to make contact. So ask and be aware and you may get a response. It may be just me ,I don't know, but every encounter no one has talked, it was more of a telepathy and they show you things. My grandfather once showed me a bees nest. I struggled for fifteen years to figure out why. Then on the first day I moved into his old home. The neighbor knocked on the door. He asked if he could take care of a bees nest on the side of the house since he was taking care of one on his. I said ok, sure. It dawned on me then what my grandfather had showed me. He was aware 15 years before. To me it was like a holy shit moment, that's when I began to really think it was all real. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people who have passed away are conscience of nothing. They are in the grave and await a resurrection to life in the future, they are not in heaven. Ecclesiastes 9:5 NW \u2014 For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten. However, there are some anointed Christians who have been resurrected to life in heaven since Christ\u2019s kingship was established in 1914. Whether they can hear us or not is irrelevant, because they do not answer prayers, only God answers prayers, offered to him in the name of his beloved son Christ Jesus. Psalms 65:2 NW \u2014 O Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come. John 16:23 NW \u2014 In that day you will ask me no question at all. Most truly I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will give it to you in my name. ",

The truth is, nobody knows for sure but if talking to them and expressing how much you miss them and care about them makes you feel a little bit better, then by all means do it and do it as many times as you need to. I hope this helps ",

Simply because they keep wealth to themselves. If one person dies due to lack of health care everyone in that Society who fails to support universal health care is going to hell. It's perfectly obvious. If you let one person suffer due to inaction you are going to get nice and toasty. ",
