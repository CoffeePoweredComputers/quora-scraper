            "answer_text": "According to publishing specialists active in the current market, less than 250. In revenue, this translates to one of two things: either not enough to cover your advance from a traditional publisher (which means that publisher will not publish you again in the future) or 70% of whatever your book price is times 250 from Amazon (which equals out to your book price times 175, which might be as low as ~$170 or as high as ~$1700, give or take). In other words, the average book doesn\u2019t sell enough copies to make it worth its own publication, at least not monetarily. (Keep in mind that we\u2019re usually talking about a book that has taken months if not 1\u20132 years to write, not to mention whatever costs of editing and design that have also gone into it.) So perhaps the actual answer to this question is not a number but a quasi-numeric concept: not enough. Why does this happen? Why does so much writing work go to waste and so many great stories and messages wither away unread? In my experience, this is due to two main factors: Low quality writingAsk any publisher why they reject so many manuscripts out of hand, and either the first or second answer they give you will be something along the lines of \u201cbecause they\u2019re unreadable.\u201d (The other answer will be \u201cbecause the author has no following,\u201d which I\u2019ll talk about below.) Look at bad reviews for Amazon books across the board, and a LOT of them are for books that are full of typos and errors, are too unclear or vague or highbrow to understand, or are just thinly-disguised sales letters in book form. And look at one statistic: the average reader only ever makes it about 20% of the way through a book. After that, they get bored, get distracted, or give up. Why? Because even if a book isn\u2019t terrible, it still has to be good enough to compete with everything else that a reader could be doing\u2014almost all of which get them entertainment, education, or both a LOT faster than reading a book does. The bottom line is that in today\u2019s writing and publishing world, it\u2019s not enough to be halfway decent anymore. It\u2019s not even enough to be good. If you want to hold a reader\u2019s attention, your book must be great. And far too few writers go any further than halfway decent. As long as it\u2019s good enough for them, many assume, it\u2019s good enough for the rest of the world. And with very few exceptions, this is never true. Even the really good writers need to revise their work, and work with book coaches and editors to hone and refine their words, and care about the quality of their work beyond just finishing it in the first place. Little or no publishing strategy.There are so many rags-to-riches success stories in publishing these days that most authors can\u2019t help but hope their manuscript will get picked up by one of the big 5 publishing houses (and/or become a runaway Amazon sales monster) and make them the next E.L. James or Tim Ferriss. Problem is, hope is not a strategy. It makes us feel good, but it doesn\u2019t tend to get us anywhere. Many of these authors approach publishers with a \u201clet\u2019s make a deal\u201d attitude, saying that if the publisher will just pick them up, they\u2019ll work themselves into the ground to market the book. Problem is, trying to bargain with someone who doesn\u2019t need you (and for whom you\u2019d do all of that work anyway, so offering it doesn\u2019t help them) isn\u2019t a strategy either. It\u2019s an invitation to be taken advantage of at best and turned down flat at worst. A lot of self-published authors, meanwhile, try to boost their sales by putting on a huge Amazon launch\u2014which often does get their book up to an average or above-average number of sales. Problem is, in order to do that they typically make the book free or heavily discounted, so they don\u2019t actually make much if any money from the launch. Plus once the launch is over, sales tend to drop back to zero unless additional marketing efforts are employed. An Amazon launch is not a strategy either, though it is a tactic that can be included in one. A publishing strategy isn\u2019t something you hope for, bargain for, or set up a one-shot tactic to make happen. It\u2019s something you plan for and set in motion over time, usually starting well before you\u2019re even thinking about publishing. It involves building a platform where you can interact with your readers, providing value through that platform, and gradually growing the platform until you have a lot of people already waiting for your book because they already know you and want to read what you write. If you\u2019re a business owner or entrepreneur, it also includes building the platform into your business, so you can use the book to help the business grow. And this kind of strategy applies whether you want to self-publish or go the traditional route. So the good news is that if the average book sells 250 copies or less, it\u2019s actually pretty easy to be above average with your book. But the bad news is that in order to make that happen, you\u2019ll need to commit to doing more than the average author ever does, both in terms of the quality of your book and in terms of your publishing strategy.

            "answer_text": "The average sales per title are utterly without meaning. There are vastly different numbers for mass market paperback novels, trade-paperback original novels or trade non-fiction, hardback original trade books, and for non-trade titles in any of a hundred sub-categories. I can only speak about the US, but here's how you find a number that MIGHT mean something to you.  There are about 50,000 trade titles from mainstream publishers per year. They'll sell between 1500 copies (a disaster, but it happens a lot) and a few million (which happens a handful of times per year).  An okay sales number will be 5,000 to 15,000 copies.  Mass market paperbacks must break 10,000 copies per title to break even, and they're very high risk, but also high reward if things go really well (which is really rare). That's why only a few of the largest houses do them.  THEN there are self-published books. The numbers for these are FAR worse. They come in three basic groups.  There are the pros who are taking charge of their own careers, and who are doing their homework on production, covers, layout and text design, marketing, distribution, and so on. They may be in trade fiction, trade non-fiction or non-trade, but they have their own publishing companies, and you'll be hard-pressed to tell the difference between their books and the books coming from any large NY-based publisher. This group has a few thousand titles per year, although it's growing. They sell about 1/3 as many copies as the same book would through a mainstream house, but the author makes much more per copy, since most of the sales are ebooks, through Amazon, and they're getting 70% of the sale. There is the newbie dreamer, who believes their friends and relatives, and thinks that their book is great. They hire a so-called self-publishing company, and their books sell a few dozen copies, and stop. This group is huge.This is the largest group of titles, but with the fewest practitioners. They're using computers to scrape copy-left content off of the web, assemble it into ebooks and harvest a dozen or so sales per title across thousands of titles. I hope that this helps you understand how many copies a \"bookstore-type\" book might sell in the US.  If you're not in the US, you need to pro rate those numbers. No other country's book publishing industry is more than a third the size of the one in the US.  ",
