            "answer_text": "Depends how you define civilization. Before we ever built cities, roads, or farms, semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers had their own culture going back hundreds of thousands of years. Here are some dates for context, and you can pick what you consider counts as \u201ccivilization.\u201d 8,500 BCE, first agricultural villages appear along river banks of the Tigris and Euphrates river. These proto-Sumerians do not yet have full cities, political unity, or writing. 8,000 BCE, proto-Sumerians using small clay tokens as inventory of goods during trade. 7,200 BCE first archeological evidence of Mesopotamians doing small-scale irrigation in the Tigris and Euphrates. 6,500 BCE Catal H\u00fcy\u00fck opens obsidian mining. Jericho flourishes. 5,200 BCE first archeological evidence of Egyptian villages doing small-scale irrigation. 4,000 BCE, first use of wooden plows in Sumer. 3,600 BCE, Egyptians establish political network of Nomes with Nomarchs as rulers. 3,500 BCE, Sumerian copper-tipped plow invented. 3,100 BCE, first evidence of papyrus harvests in Egypt.

            "answer_text": "If by civilisation you mean organised societies with permanent structures, it\u2019s about 100\u2019000 years old, which is the age (roughly) of sandstone blocks arranged in a semi-circle, discovered in Egypt. If by civilisation you mean modern humans, we have remains and cave art in Europe from about 45\u2019000 years ago, and the earliest known human permanent settlement 40\u2019000 years ago (in Australia). By 33\u2019000 years ago we\u2019d domesticated dogs, and by 20\u2019000 years ago we\u2019d discovered pottery. Sadly, we knew war by 14\u2019000 years ago (although, knowing humans, war is probably much more ancient). 10\u2019000 years ago we\u2019d domesticated sheep, goats, cattle, and crops like barley and corn. By 6000 years ago we were living in large communities of up to 20\u2019000 people. ",
