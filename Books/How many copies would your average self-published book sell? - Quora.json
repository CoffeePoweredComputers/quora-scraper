            "answer_text": "Great question! That depends primarily on a few things: The platform you publish onThe kind of marketing and self-promotion you engage inPresentation of the book itselfLet\u2019s break these down super quick: The Platform You Publish On If you are going to choose to self-publish, it is best to do so digitally. Never engage a vanity press or subsidy publisher (basically a printer who you pay to produce hard copies of your book). Because bookstores will not generally stock vanity press-printed books, you\u2019ll be stuck with boxes and boxes in your closet for years. Instead, pick online platforms that is well-known. Amazon\u2019s CreateSpace is closing, but they seem to be nudging people towards their KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) Print platform. You could also try Lulu or Kobo, so do some research there. Marketing & Self Promotion One of the benefits of traditional publishing is that you get a whole marketing team (and a marketing budget!) working on selling your book for you. If you choose to self-publish, you have to also take on the role of full-time marketing expert, which can be draining. Unless you are constantly pitching your own book, engaging on social media on behalf of your brand, and booking your own speaking gigs or events, your book sales will not be very impressive. Some easy marketing and promotion tips are: Make a Twitter account for your book and interact with your target communityMake an author website and make sure it\u2019s linked in all your social media, your email signatures, etc.Make business cards to hand out at events, readings, or networking opportunitiesCheck the HTML and meta text on your sales platform to make sure you are optimized for SEO and relevant search resultsThe only way people are going to find your book is if they know to look for it. The Presentation of the Book You\u2019d be surprised how far a little TLC will go when selling a self-published book online. People want to read your story. Your only job is to make it as easy as possible to get lost in the world you\u2019ve created. Ways to do that: Professional cover artGreat cover copy, description, reviewsWell-edited text with no typosWell-formatted document that is pleasant to look at and easy to readThe good news is: it\u2019s EXTREMELY easy to stand out from the crowd in the self-publishing marketplace (because frankly most stuff just isn\u2019t that good). But if you make sure that your book is on the right platform, sufficiently marketed, and presented well, you should be able to sell just as many as if you got it traditionally published! ",

            "answer_text": "How many copies would your average self-published book sell? One of the big self-publishing companies inadvertently gave a very precise answer to that question a few years ago. The company was congratulating itself on having published its one-millionth book. Wow, eh? And elsewhere in the same ad, it said that they have sold 2.3 million copies of those books. Divide 2.3 million sales by 1 million titles and you have an accurate idea of just how disastrously badly most self-publishing books sell. My now-deceased aunt published 5 books of poetry with that company. As far as I know, noone in the family could bring themselves to actually buy one of the books. We\u2019d seen her poems, and \u2026 we knew. Five books published, probably zero books sold. Most writers find that their mother buys a copy of the book, their lover buys a copy, and about half the time, they have one friend who is nice enough to buy one. Oh, and that average of 2.3 books sold? Some of the titles they\u2019ve published have sold thousands of copies. Going into self-publishing with a marketing plan, and doing some market testing, will quickly get your sales to well above that dismal average. But you didn\u2019t ask about that. ",
