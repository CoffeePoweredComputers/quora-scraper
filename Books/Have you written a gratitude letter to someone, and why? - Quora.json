This is what he supposed to be doing!\u201dAs she, Sharyn, told me afterwards, what he had said, as I was speaking, which for me only confirms why I asked both my mum and days to come and be there, and as God told me, gave me insight, that my mum at the time, would resist and attempt to persuade my dad to not go, even though she said yes, it was a tactical response, to go with the flow and change her and his mind at the last minute, so that\u2019s why, a couple of days before I was prompted to go and see them, ( so as you stop the Indians surrounding the wagons) and at 1st she agreed as well as dad, then she said she wasn\u2019t coming, attempting to and do much persuading dad to not go also, BUT God gave me a word what to say, so he will go, and on retrospect, now I realise why it was so important for him to be there ( her opposition & resistance as well, as evil working through her, so as to stop him, she was the king of lies and arguments, for no reason, just that it was me) AND it was for that exact moment when God spoke a word of knowledge through my dad, I have never heard him say anything like that, before, glory to God, in Jesus name, amen much love many blessings Gbu L ",

            "answer_text": "Have you written a gratitude letter to someone, and why? Yes I have. The one that sticks out in my mind is the one I wrote to my kids principal. When we moved into the city way back when, we needed to find a school for our kids because I could no longer homeschool. We checked out one school but it wasn't a good fit. We prayed and the Lord led us to a Catholic School in the heart of the city. We put 2 children in, the younger 2 went to preschool and my husband homeschooled my oldest daughter. The last 2 children were put in the Catholic School the next year. The principal and the vice principal as well as the teachers were so good to my kids. We received Wegman's scholarships at the time which allowed us to pay $100 a month for all four children. I was working part time and I believe my husband worked nights, it's hard to remember everything from years ago. Anyways, it was hard for us to make tuition sometimes but they always worked with us and never treated us or the kids any different. When my son graduated from sixth grade he had to switch schools because the school only went up to sixth grade. It just so happened that my Pastor along with some other Pastors opened up a Charter School. We decided that since my son was the oldest of those 4 that we wanted the girls to be at the same school with him. I then wrote a letter of gratitude to the Principal and Vice Principal expressing my appreciation to them and the teachers for everything they had done. I know many people don't recognize Catholics as Christians, however I have to say these people showed our family more love and compassion then some of the people in our \u201c Christian \u201c denominations. This is one of the reasons why I've learned not to judge who is saved and who isn't or which \u201c denomination \u201c is the chosen and which one isn't. The only denomination who are actually God's chosen people Biblically speaking are the Jews. The rest of us are gentiles, and by His grace and the shed blood of Jesus Christ and receiving Jesus in our hearts we have been engrafted into the Vine. Glory Hallelujah thanks be to God. The fruits were demonstrated continually at that Catholic School, and it's by one's fruits and the confession that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh that you shall recognize a Christian. ",

It was totally a surprise for me that she thought my considerate treatment of her grandson on a daily basis that she watched me and gave her netting items to me for her appreciation. I was doing my job what I supposed to do but she stated many are not truly kind or considerate for others and she felt I did care about him very much. I treat every patient the same way but some people noticed a good thing. I truly appreciate the recognition and I send small money in the card and thanked her for it. Such an event makes worthy of life. ",
