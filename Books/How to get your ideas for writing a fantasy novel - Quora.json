            "answer_text": "Honestly? There are a handful of ways that I come up with ideas. First, the point of where I start thinking up ideas is honestly on those boring bits of the day. Slow portions of a shift, break, commute to and from work (I keep the radio volume low to help this), relaxing at home, when chores need to be done, in the shower, while babysitting my nephew so I don\u2019t have to endure the 50th episode of his show that day\u2026 you get the point. Now, during those sessions of me thinking while I am bored, I normally think of various tropes that usually run rampant and what would be fantastic way to subvert them for stellar effect? What better way to agitate the standard fantasy fan boy than by taking the normally benevolent elves and turning them into a hyper supremacist society and then turning the orcs from mindless savages that most expect and presenting them with a hard, unapologetic people who actually have some valid points. As for my other main way of coming up with ideas\u2026 human history! Yes, it really is that simple. There is an abundance of material in the font that is the history of the species most readers are. It\u2019s a great place to make references when you need an idea of how to shape some particular things in the world and to have a understanding of how the existing bodies in your world might react. Lets be real, it\u2019s always nice when an assassination starts a war. However, between those days where the tensions rise and armies march, there is an enormous amount of things that happen, and making sure to include them adds depth. ",

            "answer_text": "By reading and watching. When I was writing my first novella, it started out as one thing, but gradually slipped in another complete direction because of all the crime and mystery stuff I\u2019ve absorbed by osmosis, as well as swaying into the Gothic. A bit of Agatha Christie here, a bit of Emily Bronte there. For the first of my fantasy trilogy which I\u2019m writing now, with the working title \u201cThe Purity of Evil\u201d, I can see those same influences creeping in. This time though, there\u2019s going to be a distinctly Japonic twinge to some of the major characters as well as the dialogue, thanks to the Japanese literature and manga/anime I\u2019ve read and seen. There\u2019s also the shadows of poets like Tennyson, McCrae and Owen in there too - their poetry about war left me with a distinct idea about how I wanted to portray it in my novels. Various sitcoms give me the foundation for the comedic element, including the bits of satire. Films, specifically cinematography and scores, give me inspiration for the moods of different moments and settings. Throw in a bit of Harry Potter for good measure, and well\u2026 that\u2019s me sorted. ",
