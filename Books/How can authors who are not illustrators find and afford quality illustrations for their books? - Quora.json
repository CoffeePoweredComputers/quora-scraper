            "answer_text": "Sites like fiverrr, Guru or upworks are home to a lot of illustrators offering their services. They mostly also have a portfolio on those sites, so you can look for the style you need. People on those sites are often starting out and try to get experience/publications so they might be willing to work for more affordable rates.Check out DeviantArt - Discover The Largest Online Art Gallery and Community and similar sites. Many illustrators use them to showcase their work. You might find the right talent there. Just contact them and see if you can strike a deal.Go to your local comic book store. And I am not talking about the big chains or Disney stores. I am talking about those small stores where the nerds hang out. The owners usually also have good insights into the local scene. They may be able to put you in touch with somebody.You can always try and contact an illustrator of a book you like. They may be looking for work.I almost forgot the (at least to me) most obvious one: If you live close to a university/academy \u2026 that teaches visual arts, you can go there and ask/look around. Many of these institutions also have regular exhibitions to showcase the talent they educate.",

            "answer_text": "Oh, gosh, I worked with graphic artists of all kinds during my advertising career. Because I did a lot of collateral (brochures), I had access to layout artists, illustrators & graphic designers as well as to printers. I hired a well-known West Coast political cartoonist to create an illustration for a print d I was making for a regional theatre. I paid a top-flight illustrator for an image to run in the Village Voice to advertise my own book. I even paid the best .gif animator I could find online to design an animated logo for a website I was running. This was during the \u201880s-'90s when such pieces cost hundreds, rather than thousands, of dollars. Like everything, it's who you know, neh? Producing advertising for clients is one way to get involved in the graphic arts community; I'm sure there are others. ",

            "answer_text": "Tom: Go on line and you will find lots of illustrators who will show you their work and not charge you the earth. I did exactly that for my children\u2019s book, \u201cLadies and Gentlemen..The Penguins?\u201d which was published in December 2018. The illustrator I found was Dave McTaggart in London\u2014and he diligently worked with me (long distance) and my concept\u2014until I was happy. Check out what he did\u2014and you will see what I mean. It may take much back and forth, but it can be done without going broke. Good luck. ivor davis ",
