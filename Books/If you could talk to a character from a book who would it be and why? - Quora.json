            "answer_text": "Probably the Judge from Blood Meridian, though I'm not sure how that would affect my sanity or even life. Mostly, I'd be sitting horrified while he explained his philosophy on humanity and creation. He came across as equal measures psycho and philosophical in the book. Another character would be Death from Death with Interruptions. I'd probably take her to a jazz bar and listen to her complain about her job and how no one appreciates her, about her planned strike, and how in no way could it go wrong. ",

Then, when I heard her side of the story (read HER side of the story in Wide Sargasso Sea), I would tell Rochester to kiss my butt. The \u201cmad\u201d woman I would become friends and plan how to drive HIS butt crazy by jumping out of closets, teaching his horses to throw him every time he tried to leave, and throwing out one of all his pairs of socks.
