In the book setup, the primary author is listed as the author, the co-authors are listed as contributors tagged as an author. On the cover, the primary author must be listed first if the list goes down, or on the left if the list is on one line. The same order should be used in the front matter. The first 10 authors will be listed on the product page, the rest visible when the \u2018more\u2019 link is clicked. All the authors can add the book to their Author Central account, so the book appears on all of the author profiles. Only the primary author is paid. That person is responsible for paying everyone else their share. Such collaborations need to be contracted, so everyone knows such things as when they will be paid, and how much. Sample contracts are available if you google for them. The better the contract, the less issues likely to arise later. Contracts should be signed before the writing even starts. ",
