            "answer_text": "There are: Seven main novels, following Harry from age 11\u201317. A short story about James and Sirius fighting Death Eaters in the summer between their sixth and seventh years at school. One published script for the first Fantastic Beasts film, set in the US in the 1920s, with more books to come. The Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages booklets, which pretend to be text books Harry used at school. There are two different editions, and the two editions of FB each have some content which is missing from the other, so you really need to buy both. The second edition has more creatures and different (and in some respects better) illustrations, but the first edition has illuminating marginal notes written by Ron. The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a book of wizard fairy tales with comments and additional material by Dumbledore. Various essays on Pottermore, including a booklet-length article about a World Cup Quidditch match in 2014, part supposedly written by Rita Skeeter and part by Ginny Weasley-Potter, containing a lot of information about what everybody was doing at that time. The published script of the Cursed Child play, set in 2017. This occupies a doubtful place in the series, as it wasn\u2019t written by Rowling and apparently had only small input from her. In a fit of temper because she didn\u2019t like the way racists reacted to a black actress being cast as Hermione, Rowling declared that the play should be considered canon, but it is wildly incompatible with the books on several points, and rubbishes several of the characters, especially Harry, Ron and Cedric. Also Hermione to some extent, although we can I suppose explain her failure to know things she knew in the books by saying that she\u2019s been hit by an Obliviate at some point. Then there are various semi-official items penned, or at least approved, by Rowling, such as the Famous Wizard cards. ",
