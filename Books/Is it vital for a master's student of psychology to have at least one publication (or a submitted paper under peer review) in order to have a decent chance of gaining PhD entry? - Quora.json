            "answer_text": "If you have chose to be a psychologist (or to be related to this) - you must have own blog, or at least a massive of written communications with other people. Else - what a psychologist you are? So having such amount of material - you have enough stuff to create publication in one evening if you'll be necessary. In age of internet best known professionals are not people that write scientific books. But that have some minutes on TED. If you really want to be valued - make publications before somebody asks you. Yes, education system is very conservative, and it's \"servants\" want you to have a \"paper work\". But it's easy when you have it already published. Especially if your publications have links to most discussed questions [and people], like politics, war, or economic crisis. ",
