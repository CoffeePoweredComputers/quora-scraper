            "answer_text": "Yes, they are one of the races of the 4 lands, Elves, Man, Trolls and Dwarves. Of the four only the elves are non humans, the other three are descended from humans of the old world. After the world was destroyed in a nuclear holocaust the dwarves survived by living underground and became shorter and stockier, the trolls lived out in the wastes and became large and strong with bark like skin. The humans lived in a magically protected land and remained as they were. The elves on the other hand were descendants of the faeries who had lost their great magics. What little magic they retained kept them hidden from humans of the old world and only re-emerged after the damage from the holocaust had healed enough. One of the early druids we are introduced to is a Dwarf named Risca who was a disciple of Bremen during the first Second War of the Races. Hendel was the main dwarf character of the Sword or Shanarra who was a tracker and ranger. This brings up one of the features that makes Shanarra dwarves unusual, unlike most races they fear to be underground as a racial memory of their centuries forced to live underground. Instead they choose to live in the forests of the Eastlands. ",
