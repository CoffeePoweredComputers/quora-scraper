            "answer_text": "For house 3000 square feet is pretty large. You could accommodate 5 bedrooms in 3000 square feet. If that many people are going to live in the house you will also need multiple bathrooms. This will push up the cost significantly. I do not know which part of Maharashtra you referring to. If it is coastal Maharashtra you could choose to use laterite stone walls to support the slab. This will reduce the cost of concrete. If you look at the cost of construction around half the cost used to build the concrete shell. The other half is in constructing the interiors - the flooring, the windows and doors, the plastering the plumbing and electrical work. You can cut cost by buying the cheapest material here. My suggestion is that you do what most people do. Instead of constructing the entire 3000 square feet in one go build your house in slabs. Start with the 1500 square feet house at ground level and constructed in such a way that it can be expanded into a 3000 square feet house of 2 levels. ",
