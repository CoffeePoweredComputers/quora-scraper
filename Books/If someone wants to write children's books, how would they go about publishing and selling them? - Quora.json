            "answer_text": "I have only done it one way, but that has worked for more than sixty or seventy nonfiction \u201ckids\u2019 books\u201d to half a dozen different publishers to date. Then, it\u2019s up to the publisher (with a little help from the author) to sell the books. To begin, first decide if you want to write fiction or nonfiction. Nonfiction, in my opinion, is easier to sell to a publisher specializing in such works because it usually offers a larger marketplace and, thus, greater sales for the publisher than does fiction. (There are VERY RARE exceptions, of course.) Nonfiction: Decide what age group for which you\u2019re interested in writing\u2014picture books for preschoolers or books for early grades, junior high, or young adult. Then, select an idea that hasn\u2019t already been done to death. Often, you can find fresh ideas in the \u201cadult\u201d news of the day and tailor them to a younger audience. Next, create a fantastic, engaging, one-page maximum pitch or query. Conclude with a few sentences about yourself and why the publisher should contract with you for your book. Find your potential markets (publishers) by checking out children\u2019s book publishers in Writer\u2019s Market or by doing a Google search. Choose the publishers who you think might be the best fit for your book, making sure that those publishers don\u2019t already have books on a similar topic in their catalogs (check out each publisher\u2019s Web page and do a search on Amazon under your book\u2019s topic and the category, \u201cBooks,\u201d from Amazon\u2019s drop-down menu.) Finally, e-mail your pitch, with the word \u201cBook Query\u201d or \u201cBook Pitch\u201d followed by the subject matter clearly identified in the e-mail\u2019s subject line (example: \u201cBook Pitch: Ty Cobb\u2014Baseball\u2019s King of Kings\u201d). If you can\u2019t find a submissions e-mail on the publisher\u2019s Web site or from your Web searches, use the publisher\u2019s telephone number and call to ask how to submit a book proposal by e-mail. (Chances are the e-mail address will be something such as \u201cSubmissions@PublishersName.com\u201d but check to make sure so you don\u2019t waste time.) If the publisher lists any submissions\u2019 guidelines, be sure to follow them. Nothing upsets an editor more than a writer who can\u2019t follow instructions! Finally, do NOT send a sample of the book (or, God forbid, the entire manuscript!) until asked to do so. Failing to follow this simple rule is guaranteed to get your query a quick trip to the \u201creject pile.\u201d Fiction: For submitting fiction, it\u2019s doubly important to follow the publisher\u2019s on-site guidelines (or those you find in Writer\u2019s Market or other reliable sources). That\u2019s because no two publishers require the same thing. Some may request a query letter ONLY; others, a query letter and the first few pages of the manuscript; a few others, a query letter and the complete manuscript. Also, some publishers are adamant about copying and pasting your material into the body of the e-mail instead of attaching it to an e-mail. Follow instructions to the letter, and then sit back, wait, and hope for the best. Oh, and if you haven\u2019t heard anything from the publisher in the publisher\u2019s proscribed period of time (often they suggest 2 - 3 months), feel free to follow up after that to make sure your material was received. If, on the other hand, the publisher has a policy of \u201cno response means no interest,\u201d don\u2019t bother following up because you\u2019ll only be wasting your time and that of the editor. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Good for you for wanted to publish a children\u2019s book. I have self published 6 children\u2019s books for my mother. If you learn nothing else from my post, remember this: Publishers Are Vultures. For three years now since the fist book was published I have received daily email and phone calls from some of the world\u2019s largest publishers. For a small fee ($1500\u2013$10\u2032000) they will assist me with our next book. A publishers can not provide anything than I can do for free. A publisher who buys the rights to your book/books will need to see proof of sales. If you can sell 100\u2032000 books a publisher might look at you next book. Steps to Self Publish Choose book size and page countWrite your bookFind an Illustrator who can edit as wellProof, proof, proof, make sure everything is rightSend High Rez Pdf\u2019s to printer.I have used Amazon & Ingramspark to publish with. Amazon only does Softcover and Ingram does hard & softcover. I know use IngramSpark as they are Print on Demand. They print your book as needed. Ingramspark will also place your book on Amazon & Barnes Noble. No actual hard copies will go into stores.

If you need an illustrator who also edits I can pass on mine to you. my email is: bseaves@gmail.com ",
