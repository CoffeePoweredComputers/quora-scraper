            "answer_text": "Hello friend , since you have done most of the syllabus and that's also thrice so it shows how much determined you are. So , try to complete the remaining part because since you are saying most of the syllabus so it denotes that not full syllabus is completed , so try to complete full syllabus and it , in my opinion , will surely help you to increase your range of marks . Other thing is try solving lot of problems and this will surely increase problem solving speed and will also increase the range of marks. If their is another reason that's not mentioned above , do comment . Best wishes . Hope u get the point . ",
