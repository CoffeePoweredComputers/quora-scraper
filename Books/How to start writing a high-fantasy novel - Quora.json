            "answer_text": "I've been a huge fan of fantasy fiction genre since I was a kid. I've been writing constantly on Wattpad, a worldwide writing platform for buddies writers where your work is seen and criticized by people from all over the world. For writing any novel, you gotta make a list of your characters firstly to avoid any confusion. Decide from whose point of view you want to narrate the story. Introducing many characters and writing each chapter from every character's point of view is a popular trend now a days. Just make sure to avoid confusion among the readers. Start with the last chapter. The ending of a novel is always the most difficult part. The renowned authors usually write the ending chapter and then according to the conclusion, they start the story. That's why, you'll find many writers on Wattpad who've started a novel, but could never finish them. Keep the plot clear and intensifying. A unified plot should have a beginning which initiates the action, a middle which intensifies it and and end that concludes it. Hope this helps! :) ",
