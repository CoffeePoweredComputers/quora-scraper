            "answer_text": "Yes, you were wrong for saying that.  As others have stated in their answers, \"to retard\" originally meant \"to slow down,\" and \"retarded\" meant \"delayed.\"  For a while, the clinical terminology for a person with a cognitive impairment was \"mentally retarded.\"  It was a term used by psychologists, special education teachers, and other related professionals to describe the people they worked with.  It was not an insult or a derogatory term.  It was simply a clinical description of a person's abilities and level of functioning. It's helpful when planning educational goals - you need to talk about what this person can do now and what you want to help him learn next. And then at some point, the general public decided to take that term and start using it as an insult.  This is the same thing that had happened with older words idiot, moron, and imbecile.  Those words had originally referred to specific IQ scores. What is the difference between an idiot, an imbecile and a moron?  Now they are just derogatory names to call someone when you want to say that they are stupid. I have been a speech-language pathologist for 20 years.  In that time, I've had many clients who had cognitive impairments.  Some of them have been severely delayed in all areas of development.  And they are real people, with real feelings.  And real families who love them.  And when you call someone or something \"retarded,\" you saying you're like that guy (the person with the severe cognitive disability) and that it's bad to be like that guy.  That is hurtful to the person with the disability and to everyone who loves that person.

Ed.\" which is an abbreviation for \"Special Education.\"     ",

            "answer_text": "The other day my mom told me I couldn't go to my swim meeting because I had an asthma attack the week before. In outrage, I said that was retarded. She freaked out on me and told me to never say that word again. Was I wrong for saying that? The word \u201cretard\u201d itself is not \u201cbad\u201d and not vulgar. If a treatment successfully retards the spread of a disease, that\u2019s very good news and a perfectly inoffensive, legitimate use of the word. In that sense, it just means to slow. When \u201cslow\u201d or \u201cretarded\u201d is applied to people, however, it generally refers to a developmental delay or disability. As such, it now has a strong connotation of hate and disrespect. It has grown into the sort of thing too many bullies have said, too often. So while I won\u2019t say you should never, ever use that word, I will say you should know how hurtful it can be, and consider for yourself whether it is really what you want to communicate. In this case, you weren\u2019t referring to anyone in particular, including your mother. You were reacting to that particular pronouncement. There are lots of great words you could use instead: ridiculous, outrageous, ill-considered, thoughtless, absurd. There are plenty of nouns, too: nonsense, rubbish, piffle, balderdash. Consult a thesaurus for heaps more, and tuck away a few of your favorites for next time. You can disagree without offending, and it\u2019s a great skill to practice. You may also want to talk with your doctor and your mother about under what circumstances your asthma should keep you from swimming. You could prevent both mishaps and misunderstandings. ",
