            "answer_text": "I used to work at a Qualex photographic processing plant. My job was to create pictures, in a darkroom with a hand enlarger, when the customer had a negative that was of unusual size\u2026 110 film, 126 film, larger formats, round Kodak discs, the single \u201cpositive\u201d that was snapped into the end of a souvenir viewer, etc.  To get to my \u201cHand Enlarger\u201d room, I had to pass through the \u201cPrint to Print\u201d room. In here, a coworker would use a machine that basically takes a picture of a picture, after which she would process the film in the usual manner. We both used slightly different methods to convert slides to prints, she to standard photo sizes, while I\u2019d handle enlargements. In the 80\u2019s, one would simply have to turn a print into a photo processing center at the local drugstore with instructions to make a copy... Eventually, it would end up at one such plant, be converted as requested, then sent back to the drugstore for a fee. Internet services such as these are still available, but most of the on-site plants have closed their doors for good. ",

            "answer_text": "I worked in a print shop in the 1980s, and here\u2019s how we did it. Without the negative, you have to take a photo of the photo. We had a dedicated camera for this in the darkroom, but there was still some loss in quality. After that, we could develop it chemically on to photo paper and there\u2019s your copy. If multiple copies were to be made, then we might shoot the photo with a halftone screen on it. This was a piece of transparent material with staggered rows of uniform dots. The resulting photo would be made up of tiny dots similar to what you see in old newspaper photos. The screened photo could be burned on to a thin metal plate for an offset press, where many copies could be made.  This is an exaggerated example of a halftone screen. Image source: About halftone screens So unless you had the requisite equipment, you\u2019d send or take your original to a photo lab or a print shop. ",
