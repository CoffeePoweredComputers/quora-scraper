            "answer_text": "Develop a commonplace book. While I would like to reiterate, and cheekily take credit for the response the best best best thing you can do is click through this link and read it. Have you ever heard of Robert Greene? Author of The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Laws of War, Mastery, and I\u2019m sure other books as well? Well this is his methodology as explained by his research assistant Ryan Holiday, who is also a best selling author, as well as a contributor to Quora. The article is from lifehacker but has very informative links back to his own site as well. I'm Ryan Holiday, and This Is How I Work As you\u2019ve stated your concept is at the intersection of modern war, mythology, and science fiction technology. So read as much about each of those topics individually and develop a commonplace book around those topics. In the process of creating your own commonplace book you\u2019ll end up combining concepts and themes from each category in your own unique and novel way. That\u2019s the best way to go about it! ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to the other answers here (which I agree with completely but won't reiterate), one resource that has been essential to me when writing is the writer's group.  Having like-minded people (writers) who have a different methodology or alternate 'take' on the information you share can be extremely beneficial and help clear some of the idea blocks/slow downs. If you don't have a group in your area, I strongly encourage you to look up the forums at Nanowrimo (National Novel Writing Month).  It's a not-for-profit that sponsors a national novel writing month every November to encourage fledgling writers to produce enough draft material to edit to a novel 50,000 words).  I've done it twice while working full-time and frankly, it's a gruelling pace, but very rewarding.  Outside of that actual event, the forums are open all year long, and local in-person groups develop which can also meet 'off-season'.  You may find some specific help and maybe even a writing group out of it. ",
