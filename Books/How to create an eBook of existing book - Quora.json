            "answer_text": "Now this is a complicated question. I am assuming you are asking about turning a solid REAL book into digital format, like pdf, epub, mobi etc. These are ways to convert into digital format Simplest way is to scan the pages and upload those into anyone of the hundreds of image to epub, pdf, doc, fb2 etc, websites. Just google image to pdf, image to doc, image to epub\u2026and you have the answer. Or I sent these images onto word and save it. Or you can click photos of those pages and upload in onto your computer and turn those into the desired format using online services or dedicated apps like Calibre. You can also type the book on a a document writer like Word, Wordpad, Notepad or special apps which deal with ebooks. You can convert those into desired format or keep it the same. Now ebooks: Ebook is an entirely new section. You have a fixed format. Like the cover page, the index, the acknowledgement page, maybe the glossary and so on. You have to pick a font, beautify it and so on. You can do this on your own, or use specialised and dedicated services like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing or Blurp. If doing on your own, you can write it on word and convert into pdf or epub or any other format. And if you are lazy\u2026 you can just hire a service to convert the hardware into software\u2026 lol. Like you Local Cyber Cafe? Local Printing g services? Or just google one and choose the best suited for you. ",
