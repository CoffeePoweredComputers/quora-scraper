            "answer_text": "If we think of the principle it is valid for microscopic particles and it is due to fact that we don't have length measuring device whose least count is less than that of microscopic particles and also to determine the position we need watch it using a microscope and a light beam will fall on it exciting it and thus changing its momentum. Now if electron is stationary then to determine its position we watch it with microscope a light beam falls on it this it's momentum changes. So Hiesenberg's uncertainty principle is valid. I want to know I am right or not. If not please explain me this. Thanks In advance ",
