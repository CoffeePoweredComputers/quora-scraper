            "answer_text": "Strategy to tackle GS Section of CGLE2019 to be held in MARCH2020. You must understand the type of questions asked in CGLE2018 and then prepare accordingly. Most of the questions in history were asked from Mughal period. Why? As various steps were taken by the Central govt/some state govt to change the name of cities/streets named after Mughals. Its like connecting current affairs with your static part. This approach is usually taken up by UPSC. SO LEARN FROM THE PAST.Same goes with Indian polity. Understand the citizenship Act, Article 14,15,24,25, etc which have been in news. Sabaramila temple, Ayodhya verdict, And now CAA,NRC. Understand the crux. You will get questions from here too apart from static part( LUCENT GK).Current affairs: Various questions are asked from sports/recently held sports events. International events. Learn the polity in your neighbouring countries. Nepal was asked last year. This year they may ask Pakistan/Afg/Bangladesh.Geography: Questions were relatively easy. Longest river kind of questions. Can be dealt with easily(GK LUCENT)Science: Very easy questions were asked. Straight from the tables given in LUCENT.Economics: Trust me. This is not easy. No matter what you study, they will end up asking static questions which are way too difficult. So you can skip this part. Do it only if you have time.This section has relevance if you are very strong in other sections. If your score in mock tests is stuck around 130\u2013150, then this section comes into picture. All the best. And let me know in comment section, if it is helpful. ",
