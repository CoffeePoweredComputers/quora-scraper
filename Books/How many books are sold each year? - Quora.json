            "answer_text": "This is too broad a question. If you\u2019d like to find out a ballpark number, you might split it up in a few general categories, like fictionnon-fictionAnd then split it even further, depending on subgenres. And then add up the numbers. Nowadays most are sold online. And retailers like to keep their data as private as possible \u2014 wouldn\u2019t you? You have Amazon \u2014 the biggest book seller in the world; with all its regionals + book depositoryiBooksGoogle booksBarnes & Nobleall the other online and offline bookshopsThe data concerning the actual, real, unaltered booksales of a platform will never be publicly available. However, there are some stats that someone might offer. For example, for my niche, I\u2019m interested in serial readers, because they are the ones that make up the most of my revenue. Last time I checked \u2014 and it took me just a little over two months to gather the necessary data \u2014 there were a few million serial readers worldwide. I won\u2019t give any further info on that, given the amount of time and sleepless nights \u2014 plus I\u2019d be creating competition for myself \u2014 but you can start with social media and make your way into narrower regions of the web. Nobody knows exactly how many books are sold globally, each year, and whoever pertains to know the answer has something up their sleeve \u2014 an agenda or wanting some attention. Hope that helps.
