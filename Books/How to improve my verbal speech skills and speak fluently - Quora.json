            "answer_text": "How can I improve my verbal skills? I have problems with descriptions and explaining, both written and orally. A quick one, in response to your question: Practise speaking widely. Practise speaking deeply. Practise speaking differently. Here is my quick roundup of practical approaches for you to enhance your speaking power: Practise speaking in front a mirror, by working, say on your pronunciation, stressed sounds, and even your body language;Improving on your fluency of speech;Slowing down your speaking speed so as to allow yourself time to think; public speaking experts call this initiative, \"pause for poise\";Acquiring more fixed or set phrases and other word forms so as to expand your vocabulary;Learning to listen intently and attentively, just as productivity strategist Stephen R Covey put it: \"Seek first to understand, then to be understood!\";Practising your interrogatives, so as to keep the conversation going and to show that you care about other people's opinion;Talking to yourself whenever you are at home or alone somewhere;Reading out aloud;Learning and practising using common language expressions of native speakers in everyday situations;Singing along in English songs (Tip: research the lyrics first);Telling stories and/or sharing anecdotes from your native language in English;Always be prepared for any public speaking opportunity;Read, read, and read widely and even deeply, as well as write, write, and write profusely, and of course, speak, speak, and speak regularly;Last but not least, always putting your mind at ease or relaxed mode when speaking!Here are a slew of more possible practices, intended to build and enhance your spontaneous responses in speaking: Watch any Hollywood movie from a DVD, and switch it off at 60-minute point, and just do a running commentary - by speaking aloud - onto the recorder function of your smartphone; you can even precede your description with an outline of your personal impressions and/or feelings about the movie plot up to the 60-minute cut off point;Listen to an international news broadcast, and do your best to articulate your reactions; you can extend this initiative further by probing - again, by speaking aloud - the rationale and motivations of the report as broadcasted; you can also replicate this speaking initiative when reading your daily English news paper;Grab any postcard or photo or picture at random, and proceed to describe in detail - again, by speaking aloud - what's in the picture: whats the theme/what's in the foreground/what's in the background/what's in the centre or middle/what's on the right/what's on the left/what's at the top/what's at the bottom/what at the top-right/top-left/bottom-right/bottom-left/what's happening/is it inside or outside/who's there/how's the weather and/or timing; how do you know/compare and contrast/how do you feel/what do you like/what do you dislike/would you like to be in the postcard or photo or picture; why and why not?Join a local chapter of the international Toastmasters' Club in your city, if any;Conduct public speaking gigs, say for free, at your local community club, public library, business or trade association, just for more opportunities to showcase your technical expertise and vocal prowess;Next on your reading list: i) Say Keng Lee's answer to How do I speak English fluently and put it into good words? ii) Say Keng Lee's answer to How do I convey thought and explanations orally more effectively?;Frankly, with a little bit of ingenuity and imagination on your part, the possibilities to improve your communication are virtually unlimited. I like to reiterate that your verbal facility and conversational fluency can only come from the massive utility and consistent application in your everyday life and/or workflow activities, involving real communication with real people, as much as you can.

            "answer_text": "Based on your preferences, you can try a number of ways to improve your skills- READ- I believe that reading is a habit that benefits everyone, regardless of their profession. The sooner it becomes a habit, the better. Try to read anything that interest you & in whatever medium you prefer. For example, textbooks, novels, magazines, newspapers, online blogs, articles, stories, poems, etc. There are so many things to read! Once you develop an interest, it won\u2019t feel like a task. Keep an offline/online dictionary beside & make sure to never miss a difficult word while reading; try to use the words in everyday sentences.TALK- Talking is the simplest way to learn. Try to talk to people in English whenever you can, except when you think your mother tongue would be a more convenient language. Don't think that you would be mocked or your mistakes would be made fun of, even if they do make fun of you, it doesn't matter because you're learning and they're not! Also, communicate with people who are good at it because they might help you realize your mistakes & correct them. Always ask questions when you think you're wrong, just like you did here on Quora!WATCH- My greatest English teachers were never my school teachers, they were, in fact, movies and video games. I played so many video games as a kid that I learned more than they taught at school. So, if you're into video games, then play! Never skip the backstory videos and the tutorial part. Pay attention to every sentence. If you're into watching movies, then give English movies a chance. They are brilliant for learning. Pause if you want to, because some words turn out to be difficult. If you don't have movies to watch, just watch any random YouTube video. Pay attention to the composition of sentences. Always keep a dictionary with you.PRACTICE- This is the most cliche, but the wisest advise to give anyone. Make communicating in English a habit. Practice with your peers & practice with yourself. Stand in front of the mirror and just talk to yourself. This is what I'd do as a teenager whenever I was feeling down (teenage issues, don't judge me) and it helped! I became more observant of the ways I talked & how I moved while talking, of the expressions I made and the vocabulary I used. Also, I began writing about my feelings or just about a normal day. I felt the improvement in myself with each passing day. You can try that too.JOIN CLASSES- The fact that I put this point last is because I don't feel like it is a thing to be bothered about. This method only works for those who have enough time and money to give for a skill that you can learn on your own. You can join spoken English classes if you want to, but make sure to join a professional with enough experience in this field because there are just too many classes and a very few good teachers to choose from. I still don't recommend classes because I learnt this language on my own & I think I'm pretty decent at it.At last, I'd advice you to never lose hope because it's just a language! Never get disheartened or discouraged by those who make fun of you. Never look at a person who's fluent in English, and think that you cannot do it; after all, they must have started from scratch as well! You will learn it too in no time and speak it fluently just like the one you speak everyday; and one day, you will be proud of yourself. GOOD LUCK! :D ",
