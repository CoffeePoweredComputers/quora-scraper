            "answer_text": "My father read extensively since his youth. By the time I was 10 years old, he must have read thousands of books. By the time I was 15 years old, I had already read many of the great works of literature due to the influence of my father, including works from Homer, Shakespeare, Tacitus, Plato, Marx, Engels, Kant, Schr\u00f6dinger and Goethe. Furthermore, my older sister, who got to study at Harvard encouraged me to step up my reading because \u201ceveryone there read five books a week.\u201d While this is certainly not always the case, it motivated me to read more. The effects books have on us is mostly invisible. Just by knowing whether someone reads a lot or doesn\u2019t at all, you can already guess a great deal of what they are like. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of books they read. It matters who we have to become in order to read fluently. Readers have a private point of view with a distinct need of private space. Readers enter an abstract world of knowledge, not observable for non-readers. Readers have a childhood because, it creates a split between children who cannot read and their parents who can. Readers at some point \u201cgrow up\u201d while oral civilisations are characterized by childishness among all age groups. Readers are strikingly competitive, and competing against each other makes them only more alike. Readers have a vigorous sense of individuality. Readers think logically and sequentially. Readers distance themselves from symbols and manipulate high orders of abstraction. Readers have longer attention spans and the capacity to defer gratification. Reading is an antisocial act. Yet, the founding fathers of the United States deemed it necessary to raise the voting age to 21 years, as such a social system is doomed to fail with an uneducated public. Being educated in those days meant, reading well. Thomas Jefferson put it this way: \u201cWithout an educated voter, the republic cannot stand.\u201d He wrote in a letter to William Charles Jarvis: \u201cI know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves ; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education. This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power.\u201d If you take a look at the Federalist Papers and at the Anti-Federalist Papers, do not forget that these articles were published in a newspaper in the day. If the New York Times were to start writing at such a level today, they would certainly go bankrupt fast because the American public cannot and will not read them! In brief, parents helping their children read a lot of books, are creating a sort of intellectual elite. My personal experience growing up in such a household is that, as an adult, you are much favored by business and scientific communities. ",

            "answer_text": " I never read a single book for class throughout my high school career. Yep, you read that correctly. Zero. I still managed to ace my English classes, but I always felt like I was just barely getting by. There was the occasional series I would read on my own, but they were few in number. I had loved reading as a child, but as I got older it felt more like a task, especially as my reading comprehension seemed to stop progressing in middle school. During my first attempt at college, I had to take a semester off. I moved back home with my parents. I didn\u2019t have a job, and all my friends were two hours away, still at school. One can only watch so much Netflix before becoming bored. So, I started reading, and I haven\u2019t stopped. In the last three years, I have read approximately 150 books. Through reading, I have found a healthy way to deal with depression. It has been a stress reliever, and an escape from reality. It has helped me in more ways than that though. Reading almost every day in the last three years has increased my reading comprehension. It has also improved my own writing skills. This has boosted my confidence and encouraged me to start writing more often. I am now writing a fiction book, I write and edit for Odyssey, and I am an officer for the SNHU Book Club. This has also helped me become a better student. I\u2019m able to read and comprehend the text more for each class, and do well on the assignments because of my better writing skills. I truly love it, and can\u2019t imagine where I would be right now if I hadn\u2019t become a bookworm. Because I read so much, I have decided to start doing a written version of a book haul. In short, a book haul is a review of the books read each month. They are typically done as a video, but until I have the proper equipment to do that, I will be writing mine. For an example, watch this video. So, at the end of each month I will discuss the books I read, the books I bought, or received, and then ask for your thoughts and suggestions. January was a hectic month for me. Between school starting back up, and taking on more responsibilities for Odyssey, and various school clubs, I did not read as much as I had hoped, which is why this article is a bit of a combination piece. In January, I only finished one book. It was called \u201cMark of Distinction\u201d by Jessica Dotta. It\u2019s the second book in the \u201cPrice of Privilege\u201d trilogy. Set in Victorian London, it is about a young girl who has dealt with the loss of her mother and father, and who tries to find a suitable husband to avoid being shipped off to Scotland to work as a maid. There are several plot twists, and just when you think you\u2019ve figured it all out\u2026 you\u2019re wrong! Think Jane Austen with a murderous twist. I loved both books, and am currently reading the third one, so look for the final review of the trilogy next month! Source : How Reading Forever Changed My Life ",
