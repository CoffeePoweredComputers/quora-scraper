At the bottom left of the books listed you will see a like button, just click on it. You might want to be selective on the lists you like since Goodreads does not have a way to index lists you want to refer to on a regular basis. There is no favorites button, so you might want to use the like button just for lists you want to find again. You can do that by clicking on the link \u201cLists I\u2019ve Liked\u201d. ",
