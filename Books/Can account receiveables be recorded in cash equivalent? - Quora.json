            "answer_text": "No. Look at any balance sheet. If there are any receivables, it will always sit on its own discrete line separate and apart from the line called 'cash and cash equivalents'. Cash equivalents are highly liquid and easily converted into cash. Cash equivalents, also known as \"cash and equivalents,\" are one of the three main asset classes, along with stocks and bonds. These securities have a low-risk, low-return profile and include U.S. government Treasury bills, bank certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, corporate commercial paper and other money market instruments. Source: Cash Equivalents While most receivables will eventually be turned into cash (when collected), they are no considered in the same light in terms of liquidity. You could theoretically have half your receivables 180 past due, despite all your begging and pleading for your customers to pay. That would be the opposite of being 'easily' converted to cash and the distinction of why receivables are separated from cash equivalents. ",
