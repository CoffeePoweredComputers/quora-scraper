            "answer_text": "Browne pens an engaging novel that takes a look at the end of days and what we can expect through her psychic's perspective. The end of days has been a hot topic recently since the end of the Mayan calendar is fastly approaching - 21 Dec 2012. Browne takes a realistic look at the end of days and what we can expect. \"End of Days\" is raw, gritty, and fresh. By taking a look at our past, can we hope to make change for our future. Hope I helped! ",
