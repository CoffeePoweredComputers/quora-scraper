            "answer_text": "The royalty an author collects is based on the publishing arrangement. Normally, a traditional publisher will have a lengthy contract and may offer an advance or advance against book sales. But this author needs to have proven his worth or have a very hot topic that the publisher knows will be a popular seller. Vanity publishers usually get paid for setting up your book in a very professional way, and they use their publishing imprint (name) as an umbrella to make your work look more traditionally published. They will take an amount like $3,000 up front to create the book for you and then will only take 10% or so of your royalty. Some will even set everything up for a flat fee and allow you to keep all of your royalties. If you self-publish, you keep 100% of your royalties, but there is much room for making \u201cnewbie\u201d mistakes which make your book look so obviously self-published that sales are not really an option as professionals can tell and will likely stay away from your book. The best option, in my opinion, is to work with someone who knows the publishing business inside and out and pay them to ensure you have a quality product, but ask for 100% of your own royalties. At Distinct Press, we set it up that the author gets 100% of their money. If you are looking for actual price of book / royalty info it depends on various factors\u2026 The size of the book, interior pages - are they black & white or color, how many pages, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends upon how you are selling the book.Dividing it into 3 sub-parts- 1)Self Published PAPERBACK EDITIONIn this you have to take care of editor, printing press, promotional activities, misc. expenses and everything.You own it, promote it, sell it. The remaining profit is yours which most of the time is meager.  E-BOOKPrinting e-book is quite easy and you can sell it online of which you have to give cut to web platform like Amazon. You can check out the royalty rates via this link.Get help with self-publishing your book to Amazon's Kindle Store On an avg. an e-publisher makes $30-50 per month.  2) Published by HarperCollins or other Big Guns The standard rate of royalty for an Author is 10% (give or take)If you have a good Agent, he or she may be able to negotiate you a 50% advance on your total commission.Now, if your book sells  more than Half copies- You'll start collecting royalty.less than Half copies- You have to refund a part of advance to the publisher.Your book ends up on Bargain table - No royalty.According to Rebecca Brandewyne:  The standard royalty rates for paperback books vary from a low of 1% to a high of 10%, with the average royalty rate falling at 6%. Hardcover books pay standard royalty rates of 10%, 12%, and 15% of the cover price --- 10% on the first one to 250,000 copies sold, 12% on the next 250,001 to 500,000 copies sold, and 15% on anything sold above 500,000 copies. So if an author's hardcover book has a cover price of $25.00, then the author will earn only a $2.50 royalty on every copy sold, up to 250,000 copies.   3) Small Scale Publisher In this case most probably you will not get any advance and just a quarterly royalty check of 10% of your sales. According to The Guardian - 54% of traditionally-published authors and almost 80% of go-it-alone writers are making less than $1,000 (\u00a3600) a year. Hope that helped. ",
