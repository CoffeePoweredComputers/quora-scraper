            "answer_text": "First, I\u2019m answering on the assumption that by \u201cchildren\u2019s book\u201d you mean a picture book for readers up to age 10. This being the case\u2026 There\u2019s no single answer to this. My company\u2019s children\u2019s books are mostly illustrated, but one is all photography and another is a mix of photos and illustrations. Graphic and design choices should be driven by the story, the purpose of the book, and its intended readership. For example, our all-photo children\u2019s book is about a real-life rescue dog who became a therapy dog, and the author happens to be the owner and a professional photographer. So she had tons of great photos of the dog in a variety of ways to support the story. There would be no reason at all to create illustrations, especially given that the book was about a real-life dog. The book with a mix of photos and illustrations is also a true story, but there weren\u2019t many photos to show the story. So, we have illustrations for the \u201cjourney\u201d part of the book and photos at the end to show the \u201cheroic accomplishment.\u201d Conversely, our other children\u2019s books are fiction. To create fantastical, delightful, colorful, and expressive images through photography would be prohibitively difficult and expensive when an illustrator can do as well (if not better) for far less cost. So, the best advice I can offer is to think about the story. If it\u2019s a real-life story, then photography *may* be the better choice; if it\u2019s fiction, then illustrations are most likely the better choice. But no matter what, do what\u2019s best visually. Even if I had a real-life story with many available photos, I wouldn\u2019t use them if they weren\u2019t great images. Thanks for the A2A!
