            "answer_text": "mkultra is for sure still operating at all levels. the production line churns out specialised military personnel (spies and super soldiers), social engineering agents (celebrities and social provocateurs/commentators), place holder politicians and foreign leaders for purposes of usurping and replacing unfavourable governments. I'm of the belief the project was expanded upon its discovery and better methodology was employed to keep it secret. am I saying every politician or soldier or spy or celebrity or social commentator is an mk asset? not at all, but one can certainly notice those who are assets that are forced into the public eye. what I have no doubt about at all is that the terror cells that keep springing up around the world are lead by mk assets, or supposed graduates of the mkultra pipeline.
