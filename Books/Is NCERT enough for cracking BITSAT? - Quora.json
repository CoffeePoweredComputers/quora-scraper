            "answer_text": "It depends on the subject u r talking about. If it's chemistry I would say ncert should be enough ( though it would be wise if u study organic from a different book in addition to ncert ). Maths is more of a practice based subject, so practice from different books (including the ones for iit). For physics I would recommend to go through the basics in ncert (something I didn't do and trust me I regret it) and then practice from different books including the school ones. The questions in bitsat r very easy ( most of them r formula based) so it's the time management u need to work at. Buy a bitsat book and practice as many mock tests as possible then identify ur mistakes. Ps - all the concepts will be there in ncert, but just studying ncert will not help to much. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "It cant be predicted try your best in the remaining time left for BITSAT. Begin with the syllabus of class 12th. Make the list of all the topics of class 12th and start finishing one by one. Try maintaining the average 8 hours per chapter. Do not focus on the number of questions, focus on types of questions. In BITSAT most questions are direct formula based, so maintain a copy where you pen down all the formulas and keep revising them on regular basis.Chemistry is highest scoring subject(a/c to me) so please go through NCERT in a proper manner. Remember every single reaction, every process etc mentioned in NCERT. Once done with 12th, revise 11th throughly(I mentioned revision since you passed 11th class and you know most things about it. You have to recall them.) but try keeping average less than 8 hours per chapter, maybe 6. Everyday select 50 questions of BITSAT level from Physics, Chemistry and Maths each and solve them in one go of three hours. Keep marking scheme as +3 for each correct answer and a negative one for each incorrect or left question. This kind of approach will build up your speed and will give you the motivation to attend full paper. For NCERT doubt solution just visit Ask Toppr application you can get every answer of your doubt also you can get solutions of NCERT books as well just download and start using this application for doubts All the very best and good luck.
