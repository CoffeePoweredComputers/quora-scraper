            "answer_text": "Yes, it is possible to become a multi-millionaire as a film-maker. Even if you don\u2019t have the clout that Spielberg or Lucas has, you can easily afford a multi-million-dollar home after a few hit films. And here\u2019s some proof. Michael Bay has made some of the most financially successful blockbusters of the past 20 years. I am not a fan of his movies, but that is not the question here. Tons of us are jealous of his success. This is his house. Tour Director Michael Bay's Modern Three-Story Home in California | Architectural Digest If you want to know how much these homes cost, you can check out similar homes on a website called Pinnacle List: California, USA \u2013 Luxury Properties Those are actual real estate listings. Not all of them are owned by directors, but I\u2019m sure that Bay\u2019s house compares favorably. ",

            "answer_text": "you see .. being rich was never related to career. I mean a lot of people around the world work (very) hard and they were never rich .. Same rule applies to film making. There are A LOT of film makers/ directors around the world, and some of them are really good .. but only few are millionaires. Being a rich director can be achieved by business standards not by artistic standards. Spielberg for example is a rich director (to me, he is a business man more than an artist), no one can deny that he made good movies, but most of his movies were franchises (Indiana Jones series, Jurassic park series, E.T. \u2026 etc) \u2026 Money comes from box office, and box office movies usually satisfy the majority regardless the quality of film. So I guess, may be, you could be a multi millionaire film maker if you directed box office movies (regardless the quality or critical acclaim) ",
