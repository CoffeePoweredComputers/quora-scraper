Hardcore History 50 - Blueprint for Armageddon I - Dan Carlin (Not a book, but pretty darn close) Dan does a great job relating past events to our lives today.Hundred Days - The last 100 days of WWIDreadnought by Robert Massie - Insight into the struggles faced by the powerful bureacrats of the major powers.The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman - A ClassicStorm of Steel by Ernst Junger - Inside the trenches on the German side. World War II:Hardcore History - Ghosts of the Ostfront Series - Dan Carlin (Podcast again, but worth it.)Bloodlands by Dan Snyder - Went into this wanting to learn more about Poland and the Ukraine. Walked away with much more.The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by Shirer (I haven't read Berlin Diary, thought I am sure it is excellent)A Writer At War by Vassily Grossman(Recently I've read a great deal about the war in Eastern Europe. I think I read more WW2 history in Western Europe/Pacific when I was much younger than I am now.) Aftermath:Aftermath: The Remnants of WarThe Great War for Civilisation| Robert Fisk (A few nice comments about pre WW1 conditions) ",

            "answer_text": "These are some of the hardest subjects to find good material on (at least to my tastes) since so much of it is loaded with the author's own politics and motivations, but there are some gems out there. I'm a few pages from finishing The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich as I write this. It was written in 1960 by CBS correspondent William L. Shirer, who was in Germany as a journalist throughout the Nazi regime, not just an onlooker. It also gives a good sense of Germany at the close of WWI. Excellent reading. The documentary series The War by Ken Burns is one of the most affecting things I've come across in my life, let alone on the subject of WWII. It's on Netflix, otherwise your library will definitely have it.   If you want to have a sense  of what the wars felt like, All Quiet on the Western Front is worth all the praise it receives (it's about the end of WWI from the German perspective). And watching Band of Brothers is a great way to wade through the American side of WWII. ",
