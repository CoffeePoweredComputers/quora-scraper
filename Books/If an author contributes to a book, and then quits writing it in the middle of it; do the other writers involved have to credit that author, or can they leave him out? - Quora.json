            "answer_text": "Based on your question, this author\u2019s contributions were worthy of inclusion in the book and helped shape the book as it is now. So yes, you absolutely must credit that author. Even if you and the rest of the authors have a legitimate grievance against that person, even if that person let you down and stomped on your hearts, even if you\u2019re so angry that sharing credit with him or her makes your brain turn into a roiling sea of molten lava. If compensation is also an issue, such as a share of future royalties, you still have to give credit, but compensation depends on the details of the agreement. I hope you had a contract that lays out what is expected of each author, how credit and profits (if any) are to be distributed, and how to handle situations like this one, in which an author fails to fulfill some, but not all, of the expectations. If you don\u2019t have a contract, then my next piece of advice becomes doubly important. If royalties or other compensation are at stake, or even if the issue of giving credit is likely to cause contention in the group or drama from the author who quit halfway through, I suggest you and the other authors consult an attorney with experience in intellectual property and the publishing industry. In fact, I suggest you do it anyway. You can all chip in for the fee, which may seem like a lot to you now, but which could save you a great deal of heartache and expense in the long run. ",

But it isn\u2019t that cut-and-dry. If, however, they use even one paragraph, they have acknowledge (and possibly, pay) that author for his or her contribution. Even if the contract they signed says that if an author leaves the project in midstream, they don\u2019t get paid, there could still be problems. Anyone can sue anyone. ",
