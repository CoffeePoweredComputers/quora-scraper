            "answer_text": "From Spike Lee's classic film, \"Malcolm X\" \"There are those who will consider it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain - and we will smile. Many will say turn away - away from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black man - and we will smile. They will say that he is of hate - a fanatic, a racist - who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them : Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him. Malcolm was our manhood, our living, black manhood! This was his meaning to his people. And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves. \" (Read by Ossie Davis) ",

            "answer_text": "To me Malcolm X is one of the very few people the world has ever seen. He stands as an upright man a man of his words who was so courageous ever seen. He spoke his mind and despite firmly believing at something he was also not shy to admit that he was wrong and found the write pass to carry on. For instance he changed from believing in the teachings of The National of Islam and Elijah Muhammad his mentor and started to follow The Islamic Orthodox. He even changed from believing all whites were enemies and started to cooperate with all non racist whites and other Afro Americans civil rights groups. In fact Malcolm X was courageous self educated guy, humble and very smart in arguments. He almost defeated every single man, groups or individuals who tried to argue against him. He was one the best debaters I have ever seen in history. ",
