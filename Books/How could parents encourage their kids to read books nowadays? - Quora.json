I was a library mom at my child's school and read things to the kids like Captain Underpants, Dumb Bunnies and of course, Dr. Suess! I battled the school librarian regularly over my book choices that she considered to be \u201ctasteless\u201d or in the case of Dr. Suess, \u201cliberal indoctrination.\u201d She wanted me to read only things like Johnny Tremaine and other old, dry children's lit from her childhood. It used to irritate her to see the kids line up to check out the books I read to them! I didn't care if a book contained fart jokes or precocious children\u2026 whatever sparked a desire to read was worth reading. ",

So I didn't read the actual story but I pointed to the pictures and got them to say what they saw in the picture. Once they were old enough to speak in actual sentences I read them books. Doctor Seuss \"Hop on Pop\" was an early favorite. They knew it by heart and were able to \"read\" it to me. This persuaded them that they could read. So I let them read it to me. Bedtime story is a very important ritual for little kids and once they begin to read, they can read you some of the bedtime story. When they were older, I made sure that they had a lot of books available for them to read, and after going to bed, they were allowed to read in bed for half an hour before going to sleep. We also limited television and computer time so they were encouraged to read instead.Today they are voracious bookworms... ",

This teaches them responsibility (they need to keep track of the books, take care of the books and to return the books on time) It teaches them that the world is a larger place than just their local area, and it teaches them adventure. We were fortunate to live in a beautiful area of California and they also loved exploring (Yosemite Valley and surrounding areas. We lived in an old mining town called Sonora) So, read to them, make books available to them, read them the books they choose, and keep them active outside. I was lucky enough to be a stay at home mother while they were small and this helped also. Children need supervision and love. ",
