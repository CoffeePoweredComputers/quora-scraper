            "answer_text": "There really isn't much of a debate out on the order of Harry Potter? The series flows chronologically and to read it out of order would not only mean missing out on the plot-relevant hints dropped throughout, but also on Harry's magical education. You learn alongside Harry, in the series, wingardium leviosa, alohamora, lumos, nox, expalliarmus, avada kadavra, expecto petronum. These are just some of the words (spells) that make no sense without explicit explanation, but are only give such an explanation when first introduced. So, read the books as they were released? Philospher's StoneChamber of SecretsPrisoner of AzkabanGoblet of FireOrder of the PhoenixHalf-Blood PrinceDeathly HallowsQuidditch Through the Ages (Optional)Tales of Beedle the Bard (Optional)Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (Optional)The Cursed Child**this one is controversial, actually. I enjoy it, and accept it as cannon. But plenty of people will warn you away from it, with fire in their eyes. So despite it being an actual continuation, most would still consider it \u201coptional\u201d reading. And then go watch: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.Happy Reading! ",
