            "answer_text": "Constant learning from failed subjects, a manipulator would do what you would do to master a skill: Research. Research. Research. The human mind has been mapped, with regards to past traumas we have inflicted upon each other. Start there.Notes. Learn what you are, and how you can be manipulated. Find your \u201cgives,\u201d and other triggers that \u201cpush\u201d you into either uncomfortable feelings or feelings of bliss. Both are necessary.Study. People watching is a fun hobby, for creatures of mischievous natures. But, that's what scientists and sociologists are all about. Now, so are you.Practice. Practice. Practice. If you are indeed learning a dark art such as manipulation, you have to practice. Think sales, and every person is a sucker with money to buy the nonsense you have to offer. Warning: you will have to get used to getting beat up for failed manipulations.Repeat. From the top, and make it a layer of education that covers the foundation you've dug and set. Remember, the less you feel for the other person, the better the evolution. Warning: you will lose your morality as you progress, so always stay true and only use when absolutely necessary. You'll always know when, when you believe.Any more released truth, and evil will triumph. Always master the dark, manipulating it to be a shield against what will harm us, loved ones or the community at large. Cheers! ",
