            "answer_text": "It is actually quite easy, especially if you want to review certain titles: You can either contact the writers or the publishers directly. Especially publishers offer a way for reviewers to contact them. Look for items like \u201cFor Bloggers/For media\u201d in the navigation menu of the publisher\u2019s website. There are also Facebook groups dedicated to connecting authors and reviewers. But keep in mind: Writers as well as publishers will expect you having a platform. You put your reviews on Amazon or any other book retail site? Not good enough. Goodreads or other online book communities? Better, though it depends on how many followers you have there. Same goes for Facebook. Got a blog? Now we\u2019re talking. How many unique visitors/visits to you have per month and per article? Under triple digits? Forget it. You write for newspapers, magazines, even fanzines and you get your articles/reviews published regularly? Here is your copy! Those are the reviews that usually have the largest reach for us. We might also look at the quality of your reviews: One paragraph reviews, riddled with typos? Generic text like \u201cThis is a nice book and the cover is blue\u201d? Simply copying the blurb or write one sentence? These kinds of reviews are of no use to us. So, if you are serious about this, start writing reviews about books you already know/have. Take writing those reviews seriously. Build your platform. And it is always easier to get a copy of a certain book for review (if you can plead your case accordingly) than just asking \u201cSend me books\u201d. ",

Or you can find authors on FB groups and author forums. ",
