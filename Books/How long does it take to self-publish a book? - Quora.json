You have to format. You have to proofread again. You need to muck up cover, blurb, bio, TOC, all that other stuff. You need to convert it to the file formats used by the printer and/or electronic market. Some of these take time to do. Some \u2014 like hiring an editor or cover artist \u2014 take time but it isn\u2019t your time. While you wait for the work to get back to you, you can be busy writing the next book. And oh yes; it will take a lot longer the first time around because you have to study up and learn all this stuff. So, no. Can\u2019t really put a number to it. \u201cA couple of months\u201d if you are doing most of it yourself and you are a fast learner. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been tracking my progress on my latest book. While it only took me four months to write the story, it took almost six months to edit. If I was writing full time, I could have reasonably published it in 6 months. However, keep in mind, I designed my cover and worked on it simultaneously. If you are doing everything yourself, it might take at least a year. I would say if you are working on it every single day for a minimum of 6 hours a day, you could get in done in 6 months to a year.
