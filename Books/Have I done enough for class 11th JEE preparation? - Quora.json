            "answer_text": "Sounds similar to me , but what actually matters on the very day of JEE EXAM that how much of ur data is still with you ,how much u remember ,& with what level of understanding . For this u need to give tests Regarding topics of 11 th class while preparing for the 12 th topics. Thorough understanding of most of questions present in ARCHIVE helps a lot. especially some subjective questions require very thorough grip on topics. But u don't have Jee Mains questions there ,so u can get it somewhere else like arihant 's 38 yrs ,disha 's 39 yrs. ",
