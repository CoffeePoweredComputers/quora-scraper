            "answer_text": "In the same way as any other sound recording is made. First, the book is usually edited, as most books would take longer to read in full than most listeners are happy to accept. The reader sits in a quiet space, with the book text either displayed on a screen or printed on separate sheets of paper, and the reading is recorded. It is then edited to remove problems such as extraneous noises (Umm, errr\u2026 <Cough>) and mispronounced words, and any required sound effects added. The quiet space may be a normal room or a specially constructed, acoustically dead, vocal booth. The resulting digital sound file is then transferred to a master CD, which is used to make as many copies as are needed. ",

The room or booth they are in is usually acoustically treated to get the best sound and they record it however many times is needed. After, they comp the takes, take out extraneous noises, and add any effects and EQ that are needed. ",
