I have to tell you, I was utterly disappointed by the TV show. The lengths MTV went to in an attempt to appeal to a young, \u201chip\u201d audience was embarassing, and this was all with Terry Brooks\u2019s approval. First, almost none of the characters match the book. Allanon, the supremely powerful, secretive Druid, spent the entire series being anything but powerful and telling everything to everybody. Wil Ohmsford in the books was a scared kid, just trying to survive\u2026in the show, he\u2019s a fashion model. Amberle in the books: scared, pampered princess, in the show, a warrior queen. It was just too much Next, entire groups were just\u2026different. The Elves were now just plain clumsy and weak, even the elite troops. Gnomes were Dwarves\u2026with goggles. Trolls were big guys in gas masks. Seriously, what the hell? Finally, the plot. While they kept the basic idea, they cut out pretty much everything that made Elfstones good. Gone was the desperate battle for the Elven kingdom, replaced by a deus ex machina. The long journey to find the Hearthstone became just a couple episodes of teen-angst. Entire subplots were created to introduce dance parties and romantic tension. To summarize\u2026if you like the book, fear this show. If you like the show, give the book a try, but it may not be what you\u2019re expecting. ",
