Self-publish your book to Amazon's Kindle Store - free to self-publishEbooks from independent authors and publishers - free to self-publishDraft2Digital | Welcome - free to self-publishGoogle Books - free to self-publishFor print books, a print on demand service like CreateSpace (free to self-publish) is probably the best bet, but delivery to India might be expensive compared to the US, Canada and Europe. If you are looking for an Indian company to help with publishing, Self Publishing and Print on Demand in India (free service if you can provide fully formatted content) or Book Publishers in India (paid service) could be considered. Royalties on KDP, the largest marketplace for eBooks vary from 35% to 70% depending on the pricing of the book, the country in which the purchase is made and also based on whether you enroll in KDP Select (where you have to keep your books exclusive to Amazon). Details are available at the link  provided above. Royalties on other platforms vary from 30% to 60%.
