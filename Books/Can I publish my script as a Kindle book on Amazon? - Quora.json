            "answer_text": "Sure, you can. I have published 17 Kindle books during the last 2 years. Most of them were scripts. But I have an advice for you. Nowadays you can publish anything on Amazon but if quality matters to you then take care of these tasks before hitting the big, shiny Publish button. Hire a proofreader/editor and listen to their suggestionsDesign an eye catching coverFormat your manuscipt to look good on different ebook readersRead at least one or two popular articles on amazon self-publishing and book marketing (keywords, description, title and subtitle, kindle unlimited, pricing, etc.)Self-publishing is a beautiful journey and I encourage you to try it out. Experiencing that someone reads your hard work and likes it is one of the most uplifting things and author can imagine! Good luck! ",

If you want to publish it as a book first in order to raise interest for your movie or play or whatever, that makes sense. It certainly could help. But if you simply print the script, I can\u2019t see the purpose of it. But either way, you certainly can do it. ",
