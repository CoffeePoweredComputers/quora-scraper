            "answer_text": "Your question suggests two distinct problems: organizing inputs and generating outputs. Let's address these problems in turn. Organizing Inputs Reading a lot is just a start. There's a difference between passive and active data consumption. A passive reader merely swallows a constant stream of data. No analysis. No insights. Just momentary absorption. This kind of reading is quicker, but you won't remember much. An active reader analyzes the content. Makes connections. Thinks about implications. Active readers have better reading comprehension and therefore, better retention. This skill comes with a price -- your reading speed and consumption will drop. Quality over quantity. You need to become an active reader to properly aggregate your inputs to create good outputs.  So, how can you become a more active reader? A few ideas: Find Themes - the details may vary, but themes are relatively constant. In every disciplines, you can pinpoint universal themes. For example, in literature there are familiar tensions (tropes, even) -- love, war, evil, compassion, et cetera. Read everything with an eye out for these common threads.Recognize Patterns - not to be confused with themes -- pattern recognition transcends subject areas. Universal patterns may influence economics as well as human psychology. Interdisciplinary thinking!Pinpoint Underlying Assumptions - most of the writings and data out there rely on foundational assumptions. Maybe they're correct. Maybe not. If you eke out the assumptions, you can analyze the inputs better.Active reading is more tedious and exhausting than passive reading, but the payoff is high. Your thinking will become clearer and more precise, improving your outputs.  Generating Outputs The first step is deceptively simple. Find an outlet for your outputs. Don't be a knowledge hoarder. Put it out there in a form that suits you. Finding an outlet for your outputs is an exercise in introspection. Questions to ponder: Form? - what kind of form are you comfortable with? Do you prefertime and space to analyze an issue? Maybe a longer-form output (e.g. essays and articles) would work. If you're more of a bottom-line kind of person, maybe something more concise would work (blogs, Quora, et cetera).Pull or Push?- do you need external motivation to generate output? You're  a Pull person. (You need output pulled from you.) Alternatively, are your motivation  internal? You're Push. (You can push out output.) A Push person, intristically motivated, can generate outputs without outside encouragement. Examples are: bloggers, novelists, et cetera. Pull people need a concrete motivator, a question to answer. Examples are: Quora answers, freelance journalists, et cetera. (Guess which one I am.)Internal or External Processor? - as human beings, we all have different needs to interact with others to develop our ideas. Some people rely on introspection for idea generation -- internal processors. Others need external feedback and discussion to think -- external processors. If you're the latter, it may benefit you to belong to a community of like-minded thinkers. If you're the former, a more solitary thinking environment would suit you better.The second step is also deceptively simple. Just do it. Just generate the darn content. We're both fortunate and unfortunate to live in a world where data is freely available and accessible. Just remember that data is now cheap and plentiful. It's the analysis and understanding of the data that's priceless.  For better outputs, you must consume data in an analytical and organized manner. ",

            "answer_text": "How to Analyze an Article: Don\u2019t get Fooled by Terrible Advice  Before attempting to make better use of what you have read online, you must first verify if what you are reading is actually of substance. In this day and age of easy access to information, fabricating false information disguised as articles seems to be a norm. How exactly would you know if you are reading something that does not fall under the aforementioned categories? First and foremost, do some research to see if these are reliable sources. Take note of the source and verify if these are indeed coming from reputable sites. You can also spot a shady article if it is written seemingly with an ulterior motive behind it. Most information-based texts online must be objective and not be inclined to any particular objective, since their main objective is to inform people. It would also be best if you can do some analyzing yourself. You must be able to find raw data that has been used for the research, and it would be good if you can verify them yourself. From your end, you must also have an open mind and keep the biases away from making any judgments. To be on the safe side, it is advised to be more critical than immediately believing what you\u2019ve read. How to Analyze an Article: Don\u2019t get Fooled by Terrible Advice ",
