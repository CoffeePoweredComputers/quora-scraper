            "answer_text": "How did Jerry Seinfeld get famous? His comedy is offbeat and people like anything that is different. It\u2019s a novelty (or was). But oops, too late, he is already famous and there is no going back. America is always looking for the next Rowan and Martin Laugh IN, or the next Saturday Night Live. Both models were successful. One followed the other. Yes, America is hungry for laughs. Perhaps stress makes it so. Do you know how much people are willing to pay comedians? There is a demand for comedians due to the therapeutic impact of laughter. Jerry Seinfield had great support team in the Seinfield show. Everyone in that show had comedic genius. Go back and look at the cast. ",
