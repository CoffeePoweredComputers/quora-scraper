            "answer_text": "THE LEGAL SIDE: Publishing house: When your manuscript is published through a publishing house, you give them an unlimited or time limited license to publish your book, usually in several forms, like hardcover, softcover, and ebook. That all depends on the contract you make with them. If you give them a time limited license, all rights fall back to you once the time limit expires. If the duration is not limited, the publisher will keep the publishing rights (almost) forever. Once you have a contract with a publishing house, you can no longer publish the manuscript or parts of it yourself, although it was created by you. Selfpublishing platform: When you publish on a selfpublishing platform, instead of a publishing house, you grant the platform only the rights to print and distribute your work. That is it. They could not print your books, or create and distribute your ebooks without this license. But they do not have any further rights; they could not translate your book to other languages, or publish it in any other form than the form your created with their tools. They cannot add ten pages with advertisement to your book, or sell the movie rights. This is both the same for Barnes & Noble Press (print and ebook) and for Amazon KDP (ebook) / CreateSpace (print). All selfpublishing platforms work the same way. Beyond that you keep all rights to your work. Nobody keeps you from publishing the same book through different selfpublishing channels, say through Barnes & Noble Press, Amazon and your local printshop. Barnes & Noble or Amazon just work as printing and distribution services in this case, not as publishing houses. Just remember that each different edition of your book or ebook requires a different ISBN. This way the industry guarantees that you will get exactly the same book when you order a specific ISBN twice. So, what is a \u201cdifferent edition\u201d? When you produce two different versions of the book, and a reader could spot a difference between those versions, they are different editions. The hardcover edition, the paperback edition and the ebook need three different ISBNs.When you publish the same text in two different paperback sizes, let us say one as a 5.1 x 7.8 inch paperback, the other as a 5.3 x 8.5 inch paperback, you need two different ISBNs.Publishing an extended version, with additional author\u2019s comments, requires a new ISBN.You do not need a new ISBN \u2026when two publishing houses publish a common book, due to a cooperation, orwhen you change the price, orwhen you print a new, unchanged edition, orwhen you change the printing service. (Producing and distributing the exact same print book through Barnes & Noble Press and Amazon CreateSpace would be such a case.)Vanity press: The third option would be to publish through a vanity press company. You would pay them money for publishing your book (similar to selfpublishing), and lose your rights, as you would with a publishing house. If you want the publishing rights back, you have to pay them again. They have (almost) no duties, but all the rights. THE TECHNICAL SIDE: For both service providers you start with the same file that contains your work, let us say a Word document. Both companies provide different tools for layout, uploading and cover creation, but they are quite similar. So, while you cannot transfer the final book, including all formatting, from Barnes & Noble Press to Amazon or vice versa, you use the same Word file to create the book or ebook on both platforms. ",

            "answer_text": "Barnes & Noble Press and Amazon are not publishers- they\u2019re printers / distributors / retailers. You (the author/publisher) retain rights to your book and can sell via other channels: Ingram, Amazon/CreateSpace, B&N, iTunes, Kobo, your website, indies, whatever. Apparently you have to use a distinct ISBN for B&N - while your book with another ISBN is sold elsewhere (which I don\u2019t like). You have to upload your book on separate accounts on each platform. IngramSpark will push your print and e books through to all channels, but their fees can add up. Lots of indies use both IngramSpark and CreateSpace/KDP. ",
