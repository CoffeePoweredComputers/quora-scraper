            "answer_text": "Judging from what I see in national magazines and poetry websites now, I'm tempted to say that it is very difficult to tell good poetry from bad, especially for editors. It seems that most of what passes for poetry is just a prose paragraph broken up into lines of a few words each. (In the old days, it was a few lines of insipid thoughts arranged to feature a rhyme at the end of each line.) This brings to mind an incident from high school. I was a senior at the time and presumed I was pretty smart in matters literary. So a friend of mine, an underclassman, one day pulled out a piece of paper and, with a very casual unpretentious air, read me a poem he had written. It sounded to me like a parody of Allen Ginsberg or just a riff on the fifties Beatnik style. In other words, I thought he was having a little fun with the medium. So I laughed discreetly in what I thought were the appropriate spots. Well, what do you know? A couple of weeks later, our senior English teacher brought it in and read it to us. \"Let me show you the wonderful poem this young man has written.\" Next spring, it's in the school literary magazine, and we all read it with serious faces. You never know for sure. So how do we distinguish \"free verse\" from chopped up prose sentences or genuine verse from what used to be dismissed as \"doggerel?\" There should be some ambiguity, some metaphysical aspect, some mindset or picture other than the literal interpretation of the words strung together. If you are just telling me that a bug walked across the window on an autumn morning, why should I care? Are you telling me that winter is coming and bugs die? Well, do I have to write my own poem, or are you going to write it for me? Then, unless the bare language is extremely powerful, perhaps evoking some myth or confined emotion seeking escape, there needs to be something special in the imagery of the words. The words ought to have some kind of effect just from the sound, sight,or arrangement. That's why it's poetry and not prose. Here's an example. As kids, we used to like e.e. cummins just because he didn't use capital letters, and, of course, because he looked like an enormous insect. His lines on the printed page looked like a train-wreck. But when \"eddieandbill\" and \"bettyandisbel\" came running and they all got together, and that little lame goatman started whistling \"far and wee,\" we knew what was going on out there (See the e.e.cummins poem \"Chanson Innocente\") I assume that's French for \"Song of Innoncence,\" and, if so, one should not let the irony of the title get lost. This is not about innocence. One of my high school friends was fond of drawing the wee out to weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! to emphasize the fun part to it. After all, it was a little lame goatman that was whistling. Sometimes the rhymes in the rhymed verse are almost irrelevant, overwhelmed by the imagery. See, for instance, Coleridge's Kubla Khan: In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure dome decree: Where Alph the sacred river ran Through canyons measureless to man Down to a soundless sea. In most of Poe's verse it really is the sound effects, to include rhyme, rhythm and interior sound, that just won't let you go. I read once that Ralph Waldo Emerson called Poe \"The Jingle Man\" and I don't believe he meant it as a compliment. But if you aren't gripped by these lines from the first verse of \"Ulalume,\" then you are a really hard case: It was night in the lonesome October Of my most immemorial year: It was hard by the dim lake of Auber, In the misty mid region of Weir - It was down by the dank tarn of Auber, In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir. Sometimes, if, for instance, you're writing nonsense verse, you need the rhyme to carry the load. See Lewis Carroll or Ogden Nash or the now forgotten lad who first chronicled the adventures of the Young Girl from Nantuckett. But if you're doing that, you should make it overtly funny. Don't leave us guessing. Lead-footed rhymes in a poem about death can also be hard to take. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century there were plenty of poets who gave rhyme a bad name. They can still put you to sleep in a few minutes, rhyme and all. Longfellow's best material was unrhymed and Walt Whitman didn't use it. (Well, he probably did somewhere that I have forgotten.) The sure sign of an amateur today is unmetered (or even metered) verse ended with lame rhymes. In this day and time, if you want to be recognized as a poet rather than a jingle writer and you can't compose a country music tune to go with your work, you are probably going to want to use free verse. But please, put a little work into it and give the lines some sort of poetic exuberance even at the risk of sounding like Walt Whitman. Old Walt, whatever his faults, never sounded like he had just written a letter to the newspaper and chopped it up into free verse with a pair of scissors. Well, sometimes he did, but when he did, it was at least funny. There's a great party game which, for some reason I never could get anybody to play, where you change the title of a Walt Whitman poem and get an instant parody. My favorite was I'm Walt Whitman and the Neighborhood Association Wants me Out. It ends with the memorable lines (penned,of course, by Walt himself and extracted from several different poems): I am Walt Whitman, liberal and lusty as Nature, Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding, I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart, I open my scuttle at night... I wait on the door-slab. Who wishes to walk with me? The Victorian and Edwardian poets seemed particularly good at keeping your attention with meter and rhyme while packing in such overpowering themes that you barely noticed the rhyme. Kipling was good at it, but the content of his material seems rather stilted and irrelevant to us today. In the early twentieth century there's A.E. Housman. Once again, the depth of thought in his verse, makes you forget the rhyme almost entirely. Try Housman's \"On Wenlock Edge\" where he plies you with his description of the English woods in winter and draws you into his reverie as he contemplates his Roman ancestor who stood in the same spot when the place was known as \"Uricon.\" This is what we are generally looking for rather than flash and fireworks. Robert Frost likes to give the impression that he's just a simple New England farmer throwing out advice about life, but look at The Road not Taken. Maybe a hint there of Heisenberg and Schrodinger? ( I tried without success to raise this issue as a question on Quora.) Once again, Frost's rhyme and word structure is so mundane compared to the themes his poems suggest that most of us can't even remember the actual verses. Go ahead - try and recite a Frost poem. And there is wait for it... cowboy poetry. You should not dismiss it, because it is a genre unto itself. Usually recited by a fellow in western garb rather than read from a book, it will ordinarily feature incidental rhyme, but the recitation usually minimizes the rhyme in favor of sentimental thoughts about the open range and cowboy ways. It isn't all bad. Some of it is fun, because deep down everybody likes cowboy stuff. Still, to be taken seriously, that cowboy stuff ought to be pretty deep. By the way, have you ever thought about the fact that the towered academics worship Robert Frost and do wheelies over his work while they dismiss Baxter Black and his cowboy poems? Robert Frost claims to be a New England farmer and Baxter Black claims to be just an old cowpoke, but they both invoke the secrets of the Universe in their poetry and both utilize fairly uncomplicated verse. Hey, stuff happens. Then we get T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. They're both still under copyright so I can't bore you with their verse. They were the first, at least in a really long time, whose work was more commonly studied by way of reading critical analysis rather than the poems themselves. This doesn't make it bad poetry. Seriously. The content is there. If you can actually find some scholars who are interested enough in your work to explain it to college students, what difference does it make that it's totally opaque to the average reader? Your problem as a budding poet, however, is that you are probably not going to get any college professors to study and explain your own work. Some of their work is so weird and clunky that it might be fun to play the Walt Whitman game with them. There have been prominent prose writers whose poetry is really bad. William Faulkner, when he was shoveling coal for the Physical Plant at Ole Miss thought he was going to be a poet. He self-published a volume called \"The Marble Faun.\" It would be charitable to say it wasn't very good, totally lacking in interesting content. (Just about everybody who fancies himself a Faulkner parodist throws out the term \"Marble Fawn\" as a vehicle for making fun of Faulkner's verse, and then finds out it's already been done). James Joyce's poetry looks like something you find published by college kids in the student newspaper. Mostly stale imagery without context or depth. Sylvia Plath's work, written in free verse, is fruitful with imagery and metaphor. Each poem offers the reader some sort of thematic idea which she makes available, if not in the form of instant gratification, at least with a reasonable level of contemplation. This is, after all, what poetry is about. In my view, from the standpoint of style, imagery and structure, she sets a standard from which an aspiring poet might benefit by studying. (We aging hippies may have been guilty of exaggerating her importance due to our fascination with her and her hubby-poet Ted Hughes' lugubrious lifestyle. She killed herself by putting her head in an oven, and generations of dilletantes have devoted themselves to accusations that Ted abused her.) Then there is Allan Tate. Though some of his work might tend toward the obscure, most of his theme and content are available with sufficient study by the reader. His Ode to the Confederate Dead is a master work now fallen into disfavor with the elitist establishment due to its subject matter. Tate's body of work demonstrates how poetic energy can be enhanced by invoking the darkness of history, the soul, or religious concepts of the universe. He often addresses death, aging, and history in the abstract taking us just deep enough that we do not lose ourselves in the darkness and then brings us back to pronounce the metaphor. Another from whom the aspiring poet can learn. But be careful here. Mr. Tate is a professional. You may wind up sounding like one of those \"Goths\" who used to wear black makeup and wander around the high school making everybody feel depressed. Dylan Thomas wrote lines that are visually appealing. Lots of big words and complicated syntax, obscure illusions. But maybe a little too obscure. Still he got away with it. He was quite popular during the Beat and Hippie generations. Maybe not so much in the Age of Disco or among Millennials. D.H. Lawrence wrote a lot of stuff about weird animals. A really suggestive snake, and several pages about a baby tortoise! It does have a certain appeal. Mostly it's just weird. Of course, no essay on good and bad poetry is complete without mentioning the late Rod McKuen. He was an accomplished musician and acclaimed composer of popular music and movie themes. Many of the tuneful standards of the era bore his name on the credit line. He recorded his poetry with sleepy background music and made albums out of them. (Before you laugh, they sold by the millions.) According to Wickipedia , he was among the best selling poets in the late sixties. People gave out his little books for birthday presents to Grandma. My point is that you don't hear much about him any more. The albums were something you played at a party after about half of your friends had dozed off. But really not very good as background for making out. Then there was William Butler Yates. He was born in 1865, and we are not much familiar with his \"youthful poetry.\" The poems he wrote in the late Victorian and Edwardian era have the aspect of an old man looking back even though he wasn't old yet, a trait common among poets good and bad. His rhyme seems to be almost incidental. His well-known poem The Lake Isle of Innisfree (from 1893) does not seem to have anything much for us, but for some reason it caught the imagination of Victorian readers and of many on into the middle twentieth century. For this reason, you may have studied it in high school if you preceded the Millennial generation. Its success points out that sometimes you can score by striking a chord with the hearts of your current readers. I once heard a recording , presumably off a wax record, where he grunts it out in the manner you expect a \"real poet\" to sound. Best I can tell it sounds like somebody who wants to go on vacation. After World War I Yates utilized apocalyptic and mythical themes, also invoking the Irish Easter revolt. His later works, some non-rhymed, and some set in rhyme seemingly thrown in for good measure, feature a marvelous syntax which reflects the depth of content. In his last years (he died in 1939) he produced several memorable meditations on old age. When Looking for \"good poetry\" one may well learn from Yates, memorable language combined with a fanciful vision of both past and future which is difficult to let go. So it is with what is probably his most memorable work, The Wild Swans at Coole, closing with the unforgettable lines: But now they drift on the still water Mysterious, beautiful; Among what rushes will they build, By what lake's edge or pool Delight men's eyes when I awake some day To find they have flown away? Read these lines over and ultimately you realize it is not the swans who will fly away, but ourselves, and yet we carry the image of the swans with us for the rest of our lives. Finally, a poem which you can easily access on the Internet, although it remains under copyright and I cannot provide text. It is High Flight by Gillespie Magee an RAF pilot who was killed in combat in 1941. It has become an anthem for aviators and their culture. Like most successful rhyming poetry in the modern era, the rhyme is barely noticed and almost unnecessary. The outstanding feature is the wondrous imagery of a pilot alone in an early model propeller driven aircraft. It is a perfect example of how to get past structural issues, keep the language lucid and readable and avoid the garbled syntax which accompany much modern descriptive poetry. Google it. Download it and read it. Memorize it. So there you are. You are looking for interesting syntax, introspective depth, irony, avoidance of clanging rhythm and loud rhyme (unless there is a joke to be had from it) and as little sanctimony as possible. Beyond that you're on your own. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two related steps. The first, and most significant, to read a great deal of poetry\u2014all periods, all types. The second: read about poetry. Poetry, contrary to what a well-meaning high school teacher or a poster on Quora may have averred, is not solely about the expression of emotion or personal feeling. The center of much poetry\u2014not all\u2014 shifted in that direction about 200 years ago with the beginning of the Romantic period, with Wordsworth\u2019s effusions on daffodils. (I\u2019m speaking in terms of European literature.) The fact is that one must define poetry as a combination of multiple factors\u2014rhythm, rhyme, fixed forms, and heightened language. Most modern poetry has jettisoned the first three and, in my view, even the fourth, in many cases. (A great deal of the poetry written since the beginning of the twentieth century isn\u2019t poetry at all, under that definition.) The subject of poetry can be anything. There are great lyric poems and great love poems, of course; but there are also great epic poems, great religious poems, great narrative poems, great discursive poems, great comic poems, great political poems\u2014great poems, in fact, on just about any subject imaginable. By reading about poetry, you will know which poets critics admire. By reading a great deal of poetry, you will begin to form your own taste and judgment. You will know that you have begun to form taste and judgment when you can say why you like or dislike a poem, and when you can understand why a critic may deem a poem great, and acknowledge that, at the same time you can say why you disagree with that critic\u2019s judgment. A sampling to get you started? A great epic poem: try any of the three ancient epics\u2014Iliad, Odyssey, Aeneid\u2014or Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost. A great discursive and religious poem: Dante\u2019s Commedia. Great love poems: A sampling of Donne and Marvell. Great narrative poems: A few of the Canterbury Tales, perhaps The Knight\u2019s Tale, The Miller\u2019s Tale and The Nnu\u2019s Priest\u2019s Tale. A great satirical poem: Dryden\u2019s Absalom And Achitophel, or Byron\u2019s Don Juan. A selection of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets. Wallace Stevens\u2019 13 Ways Of Looking At A Blackbird. T. S. Eliot, The Waste Land. A selection of Browning\u2019s dramatic monologues\u2014say, Abt Vogler and My Last Duchess. A selection of Blake, who is essentially unclassifiable. These are all great poems. I\u2019d be glad to suggest a sampling of what I consider bad poetry, if you like. ",
