            "answer_text": "Make sure you get the title right and also add the author\u2019s name. For PRINT BOOKS did you check the EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION box? That gets you into the Ingram Catalog. If you\u2019re searching at Barnes & Noble (Nook) they tend to NOT carry \u201cIndependently Published\u201d ISBNs. You need to co-publish (for free) at Nook Books. If you are searching Books a Million on places like that it should show up if you also include the authors name (e.g. MY BOOK TITLE MY NAME). [Once again you have to use EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION to get into the Books A Million data base.] Some retailers won\u2019t carry EROTICA or ADULT ROMANCE, so those won\u2019t get listed at SOME retailers. Allow 7 days from publication for print books to show up. If you are looking for eBooks, they won\u2019t show up anywhere but at Amazon sites. Amazon does not do EXPANDED distribution for eBooks only for print books. You need to co-publish at Smashwords or Draft2Digital ",
