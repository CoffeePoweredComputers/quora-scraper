            "answer_text": "While Einstein debated and made arguments on the validity and meaning of the Uncertainty Principle, it is not correct to say that he disproved it. The Uncertainty Principle is still held as correct. Einstein\u2019s opposition to it evolved with time. At first he argued that the UP is incorrect, and he attempted to do so by proposing Gedankenexperiments, as part of his debates with Niels Bohr. Bohr found subtle flaws in these arguments, both for the position-momentum UP and for the time-energy UP. In later years Einstein accepted the impossibility to measure two complementary quantities simultaneously to arbitrary precision, but he still maintained that these quantities do have simultaneous precise values. He rejected to notion of the probabilistic nature of reality. Einstein did not disprove the UP, but his challenged to quantum theory contributed to deeper understanding of its meaning. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. He didn't although he tried to. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle still holds in all scenarios and is rock-solid. Einstein thought that he could make this uncertainty go away by assuming that there are hidden variables which are beyond our control but which if controlled nonetheless, would lead to a deterministic universe. Bell showed that that wasn't possible if you wanted a local universe, a universe which obeyed relativity and causality. ",
