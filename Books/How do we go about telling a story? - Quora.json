            "answer_text": "Build momentum. : The first cardinal rule of opening lines is that they ought to possess most of the individual craft parts that frame the story as an entire. An opening line ought to have a particular voice, some extent of read, a rudimentary plot and a few hint of characterization. By the end of the first paragraph, we must always also recognize the setting and conflict, unless there's a selected reason to withhold this information. Resist the urge to begin too early. Remember that tiny hooks catch additional fish than huge ones. Several writers are taught that the strange or extreme their opening line, the additional possible they're to \u201chook\u201d the reader. However what we\u2019re not taught is that such massive hooks even have the facility to simply let down readers if the following narrative doesn\u2019t measure up. One of the best pitfalls in beginning a story is to start with an opening line that's confusing upon presentation, however that creates excellent sense once the reader learns extra data later within the story. The matter is that few readers, if confused, can ever create it that so much. Start with a minor mystery: While you don\u2019t need to confuse your readers, presenting them with a puzzle will be extremely effective\u2014particularly if the narrator is additionally perplexed. This has the moment impact of making the reader and narrator partners in crime Writers are typically suggested to form a brief list of titles and take a look at them out on friends and family. Attempt doing the same with opening sentences. Revisit the start once you reach the top: Typically a story evolves thus considerably throughout the writing method that an opening line, notwithstanding however good, now not applies to the story that follows. The only way to understand this is often to rethink the opening sentence, just like the title, once the ultimate draft of the story is complete ",

            "answer_text": "By starting, I presume you mean how do I begin writing a story? It\u2019s always hard. So I\u2019ve found that the best way to deal with it is not to worry about it too much and just start typing. Sometimes ideas flow quickly, but often I have to write for a long time before I really figure out what I\u2019m trying to say. Once I get words down on the page, I can begin to make sense of things, but it is always hard. In fact, let me repeat that: writing is always hard. There are some days when it flows easier than others, but mostly it is a kind of slog that somehow results in moments of enlightenment that surprises me as much as my reader. If by how do I start a story you mean how I write what journalists call a lede, that is a different question. I write mostly long-from narrative journalism, so for me, figuring out the lede often has to do with a character or an idea. I need to draw the reader in and establish quickly what the story is about and where it is going. Often I will chose a particular anecdote that is compelling, or a sentence that establishes a particular tone or expectation for the reader. In my memoir about growing up in Silicon Valley, I started with the sentence, \u201cAs a kid, I always felt lucky.\u201d I like that because it established a central fact of my life, but also telegraphed to reader that, in the course of this narrative, my luck was likely to change. In The Water Will Come, I began with the sentence, \u201cAfter the hurricane hit Miami in 2037, a foot of sand covered the famous bow-tie floor in the lobby of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach.\u201d Obviously the idea here was portray the consequences of sea level rise in a dramatic narrative of the future, one that not only set up the themes to be discussed in the book, but also was a kind of homage to the famous opening scene in Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring, in which she imagines a future spring day without birds.
