            "answer_text": "Inventing is easy. I do it every day- and so do you. I make tools to do specific jobs that I have problems with in my DIY hobby.  The problem is that no one else is interested in my inventions because my ideas are specialised and only of interest to me and a few of my friends. We are inventors as a human race- we invent words, songs, machines and processes. Every now and then someone invents something that is of use to a large number of people. Money gets invested, lots of people get interested and before you know it there is an end product that is of use to lots of people. The problem is that by the end of this process so many people are involved and they all claim that it is their invention or that they had a pivotal or special role in its success. Although you came up with the original idea you wont profit much from it. Invention is commonplace and its easy- every one does it all the time all year round. In order to get your product to market you need a team of people with skills in marketing, design, engineering, manufacturing and so on. If you want to profit from your invention then you need to study the subject of innovation and technologey management. You will learn the difference between great ideas and profitable ideas. Look at some of the inventions of John Logie Baird who is credited with inventing the television. They were base on his own day to day life and needs: A glass razor which would never wear out A cure for piles Pneumatic shoes to make walking easier for someone with flat feet. Nobody else was interested in these inventions so he did not profit from them Lots of people were involved in solving the problems of transmitting live pictures to peoples homes- everyone involved in that process was innovating. They may have been paid just a daily wage but that\u2019s how it is! Each day we are innovating and earning a crust- it\u2019s what we do regardless of who gets the credit for the original idea. ",
