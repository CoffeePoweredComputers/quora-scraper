If it a non-fiction, it is imperative for the reputation of the author for the facts to be accurate. For a fictional work, facts can be interpreted as long as they are not referenced from someone or somewhere else. One cannot say that a real person said something unless the story references the statement. Examples: (1) A fictional account of Benjamin Franklin traveling to the present would not need to validate what he happens to say. (2) A fictional yet detailed account of a winter in Montana does not to be accurate for the time period. ",

I\u2019ve had copyeditors go to the extent of finding out how many miles are between neighborhoods and questioning how fast a character could travel between them. Also, double checking any fact-based reference (like a specific police code ina specific county of a specific state). But it depends on the diligence of the copyeditor. ",
