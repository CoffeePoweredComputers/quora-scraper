            "answer_text": "To Dawn: If you are writing a school paper and want to quote a small part of a book (say, a few sentences), you must use proper quotation marks and clearly state all the bibliographical information about the book in a footnote and the bibliography. However, if you are writing your own book and want to include even a few distinctive words (e.g., \u201cE.T., phone home\u201d) from someone else\u2019s book or movie, you must get prior written permission from the publisher or you could be sued for copyright infringement, which could cost you lots of money and perhaps jail time. If the book is very, very old, and its copyright has expired, you might be able to quote from that book without permission, but you must still research its copyright status. You would also need to use quotation marks and cite your source or it would be considered plagiarism. Note: A good friend of mine lost out on being able to obtain her doctorate at a university in Berlin, Germany, because she quoted a few pages from a book in her dissertation but did not properly show what were the actual quotations. She was not given a second chance. \u2014Sarah M. 3/25/2018  ORIGINAL QUESTION: Can I copy a small part of a book? ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, no. There are cases where you can use very small parts of a book, using quotation marks, and then making it perfectly clear that those words are not YOUR words, but that they are the words of the author who wrote the book. You absolutely must make it perfectly clear, in the writing, and you must also give full credit to the author, and name the author, and give full credit to the book, and name the book \u2014 so there is no doubt. Failure to do so, is plagiarism. Trust me, you do not want to do that. Plagiarism is not a good thing. There have been cases where someone actually lost their job, many years later, because someone discovered they had done what you described, and pretended the book\u2019s words were their own words. Really. It happened to a German Defense Minister, just recently. And, here is a case from last year, where a school principal was caught, and forced to resign: Masconomet principal resigns over plagiarism claims - The Boston Globe ",
