            "answer_text": "IMPORTANT: Don't waste time writing an eBook until you know people actually want to buy it. The startup adage holds: Make something people want. 1) Understand your marketThere's no point in writing an eBook, or doing anything in business for that matter, without first understanding your customers. Get out of your house/office and talk with real peopleTweet and post in relevant social media groups and forumsTalk to people about what they would like out of your productThere's nothing worse than spending time on an eBook that nobody purchases, so make sure you know there's a market before you continue. Once you've found your market, you can begin researching your topic. 2) Conduct thorough research on topic I typically will read a ton of different material: Wikipedia articles (http://en.wikipedia.org)Magazine postsAcademic papers (http://scholar.google.com/)Lurk/post on relevant forums.This helps me gain a broad understanding of the content and niche that I'm targeting with my eBook. After I do thorough research and gather proper notes and citations, I begin to write. 3) Write your eBook Organize, organize, organize. And structure. The most important part of good literature, informational, fiction or otherwise, is structure. The structure of your text should mirror the mental model your reader creates when reading it. Make sure you make it easy for them to construct, follow and extrapolate upon that model. Write an outlineCreate sub-sections, break the eBook down into digestible chaptersHave each sub-topic follow into the next (see how I constructed this post)\"After I do thorough research... I begin to write.\" -> Write Your eBookThis helps the reader follow along.Follow the structure of the overall document in each sub-section:Example Structure:Introduction + Topic 1 + Introduction to Topic 1 + sub-topic 1 leading into sub-topic 2 + sub-topic 2 leading into sub-topic 3 + ... + Conclusion of Topic 1 leading into Topic 2  + Topic 2 + ... + ...Conclusion After you write your book, you now have to actually publish it into an eBook. This can easily be handled from your desktop. 4) Publish your eBook Create the eBookSave your Word, Google or whatever Doc to HTML, this is a strong base to work with other conversion methods. You might want to save directly to PDF in which case Google Docs and Drive can take care of it. In general you will want to support the following formats: ePUB (Open source .ePub eBook format) Yay!Mobipocket (Open .prc format) Yay!Amazon Kindle (product) AZW (Proprietary) Boo!Adobe Systems (company) PDF (file format) (Proprietary Photo Document File) Boo!As your first step, convert from the source format to ePub.My two favorite online ePub converters (just upload and download your ePub): 2epub (http://www.2epub.com/)ebook.online-convert (http://ebook.online-convert.com/convert-to-epub)Publish the eBook:Phew! Now you can post your new eBook on any of these sites: 1) Amazon's Kindle Store (https://www.createspace.com/)2) Apple's iBooks Store (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/)3) Clickbank Marketplace (http://www.clickbank.com/) More info:What is the best way to export from Word to epub format?How do I publish an eBook? It's always best to post on as many platform as you can. Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages but by posting on all of them you increase your sales and customer reach, which gets us into advertising. 4) Advertise your eBook This step is really important as well. The best way to do is to mix social media and traditional marketing. Social Media Marketing: Hop on some of the forums that are part of your target marketAnswer questions and be all-around helpfulPlace a link to your eBook page in your signatureTraditional Marketing: Check out PPC advertising platforms like Google AdsCheck out the sites that you found in your research and see if they would post a link to your eBook (maybe even offer a percentage of salesAffiliate Marketing: Affiliate Marketing platforms can help make sales as well [Amazon.com (product), Commission Junction, ClickBank (company), and Baybo]Be sure to provide your affiliates with all of the marketing material they might need (stock emails, stock images, advertising copy, etc.)Keep in touch and support them, remember, they work hard to make you money!Send me an email, tweet or private message if you want some more tips or just want to chat about ePublishing, online business, etc. I've been doing this for a while. stephen@baybo.it ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of options, but let me sketch out the overall contours of a plausible workflow.  Start with the content you want to publish. Your life will be much easier if the content is already in a text or simple HTML format..Prepare your content for conversion. You will learn from experience in step (3) what you need to do here!Decide on the target formats you want to support (ePub, Kindle, PDF ...)As your first step, convert from the source format to ePub.* from Word, save as HTML or use the Aspose Word to ePub plugin.* from simple html, use Sigil. 5. Convert from ePub to Kindle (.prc) and any other formats you want. 6.  Select retailers and distributors. At this writing, Amazon and BN's PubIt are the two biggest.  Apple's iBookstore is a pain for publishers and Google eBookstore sales are minimal, so I would put those as lower priorities. There are lots of other options, though.  You can sell directly from your own site, you can use aggregators like SmashWords or BookLocker, etc.  My advice is don't get caught in the weeds of exploring every single small company that offers a clever solution. Follow the 80/20 rule and focus on Kindle and PubIt. 7.  Create metadata (once): book description, blurbs, etc. 8. Upload desired format + metadata to retailers/distributors. 9. Test purchase and quality assurance. 10. Market. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to write an ebook is do it, do it now! Get writing this very minute. Decide on your topic & go for it. Ordering that writing is useful, I write self help books so I break down my topic into parts, which will be my chapters. I write these down then add sub headings under each chapter. When it comes to the writing I have a plan of action I can see & write accordingly! I am guessing it is not too dissimilar writing fiction, mapping out your plot first. My biggest tip is write, write, write. You can edit when done. Too many people never finish writing their book as they get so hung up on editing as they they go that they get stuck on the first chapter forever! When you have finished pouring your soul onto the page, then go re-read & edit. After that, re-read & edit again! Lastly, get someone else to read it & suggest edits. I paid a designer for my cover but many of the sites such as Calibre or Amazon do a basic cover. Maybe check Fiverr too. I won't go into the technical side of converting your writing to Ebook form, but I assure you it is not hard, although that is not saying there is no work involved, what with formatting etc but there are lots of great tuition & articles online. As for selling your Ebook, that is where the work comes in! You have no publisher to help with this so it's all you baby! Social media & lots of it. Get friends & colleagues to rate it (this takes it further up Amazon lists, if you have gone with them) ... just plug, plug, plug!  Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Two approaches to consider for creating your ebook. First and the most popular is Amazon KDP. Suzanne Steele\u2019s answer is spot on, Amazon KDP is super easy to use. Tons of tutorials out there, both on Amazon\u2019s site and on YouTube. When creating your final draft, you can use the freelance site Fiverr and have them format your text into the proper ebook format. You can also find ebook cover design for relatively low prices. You could also design your own cover in the tool Canva. All of this adds up to be in the $50-$100 range. And Amazon KDP is free, you don\u2019t have to buy an ISBN. I disagree with some of the answers below saying not to \u201cwaste time writing an ebook.\u201d After reading a few of the answers, the argument seems to be you might spend all of this time on something that sells five copies (which, to be fair, this does happen all the time). Which brings me to the second publishing approach. Why not release your ebook as a PDF that people can have via email? This way, even if it does sell just five copies, at least you have a connection to who those five people are. You can start building an email subscriber list. Keep them in the loop about the next book or other writing projects. Write the ebook because you want to do it. Work on making it as good as it can be and enjoy the process. It\u2019s a really low-cost way to share your stories. ",

Go to a publisher, and let it sell your book, again, just like any other, independently from the format. Or you may go to a self-publishing platform, that may or may not covers printed and e-books. There are many platforms, that supports self publishing from Smashwords to Amazon KDP.
