            "answer_text": "One of Agatha Christie's biographers, Laura Thompson, discredits the popular view that Christie\u2019s stories and characters lack emotion. Instead, Thompson suggests, Christie was an adult writing for adults, and it should be simply understood that her characters experience love, hope, fear, sadness, jealousy, anger, and all the other usual emotions, without Christie making these the cornerstones of her stories. But, as other answers to this question have noted, Christie does focus more on plot and puzzle than emotions. I think there are two reasons for this. First, she was a British writer publishing from the 1920s to the 1970s. In common with characters created by many of her peers, her characters kept their emotions on a pretty tight rein. Read other Golden Age mystery writers like Ngaio Marsh and Margery Allingham to see that it wasn't just Christie whose characters show considerable restraint. For that matter, non-mystery writers, such as Evelyn Waugh, Ford Madox Ford, John Wyndham and others wrote books that share that tone. These stories\u2014these characters\u2014belong to their place and time, neither of which were confessional, at least not publicly. The other reason is part of what made Christie such a brilliant plotter. Her characters only appear to fit into some stereotype or other: the bluff retired military man, the finicky spinster, the vamp, the plodding policeman, and so on. Christie uses these tropes to hoodwink us\u2014over and over again\u2014into failing to see, for example, that the refined and quietly devoted married couple on holiday together are not at all content, but are suffering terribly, he because he is being blackmailed into continuing an extramarital affair with a woman he has come to loathe, and his wife because she is eaten up by sorrow and jealousy over the situation she is pretending not to know about. How's that for plenty of emotion! But of course, in order to fool us, Christie is careful about going behind the mask. And even when she does go there, as biographer Laura Thompson says, she gives her readers credit for understanding how people feel in a given situation, without devoting pages and pages to it. One of my favourite Christie novels is The Hollow, which provides a story of considerable emotional sophistication. Everything is politely restrained and carefully contained\u2014in fact, you could make an argument that the murder would never have happened without that restraint\u2014but the emotions are there in abundance.

            "answer_text": "Agatha Christie novels have characters who run the entire gamut of emotional expression - but the narrations rarely get emotional. It\u2019s such a plus to be able to focus on the actual mystery at hand instead of getting embroiled in the main detective\u2019s personal drama. Poirot does occasionally show some emotions - rarely about a case, mind. When he does, it\u2019s got something to do with justice - someone has offended his sense of it and he lets them know it. I can\u2019t think of a time Miss Marple lost her temper - she\u2019s definitely shown having compassion and sympathy, however. I love Agatha Christie for how deftly she paints a 3 dimensional character in just a few words, and how she can fool me EVERY time about some aspect of a case, even if I\u2019ve read it 50 times. I\u2019m going to forget how it was done, or why the person did it, or even WHO did it (if it\u2019s been long enough since I read it) LOL Nothing about her books makes it easy to guess the perpetrator - it requires careful reading and analysis of the sequence of events to figure that out. Those with logical, precise minds will find it easy, once ALL the facts have been given (and Ms Christie gave them - she despised writers who sprung unknown major facts at the end of a mystery novel), but never think you can guess the murderer without following the \u2018case\u2019.
