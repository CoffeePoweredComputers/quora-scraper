            "answer_text": "It depends on the pacing, genre and page size of the book I\u2019m reading. Say the pacing of the story is \u2018fast\u2019. Clear, sharp words and defining sentences. Events move quickly between paragraphs. I follow the author\u2019s intent and I read the pages faster than I normally would. I could read about 20\u201330 pages. Say the pacing of the story is \u2018slow\u2019. Words are ambiguous, the vocabulary is a little above my own level, the dialogue is longer (And probably more realistic, from my own experience in reading slow-paced novels) and the sentences and events drag on through the pages. Progression is slow, and I follow the author\u2019s intent and I read the pages slower than I normally would. I could read about 10\u201320 pages. Say the pacing of the story is a mix between the two, I could probably read 20 pages. I read a lot of fantasy, and that genre tends to have longer pages and a smaller word size, so regardless of the pacing I could probably read 10\u201315 pages. How interested I am in the book at all also affects how much I read. So to summarize: I read could read from 10\u201330 pages for 30 minutes. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on the book. If it\u2019s fiction, I could easily read 30\u201350 pages per half-hour, depending on chapter length, font size, and pacing. If it\u2019s non-fiction, the number varies. If it\u2019s on a subject I\u2019m already familiar with, or a re-read; I usually read around 20\u201340 pages per half-hour. If it\u2019s on subject I\u2019m just getting into, or is a text more complex than meets the eye; anywhere from 10\u201340 pages per half-hour is the norm. In all, it goes from as little as 10 pages to 50 pages. ",
