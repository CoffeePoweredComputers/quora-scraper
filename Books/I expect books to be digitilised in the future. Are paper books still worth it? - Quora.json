            "answer_text": "I don't see why this question has to be all-or-nothing. I'm a highlight-and-dogear reader when I'm learning something challenging, and there seems to be a definite upper limit on how much I can read on a screen for one subject. I'm also perfectly happy to read a library book if that's what's available, and check it out again the next time I want to read it. You might try a mixed approach such as the following: 1. Definitely use your library for anything likely to be temporary, or for a first pass on anything you're still evaluating. Perhaps you'll only read a few relevant chapters of a work, or perhaps it's the novel you checked out just for fun, to keep yourself company on the bus.  One possibility, if you're making lots of notes, is to decide that that's one of the books you'll get. Another possibility is a buck or two worth of index cards. Use one per page where you're writing notes, and number them, and perhaps put a cue about what text triggered the notes, thus:      p.44 -wasn't until the mid-1960s- Very late, what took so long? Then bundle the cards with a rubber band or binder clip and make sure the front one is labeled with the title of the book. If you someday acquire the book or check it out again, you can tuck the cards into the pages they came from. Such an approach also gives you more space to write. 2. See if you can get used copies of anything you're planning on scribbling in. If you need the very latest in a narrow academic field, this might not work so well, but anything reasonably popular and a few years old is usually fairly easy to procure. (Of course, even used copies demand bookcase space.) 3. Explore e-readers. See if you can borrow one from a friend for an evening (some libraries have even begun to circulate them), and find out whether you can actually get comfortable on it. If it's not for you, so be it, but at least you know for sure. Ebooks are, as you note, much harder to mark up and to experience at a kinesthetic level. ",

One big disadvantage is that graphics and pictures are lousy (in Kindle type eBooks, in PDF they're OK, but PDF pages don't adapt to the size of your screen easily. Text in columns is especially awful to read.) ",
