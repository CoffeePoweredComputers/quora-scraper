            "answer_text": "Because that\u2019s just the way he is. He\u2019s dealt with hardship practically since the day he was born. Before ever meeting Jack, he had to deal with his physically abusive brother, his emotionally abusive father, the death of his parents, being forced to drop out of high school, having no money. He just deals with what life throws at him, and gets on with it. As the last line of the story says, \u201cThere was some open space between what he knew and what he tried to believe, but nothing could be done about it, and if you can\u2019t fix it you\u2019ve got to stand it.\u201d [Side note - here is part of my personal interpretation of the first part of the sentence: what he knows is that he and Jack were the loves of each other\u2019s lives and that there will never be anybody else for him after Jack is gone, and what he tries to believe is that things couldn\u2019t have gone any differently than they did, that they couldn\u2019t have made different choices.] Not to mention, he has his memories to get him through the years. The story opens with a prologue set some time after the end of the story. He wakes up early one morning, knowing he has to move that day because the ranch he was working on has been sold. He\u2019s going to have to stay with his daughter indefinitely until he can find a new job. He\u2019s facing an uncertain future, and yet, he finds himself happy, just because he dreamed about Jack. Perhaps, deep down, he\u2019s hoping that he and Jack will be reunited after death (even if it\u2019s in hell), and he\u2019s just biding his time until that day comes. ",
