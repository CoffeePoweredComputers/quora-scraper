            "answer_text": "Answered 29 August, 2020 When Yellowstone erupts again and you\u2019re in the caldera nothing happens to you, unless you\u2019re extremely unlucky to be standing exactly where a phreatic explosion happens. That\u2019s because you\u2019re probably unaware of the small event predicted as the next one to occur, the caldera is that large. The question presumes that every eruption of the Yellowstone hot spot is a super eruption. 80 of the 81 most recent eruptions have been lava flows, steam/hydrothermal explosions, gas emissions or single vent volcanoes of less than Category:VEI-8. Now, a VEI 7 event, one the size of which made the Valles Caldera in New Mexico or destroyed Santorini near Greece would be very destructive to anybody in the park. The good news is that, decades before that can happen, before much of the crystalised mush beneath the caldera could melt in order to made a large-scale eruption possible there would be a specialised sort of earthquake called \u201cmagmatic\u201d creating harmonic tremours. Yellowstone\u2019s hot spot can\u2019t erupt in a caldera-forming eruption with no warning as portrayed in Hollywood, the BBC or the Daily Express. The only people in harms way of such an event would be scientists studying it or scofflaws in the backcountry who snuck in after the evacuation order. Jesse Lee O\u2019Connor \u674e\u6770\u897f's answer to If the Yellowstone super volcano were to break open, how much warning might we expect?  What would happen if the Yellowstone supervolcano actually erupted? The next predicted eruption being hydrothermal/phreatic would not be noticed by people more than a few kilometres away. A gas release such as killed five bison in 2004 may not be noticed till the next spring. What type of eruption will Yellowstone have if it erupts again? And, to be precise, a caldera cannot erupt. It\u2019s the remnant of a past large-scale eruption. Magma chambers may erupt when conditions are right, which they aren\u2019t at this time and would take years if ever again to develop so at this location.

            "answer_text": "Actually, according to USGS, some 68% of the eruptions are effusive, (flowing magma - lava). So, depending on you location in the park, (It\u2019s a huge park covering some 3400 square miles), you could see the erupting lava flow from a safe distances. But even if you in the actual caldera, there are going to be warning signs that an eruption is imminent. Also, the park service has emergency sirens in the park to warn visitors to evacuate immediately. But, if you are unfortunate enough to be ANYWHERE in the park when an \u2018explosive eruption\u2019 occurs - well then you\u2019re toast. Those really big events happen about every 600 to 800 thousand years apart. ",
