            "answer_text": "Yes. Paper books will always be around. Some people just like analog. There are no notifications that pop up in a book. No other apps calling to you to distract you from reading. I actually prefer ebooks and paperbacks except when it comes to two things: some kinds of non-fiction, and when I get to meet an author I want one signed. Also I\u2019m sure tons of kids enjoy reading digitally on a device but my kids love reading their physical books. I love that they have a bookshelf full of them to grab and own for a while, and read without distraction. For the most part I read by listening to audiobooks and reading eBooks, but there\u2019s something about getting to see a full two page spread and having the ability to underline or bracket things to look back on for reference later in a non-fiction book that I can\u2019t seem to match with highlights in an eBook, even though those are searchable and faster to find, slowly studying a text seems to lend itself better to ink on a page for me. I don\u2019t think it really matters, just preference. ",

            "answer_text": "I hope so. I have a bachelor\u2019bachelor's in elementary education and a master's in library science. In one of my literature classes, the text had a passage about how the author hoped that long into the future children would curl up on a hearth rug (or the future equivalent) and read a physical book. That was in the 1980s. I listen to audiobooks and read on electronic devices but I still also read physical books. Books that are illustrated or have graphs and such are always going to look better in print. ",
