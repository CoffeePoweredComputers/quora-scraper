            "answer_text": "Use the thesaurus not for a better word but for the most appropriate word when you write down the speech. Communication, both verbal and non-verbal, is a higher order skill which needs to be cultivated through consistent effort. Use Merriam-Webster online Dictionary and Thesaurus, which has an audio providing the pronunciation also. Or any other. Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis can also help build your vocabulary. Listening well and reading intently are the first steps in good oral and written communication. Build your knowledge of grammar (Wren & Martin), syntax, vocabulary and so on. Before you use a particular word, for example, \u201cbeautiful\u201d, check the online thesaurus for synonyms and use the most appropriate word. Vocabulary is built brick by brick. So learning one new word leads to learning many others. Check the exact meaning of every new word from the dictionary, instead of trying to guess the meaning from its context. Read a lot of good authors. Listen to a lot of good speakers. Yet, in either case, develop your own unique style. Write short speeches, memorize them, internalise them and deliver them before the mirror or a better speaker than you. Practice makes perfect. Join a local Toastmasters Club or other public speaking club. Standing Ovation - Fifteen speeches to steer the budding orator by Sterling Publishers on Amazon will be a great help. ",
