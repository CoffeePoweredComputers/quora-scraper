            "answer_text": "The only thing I can read in common, if any, is that the working class (blue collars especially) and Huck Finn with his friend Jimmy (if I remember the name), is that both, Finn and the working class have nothing to lose and much to gain in terms of human dignity. H. Finn tries to escape a world condemned by history (economy based on slavery), or that reached the end of his role in history. K. Marx says something similar about the capitalism: a new vision of society, a new age is mature and the time of men living by the value of the work of other men is over. While H. Finn and Jimmy hope to live according to their free will, they don't know what will be their life, life as a never ending sum of experiences and growth of dreams made true, the communism instead dictates what is right and wrong according to the needs of everybody (good but only in theory). In Karl Marx people are not free to grow according to their free will, your needs are indicated by the party, there is no space for free experiences. In facts there is poor space for personal ideas (in terms of literature, science, techniques, human rights, etc..). So H. Finn and Jimmy see an open horizon, Marx on the other hand, freezes the dynamics of human relations according to an analysis good to explain the past. ",

            "answer_text": "You mean the Huck Finn that Sam Clemens wrote? I have read Huck Finn by Mark Twain; I have read both Karl and Groucho Marx (Groucho is much better read and a wiser, more realistic philosophy). Sam and Karl were both men. Neither of them were very good with money. Huck was a fictional American with a Black friend. Karl was a German philosopher who wrote fictions. I don't recall Karl having any Black friends. ",
