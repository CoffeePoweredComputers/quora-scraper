            "answer_text": "More or less the same way as today, in tanks. There is more than one kind of \u201cair\u201d on a submarine. More or less air for breathing, which isn\u2019t stored, and air for blowing ballast tanks stored in compressed air tanks. As well, any compartment isolated from the normal crew/equipment compartments, has air (instead of water) most of the time. There are numbers of air storage tanks, and numbers of water ballast tanks, each with a name. It is by opening valves to let water in, and vents to let air out, that a submarine fills its tanks (both to submerge and to control \u201ctrim\u201d - too keep the submarine in the desired attitude for various operations of damage control functions). The crew air can have its oxygen replaced by pure oxygen stored in tanks. In WW1 and WW2 the crew would use chemicals to absorb Carbon Dioxide from the breathing air. [Today there are more sophisticated \u201cscrubbers\u201d to remove gasses which are a problem if they become too concentrated]. A different issue that affects crew air is if it must be used by diesel engines (or rarely, in WW1, gasoline engines). These engines need a lot of air and also a way to get rid of exhaust gasses. So they normally operated only on the surface, until the adoption of the snorkel (or snort) - otherwise the diesel would use up the crew air and the exhaust would poison the crew (if unable to be vented outside). Note that even nuclear submarines STILL have diesel engines, and often a snorkel, for use if the main propulsion system fails. ",

            "answer_text": "Some types of WWII USA Subs had both CO2 scrubbers and oxygen tank storage (so oxygen levels could be adjusted/raised): they were equipped with a CO2 scrubber and extra oxygen storage.\u00a0Balao-class submarine - Wikipedia So did some German U-boats: Type VII C Manual see page 84\u201385: b) Air purification system. The air purification system consists of: Purification system: removing CO by means of sodium hydroxide cartridges Renewal system: bleeding O from oxygen flasks. A man when breathing, creates 30 liters/hour of CO and needs the same amount of O. The air purification system maintains the CO content at 1.5% level and O2 content at 17.5%. CO content above 2% is injurious. The estimation of time, when 1.5% CO content in 400 m\u00b3 of air in the boat will be reached: 37 men creates per hour: 37 x 30 x 100/400000 = 0.28% CO/ hour So 1.5% CO content will be reached after 5 hours 20 minutes. The measurement of CO and O concentration is made by means of Orsat devices, first time after 4 hours of submerged cruise. Moreover there are CO sampling tubes to detect carbon dioxide content above 1.5%. Air purification 3 air purifiers are used for air purification connected to exhaust air duct, located as follows: In the aft torpedo and E motor room In the control room In the forward torpedo room Each air purifier consists of 4 sodium hydroxide cartridges.  U-Boat Type VIIC A. Ship Information Page 85  U-boat Information VIII. Safety and Rescue Installations 7 The air from the compartment is withdrawn through an air exhaust duct through the air purifier and purified air is returned by an air intake duct. The regulating valve allows adjustment of the amount of air passing through the purifier. When adjusting, the amount of passing air should be kept as low as possible to avoid warming the cartridges, because in this case, the cartridges don't reach their full efficiency. Ventilation capacity is: In the 1st hour \u2013 350 liters/hour In the 2nd hour \u2013 400 liters/hour In the 3rd hour \u2013 450 liters/hour Air renewal Air renewal takes place, when the oxygen content drops below 17.5%. 10 oxygen flasks are provided, with capacity 50 liters each at a pressure of 150 at. These flasks are located as follows: E motor room 1 flask Diesel engine room 2 flasks Control room 4 flasks Forward torpedo room 3 flasks The main manifold, to which all flasks are connected, has a branch from the control room to the upper deck, which is used for filling the flasks with oxygen. Oxygen can be supplied through connecting pipes to the air exhaust duct and added to circulating air or bled directly into the compartments of the boat. Regulating valves installed in the connecting ducts and in the end of branch leading to the conning tower, which allow adjusting the oxygen feed rate depending on crew numbers. The stored oxygen and sodium hydroxide cartridges enable the crew of 37 men, to remain continuously submerged for 72 hours. Snorkels were used normally for diesel motor/generator operation for propulsion (an battery recharge), so that subs needed not surface completely, but instead extended the dual purpose exhaust and intake snorkel above the water and then the diesel engines could run. This was a lot safer than surfacing to say, open hatches, which may lead to the sub being more easily spotted (by boat or plane, visually or via radar). German U-boat snorkel Submarine snorkel - Wikipedia So as you can see, snorkels allowed the diesel motor and generator to run to charge the batteries - near surface. When submerged electric batteries propelled the sub and oxygen was replenished from dedicated tanks tanks and CO2 scrubbed from the air for some WWII subs. ",
