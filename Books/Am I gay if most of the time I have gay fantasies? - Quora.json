            "answer_text": "Well it is probably likely that you are gay if most of your sexual fantasy\u2019s are about men if your a boy, or about females if your a girl. But don\u2019t be in a big hurry about figuring things out if your a young teenager. Take your time date one of your crushes boy or girl see how that goes and repeat that a few times the answer will develop when it does you will know it\u2019s really your authentic self if you let it come about naturally without rushing things. If your older and still not sure either date more and figure it out, or maybe get some counseling from a therapist that specializes in psycho social development issues. As far as coming out do not rush there either wait until your comfortable and have a plan for dealing with any worst case results such as being disowned by parents, losing your job, or losing a friend. Your not in anyway doing anything wrong if you stay in the closet until you finish university and have a job, or if you come out as a young teen, no timing is somehow more legitimate, nor does it make you a good or bad person, do what feels right to you. My suggestion is if you have supportive parents who you are sure will not react badly then come out young. If your parents are likely to react badly then stay in the closet until you finish your education or even longer as far as they are concerned. Attend college in a different state then the one your parents live in and be out there to a select group of friends but not to anyone from your home town who might tell your parents if there was ever a problem in that friendship. In a perfect world I believe being out when your a 13 year old is more likely for the person to avoid all the psychological problems caused by living in the closet. Living a lie causes stress, fear, loneliness, self esteem issues, PTSD, and can lead to suicide in extreme cases. So the less time one has to live a lie the better. But in this world being kicked out of your home as a teenager happens way more often to gay kids then any other cause of teen homelessness. Homeless gay teens have much higher suicide rates then other homeless teens, and the psychological damage caused by homelessness and rejection by family is much more severe then those caused by living a lie.

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. And I am not aware of any evidence that supports a claim that fantasies cause homosexuality. But there is certainly a causal relationship in the other direction: if you\u2019re gay, then you\u2019ll have gay fantasies. If you Google for it, I am certain you will find various studies that show that straight people do fantasize about same-sex sexual contact now and then even if they do not pursue it. Rather, I think you have to look at the prevalence, frequency, and quality of your sexual fantasies over all. If you think about same-sex sex all the time, well, that might be a sign that you\u2019re gay. If you only fantasize about it occasionally, perhaps you\u2019re bisexual. If you are very young, though: I would be cautious about regarding your sexual fantasies as some sort of irrefutable test of your sexual identity. Young people are often very easily aroused by all number of things. As you age, you\u2019ll probably find some greater consistency in what appeals to you. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A Homosexuality is romantic attraction,sexual attraction, orsexual behaviorbetween members of the same sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, homosexuality is an enduring patternof emotional,romantic, and/orsexualattractions to people of the same sex.[1] That is what it means to be gay. Homosexual fantasies, in and of themselves, do not necessarily amount to one being gay. However, they may be an indicator of homosexuality. If they persist in duration and intensity, they indicate a sexual attraction to members of the same sex. That satisfies the definition of homosexuality as a sexual orientation. Taking your question literally, nothing \u201cmakes\u201d a person gay other than one\u2019s DNA. Same-sex sexual orientation is an innate and immutable heritable trait.[2] It\u2019s hard coded in one\u2019s DNA. That\u2019s what \u201cmakes\u201d a person gay. Homosexual fantasies do not cut it except in so far as they accurately indicate same-sex sexual orientation, or in so far as they are harbingers of homosexual behavior yet to come.

And I want him to fuck my ass so good and slow so I can feel his dick slide in and out of me until he fills me up with every drop of cum he has.
