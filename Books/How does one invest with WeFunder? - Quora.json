            "answer_text": "Hi Will, It's pretty straightforward. First, go to their website and sign up. You'll have to provide some personal info (including your SSN, as they need that to verify your legal eligibility to invest in American startups), answer some questions, and set up a link with an account from which cash for investments you choose to make on Wefunder will be pulled. Then, you can browse individual offerings on the platform, and when you're ready to pull the trigger on one: download the documentation (for your records), click the \u201cinvest\" button, fill in the amount you want to invest, and accept the various disclosures. The amount you indicated will be withdrawn from your linked account in a matter of days, but your investment won't be finalized until a specified date before the current round of funding for the startup in question closes. Until that date, you can cancel your investment and have it refunded to you. Also, if a material change in the offering occurs, you'll be sent an email prompting you to reconfirm your investment. This can typically be accomplished with a simple button click, but if you fail to do so in a timely manner, your money will be refunded. The processes described above are basically the same for all the other investment crowdfunding platforms I've used as well. ",
