I mean, if you love to read, then pick up a particularly long book, or one made for older ages, and you'll undoubtedly see words you don't know. You can look them up, or figure them out through context. Just reading IS good enough to learn new words. I have read the dictionary. I learned like, 2 words that I still remember. But from reading books that I love I've learned to spell many words, and learned the meaning of many others.True story, in 9th grade my English class was asked to spell the word doubt, on the whiteboard. Every person in the class tried and failed. The teacher went up and down the rows. Nobody could do it. Then I came in from the bathroom, they asked me, and I spelled it easily. I'd seen it so many times in books. Just reading is good enough for expanding your vocabulary. ",

            "answer_text": "Read lots of books that are meant for learners of the language in question. The way these books use restricted and repeated vocabulary in context is one of the more enjoyable and effective ways to learn new words and phrases. Make sure the book is already mostly comprehensible to you (like 95%). That way you can go along with the flow without having to look up words all the time, and the few new words should be more easily picked up and retained. Too many new words might result in your retaining little to nothing at all. Of course, different people have different capacities for learning new vocabulary. If you\u2019re very good at it, you could probably get away with books of which you understand less than 95% and still learn while enjoying the story. In any case, I recommend reading easier books extensively rather than slowly slogging your way through just one really difficult book. Research suggests this is more effective. Huffman, Jeffrey.

When you come across a word you don't know or of which you are unsure, try not to disrupt your reading (especially if it is fiction or something that you are reading for pleasure) and read on, but at the end of the chapter, or period of reading, go back to the words you were of which you were unsure and look them up in a dictionary. If you just look them up, whilst they will make sense to you at the time, they will inevitably fade from your memory. Instead- as you look up each word, write it down in a sentence or say it out loud in a sentence or two- you will be surprised at how quickly you expand your vocabulary (understanding) and vocabulary (useage). Endeavour to read everything and anything you can- persevere! Many, many books that have become personal favourites were books that I initially had trouble getting into. Good luck! ",

There are crosswords, word searches, codewords and varioius other word puzzles to suit all abilities from those designed for children to very challenging cryptic crosswords. That way you can have a bit of fun, learn some new words or get practise with ones you already know, and set yourself a time goal to complete it in order to measure your improvement. ",
