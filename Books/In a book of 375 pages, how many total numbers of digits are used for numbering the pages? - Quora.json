(Numbers that are less than 100) In total there are 99 of these so subtract 99. (375*3)-99 Now realize every less-than-2-digit number is included. (Numbers less than 10) In total there are 9 of these so subtract 9 (375*3)-99\u20139 And there you go. If the number of pages was (random example) 4756 then the total digits would be (4756*4) -999\u201399\u20139 ",
