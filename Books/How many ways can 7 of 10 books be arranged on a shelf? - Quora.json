If so, then the number of ways to do that is: 10C7 \u00d7 7! i.e 10P7 = 604800 ways.You have 10 books and you pick 7 particular books and the initial selection of the 7 books aren't important as you know exactly which 7 you're going to place on the shelf. Then the possible arrangements are simply, 7! i.e 5040.",
