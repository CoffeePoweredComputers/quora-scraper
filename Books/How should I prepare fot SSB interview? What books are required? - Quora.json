            "answer_text": "Begin with self - introspection which forms the basis of your preparation towards knowing yourself better. Take time to understand yourself in terms of all your strengths and weaknesses. Evaluate your hobbies, interests, extra - curricular activities etc. Have a basic idea regarding all your interests and activities you are involved in. Have a fluent understanding of your relation with your parents, friends etc. All this will keep you prepared to answer the questions directed to you without having to spend much time thinking during the interview. Keep yourself updated with the current happenings in India as well as around the world. Develop a habit of reading the newspapers and make use of magazines like India Today, Outlook or The Week which will help you not only in your awareness of the current events but will also improve your fluency of language during the interview. As for books for the SSB, you can refer to any of the books available online. I used a book by Dr (CDR) N K Natarajan during my prep. These books will give you an overview of the tests and the whole procedure so as to give you an idea of what to expect when you go for your SSB. ",
