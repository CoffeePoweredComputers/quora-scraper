            "answer_text": "Yes, it can be! Anything that would block or restrict the airflow around a fridge is bad. A fridge moves heat from inside the fridge compartment into the space outside and immediately adjacent to it. Since heat rises, if your \u201cthings\u201d on top of a fridge block or restrict the flow of heat from escaping the fridge, it is harmful to both the machine and your electric bill. Your specific cabinetry will determine what you can get away with.Anything susceptible to heat. It is warmer above your fridge. Store anything susceptible to heat up there, and long-term it will age faster. As a general rule, no foodstuffs on top of a fridge - ever. That includes spices. Glass and metal \u201cstuff\u201d is best to store above a fridge. Which brings us to:Wine. For the love of God, do NOT store wine or place wine racks above a fridge, or any other appliance for that matter! I can\u2019t tell you how many home remodeling shows I have seen with wine racks over or alongside a stove/oven/fridge/dishwasher and once even a fireplace! Just, no! Wine + heat = bad.",

            "answer_text": "NO - generally - unless its heavy and fragile and there is an earthquake and or you have sensitive floors or sensitive parts of your body or another bizarre situation which may destabilize ....... the refrigerator that is. You should be aware that refrigeration involves removing 'heat' from within the refrigerator cabinet to the exterior - removing heat makes things such as air, fluids and solids less hot or what we call cold. Some - actually many or even most non frost free refrigerators 'vent' warm air upwards at the rear so its wise to be aware that if you store any items that may be effected by heat, particularly if stored below or upon a surmounting shelf or within a cupboard above - even an adjacent shelf or cupboard - those items may 'enjoy' a temperature rise - more so if closely fitted sans an air gap. Some refrigerators have the condenser, (which conducts heat from within the refrigerator to the surrounding air) built into the exterior side panels.  Most frost free refrigerators blow warm air forward at the bottom through a vented kick plate below the doors (or drawer of recent models) but if any rear panels are absent or not correctly fitted warm air may be emitted at the rear and upwards.
