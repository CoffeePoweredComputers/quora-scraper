            "answer_text": "Engineering have different streams. So many branches have engineering sections of educational curriculum. Mathematics is indispensable for all engineering. Bollean algebra (required for logic gate)is important for computer science , electronic engineering. Discrete math specially algebraic graph theory is required for networking analysis ,a part of computer science and engineering. Fluid mechanics is important for aircraft, automobile engineering, mechanical engineer, integral transform is required for electrical engineering. So all students should follow their curriculum of mathematics as their requirements of study. Then they have to understand theory properly and doing some problems to clear ideas. Always they should try to connect the application of mathematical curriculum,in their perticular engineering stream. ",
