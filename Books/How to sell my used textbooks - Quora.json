            "answer_text": "Selling your used textbooks can be easier than you think! I recommend selling textbooks close to the beginning of a semester. For example, in a couple of weeks, just before the Spring 2020 semester begins for most schools, you\u2019ll want to sell your textbooks. It\u2019s also really important to consider your selling options. BookScouter has a comparison tool to help you see over thirty textbook buyback options at once, including Amazon! We take care of the search, you just sell those college textbooks. If you prefer in-person selling, many college towns have book exchange shops where you can sell used textbooks. Be sure to call around to see who is offering the best rate. Post The Book. Share what you\u2019re selling the book on your student portal or on a student-to-student book exchange facebook page. You\u2019ll save your friends the hassle of buying elsewhere and minimize the chance of shipping costs. For more tips on how to sell your used textbooks, check out this article: BookScouter ",

Probably not any more. Craig\u2019s List? Departmental bulletin boards? Set up a table during registration? Or is that all online now? Good luck. ",
