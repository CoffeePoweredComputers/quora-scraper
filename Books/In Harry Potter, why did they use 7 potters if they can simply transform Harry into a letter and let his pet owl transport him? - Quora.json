            "answer_text": "Because they can\u2019t \u2018simply\u2019 do that and also the fact Harry would never in a million years go along with it. You can\u2019t transform people into inanimate objects, doing this to Harry would likely kill him because a letter is so drastically different from a living human. Also, if you were gushing over the supposed brilliance of this idea, who here would actually want to be turned into a letter? You\u2019d be rendered mute, deaf, blind and completely frozen, it all sounds extremely unpleasant and there\u2019s a HUGE chance it\u2019ll go horribly wrong. Harry would flat out refuse to allow himself to be rendered thus, even putting aside how horrifying the very idea is, he would hate being defenceless and unable to help his friends. And here\u2019s something else no one has considered. In fifth year, when Harry was communicating with Sirius, Hedwig got attacked and the letter read. Meaning there\u2019s a very good chance this plan would fail miserably as the Death Eaters would have no problem killing Hedwig and taking the letter. They would likely cast charms to see if anything was hidden and discover it\u2019s Harry. It would then be a very simple thing to hand him over to Voldemort to kill. It\u2019s an all round terrible idea. ",

            "answer_text": "Because you can\u2019t transform people into letters. There are some charms that allow you to transfigure certain living creatures into other objects - such as the charm that turns mice into teacups from one of Harry\u2019s early lessons - but these are very specific. Freeform transfiguration, while possible, doesn\u2019t generally work on more\u2026 complicated things. Sure, you can turn one solid object into another, but you can\u2019t generally transform living matter into other things this way. (If this sounds a bit hand-wavy, that\u2019s because it is. Rowling\u2019s rules of magic are somewhat erratic and often contradicted themselves later on. I imagine \u201cmice into teacups\u201d was the right note of whimsy early on as it\u2019s clearly magic but it\u2019s also completely ridiculous and useless.) One case to consider is in \u201cGoblet of Fire\u201d, in which Barty Crouch Jr is posing as Alastor Moody - for an entire school year! - and has the real Moody tied up in his own trunk. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to just transform him into something else? Barty does transfigure someone into a bone and bury him in the forest, but only after the man is already dead - so you could potentially turn Harry into a letter and post him if you didn\u2019t mind him being a corpse first, but that would rather defeat the point!
