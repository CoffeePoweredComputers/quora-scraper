            "answer_text": "Look for a fee-only advisor, not just a fee-based advisor. Someone whose firm who\u2019s does not have any sources of revenue other than what you pay your advisor directly.Make sure you aren\u2019t working with a broker who is disguised as an advisor. You likely don\u2019t want to work with someone who has a limited \u201cmenu\u201d of products that his firm is being paid to offer. Understanding how your advisor and especially his firm is paid is critical to understanding that his incentive is to be on your side at all times. Don\u2019t just work with a salesperson. There is nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with a broker in some situations, but if the firm is being paid by anyone besides you, then the advice they give you may be biased.Someone who owes a fiduciary duty to all of their clients at all times. ALL CLIENTS, AT ALL TIMES.A firm that doesn\u2019t just manage money, but helps you make decisions. In other words, work with a financial planner. Anyone can call themselves a planner, but the gold-standard in planning is the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation. I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s the gold-standard overall, but it is in planning.CFP holders tend to be investing generalists though. Make sure the firm has some Chartered Market Technicians (CMT) and/or Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA) on staff too. You likely won\u2019t talk to those guys, but it\u2019s important to have them. Also, beware the advisor with a ton of silly initials after his name. The ones I mentioned are all credible, and there are a few more than are certainly worth having. But there are also many designations that take a week or a few months to get and are very basic. All initials aren\u2019t created equal.A firm that offers a variety of strategies rather than just one strategy that is slightly tweaked for a few different classes of clients. The firm should be competent in advanced strategies such as those involving hedging and options. Run for the hills if they have no expertise or don\u2019t use those sorts of things for any of their clients.Great communicators. It\u2019s not all about numbers, it\u2019s about being with something who is a coach, not just an advisor. You may not think of it in the beginning, but how the communicate later in the process is going to be important. Most people neglect seeing their advisor because they hate being stuck in traffic and spending all that time. Advisors who offer video, written updates, blogs, and video-conferencing appeal more to today\u2019s investors.Has a great team, not just one person. A one man shop has many risks that a team doesn\u2019t have. A great team also has division of labor. The planners aren\u2019t trading, and the traders aren\u2019t taking customer serviceGenerational diversity in the team. You want to see grey hair in the team, but you also want to see younger talent. If you are 50 and your advisor is your age, you have to realize that he\u2019ll be getting ready to retire at the same time you are. Look at the younger talent and realize that that\u2019s the future of the firm. Also, certain things that are a huge deal now (like options) were barely a footnote even in the curriculum a few years ago. Still, certain things are polished with age. Generational diversity is key!Track record. If you require a lot of customization, then a track record may not be relevant to you. But your advisor should have a track record of trading on some less customized strategies, at least. The point is that people don\u2019t want to be working with a guy who can only show them a hypothetical record. In other words, a record that was generated with the benefit of hindsight instead of something that actually happened.",

            "answer_text": "Financial advice is everywhere, it can come from your friends, family, doctors, priests, a movie, a billboard, a TV show, literally anywhere. The first step to finding out if you have a trustworthy financial advisor is to recognize that financial advice is everywhere because once you realize this, you will be able to evaluate who\u2019s advice you should be taking. Once you recognize who\u2019s advice you should be taking the next step is to evaluate their actual competency. Competency can be of two types, positional competency, and actual competency. Positional Competency is the competency you assign to a person based on the position they hold. Actual competency is the competency you assign to someone based on the actual results they produce. Take a successful entrepreneur who runs a car dealership, for example, they might be a very successful car dealer but are not necessarily good at investments, because their field of expertise lies in cars. You can trust business advice coming from such a person, but not necessarily when it comes to finances and investments. When looking at a person\u2019s actual competency to give you financial advice you need to consider three things: Their own achievements in this field: When someone is giving you advice on anything, you need to see what they have achieved in this field themselves. If you are seeking marriage advice, you would usually first approach someone who is married. Therefore, if you are seeking investment advice, you should approach someone who makes investments for themselves and others. The results they have produced for others: When evaluating how competent someone is to provide you with financial advice it is always a good idea to check the results they have produced for others. This demonstrates that the advice not only worked for them but has also worked for their clients. How up-to-date are they: When seeking financial advice, it is important to get your advice from someone who is aware of the current scenario in the market, as the financial market is a dynamic entity it keeps going through changes. One of the most important things to determine is that if the financial advisor has any vested interests in providing you with financial advice. If they do have a vested interest you should see if they are competent enough to provide you with what you want. The ideal financial advisor will have no vested interest in your financial well-being, other than the fact that they want one more satisfied client.
