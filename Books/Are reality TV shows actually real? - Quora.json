            "answer_text": "I am so glad I found this question. The short answer is that a vast majority of reality television shows are not 100 percent real, as there is a high degree of manipulation in order to achieve sustained audience attention. But this is too simplistic of an answer and, to be fair, every show has to be analyzed to understand the motivations behind those manipulations. In my opinion, misleading the audience should not be allowed and some kind of regulation should be in place, but I know for a fact that networks are not willing to self-regulate and be honest with their audience, much less allow governmental oversee. Only when you, as a creator, have enough creative rights, then I believe you should disclose the level of manipulation that the show has or not. Reality television was a happy accident in my career, I never liked it but my prior experience in news-gathering primed me for this genre. One day we pitched an innovative idea to a network and two weeks later we were drafting agreements. That has been the fastest I had sold I show, and that was a problem, because I had no idea how to approach it \u2014 but that's what makes my job so fun. I tried to do the real thing, but pretty soon we discovered a lot of legal and safety hurdles. Just alone, looking for insurance proved futile: only one broker was willing to bond coverage, imposing a $1M premium and conditioning us to have an attorney on site for each and every scenario. The network was looking for the authenticity but was not happy with the costs or risks of pursuing the real thing, as such, they were not convinced so they asked us to produce a pilot before committing to a whole season. At that point, I came up with a plan: recreations loosly based on real experiences from the team we had in place; these guys were real professionals in their field with no acting experience, so we created scenarios with actors in (somewhat) controlled locations where they would perform their everyday tasks without any rehearsals or knowledge of what was going to happen. Not only did the network thought it was real, but their legal department fell for it as well. Everybody was happy at that point and they were ready to move forward but then I demanded one condition: to have a disclaimer at the beginning of each episode. We had a big argument, but I stood firm and, after explaining the legal and ethical reasons for having one, we agreed on the language of it and began producing it. The show ran for more than 7 years, crossed over from Spanish to English (at that point I had to fight for the disclaimer \u2026 again), and we delivered more than 600 episodes. The irony of it: to this day people keep calling the show fake \u2026 and every time I get confronted with this, I ask a simple question: \u201chave you read the disclaimer at the top of the show?\u201d \u2014 their faces tell me everything, and usually they stop ranting. So, even after self-regulating by disclosing that the show was a recreation loosely based on real experiences, people still want to believe whatever they want to believe. That's why I'm so happy I'm not producing reality television any longer \u2026 I rather create something for audiences that are more discerning or at least willing to turn on their brains more often.

            "answer_text": "Kinda sorta. I\u2019ve transcribed countless hours of rough footage for reality television. So, what happens \u2014 camera crews do a ton of shooting. The director/producer person does some guiding of conversation around things, to get the people to tell the story they want to tell. Then, all that footage goes to the scribes \u2014 where I see/hear it. And I make transcripts for editing. Editors then take those transcripts, that are often time-stamped, and cut them up to write their script, then edit the video down, add their graphics, tweak their audios \u2014 wallah! An episode is born. So, 40 hours of footage may turn into two hours of show. I don\u2019t watch television and have only caught a few glimpses of the final product here and there, but what I saw on my end was way different than what I saw on the screen. But for the most part, the \u2018actors\u2019 write the script by speaking it, then their words are transcribed, and then the script is heavily edited. . I don\u2019t know if anybody remembers the show \u2018Bamazon\u2019 where a bunch of Alabama guys go to the Amazon to try to mine gold. I did quite a bit of transcribing on that one and thought it was going to be an interesting show. That was the only one I made an attempt to watch. Because I only get portions and don\u2019t get to see everything that I hear about. But dang, it sounded like something worth watching. It wasn\u2019t. The editing totally ruined it. And I\u2019ve transcribed for a few prison shows. Five hours of interviews gets whittled down to three minutes \u2014 or never shown at all.  For reality TV, the script is written in reverse. The scenes vary from the very real-life moments to exceptionally orchestrated setups. Most successful reality TV shows have a good blend of the two. Often, before the final editing, the \u2018actor\u2019 receives a list of lines the editors want them to say again because of an audio issue, or for the sake of story. There\u2019s usually a final line reading that is totally scripted, but it\u2019s the \u2018actor\u2019 repeating their own words that they said previously. ",

            "answer_text": "The authenticity of reality television is often called into question by its detractors. The genre's title of \"reality\" is often criticized as being inaccurate because of claims that the genre frequently includes\u2014premeditated scripting; acting; urgings from behind-the-scenes crew to create specified situations of adversity and drama; misleading editing; etc. For these reasons and more, there has been controversy over the extent to which reality television truly reflects reality. In many cases the entire premise of the show is a contrived one, based around a competition or another unusual situation. However, various shows have additionally been accused of using fakery in order to create more compelling television, such as having premeditated storylines and in some cases feeding participants lines of dialogue, focusing only on participants' most outlandish behavior, and altering events through editing and re-shoots. The 2004 VH1 program Reality TV Secrets Revealed detailed various misleading tricks of reality TV producers. According to the show, various reality shows (notably Joe Millionaire ) combined audio and video from different times, or from different sets of footage, to create an artificial illusion of time chronology that did not occur, and a misportrayal of participant behaviors and actions. An episode of the NBC drama Harry's Law used the industry jargon \"Franken-bites\" and gave an example of the audio-splicing trick, which is used to force dialogue that is needed for the drama/story/script, but not actually said by the cast members. In docusoap programming, which follows people in their daily life, producers may be highly deliberate in their editing strategies, able to portray certain participants as heroes or villains, and may guide the drama through altered chronology and selective presentation of events. A Season 3 episode of Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe included a segment on the ways in which selective editing can be used to this end. [6] Unreal environments In competition-based programs such as Big Brother and Survivor, and other special living environment shows like The Real World , the producers design the format of the show and control the day-to-day activities and the environment, creating a completely fabricated world in which the competition plays out. Producers specifically select the participants and use carefully designed scenarios, challenges, events, and settings to encourage particular behaviors and conflicts. Mark Burnett , creator of and other reality shows, has agreed with this assessment, and avoids the word \"reality\" to describe his shows; he has said, \"I tell good stories. It really is not reality TV. It really is unscripted drama.\"Survivor Wardrobe handling Some shows, such as Survivor, do not allow the participants to wear clothing of their own choosing while on camera, to promote the participants' wearing of \"camera-friendly colors\" and to prevent the participants from wearing the same style and/or color of clothing. Additionally, some prohibited clothing with corporate logos. Scripting and staging Reality television shows have faced speculation that the participants themselves are involved in fakery, acting out storylines that have been planned in advance by producers. ThThells is one notable example; the show faced allegations that its plots are scripted ahead of time. During the second season of Hell's Kitchen , it was speculated that the customers eating meals prepared by the contestants were in fact paid actors. Various alumni of the MTV reality series The Real World have related incidents in which the producers staged or attempted to stage incidents for the cameras. During a reunion show featuring the first four Real World casts, Heather Gardner , of the original New York cast, questioned members of the San Francisco cast if their situations were real, noting that situations from the original season seemed to repeat themselves in subsequent ones. On an edition of the E! True Hollywood Story that spotlighted the series, cast member Jon Brennan revealed that he was asked by the producers to state on the air that he felt hatred towards housemate Tami Roman for her decision to have an abortion, and that he refused to do so, stating that although he disagreed with her decision, he did not feel hatred towards her. Lars Schlichting of The Real World: London related an instance in which roommate Mike Johnson asked a question when cameras were not present, and then asked the same question five minutes later when cameras were present, which Schlichting added was not typical of Johnson. Producers have also been accused of selectively editing material in order to give the false impression of certain emotional reactions or statements from the castmates. New York cast member Rebecca Blasband says producers paid a man $100 to ask her out on a date, and that she terminated that plan when she learned of it. She also says that a heated argument she and Kevin Powell had in the seventh episode of that season was edited to make both of them appear more extreme Wikipedia.org ",

It's more about objective, performance based skill - did you hit the target or not, were you faster than someone else, etc. The New York Times had an interesting article on this topic: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/arts/television/top-shot-on-history-channel-straightforward-reality.html Having gone to UCLA and being around TV stuff, I was very much expecting producers to try and feed me lines, stir the pot and cause drama, and do other things to make interesting things happen for TV's sake. I was pleasantly surprised that the producers were pretty much flies on the wall and let things happen organically. Before going onto Top Shot, I do remember saying to myself that I will not say or do anything that I do not agree with, and I'll suffer the consequences if any were to arise. Another interesting thing to note is that with so many competitors, they have to whittle down our personalities to a simple one dimension. I was the \"self-taught IT geek,\" which was the persona I carved out for myself. All the things we said and did on air were in proper context, but of course, they selectively left out a ton of footage so they could craft an interesting narrative (but based on the footage we gave them, not based on a narrative the producers wanted). Of course, with only 40 minutes of airtime in each of 12 episodes, there's only so much that can be shown.  Finally, it was funny for me to have a camera following me around during my morning routine, shaving, brushing my teeth, eating cereal, drinking coffee, etc. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the thought of how boring this could be if they ever showed an extended clip of me eating my cereal. They shot so much of that footage where only a few seconds of it was ever used. All in all, I had a fantastic experience being in a reality TV competition, and would jump at the opportunity to do it again. ",

            "answer_text": "Some of you probably do not know this, but I was born and raised on the Jersey Shore. Yes, THAT Jersey Shore. The one depicted on the MTV show.  I grew up just a stones throw away from Seaside Heights, which is where most of the show took place. Personally, I have never watched it except for a few clips here and there, though I do have a few friends who have made appearances. One of them was my friend Jackie, who had gotten involved in a pretty heavy argument with one of the cast members. However it wasn\u2019t real. What really happened was that she got into a minor disagreement with one of the cast members that was filmed on two separate occasions. The first one was very mild, and ended cordially. The second one, which took place about an hour later, featured a bigger film crew, was more dramatic, and involved yelling and screaming. According to her, both interactions were featured on the show, presented as a single incident, and blown out of proportion to make it seem more dramatic than it really was. So to answer your question, reality shows aren\u2019t really scripted in the traditional sense, however, they do rely on improvisation and creative editing to draw interest in viewers. Whether they truly reflect reality, is debatable. ",

This is, after all, the genre that spawned the Kardashians and the Real Housewives, either of which should be enough to shut down any new show pitch that doesn't involve a script. Yet somehow, producers occasionally stumble upon genuine, interesting people and convince them to get in front of a camera. Watching a group of rich ladies scream at each other about mean tweets seems like a complete waste of time when you can be following real homicide detectives the moment they catch a case, or a guy who's getting plastic surgery to look a human Ken Doll. This is a list of exactly those type of shows that will have you wondering why you ever learned who Kylie Jenner was in the first place. 1- Deadliest Catch Capturing the harsh environment of commercial king crab fisherman in Alaska, Deadliest Catch has become one of Discovery Channel's most successful shows. Even if all of the dialogue was scripted and the interpersonal drama was manufactured by meddling producers or editors, these guys are still on boats in freezing temperature, all so gluttons can eat their fill at Red Lobster. Oh yeah, and sometimes they die. Did we mention that? In the first season, a ship sank and five people perished. It doesn't get much more real than that. 2- Below Deck Another show about life on boats\u2014albeit on the complete opposite end of the spectrum from Deadliest Catch\u2014is Below Deck, a show about a luxury yacht crew hosting charters for wealthy jerks. There are plenty of goofy, obviously-staged situations, but the workplace tension seems genuine. The crew members work long hours, then have to share cramped co-ed living quarters, while grinning and bearing it to appease their charter clients, who in the show's best moments, are unapologetic, pretentious clowns. Fortunately, most of them get really hammered on real alcohol and slur their way into looking like complete morons on television, which is the singular joy and only redeeming quality of the entire show. 3- Survivorman Forget Bear Grylls, whose name alone makes you stop and say \"No, there's not a chance that's a real person.\" If you're looking for a survivalist show, look no further than Les Stroud's amazing Survivorman. This guy is like a real life MacGyver minus the mullet. Getting dropped off in the middle of Earth's most remote locations with nothing but his camera gear (he shoots the entire show by himself), a sort of utility knife, a satellite phone (for emergency calls to a remote crew who are always close enough for a rescue), and the bare minimum of supplies, Stroud must find a way to survive for days at a time. There are no celebrity cameos, no airlifts to luxury hotels at night, and no drinking his own pee. Give it up, Grylls. You've got Kate Hudson with you. How hard is this possibly going to get? 4- Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown Former chef Anthony Bourdain travels the world in this latest incarnation of basically the same show he's been doing since No Reservations. True, the concept is similar to most other travel shows: guy goes to place. Guy observes local traditions. Guy eats local food. But where Bourdain's show differs is in the intentional avoidance of tourist traps and clich\u00e9 experiences. He uses fixers, friends, and local craftsmen to navigate him to past the guidebook stops and into homes and businesses that represent \"the soul of the city\"\u2014a phrase at which Bourdain would most definitely scoff. To that point, Bourdain is constantly self-deprecating, almost eager to expose the artifice of television at all costs, which makes for an interesting, if not contradictory attempt at documenting a genuine experience. 5- Hoarders People who compulsively collect junk to the point of filling every room of their house floor-to-ceiling are the subject of Hoarders. We've seen an episode where they moved a couch and discovered the skeleton of a dead cat, and another where the homeowners didn't have any working toilets, so they just relieved themselves into plastic bags and flung them into the kitchen. If any of that seems fake to you, ask yourself this question: how much would a television producer have to pay you to let them do either of those things to your house? ",

None of us is comfortable with revealing all our cards. We all have something to hide, and we fabricate numerous methods to secure that safe spot of privacy. But this show vanquishes every restriction imposed on human behaviour. Premise Under the examination of a polygraph, a contestant is asked around 50 questions related to one\u2019s personal life. This happens before the recording of each episode. Every answer is documented. The list is then whittled down to 21 questions which will be featured on the broadcast. In the presence of a live audience, the show\u2019s host fires those questions one at a time. They increase in difficulty and become progressively more personal and embarrassing. Every round of questions proffers a cash prize.  If the contestant answers by the polygraph results, he/she moves on to the next question else, they leave with nothing. Read more here. The \u201cReality\u201d Part Out of the 23 episodes that aired on TV, the 5th episode of season 1 turned out to be the most controversial of them all.  It featured a young blonde who admitted to having committed adultery. She believed she was meant to be with her ex-boyfriend instead of with her husband. Throughout the 43 minute episode, she\u2019s targetted with outrageously ridiculous questions concerning her personal and sex life. All of this happens in the presence of her entire family. As a viewer, I must admit that the creators(and actors) of the show did a very good job in convincing the audience about its legitimacy. I mean, look at the guy in black. His baby face, accentuated by those nerdy glasses just makes him the ideal, gullible husband who never happened to notice his wife\u2019s constant indulgence in infidelity. And to take it up a notch, they bring in Mr. Nice Guy(maroon shirt) to win his long lost girlfriend back. Amid all this drama, you have the girl\u2019s family playing the right amount of emotions to add more credibility to the show\u2019s \u201crealistic\u201d nature.  The show was carefully devised to grab the attention of as many people as possible. They were able to tap into an addictive formula which made the audience keep coming back for more. Concurrently, the channel\u2019s(Fox TV) TRP grew at a substantial rate. It was a win-win situation for the channel and the show\u2019s crew. And guess who\u2019s the loser who went home empty-handed? You and I! ",

In it's loosest sense, we'll create a false construct to drive the story - such as Biker Build Off - 30 days to build a motorcycle and get it to an event where people vote on which bike they like best.  Though for the \"lifestyle\" beats, and the back and forth between the bike builders, is all produced.  In it's strictest sense, I've worked on reality shows with literal, actual scripts being written for the on-camera participants. ",

Their words, responses, reactions, all go in accordance with the director's instructions. The locations are as carefully set up as any stage set, the scenes are planned and directed down to the tiniest detail. Scenes are filmed, reviewed, refilmed, cut and spliced and shaped to fit the precise product according to the show-runners' minutely specific plans. Not the tiniest part is ever left to chance. None of this means you can't or shouldn't enjoy them if you so choose. Just don't fool yourself: they are not real. ",

And my first thought was this can\u2019t be real. The producer need thirteen episodes for a season and they can\u2019t let the vagaries of human beings risk them having half an episode before somebody blows a fuse. So they obviously had to stage the show. People from other shows have come forward to say that what happened was indeed staged. ",

Do I think I\u2019d act normally if an entire camera crew showed up to film your job? No. But I do think I wouldn't start trying to make my life look as bleak as possible without some producers giving me a nudge in that direction. Also, America\u2019s Got Talent almost certainly used video editing to make a magic trick look better. There was a real magician performing a real, fantastic trick, but for whatever reason, they decided a couple pixels needed to be different, and \u201cfixed\u201d it. The result is pretty easy to see in extremely slow motion. That's just not how objects look in the real world. Reality shows can be fake. Many are extremely fake. A couple, like Impractical Jokers (my personal favorite), I think are real. I have no proof, but I like to believe. ",

Also, the part where a stage is kicked off and you see all the contestants running is quite fake. Contests run for a couple of hundred feet and then the cameras stop rolling and they contestants chill out till the producer/director instructs them to do otherwise. The finale seem staged too (I'm not fully sure (I don't understand french) ) - from what I saw of it during filming, clips of each contestant 'winning' were shot. ",

In fact a few years ago reality producers fought to be accepted into the Writers Guild union (WGA) because they felt they were writing so much of what was happening. ",

More often they will tell us what they want to do and we just schedule a time to be there. Like someone will say \u201cI want to do a party to kickoff the new business I started\u201d so we will help them schedule it while they are there. And someone else will say \u201cI want to confront her about how she handled this.\u201d So we allow them to do it. Or even innocent things like \u201cI need to take all 12 of my kids to buy shoes\u201d and we ask them to wait until we are there to film. On occasion, they may like a line so much that they\u2019ll ask someone to repeat it for the camera, but it\u2019s pretty rare producers will flat out make something up. If you cast well enough, you don\u2019t really need to. What\u2019s more often is that producers will use interview part of the session to shape what happened and tell the story. They can sometimes guide people to comment based on what\u2019s been recorded but that happens after the shoot. ",

And another factor is, they just can\u2019t roll as a live show, as they have to make a lucrative show so that audience would take keen interest.

Drama Based Indian Reality Shows:  Is shouldn\u2019t come up a surprise as shows like Bigg Boss, Swayamwar Rakhi ka, and even show like Satyameve Jayate is somehow scripted.
