            "answer_text": "I suppose you could count the chapters in each book and then rank them, only to find out there are multiple books with only one chapter, so that wouldn't work. The next step would be counting verses, until you realised some translations of the Bible don't show a few verses that other versions include. The same difficulty would appear if you started counting words, letters, pages... There are multiple languages/translations/versions to work upon. Not to mention differences regarding each books are considered as part of the canon. You have a problem, my friend. Not a computational problem (all the counting would take a few hours, I suspect). Honestly, what is the purpose of your question? Your answer must be in the question. If you are solely interested in finding out that Psalms is longer than Romans, you really don't need a system...
