            "answer_text": "No you can't share a kindle ebook through mail as it's only for personal use and sharing is illegal. But forget about those things and do what you want but it's not easy to share kindle ebooks as you will not find the file of the book as an pdf or epub. Kindle use specific file extension for it's android and Windows (from 8.0) app, so it's very hard to find those files for sharing but if you're using Windows 7 you can find all the books and of course can share it as an attachment. If you're going to share some books don't forget me. ;-) ",
