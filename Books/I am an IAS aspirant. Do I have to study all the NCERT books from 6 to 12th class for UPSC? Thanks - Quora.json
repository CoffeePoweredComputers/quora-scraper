NCERT contains the basic knowledge which is must to gain in UPSC. NCERT books of class 6to 10 can give you a huge content. This content is most trusted. I have heared from many IAS officers about the advantages of reading NCERT books. When you finish NCERT, you can also read other books. In addition to books, magazines and newspapers will also help you. You must know about current events. That's how you can prepare for your IAS examination. I hope it will help you. Best of luck\u2026. ",
