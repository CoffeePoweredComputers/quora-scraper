            "answer_text": "Look mate, I am gonna be honest with you. You don't need to influence people to become friends. There's no magic in it. Friendship is the purest form of any relationship. It is all about trust, loyalty and most importantly honesty. True friendship doesn't mean u gotta pretend to be someone else just for the sake of impressing someone. So, if u r trying to be someone else, to make new friends, that is not friendship that is forgery or impersonation.If they r not liking you back, fine, forget about them, move on, they don't deserve to be your friends. Find people who like you for who you are in reality. Not gonna give u lots of lectures about friendship. Just gonna give u one free advice, just be yourself and trust me it's gonna work. Trust me, it's better to have a few friends who actually care than to have a long list of \"so called\" friends who just wanna be friends because of their own selfish interests. That kind of friendship is not a friendship at all. It's an insult to it. ",

There are of course many tips that can help us interact better, but nothing will ever replace diplomacy and understanding.
