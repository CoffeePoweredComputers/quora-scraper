            "answer_text": "Hello, my husband was previously homeless and now we're millionaires! I believe it was within 10 years to figure it all out and do it \u201cfrom rags to riches\u201d. But now we know the shortcuts. First off you want to create a great list of skills and experience you have and get it onto a resume (get a template online, at a library). Go to goodwill and get your best outfits together. Join a cheap gym for showers and get all cleaned up. Print out a bunch if resumes at the library and just go up & down the main drag in all the shops & restaurants and (most important part) ask a Supervisor what they need help with. Busser, barback, dishwasher, host are all great entry level jobs to get your foot in the door until you can sweet talk your way up. That's how to get provision (even while being homeless). From there look for a room for rent on Craigslist (be picky about who you live with) and don't tell them you're currently homeless (that scares people off). If possible have positive documents you can show them like bank statements showing money flowing in, acceptance letter at your new job, credit report if its decent, reference letter from a past roommate, paystubs, etc. Now all's you really need is a $20 air mattress from Wal-Mart and some sheets and a lamp from Salvation Army. Now here's the millionaire part. Study everything you can about Wholesaling Real Estate. Join the Facebook group \u201cWholesaling Houses Full Time\u201d on Facebook and just learn everything you can. Google the words \u201cREIA\u201d and your county, and show up for meetings there, they teach you how to be a Real Estate Investor. Observe everything you can and connect with everyone you meet on Facebook. Go to every club you can find out about. Connect with other \u201cWholesalers\u201d and \u201cRehabbers\u201d and keep all their contact info. Ask the wholesalers if they have any properties available and what they'd pay you to bring a buyer. Once you have a commitment, forward all the information to the Rehabbers and be the middle man that connects them. Collect money. Do a few deals and keep talking to everyone you can in the industry. Then become a Rehabber yourself and you'll become a millionaire within a couple years. #BOOM! I travel around speaking at events and conferences teaching people how to do this. ",

            "answer_text": "The year was 1995. I\u2019d been at my first job out of college for two years when it spiraled down into bankruptcy. I made some poor decisions regarding my housing along the way, and found myself homeless at 25, living out of the back of a beat-up old Chevy LUV that had faded to a streaked, pale orange colour. I was fortunate, though, to have made some friends at that first company, and when talking to one of them about my situation, he offered to let me stay in his garage until I could get back on my feet again. Having a quiet corner to sleep in, and a shower I could borrow to make myself presentable made all the difference in the world. It\u2019s so much easier to get a job and hold onto it when you\u2019re clean-shaven and don\u2019t smell. Thanks to the generosity of my friend, I was able to get back onto my feet again, and a few months later, moved out of his garage into a small 1 bedroom apartment of my own. It wasn\u2019t fast, by any stretch of the imagination, but now, decades later, I\u2019m a multimillionaire. I live frugally, in a house with with a single desk I bought 20 years ago at Target for $39, a few bookcases, and an entertainment center I built from a few pieces of lumber bought at the lumber yard. No couch, no bed, no coffee tables; just the bare necessities I need. I never forget what it was like to be homeless. Every day, I\u2019m thankful for where I am, for having a roof over my head, for being able to know where I\u2019m sleeping that night. Having been there, though, I know I can survive it. It\u2019s not the end of everything. And that gives me strength. I don\u2019t worry about losing my job. I don\u2019t worry about losing my house. I\u2019ve been there, and come out the other side. So, at work, I don\u2019t play it safe. I don\u2019t keep my head tucked down, afraid of what might happen. I speak up. I call out things that are wrong and need to righted. I see things that are broken, and push for them to be fixed. And that lack of fear made me visible. I stand out from the crowd. I get noticed. When a new CEO comes on board the company, I let them know what works, and what doesn\u2019t work. When they do well, I congratulate them, highlighting where they did well in engaging with the employees; when they miss the mark, I help them understand what might have worked better, and how they might undo some of the damage at the next meeting with the employees. Is it my job? No, I\u2019m a network engineer. Nothing about my job title suggests I should be speaking up like that. I work at the bottom rung of the corporate ladder; nobody reports to me, I have no authority over anyone. But having been through the wringer, and come out the other side, having survived being fired, losing my job, being homeless\u2014those things no longer hold any power over me. I\u2019m not afraid of them any longer. I\u2019m not afraid of the executives getting annoyed and firing me for speaking up. As the saying goes, \u201cbeen there, done that.\u201d And paradoxically, that makes me more valuable than if I simply blended in, kept my head down, and went to work every day afraid of losing my job. Every time I try to retire, it becomes a negotiating discussion around what it will take to keep me happy and working. I\u2019ve made more in the past 2 years working than I did in the first 20 years working, combined. Was it the fast way to becoming a millionaire? Absolutely not. But I started this part of the journey homeless, and ended up a millionaire. I never forget the path I\u2019ve taken to get here, and I draw strength from it every day. So, while it may not be an answer to the *fastest* way to go from being homeless to being a millionaire, it is at least an answer to *one* way in which it has been done. Best of luck, and never be afraid to talk to your friends about your situation. You may find more support than you ever dared to hope for. Stay strong! ",
