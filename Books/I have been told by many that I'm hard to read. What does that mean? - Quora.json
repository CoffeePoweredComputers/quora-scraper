            "answer_text": "Cheng Ying, You personally requested my interpretation, so I will express my views somewhat boldly, rendering several \u2018assumptions\u2019. You remain \u2018hard to read\u2019 as you tend not to express your emotional state \u2013 for several reasons, or rather \u2018causes\u2019. Your heritage. 1. You are \u2018Asian\u2019, possibly first generation in the \u2018west\u2019? As such, you are \u2018reserved\u2019 - uncertain of just \u2018how\u2019 you will be perceived due to western \u2018socio/cultural\u2019 bias. You desire not to \u2018offend\u2019, you really have no idea just what would be deemed \u2018offensive\u2019. 2. Your \u2018parent culture\u2019 is, by western standards, very old and established. Your conditioned temperament is quietly reserved, muted; You appear as withdrawn, uncommunicative. Contrarily, westerners are, by disposition, actively expressive, and emotionally communicative, fluctuating frequently. What with all the social turbulence in the west, the citizenry is especially insecure, agitated, even unto volatile \u2013 And they expect others to \u2018be just like themselves\u2019. 3. Do to the above causes, you do not easily engage in \u2018small talk\u2019 - For you remain uncertain just \u2018how\u2019 you should engage in this western propensity to express themselves emotionally. Do not despair unnecessarily. I am a Stoic Scandinavian, also unwilling to engage in emotional rhetoric. I am frequently viewed much the same as I ascribed unto you. I remain largely unconcerned. If you consider my interpretation is invalid or incorrect, kindly contact me via Quora, and I would appreciate all insights you may present. As the imperturbable Vulcan \u2018Mr. Spock\u2019 of \u201cStar Trek\u201d would exclaim: \u201cLive long and prosper\u201d. Just a Thought . . . To Ponder The Potentials of: \u2018Well Being\u2019. \ud83e\udd20 ",

            "answer_text": "generally speaking, you are hard to read because of your behaviour(maybe) haha\u2026i know its not funny to laugh.. after all this is not a joke. let me put it this way, when people lack social activity,they only spend time by themselves it means you don't allow people to know you. you don't express yourself clearly as you wanted to, I call those people Lackadaisical. I don't wanna be rude,but I can say,generally people like you observe everyone's behaviour very seriously and internalise that this will help me to know people well. other than that\u2026I don't know your (mental) status .. so it makes hard to comment any further on this but I'll do it anyway. \u2026. you pretend to be a good person, friend, or whatever you like to possess but you stop yourself to being close to them because of you being clandestine. So this make you dissent and hard to read. Well to me body language doesn't make you hard to read\u2026it's your emotions that comes out when you feel lonely but don't wanna talk about it to someone because you think you can control and procrastinate when you really need to speak. if this is the not the case with you.. then forget what I said just inculcate confidence in you and stop confusing people .
