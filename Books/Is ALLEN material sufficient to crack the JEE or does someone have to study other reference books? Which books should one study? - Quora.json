            "answer_text": "You need to understand that nothing is sufficient to crack the JEE, its about covering as much concepts as you can and learning their applicaton. Do what you can. Start with Allen Study Material, if after completing it, you are left with time before you move on to further topics, then try some books. Take any practise book and solve it complete(topic-wise). Another word of advise, once you start a chapter, do it complete, dont be like solving half of the allen study material and then half of the book. OK, sorry I got off topic. Coming to quality of the study material, yes, I would say they are good. They start from basics and try to cover everything important for JEE. Other Books: Everyone would suggest you the famous books like Irodov, J.D. Lee etc. They are no doubt very good and helpful. But seeing the trend, some practice books are more helpful because they not only include the best problems of these old and renowned books but also get amended according to JEE trends. Try the \u201cMaster Practice Books in JEE Main and Advanced by Arihant\u201d in all the subjects. I used them along with the FIITJEE study material. ",

            "answer_text": "those ALLEN Modules are surprisingly very good.They have been made from many great references books like HC Verma,DC Pandey,O.P Tondon and many others and also consistes of the most important questions asked in preveious years of JEE Mains and Advanced also in AIEEE. You can read other reference books if you want to go for much higher level but first and foremost those Mosules should be completed throughly and that will Insanely help You. I have a few reference books but i first finish a given topic from the module completely and them only i start that topic in ither refernce books. ",
