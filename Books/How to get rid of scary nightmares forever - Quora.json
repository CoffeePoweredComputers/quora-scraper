            "answer_text": "Usually, it was believed that hanging a dream catcher near your bedside, would draw in your bad dreams and you'd be left with good ones. Nightmares are only a figment of your imagination, therefore, they aren't at all real. When I was very young, nightmares were normal for me and it was something that I couldn't accept. I had nightmares about every possible thing you could imagine. I had gone to my parents room everytime I had one, and my parents were kind of annoyed. My mom would then every night, teach me a prayer that would protect me during my slumber. I even bought myself a night light and a dream catcher to ward off the evil lurking. It worked for the most part, and honestly to this day I still have a few, but it will eventually cease. What I'm saying is that nightmares are only true because you believe them to be true. If you start believing on the positive aspects of life then your dreams will have a positive outcome. Not to have a nightmare forever, honestly, it might not be possible to get rid of, but overtime it will lessen\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I can not tell you how you can get rid of scary nightmares. I can tell you how I no longer have mine. Dreaming is as I understand, processing of memories and emotions, experiences and what we have learned, what we think about and a lot of what we don\u2019t like, what we are afraid of and what our personal internal consciousness is doing battle with. The last, consciousness is in my subjective experience, processing on an evolution level to find mind/body/emotional/spiritual balance and eventually peace between disciplined and undisciplined nature. You are growing up. You are a creative human being. How I learned forever to not have nightmares is to avoid the TV, the news, the personal conflicts, what makes me worry, and ease my mind. The nightmares have gone away, but life is not now perfect bliss. Life can not be perfect bliss. Acceptance of such in due time will prove true personal growth. ",
