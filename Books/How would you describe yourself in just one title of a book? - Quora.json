Everything happens for a reason and everybody you ever meet is somehow connected to you directly or indirectly. I meet a lot of people everyday, some i just see, some i just observe, some i\u2019m a customer of while some are my colleagues, who I feel are connected to me in a way or other. While i don\u2019t go up and talk with each and everyone of them, ever since, i\u2019ve read the book, its just stuck in my head that everything is connected. Might sound crazy. Yes. But its a small world after all. A lil\u2019 coincidence: I used to travel a route here everyday and i used to see a nice looking building while on this route. Me and my colleagues always used to wonder what was this nice structure in the middle of nowhere. 2\u20133 years down the road, that building is where i work. Strange! ",

P.S. - For those who have not heard the name of the book, it's a famous one by Alan Sillitoe published in 1959. A movie of the same name was also made based on the book. ",
