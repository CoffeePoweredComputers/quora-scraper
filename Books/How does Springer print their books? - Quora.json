            "answer_text": "With the cost of book publishing at an all time low, it's possible that, instead of carrying inventory of several hundred different books, companies like this are printing the books 'on demand'. Sort of like \"we don't make it 'till you order it!\" I worked for a company that printed self-published artists this way. You can right now get a 500 page 6\"x9\" book printed, bound (full color soft cover) and shipped for around $12.50.  Our cost was about 1/2 of that. In order to do this, the process is of course digital so there will be some artifacts in the digitally printed product that wouldn't be there in conventional offset printing.  ",

            "answer_text": "Without the opportunity to inspect the actual book, my answer is purely guesswork. Springer Verlag is no different from many publishers around the world -- they contract printers like me to print their books and other products according to the specifications they require. The printing process and techniques varies a bit but safe to say offset lithography is the way 95% of the time. I'm guessing here, but the red and blue grains may be part of the paper itself rather than the printing process. If true, then Springer may indeed have specified a particular kind of paper. If the red and blue grains seem to be printed, then perhaps Springer have specified for that effect. It's impossible to say one way or another. What I can say is that printworks for a major publisher like Springer would not likely be defective in quality. So for practical reasons, you have to assume the red and blue grains are part of the printing or paper specifications unless something tells you otherwise. Hope that gets the general idea across. Thanks for the A2A. ",
