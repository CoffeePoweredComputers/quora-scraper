            "answer_text": "With all due respect, this question is the completely wrong question to ask Because \u2018the average self publishing author\u2019 does not really exist There are different groups of authors that achieve different levels of success. There is no such thing as - If you go into self publishing you will make $X on average You will make money according to how good your Product Market Fit is, how good your book is, and how good your marketing is Let\u2019s look at the Tiers of Authors  First, is the authors who made nothing or a net loss The self published author who neither put effort into the book, nor into the marketing. These authors make nothingThe self published author who wrote a good book and polished it well, and then did nothing. Hoping lightning would strike. These authors also make nothingThe self published authors who wrote something useless or terrible, and then put a lot of effort into marketing, not realizing the book is not good enough to sell, and made a small amount. These are the authors who have spent $5,000 to get $1,000 in sales. So they did not make anything. They had a net loss of $4,000What is the lesson to take away from these authors - If you don\u2019t put effort into both making a great book, and doing good marketing, you have ZERO chance of making money from self publishing  Next, is the authors who made very little The author who has a decent book and did decent marketing. Unfortunately, this method does not work because being slightly above average doesn\u2019t work. These authors will end up making $100 to $2,000 lifetime from the book. I think we can agree that is not worth the time investment of 2 years of your life to write a bookThe author who has a very good book and then did the wrong marketing or used their budget too quickly. These are authors who thought it was a 100 meter race and spent all their money and energy at the start and got burnt out. Now they are left with no money to keep promotingThe author who has a sub par book and did excellent marketing. Some authors are very good marketers but not good authors. They are able to push their book to mediocre levels of sales. They will end up making $500 to $5,000 lifetime of the book. However, there is only so much lipstick you can slap on a bad bookThe author who has a very good book and had a good marketing start and then gave up. These are authors who had everything going right, saw the initial $1,000 to $2,000 come in, and thought it\u2019s not worth it. Please Note: Depending on your profession, and other options, it might not be a bad idea to quit if the money you are making from books is less than what you could make elsewhereThe main lesson to take from these authors is that being mediocre leads to mediocre results And that you have to master ALL THREE of these dimensions Write a book for which there is huge market demandWrite very very well and polish the book and package it wellDo very good efficient marketing + use your time and money very efficientlyYou have to master ALL THREE AREAS  Next are the authors who got some amount of success but not big success The most common are authors who have a very good book and did very good marketing and got some success and then they did not write enough additional books. Your reader loves you and then there is nothing more for them to buy. You spend almost as much to \u2018acquire\u2019 the reader as a customer, as you make from the book saleAlso common are authors who had a very good to exceptionally good book, did decent marketing, and didn\u2019t manage their money well and ran out of marketing budgetOne interesting category are people who built a content farm i.e. identified a market where there is demand, then creating a factory of creating \u2018just barely good enough to sell\u2019 books and flooding the market. These make good money in the short term and then the money dries out as other content farms come inSome authors are exceptional at marketing. They write good books. Do the perfect marketing. Make good money. Then they make the mistake of thinking people are buying the marketing i.e because they like marketing more or are better at it than at writing, they basically become marketers selling wordsSome authors give up on marketing completely. These are authors who are on their way to making six figures a year. But the stress of doing both writing and marketing becomes too much. This is particularly true if you\u2019re an introvertWhat is the lesson to take from these authors? That sometimes the only difference between middle level of success and big level of success is \u2018one missing piece\u2019. That you have to identify what that one missing piece is, which will take you to the next level If need be, get someone to help get that missing piece in place  Now we have the authors who got big success. These are not different groups. They are one group that do many/most of the below things right Write a very good book and polish it very wellWrite lots of books. Thereby, increasing the Lifetime Money they make from each reader. An author with one book can make just $5 per reader if book is $5. An author with 10 books can price lower at $2.99 and from a reader who loves the author\u2019s writing, can make $30. So now the Revenue Per Reader becomes so much higherMarket extremely well and to the RIGHT readersManage their money very very well. This is critical because each author is, in effect, running a businessBuild direct channels to customers. It is not unheard of for successful authors to have email lists of 100,000 to 300,000 readers. Take an author with 100,000 email subscribers, who is sending out 2 new books a year, at $2.99. Getting even 5% of those readers to buy would be 5,000 * 2 * $2 (their cut of $2.99 price) = $20,000. Just the email list, from 2 days out of 365 generates $20,000Identify what resources work best for them and focus on partnering with those. What cover designer is best for my books and my genre? What marketing service is best? Facebook Ads or AMS ads or Book Promotion Sites? What editor creates the best books? etc etcKeep expenses down. Cut out all unnecessary expenses because that goes straight to profitsLack of Attachment to one particular method. If you get attached to how things work in the book world at one particular point of time, you cannot adapt when things changeLack to Attachment to Ego. Most middle level of success authors fail to become big successes because they start thinking they have already arrived and start behaving as if they are Stephen King. Even Stephen King doesn\u2019t behave as if he\u2019s Stephen KingThere are lots of lessons to take from very successful authors We\u2019ve worked with over 7,000 authors and it\u2019s pretty clear to see what differentiates big successes from the small successes So, you have to decide What amount of time and effort you are willing to giveWhat level of success you are willing to achieveHow you are going to ensure you get all 3 key things right - the right market and the right product for the market, a very high quality product/book, and very very good marketingWhether or not you are willing to learn from authors who have achieved enduring successWhether you want to build a sustainable business and keep adding more products/books to your empire",

            "answer_text": "F*ck all! Now, I realise that isn\u2019t the most optimistic start to an answer, but it\u2019s better to be realistic. The average self-published author on Amazon is going to earn in the hundreds of dollars a year. And that\u2019s a median. Many in the bottom half will sell nothing/next to nothing. The survey shows that the old way of doing things continues to reap the most financial rewards for writers, with traditionally published authors making a median annual income of $3,000\u2013$4,999, and independent writers a median of $500\u2013$999.[1] The relative ease with which people can now get their writing published naturally means that the overall standards will not be as high. John Doe can write about his career as an eel tickler in Idaho, publish the 17-part series, and wait for the non-existent royalties to never trickle in. I mean, literally any idiot with a keyboard can now publish a book. Animal Killdom: A Hypothetical Voyage of Mixed Martial Animal Madness, Cooper, Alex - Amazon.com Shit. Just kidding. (Well, sort of.) Without blowing too much smoke up my own arse, even I am not exactly an \u201caverage\u201d self-published author because I released my book with a decent following on this site, and I did at least attempt a few marketing efforts (e.g an email list, one or two promoted fb posts, even a paid Quora ad). I mean, my book got into the top 50,000 in both kindle and paperback rankings, on Amazon US and Amazon UK. The paperback peaked at around 13000 of over 6 million books on the UK site. \u201cWeird flex, but ok?\u201d Well no, because how many sales did it take to reach 13000? A handful a day for a few days. (Boosted by family and friends ordering, too. But not boosted that much, because I don\u2019t have many friends.) And now my sales have tapered off, I\u2019m back in the hundreds of thousands. (A single sale can cause a jump of one or two hundred thousand.) That means the vast majority of titles on Amazon aren\u2019t selling anything. Most self-published authors don\u2019t have followers or an email list, and will just send their magnum opus out into the ether, where it goes with several million other titles on Amazon. And, again, at the risk of sounding arrogant, I\u2019m better at writing than most people. I\u2019ve had jobs where I\u2019ve been paid to write, albeit not books. I see some questions about people writing their books, read some of their answers, and I just know that they don\u2019t have a chance. I\u2019m still realistic enough to realise that mine isn\u2019t as polished as if I\u2019d had a traditional publisher guide me through it, but I\u2019ve read some self-published stuff and I\u2019m pretty confident it\u2019s better than most of it. I didn\u2019t really set out to write a book; I only did it after some positive reinforcement on here, and after I\u2019d already sunk plenty of effort into writing content for free. And if I were choosing the topic that I thought would make the most money, I can guarantee it wouldn\u2019t be hypothetical animal battles. It was as much a personal thing to actually accomplish something and tick it off the ol\u2019 bucket list. (Saying that, I still put in a lot of effort and tried to make sure it was worth the money. I hope people actually enjoyed it\u2026*cries*) Lots of people lack a bit of self-awareness when it comes to their own writing. There\u2019s a question on here about someone wanting to publish their million word novel, and saying they don\u2019t want to break it up. That\u2019s bordering on delusional to believe that any traditional publisher will touch that with a barge pole. And if it\u2019s even physically possible to self-publish a novel that long in an ebook, no one is going to read it. (Let alone pay for it, because Amazon charges by file size.) The unpleasant truth is that most self-published stuff on Amazon is (redacted). Most people think their stuff is better than it is. Saying that, I\u2019m probably guilty of that, too. And people can make good money, but it\u2019s the top few percent, like most things. The very modest \u201csuccess\u201d I\u2019ve experienced has actually made me want to try again, now, but I\u2019m sticking to what I know (light-hearted animal stuff) and not going to attempt a full-on novel which I think really needs extensive professional editing. I\u2019m almost apologetic when it comes to self-promotion so I guess that\u2019s something I need to remedy. (And something anyone will, if they want to sell some copies.) If you do want to read more of that kinda stuff then you\u2019d be a legend if you subscribed to my email list at the bottom of this page on my site: Book | Coopeywriting. I\u2019m actually tempted to go under a pseudonym and write some trashy romance stuff, because that actually sells the best, but I\u2019m not sure my pride will allow that. Those who want to do best at self-publishing, they found, would be well advised to focus on romantic fiction. Romance authors earned 170% more than their peers, while authors in other genres fared much worse: science-fiction writers earned 38% of the $10,000 average, fantasy writers 32%, and literary fiction authors just 20% of the $10,000 average.[2] If you see a raunchy tale of a journalist falling for her hunky safari guide, you know who was responsible. (Actually, without looking it up, there are probably 183 books on Amazon about that topic already.)  Basically\u2026 what I\u2019m saying is that while there\u2019s an \u201caverage\u201d sales number no one is completely average. The top self-published authors can actually make a decent living, but the majority will make almost nothing. If you\u2019re a good writer (and other people, including those not related to you, actually tell you this) then it might be worth a go. But keep your expectations realistic. We all hope our stuff will get a lucky break and shoot up the bestsellers charts, but the better chance of success is writing loads of books, having a following, and being good at marketing.
