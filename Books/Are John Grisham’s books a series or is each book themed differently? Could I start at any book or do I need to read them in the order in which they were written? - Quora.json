            "answer_text": "His novels are all standalone books, even though there are just a few characters that recur in three or four of them, the ones that deal with legal cases in a small town in Mississippi. No, you don\u2019t need to read them in any order at all, even the ones with recurring characters, though if you do plow through them all, you might want to check plot summaries to see which ones are on that topic and read those few in order just because it might make sense to do that. I\u2019ve never read his series for children, the Theodore Boone series. I think Theodore Boone is the name of the main character (a kid lawyer) in all of them, so maybe different rules apply. ",

The simple answer is, No\u2014his books are not a series. A better answer would be to give you a link to Fantastic Fiction which is a superb site for researching any fiction authors. Not only are the authors listed, but their titles are listed as well. They are grouped in series, or individually, and by clicking on their title (or cover) we are able to read a summary of them. Take a look. ",
