            "answer_text": "Understandably this is a really tough situation for you at 16 and I give you amazing amounts of credit for recognizing your emotions toward your younger sibling. Two year olds are adorable and darling as they develop new skills and say the cutest things which are very entertaining to adults. The fact that the 2 year old gets so much attention is not her fault but the reaction of those around her. At 16 you also need the attention and encouragement of those around you and you may not be getting what you need. If you can, discuss this situation with a trusted adult. Sometimes just verbalizing your feelings is helpful. You may not be able to change your situation but you can change how you react to it. Get involved with an activity that interests you, a sport, volunteer, a job that will get your mind distracted from any resentment you have. Another approach may be to engage with your younger sister and try to enjoy her for who she is. As you get older you will get through this! ",

            "answer_text": "2? That kid hasn't intended anything against you. At that age kids are just regurgitating behaviors that they have encountered in their environment. All other ages are doing the same thing, I suppose. You can perhaps recognize that all resentment is a feeling that you contain in yourself. Your sister does not contain any of your resentment. She is a tiny child who has not got the experience to even understand how her presence and behavior impacts the world over time. It is inside you. Not the real world. ",
