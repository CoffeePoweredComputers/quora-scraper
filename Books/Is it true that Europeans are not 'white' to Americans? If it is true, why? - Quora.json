            "answer_text": "Well I guess because the concept of black and white is just basically because you don't have any other nationality and culture. I mean shure Americans have things like christmas (comes from scandinavian Yule originally) and thanksgiving (recent happening historically speaking) but they aren't really deep roted culture, more like recently made up to sell products. If you think of an american it's also not a specific kind of person you think of, but if you think of an Swede you think blond, blue eyed, light skinned, strong and if you think of an Italian you think more darker hair and eyes, olive skin, skinny and so on. Because you can't do this with Americans because they are just a mix of anything, they want to have something to call themselves, so therefor they take the simple way of just looking at their skin colour. Originally every person should have a deep bond to there land. It's sad what had happend with America. ",

And that is to some degree official policy: in Europe the police will not write for a criminal \u201cWhite\u201dor \u201cHispanic\u201d, the latter obviously meaning \u201cnon-white\u201d. My dad had a black hair, black eyes and a bit tanned looking skin. My mother was very white, blond, with green eyes. I am more like my father, so is my son, but my elder daughter is like my mother. So, from some Americans point of view one of my kids is white, the other is not\u2026That\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it? ",
