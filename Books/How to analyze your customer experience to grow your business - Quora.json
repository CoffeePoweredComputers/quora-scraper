            "answer_text": "Customer Experience is the most important key to grow a business towards success. Every business should get reviews and feedbacks from customers. It helps in understanding so many points which later can be improved every day. Whenever any customer leaves feedback and reviews, the business persons or teams should analyze every experience that the customer has gone through while using your product or services. Delighting your users or customers is the best part which helps in growing the business 100 times. It helps you gain more customers when any old customer shares their experience with their surrounding people. So regarding how we should analyze, I wanna say it depends on the business to business. But clearly you have to write the pain points shared by the customers, the benefits which they can get but are not getting through your services or products, etc. Overall, try to list out the major Goods and Bads of the feedbacks provided by customers and then maintain the good ones along with getting rid of the bad ones by rectifying the issues and resolve them in the upgraded versions and let the users know that they helped you resolve an issue or a pain point in your business.
