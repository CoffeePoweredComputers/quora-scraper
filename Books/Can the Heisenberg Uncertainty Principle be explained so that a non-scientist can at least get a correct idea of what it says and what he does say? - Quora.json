            "answer_text": "Sure, why not? But it will take several steps. First Fourier transforms, then complementary pairs of variables, and finally the counter-intuitive physics of very small things. First consider sounds, musical sounds and sharp impact sounds. A sharp sound is very localized in time, it happens suddenly and then it\u2019s over. A musical tone sound takes some time. In fact, if you tried to play a low note on a piano for a fraction of a second, you would have a hard time hearing what note it is, because it doesn\u2019t get to go through many vibrations, or cycles. Indeed, if it doesn\u2019t make it through one complete cycle, its frequency is not well defined. So, that means that a sharp thwak sound doesn\u2019t really have a single frequency or tone. It is made up of a very wide range of frequencies, and each component is lined up in time, in phase, so all the leading, rising edges of the sine waves are going together. This has to be true for a sharp sound, or it would be spread out in time. We call this a Fourier Transform pair. (Fourier was some smart French guy around 1800.) In this case, it is time and frequency. The Fourier Transform is a mathematical function that takes a time signal of some sound, and tells you what the frequency content is. Did you ever see one of those bar-graph indicators on a stereo (probably in the 1970s) that shows the content of the sound, with the bass on the left and the treble on the right? That moving graph is the Fourier Transform of the time signal. Also, to make it intuitive, this transform is what your ears do all the time. You don\u2019t perceive sound as a time-varying function of air pressure. No, you experience it as low tones and high tones, bass and treble, cellos and piccolos. Your ears mechanically run a Fourier Transform on the time signal, and run that information to your brain. So with such transform pairs, if one is very localized (like a sharp thwak in a very short time), then the frequency spectrum is spread out, and if it is localized in frequency (like a pure tone), then it is spread out in time. OK, that\u2019s signal processing 101 - see this for more: Fourier transform - Wikipedia. In quantum mechanics, which is the physics of small things, on the order of the size of atoms, some measurable quantities that you thought of as independent from each other, are actually transform pairs. These are (x, p) position and momentum, and (E, t) Energy and time, or duration of an event. There are more, see this: complementary pairs. In classical, macroscopic mechanics, an object can be anywhere and be moving at any velocity. No problem, we treat these as independent variables. But, what if the object is really a wave-like function of something that isn\u2019t really all in one place. Consider a wave at the beach. All the water is not in one place, it is a bit spread out. Similarly, its momentum, or velocity is not completely uniform. Some parts are moving faster than others. The wave changes shape as it moves. That\u2019s a wave in the ocean. Now, consider a very small particle, like an electron, a proton, or a photon. At that scale, this object is not solid at all. It is a wave-like function, some parameter, as a function of space and time. This function is is not exactly a medium, like the famous ether of the late 1800s for light. It\u2019s just a parameter that we can handle mathematically. We can do some math to transform this function into a probability that we will detect the particle in one place or another. Fine - that\u2019s the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and its wave function. In my freshman year at Columbia, I had a physics professor who used to say, \u201cit turns out that \u2026\u201d, and then he would wave his hands and give you some complicated formula. It was infuriating. So, it turns out that position and momentum are such transform pairs. That means that, on a microscopic scale, the position and the momentum (roughly proportional to velocity) are not a single number, but a probability distribution, spread out over a range of numbers. Precisely what the Heisenberg formula says is that the product of the uncertainties (the spread) of the two quantities, is never smaller than a certain constant. Normally, for a particle, the position is a little uncertain (spread out over a range of values), and the momentum is a little uncertain. But you can also take it to the extremes thus: If you do an experiment that tells you precisely where the particle is at a certain time, then you will maximize the uncertainty in the momentum. You cannot tell how fast it was going. Or, if you measure exactly its velocity, you cannot tell very well where it is. The latter makes some sense, intuitively, because to measure the velocity of something, you need to measure it at t0 and then a short time later at t1. So, your idea of where it is is fuzzy, because it is moving. All of this is not intuitive at all, because when you go to larger objects, the observable behavior is the aggregate of all these tiny atoms, and that fuzziness is averaged out. The physics we experience directly does not reveal the underlying quantum reality. But you do yourself a disservice if you (like a lot of folks on Quora) insist on thinking of electrons and photons as little, solid spheres, whenever someone calls them particles. They are not particles, and they are not waves either, exactly. They are these things that stuff is actually made up of, that don\u2019t behave like macroscopic things that we experience directly. But we have devised a whole mathematical theory and sets of equations that let us model real systems, and we get the correct answers. That\u2019s as far as science goes when it comes to describing reality. It is correct. Whether you like it, or consider it intuitive, well, that\u2019s up to you.

            "answer_text": "Yes - at least if you accept Quantum Field Theory. This is one of many reasons why QFT (a theory based on fields) should have replaced Quantum Mechanics (a theory based on particles) - but didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s the reason I wrote my book. As Julian Schwinger said: \u2026these two distinct classical concepts [particles and waves] are merged and become transcended in something that has no classical counterpart \u2013 the quantized field that is a new conception of its own, a unity that replaces the classical duality. \u2013 J. Schwinger In QFT, the Uncertainty Principle is simply a statement that a spread-out field can\u2019t be localized to a point, but the degree of localization depends on the spread of wavelengths within the field. Here is how I explain it in my book: The probabilistic interpretation of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation eventually led to the uncertainty principle of QM, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. This principle states that the exact position of a particle cannot be determined, but the uncertainty in position is related to the uncertainty in its momentum. So not only do we have wave-particle duality to deal with, we have to deal with particles that might be here or might be there, but we can\u2019t say where. If the electron is really a particle, then it stands to reason that it must be somewhere. Resolution. In QFT there are no particles (stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before) and hence no position, certain or uncertain. Instead there are blobs of field spread out over space. Instead of a particle that is either here or here or possibly there, we have a field that is here and here and there. Spreading out is something that only a field can do; a particle can\u2019t do it. In fact, there is a property of fields called Fourier\u2019s theorem that relates the spatial spread of a field to the spread of its wavelengths. Now in QFT the wavelength of a quantum is related to its momentum, so Fourier\u2019s theorem is equivalent to the relationship between position and momentum in the Uncertainty Principle. I still remember my moment of insight in graduate school when I realized that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is nothing more than Fourier\u2019s theorem.

            "answer_text": "If you look at a book or a baseball, you don\u2019t bother it. You shine a light on it, and it just sits there. No problem. If you look at something tiny, when you shine light on it in order to see it, you are bombarding it with photons, which do carry tiny amounts of energy and momentum, and give the object a tiny bump. If you look at something atom sized or smaller, you can pretty much only score a direct hit with one photon at a time. If you have a wide set of detectors, then you can generally see where the light is coming from, so you know where the object is. BUT\u2014if the photon actually hits the tiny particle, it knocks the tiny particle pretty hard, and it recoils in some direction. Since we don\u2019t know exactly where it was or how fast it was moving before we looked (that\u2019s why we looked!) we can\u2019t tell just from the photon ricochet both where the particle is and where it is going next. It\u2019s not enough information. If you try using more photons, you\u2019re just smacking it around like a ping pong ball. You can figure out where it was, but you can\u2019t tell where it is going next because you never get enough information to catch up. If you try using gentler photons, you get a different problem: it gets hard to see anything much smaller than the wavelength of light you are using to see with. So you can tell roughly where the particle is, but not exactly. The actual formula says that your error in position multiplied by the mass of the particle, multiplied by the error in velocity, can\u2019t be made smaller than a certain number, which happens to be 1/4pi * Planck\u2019s constant, or 1/4pi * (6.636 x10 ^ -34 J*s) Which is incredibly tiny, and so we don\u2019t see this behavior when we look at golf balls or even bacteria much. I hope that helps. ",
