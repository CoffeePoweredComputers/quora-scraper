            "answer_text": "Revelation chapter 17 tells us clearly that Revelation was written within a ten-year span: 69 - 79 AD, during the reign of Vespasian. Jesus was taking on disciples at Bethabara and we suppose John was there looking for a teacher. When fellows were 17 and if their families had the means, they were allowed to seek out a teacher for higher education. So if Jesus was 30 and John was 17, there is a 13-year difference in their ages. So then, if John wrote Revelation in say 75 AD, John would have been 62 years old. The thought that John was a very old man has been disproved over and over again. And if he were on Patmos, which is a 49 sq. mile copper mine, he certainly would not have been 90 something years old. The life expectancy at that time was about 29, and what can a decrepit man of 90 something do in a copper mine? Not much. But a 58 - 68 year old man would be of some use to the Romans. (For he tells us he was there on account of the Word of Yah and the Testimony of Yahshua.) On \u2018church father\u2019 tells us that he was there during the reign of Domitian, that is, 90s AD, but he also admits that it would be more valuable to the church to keep the revelation AFTER the Jewish revolt. After all, John in the Revelation was writing about the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. If Revelation could be dated LATER, then of course the church could lie and use that as a glimpse of the future, to keep people under the power of their false teachings - and that was a great strategy, because the Mystery is History - nothing to fear from any of that now - only hope to be gotten.

            "answer_text": "Based on analyses of the texts and the theology contained in them, if the apostle John wrote the Book of Revelation, he could not have written the gospel that now bears his name. In fact, there is no good evidence at all that the apostle John wrote the Book of Revelation. The book certainly is signed by a person called John, but even the early Church Fathers disputed whether this was the apostle John. As a result, most modern New Testament scholars now refer to Revelation\u2019s author as \u2018John of Patmos\u2019. ",
