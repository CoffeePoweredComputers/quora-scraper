            "answer_text": " My advice? Have a game plan. In other words, don\u2019t leave everything up in the air, hoping for the best, but not really knowing how to organize the time you spend in your study sessions. A good game plan means having strategies in place so that you know exactly what you need to do. Here are 5 strategies that can help you improve your reading concentration while you are studying. Strategy #1. Dedicate time to reading study material early. Why early? Because you take full advantage of your circadian rhythm which dictates which activities you\u2019re more likely to do best at certain times of the day. For most people, the brain\u2019s peak performance happens 2-4 hours after you wake up: if you get up at 8, the peak time is 10\u201312. This is the time when your analytical brain takes over and you can focus better on absorbing new material.What are the benefits? Doing your hard work early in the day allows your brain to focus fully on the material in front of you with fewer distractions, less inputs from your environment, and with more energy that you've gained from a restful night. It's the opposite of what can happen if you leave learning new things for late at night, when your brain has processed information for well over 12 hours.What about distractions? When you\u2019re in learning mode, turn off your phone or at least the volume setting, avoid responding to calls and text messages, and ignore other distractions such as emails, reading the news or what\u2019s in your social media feed. You\u2019ll notice a big difference in the way and the speed at which you can absorb new material when you are not distracted. Strategy #2. Read smarter, not longer or harder. Reading for hours on end is probably the worst approach you can take when studying. It will zap your energy, decrease your motivation, and negatively impact your focus on what\u2019s in front of you. Try a different approach: when you're ready to begin, use a timer to divide up your time so that you allow your brain to focus in a more targeted and effective way. Here\u2019s how: Reading or reviewing study material. Set the timer to 30-60 minute increments to maximize concentration; or, you can also try the Pomodoro technique which consists of 25 minute blocks of time, followed by 5 minute breaks.Preparing for exams. Use your timer to simulate an exam. First, start by reading the review questions in your textbook or those provided your professor. Or, you can create your own questions based on the most important concepts from each chapter. Then, write the questions down on a sheet of paper in a list format. Set your timer to the Pomodoro technique (25 minute increments) to give yourself only a short time to answer the questions, and go down the list until you\u2019ve covered them all.Saying it out loud. As you\u2019re going over new material and complex sections for the first time, write an outline of the basic points and then say each point out loud. You can take it a step further: tell a friend, family member or even your dog what you\u2019ve just learned and why you thought it was interesting and important. This help you review, recall, and retain what you\u2019ve learned in a much better way than just silently looking over the material and writing it out. Strategy #3. Take notes of what you read. If you want to keep track of what you read, it\u2019s a good idea to create a system for it. In other words, you can give your reading experience more structure so that you can process, retrieve, and recall the material more easily. A good way to do this is to make notes like a pro. What are the benefits? Taking notes is a valuable skill to learn not just for the sake of giving your reading experience more structure. It\u2019s also really good for your brain because it helps to amplify your focus and concentration, makes retaining and recalling information easier, boosts your cognitive skills, strengthens memory, and engages your critical thinking skills.How do you take notes?Dedicate a notebook to your reading. Then, as you read through articles and books, start a note on each one by writing the title, author\u2019s name, and date when you read it, which can be an added memory boost when you look at your notes later.Focus on key concepts, ideas, and topics. Don\u2019t make it a goal to write down every little thing you read. That will take forever and you won\u2019t benefit from your notes. Instead, boost your critical thinking skills by identifying what is relevant to the topic. If you\u2019re not sure how to begin, try the Cornell Method.Write notes in list format. This saves time, enables you to skim the material when you need it, helps you locate information faster, and makes the review process easier.Get creative with drawing and color. It\u2019s not all about long, dry segments of text. You can draw squares, rectangles, or circles around the main topics, ideas and concepts. Use markers or highlighters to prioritize concepts (use one color to mark those that are top priority, and a second color for second level priority items). This helps the most important information to stand out and makes it easier to find later when you need it. Strategy #4. Tell someone a story about what you\u2019ve learned. When you put yourself in the role of storyteller, you make the study material come alive. It\u2019s a great way to take the next step in the learning process. It\u2019s being proactive about what you\u2019re absorbing, instead of passively reading and just moving on to the next thing. What are the benefits? Telling a story is easy to practice because it\u2019s not formal so there isn\u2019t pressure to make it perfect. It also gives you confidence by strengthening your knowledge of the study material, and it boosts your memorization. You can review, recall, and retain what you\u2019ve learned better and more effectively.How do you do it?Find your audience. It can be a friend, roommate, study partner, sibling, or parent.Find the right time. Don\u2019t just assume everyone will want to pause what they\u2019re doing and pay attention to you. Pick a time when they\u2019re not in the middle of working or finishing up a task, so they can also enjoy the story. For example, you can talk while taking a walk together, having dinner, or just chilling out in the evening.Make it concise. Nobody wants to sit through an hour\u2019s worth of lecture, especially if it\u2019s during their downtime and not an obligation to do so. Think about what is the main point of what you read that you\u2019d like to share, and then explain it in a few minutes. This will force you to prioritize what is the most important piece of the material you read.Make it lively. Your story doesn\u2019t have to be merely a list of important concepts. To make your story interesting, mention an example you really liked and say why you liked it. Add a detail that you found fascinating or unusual. If there\u2019s something that was not clear to you, mention that too. It\u2019s an excellent way to prompt your friend to give their take on what they heard.Encourage dialogue. You told your story. What happens next? Use the opportunity to get your friend\u2019s opinion and point of view. Ask them if they heard or read anything similar, and you might get a recommendation of what to read next. Share your opinions and turn it into a conversation so that you can both benefit from the experience by making it more meaningful. Strategy #5. Revisit the new material throughout the day. Chances are much greater that you\u2019ll remember details of what you read if you apply them to your life in some way. It\u2019s another example of being proactive with what you are reading. What are the benefits? When you apply the details of what you\u2019ve read to your life, it means you are making a connection between learning something new and the way you think, study, work, or communicate with others. In other words, you are applying that knowledge to something concrete and tangible that can benefit you.How do you do it?Use every opportunity you have. When you are on your commute or walking or running errands, ask yourself what were the key concepts from the article or book you just finished. Go over them, remembering what you wrote in your notes and how you emphasized each point. This added repetition of newly learned material will reinforce your knowledge of it even more.Use the new material to generate more ideas. Sometimes reading an article can give us ideas on how to do our job better or how to improve one area of our life. For example, we can learn about developing a new habit, practicing a skill, achieving mastery at something, or just going more in depth on a topic that we find fascinating. It\u2019s an excellent starting point to do more research on what interests us.Take one idea and practice it. Every piece of new material you read, whether it\u2019s a news article or a 19th century novel, will be full of details and new information. Don\u2019t think that you need to practice every little detail or idea. Instead, find one idea that you liked, then find ways to practice it at work or school. It can be learning a few words in a different language, practicing a small habit or ritual to make your day more interesting, or a different way of asking questions in a conversation. Whatever it is, select something that can help you improve the quality of your everyday life so that you can really feel the benefit of learning something new.",

            "answer_text": " If you want it badly enough, you will find the resources. If you are reading something you perceive to be of utmost importance, you would not be distracted. The distractions will just melt away in oblivion and you will have the sheer focus to go through whatever you are reading or doing. Your training is nothing. The will is everything. -Ra\u2019as al Ghul (Batman Begins) That said, here are the few ways in which you can increase your reading concentration: Practice meditation: The best way to increase your concentration and be ultra focused is through meditation. Meditation teaches you to turn down down the noise, and focus on whatever is truly important. That is one of the reasons it is a crucial part of lives of many legends throughout the history. Even 10 minutes of meditation [1]on daily basis can have a lasting effect on every aspect of your life, including concentration while reading.Before sitting down, realize why it is important: If you have a purpose, you will be doing it with all your heart. Before sitting down to study take a moment to think why this is important and why you are definitely going for it. That way you train your mind to believe that whatever you are going to do is truly important and therefore you should stay focused.Practice speed reading: A normal person can read 300\u2013400 words per minute (w.p.m.). However, this is not the human limit. Through practice, we can train our mind to read at a much faster pace. It is not uncommon to find someone who can read at 800\u20131000 w.p.m. This aid you significantly in two ways:When you are reading at a much faster pace, you quickly move from one word to another (or a bunch of words to another bunch of words). Therefore, the capability of mind to wander to un-chartered territories is severely incapacitated. That help you in staying focused for longer duration while studying.The other benefit of speed reading is that you can read too much is too little time. So say if you are normally read at 300 w.p.m. and it takes you an hour to finish a particular chapter, then by increasing your reading speed to to 600 w.p.m. you can read the same chapter twice in same time. And for memorizing, it is evident that the more no. of times you read something, the better you retain it. So that way you can retain whatever you are reading for a longer duration.Set a timer: Our brain is just like any other muscle in our body. The more you train it, the better it becomes. But you can not become an Olympic weightlifter in a day. You have to start small and gradually improve yourself on a daily basis. So initially you should not set obnoxious targets for yourself (like reading straight for 4 hours) and completely abandon your plans at the first instance of failure. Start with smaller goals. Use Pomodoro technique and try studying with utmost focus for 25 minutes in the beginning. Gradually increase this time by 5 minutes a day and within 6 months you will have gained significant focusing capability.Eliminate distractions: While doing a focused task, if we are distracted, it takes us 20 minutes to go back to our state of flow (a term used by Cal Newport). That is too much time to waste when we want to achieve anything productive. Therefore, before studying or committing to any task that require extreme focus, turn off the distractions. Switch off your mobile phones, internet, TV, write down any lingering thought you may have in your mind on a piece of paper (so that you can get back to it later) and put a DND signboard outside your room. These will help you in achieving unfettered concentration required.Hope it helps. Shot me a message in case you want any further help. Good Luck.

            "answer_text": "Concentration is what we all require if we really want to attain the best of our actions. This is not only required while studying or working, but it is also important into your day to day life as well. It is not a thing that you can achieve overnight however with constant practice, it will bring success. Coming on How to improve. As we all know the biggest contradiction to concentration is distraction of mind for more attractive things. Discipline - Try to keep yourself disciplined and prepare your timetable to study and follow it rigorously. When you will train your mind like that then it will be much easier for you to work on in a longer run.Interest - When you are initiating your studies, Try to study the topics which interests you the more. This is a very common and proven way of get yourself going for a longer time.Prepare yourselfQuite zone - Try to be in a zone which is quite enough to study. By study, I do not mean only Books, it is also about study your own thoughts.Keep your gadgets away - It is very common nowadays that we get distracted by Mobile phones. It is being advised, that if not important then keep your mobile phones away from you on a \u201cSilent mode\u201d :). This would help you to focus on current priorities.Feed yourself - We all have some habits, mine is eating while reading (in a controlled manner). Keep yourself stuffed, well enough next couple of hours.To-do List - It is very important to set targets for yourself and strive to achieve for it, this will help you covering your syllabus/course. Select topics that you want to cover on a particular day and then manage your time to achieve your target.Decisions - Don\u2019t always keep on going/reading when it\u2019s not helping. It\u2019s like hitting a wall. When it is hard to understand, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help or second opinion.Breaks - Breaks in your timetable is as much important as your studying is. Your mind will also need time to understand and absorb some of the new topics and some of the contradictory beliefs.I think that it is applicable for most of your actions and will be helpful. ",

Simply write why you\u2019re reading it and what you hope to achieve or learn.As you read the book, enter notes related to significant insights in the category of Unexpected lessons.In the Want to share category, make a few notes about what insights you want to share and with whom. It could be a blog or Facebook post or a personal note.Finally, when you complete the book write a short Summary on why you liked or did not like the book and what were the key insights. If the book really moved you, write a more extensive summary.When you start with these ideas in mind, it keeps your brain on alert for insights. It also helps to review your notes a few times during the course of reading the book, especially if you read it over an extended period of time. I often find myself with a half-dozen books in progress, and having a note on each one is very useful. If you keep these notes in a Books folder, you can search on key words and phrases and quickly refresh your memory on insights and lessons. Unfortunately, I should have started this process years ago. My old practice was to highlight, underline and write notes in the margins. It\u2019s not a very effective way to retrieve lessons learned. Edstartwithclarity ",

Does this sound like you? Don't feel ashamed. This is possibly everyone who uses a smartphone these days. Multitasking has had us chasing two three four rabits, and decreasing our attention span. The constant notification deplete our attention. Some tips that have helped are : Read with objective in mind : I set a target to read X number of pages in Y time. By keeping the target at the back of your mind, you're more focused than before to achieve it. Summarize what you read : If you read for pleasure, chances are you might wander off and you'll lose track of what you were reading. This usually happens with people who read a lot of fiction. Read with the idea of making a gist or summarizing what you're reading. Thereby you'll be more present whilst reading. Keep away the distractions : Put your phone on silent, turn off the laptop and don't listen ti music while reading. Our minds can't multitask, it was only made to do one task efficienctly. These are some of the practices which have helped me. Do let me know how helpful you found them to be! ",

If a book isn't captivating enough, our mind gets bored and gets distracted. Find some short story that leaves you asking for more. A suspense or mystery book will also keep you hooked on. Every time you sit to read, the challenge is finishing the first 3 pages. Once that is done, your focus will remain on the book. Try to devote time to this. Reading in a library may also help. Library is to reading what a gym is to fitness. The group enery is inspiring. Another option would be external assistance. Read out to someone. That way, you become sincere and responsible to ensure that you read out the entire story to the other person. Reading is the best habbit/addiction you can get. Don't let\u200b it go. Hope this helps. Happy reading. :) ",

            "answer_text": "There are two main pillars of academic reading and studying. Increasing focus and retaining information. For increasing focus always remember to study smaller chunks of information in order to gain more. Large sessions result in more time distribution. The more time you take to complete a task, the more have the chances that you lose focus. Always keep the study session small so that you stay constantly concentrated. A fun fact is that the brain can only concentrate on a single task for 45 minutes and after that, it loses focus off it. Also, remember that never think of multitasking as an option. It is proven that multitasking is stressful and reduces productivity. So study one subject at once to have stress free and productive study sessions. The common practice amongst students is doing everything late at night because they think that they will get a silent atmosphere and will be able to do better. But this is wrong, as early birds are more proactive and productive in all their tasks. It's a fact that our brain is fresh in the morning and can process much more information in less time. While night owls have issues like a tired brain and lack of oxygen in the brain. The second important thing is retaining information.

            "answer_text": "How much I know and saw people generally cant concentrate in there studies because while they study there mind generally get attracted by othere things specially with phone. One very important thing is you should always turn off your phone data while studying because it will always bother you with notification but dont switch off it because possible any one may have a important work from you. One of the other problem is your friend calls just to have a time pass that time you should just say a small thing \u201cI AM IN TUTION\u201d that time your friend also become your parents. The main in all of this is TRY TO STUDY LOUD means to speak and study it will never let you to lose your concentration and try to understand and study because if you understand what you study you will try to give your most of the time to it. \u201cFIND A REASON STRONG ENOUGH THAT WILL NEVER LET YOU FEEL THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS USELESS\u201d because no one else can give you a reason, why to study except yourself. One more important thing is always follow the things usually moms says like \u201calways sit and study\u201d, \u201cstudy loud\u201d ,etc\u2026 These things seems usual but they always work. Thanks.

One of the reasons people who were voracious readers lose interest in reading is because now the head is full of knowledge, but the knowledge has not been applied. If you start applying what you have read, your hunger might awaken again.Sometimes, people, like myself, are kinaesthetic learners, so they learn a lot through touch. So you can underline the book in case you own it and it is a physical book. Sometimes, I had to finish 150 pages in very little time. This technique helped me a lot. Other tips for kinaesthetic learners including making notes, making diagrams, marking important places on maps and so on.If you are a visual learner, drawing the plot or an itinerary may help.It could be that you have evolved. Now the kinds of books that excite you have changed. For this you just have to keep looking for the right books. The right book will draw you in.",

            "answer_text": "Follow the Pomodoro Technique. If you don't know what it is, well, you do one set of work for 30mins and then you take a 5 mins break. During the break you can do what you want but you need to come back again for another session for 25 minutes. Keep repeating it. Now certainly there are multiple ways to improve the Pomodoro Technique and there are many other tricks to get you focus and concentrated at work.Check some of them out here :  Second thing I would recommend is break your job into smaller sub-jobs. Like suppose if you want to complete a work by evening. Break that work in smaller works, like in 3 parts. Set a smaller target which you might wanna Complete by afternoon. One by evening and other by night. Also reward yourself when you reach that milestone. It helps you keep track of your progress and will let you improve your focus and concentration. Hope that helps :) ",
