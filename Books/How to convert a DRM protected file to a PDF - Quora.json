            "answer_text": "Currently, lots of book platforms apply with such encryption technology. So before answering your question, I need to confirm one thing: Are you going to convert the files from Kindle, Adobe, Kobo, Nook eBooks? If yes, then I may certainly help you out. When we purchased a book from those platforms, we can, of course, enjoy millions of digital titles provided by their stores. But to a great extent, we will be limited in cases, for example, we are limited on the reading time, we can't transfer them to other devices, we are incapable of converting them to other formats, like PDF, or etc. I think that's also why you will ask for an answer / a tool for this requirement. I endured this as well in the past. But finally, I find out a program that can help me convert those DRM files to the open book files, including PDF, it's called PDFMate eBook Converter. On its official statement, it can remove DRM from Kindle, Adobe, Kobo, Nook eBooks and convert them to various formats, including EPUB, MOBI, PDF, AZW3, TXT, and KFX. Users only need to click a few clicks to convert the DRM files to PDF files: add DRM books to it, select the output format (of course you can choose PDF), click convert to start, and then just wait for the conversion end. It's a smart tool and that's also why I recommend it. And here's the interface of their program:  Plus, they also have a PDF Converter, which is totally free!!! If you just need to convert the common files (instead of DRM files), just try it! ",
