One evening I heard a noise of heavy boots going up and down the staircase (I and my family lived on the floor below the spinsters). I opened my door to check what the commotion was all about and was met by EMTs hauling what looked like an empty gurney down the stairs... but it wasn't empty. The elder of the spinsters was in it under a maroon blanket. Ever since then we have reports of a ghost walking the halls. There have been strange occurrences. Ball lightning in the building. Cold air in the middle of nowhere. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t consider it bad luck. There are people who consider a house where someone has died from other than natural causes to have a stigma. In fact, in some areas if someone has been murdered or committed suicide that this be disclosed. In real estate these are known as stigmatized properties. Of course if the event occurred many years ago it is possible the current seller may not even be aware of it. In my area we have homes which date to the 1800\u2019s and I\u2019m fairly sure that there are many homes which have had someone pass away in them. At one time dying at home was not uncommon. ",
