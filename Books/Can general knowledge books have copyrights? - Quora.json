            "answer_text": "Yes. Facts can\u2019t be copyrighted\u2026 but the expression of them can. So, for example, you could learn everything in a general knowledge book, then write your own book describing all that and sell it. That\u2019s legal. But you can\u2019t legally make new copies of that book and sell them, or copy significant blocks of text from it and claim it\u2019s your own. An arrangement or selection of facts can also have a copyright, under precedents in the US. So, for example, if I write a book of \u201cFun Facts About Star Wars\u201d, and then you write another book which happens to have the same set of \u201cfun facts\u201d, and I can prove that you used my book to make yours, that\u2019s a copyright violation. If, on the other hand, you wrote your book independently and it just happens to have the same facts, that\u2019s not copyright infringement. And that last bit is part of why copyright lawsuits get so complicated. Copyright is about copying. If two people happen to write the exact same poem somehow (to make it more likely, say they\u2019re both parodying a well-known poem that\u2019s out of copyright), then they each have a copyright to it. If, say, person C then copies person B\u2019s original, and it can be proven, then person B can potentially get damages\u2026 but person A can\u2019t, since their version wasn\u2019t copied, even though it\u2019s identical. Yeah, it\u2019s weird. Just keep in mind that it\u2019s about copying, and that should help a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "Collections and compilations can be protected as literary works. Facts, as a rule, do not have copyright on them. However, a compilation or arrangement of these facts may be eligible for copyright protection. For example, if you collate and collect facts relating to a particular person, place, event, book, movie, or anything else; and publish them in the form of a book, the resulting book will be subject of copyright protection. This is because in collecting the facts and compiling/arranging them in a single book, you have used exercised some effort of your own. On the other hand, if you wish to copyright a single fact relating to anything, you cannot do it. This is because the fact is an already existing piece of information, not open to being copyrighted.
