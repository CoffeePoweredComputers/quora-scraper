            "answer_text": "There is a lot you can learn on your own these days since there is so much great content online. There are advantages to taking lessons with a good teacher: Guidance on building good physical habits. This is something that may not seem to get in your way in the beginning, but can stop you from playing more difficult music down the road. It\u2019s way easier to build good habits from the beginning than to undo bad ones later.Help you make a learning plan. I ask students what it is they want to do and then make a plan of what they need to focus on that will help them accomplish it. I\u2019m going to make a different plan for someone who wants to play and sing pop music than I am for someone who wants to play solo classical music.Make you accountable. Knowing someone will be checking in on you is a good motivator to getting things done.Choose material or arrangements that sound good or are at the right level for you.Lay out knowledge and skills in a logical order. So much knowledge in music is interconnected so sometimes people struggle to find a path through it that makes sense and isn\u2019t overwhelming.It may be that you can accomplish these things in other ways. Certainly, being part of an online group or checking in with a teacher every so often would be beneficial in making sure you\u2019re on a good path. Here are a few ideas on how you could do this free or very low cost. Buy a piano class on Udemy or some site like it. They are usually anywhere from $11 (on sale) to $30. You would get specific lesson content and probably also some access to interact with the teacher and get feedback.Follow some piano teachers or people who give tutorials on Youtube.Reach out to teachers who have an online presence with specific questions. Teachers that are online welcome engagement and interaction. I just created a video specifically on understanding tensions because someone on instagram asked me to explain it!Find websites that have piano learning content.Buy some piano method books. I would suggest getting one that builds reading skills and then one that has easy music that you are interested in playing. You can certainly supplement with other free music you find online but you probably don\u2019t want to have to piece the whole thing together yourself.Use apps for your phone or tablet that can help you drill on knowledge and skills.There are websites that have a monthly paid subscription. $30 a month is way cheaper than lessons but I\u2019m always loathe to commit myself to subscriptions especially not knowing if it is really effective or not beforehand. You can check out all of the content that I create free for students on my site (suzanstroud.com) and feel free to reach out with questions to me or on Quora. Users on quora are great about giving really detailed answers to questions. ",

            "answer_text": "You will only regret NOT taking lessons if you don\u2019t commit to practicing perfectly every day. There are a lot of free and cheap resources online that will help you get better at piano but if you aren\u2019t committing to following them, then you are going to get frustrated and give up. Then you\u2019ll regret not taking the lessons. If you don\u2019t have very good self-management skills then I would suggest you try to find a cheap teacher (even over skype or something). At least they will keep you accountable for your practice. Even if you have lessons, you\u2019ll drop off if you don\u2019t practice. Perfect practice is the most important aspect and if you don\u2019t commit to this you\u2019ll always regret it. Good luck! ",
