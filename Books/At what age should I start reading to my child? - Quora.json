            "answer_text": "I know Ian McCullough asked me to answer this question because he knows me and knew in advance what my answer would be.  The reasons you read to your embryo and fetus prenatally and as often as you can are many.  While expectant parents might feel silly at first reading to a slowly swelling belly, the sound of your voices reading is soothing, so the oxytocin in mother-baby increases, causing serenity and calm feelings. This is a way to reduce stress in mother-baby during the entire period of gestation.  Additionally, it has been proven that the uterus conducts sound. Babies who have been read to in utero recognize their parents' voices when they are born.  Neonates and infants who are read to feel soothed by familiar voices. Although they may not specifically speak or understand words (understanding predates speaking in the child development process), they are learning the rhythms and patterns of speech. This includes a gradual ability to learn and separate their language's sounds.  Children in preschool who have been read to habitually have an easier time learning the alphabet, and recognizing the sounds of the alphabet in words they know, and can respond accurately to the question: \"What sound begins the word 'tiger'?\" They have an understanding of language and reasoning that some may say shows early and advanced skills. Actually, they just had more and earlier exposure to language and the sounds and thoughts manifested in speech. Such babies are way ahead of the learning curve.  This answer should be interpreted to mean that as soon as a pregnancy is confirmed, reading aloud can (and should ideally) commence.  Readers whose children are already born should begin the reading aloud habit immediately.  Family reading time before bed is a beautiful ritual. And on weekends and slow summer days, the time from 2-4 was known as 'quiet time' (comprised of afternoon rest and reading time in my household). During that time, children who need to nap can be read to, and then either fall asleep or look at books. Older children can read to themselves or do any quiet independent activity which doesn't interfere with anyone else's quiet time.  Reading out loud can be the greatest moments of a child's life. Edited to add that I am such a proponent of reading with children that I began a blog on Quora, Bedtime Reading. There, you will find answers by parents and by me which list favorite bedtime reading books for parents and kids of all ages. ",

The sound, tone and rhythm of your voice even at the youngest age will have developmental benefits for your child even before they can understand language. It\u2019s helps their brains grow and it may help them develop language faster. Studies have shown that reading to even very young children helps their brains grow and increases intelligence among other benefits. And you don\u2019t always have to read. With very young kids get picture books and talk about the pictures - the figures, the colors, objects in the picture, make up stories. When I was very young my some of my favorite books were Richard Scary books. Back then they didn\u2019t always have words or minimal words but dad and I would spend ages just looking at everything going on in the pictures because there was always A LOT going on. And when Gold Bug became a thing we always searched for it. My dad took me to the library regularly and read to me almost every night and his \u2018reading\u2019 always included discussions of the pictures. I was always in the highest reading class in school, always read above my grade level and read my first no pictures chapter book (Nancy Drew) all the way through in one day the summer after fourth grade. I was nine or ten. The beginning of my speed reading ability. I always credit my father not only with giving me the love of books and words but giving me the freedom of imagination and the freedom and skills to indulge all of those things because he opened my mind to the worlds in books from a very young age.

            "answer_text": "Reading to children should begin as soon as the child is capable of understanding even a few words, possibly even before. Many books for very young children consist almost entirely of pictures, and looking at the pictures together and turning the pages helps establish the desirability of reading and emphasises companionship between adult and child. It\u2019s also a very good way to help settle children for sleep. We had a few books which revolved around just a few words that were excellent for very young children. One involved the word Boo! which our son learned to recognise very early; he\u2019d point to it and yell \u201cBoo!\u201d In its way, that established in his mind that he could or would be able to read when the time came. In fact, reading sort of snuck up on him. He came home from school one day and said to me, with an odd, somewhat disgusted, look on his face: \u201cI discovered I can read.\u201d (I\u2019d actually known he could for some months before his discovery.)

Or - to be more accessible to those us without access to a time machine: Start now. Get books with pictures, read the words to her (pointing to them) but also point to different parts of the pictures and describe them, describe what's happening - do it every night, do it during the day, get at least two really good kiddie books to read per day. Read all the time - let her see you do it for fun for yourself. Read out bits of books you're reading for her to listen to (not violent or smexy bits - but otherwise don't worry about the words not meaning anything to her or being too complicated - get her used to hearing them). Read in waiting rooms, read at bed time, read in the middle of the day, just read - read out her cereal packets. Just get her used to the rhythm. And then - when she turned 2 years old - start watching \"Super Why!\" with her (can be found on YouTube - and you can start when she's one if you really wanted to but it's really above that age group - and you kind of want to hit JUST above her age group - but not too far that she can't get any enjoyment out of it - I started my son on Super Why when he was 2 years old - at 3 years old (and now at 4) he was causing professionals to jaw drop on his recognition of letters).

            "answer_text": "Hi there , I see that this question is well answered by Radhika Alok. You can start when the baby is still in the womb. The earlier you start the better as the interest is inculcated at a stage when the child learns that which you teach and not when they are being influenced by outside environment. Reading with a lot of expressions and sounds and acting makes the story come alive and the child enjoys it so much more. His /her imagination is sparked and after that it is a lifetime habit. The important thing is that at very young age do not expect that they understand right and complete the story and sound the word right. It is about getting the child\u2019s interest. So you could be funny and come up with silly words and even go to the extent of changing the story with twist from the normal. You could also make up stories with them. As they grow a little older do introduce different topics for them to become versatile. Regular reading creates a love for books and forms a lifetime habit. Reading once a week or only when you have time is not the method. You should inculcate the habit of reading yourself if you are not a reader. Start with newspaper and articles and short stories and magazines then go on to fatter books. ",

Reading to your little one can become a unique experience, but don't do it as an \"investment\" with future benefits in mind (nothing wrong with it, only it's less good and it could even backfire); instead, imagine those minutes spent sharing a story, with its pictures, its theatrics, where *you* have your FUN(!!). Play and laughter will spontaneously create an experience that connects you both at the heart -- and during those minutes we forget about her IQ, about her learning, her knowledge, future mini-habits; instead, we seize the moment and have a blast. Then make it a tradition, so you help her grow wiser while she helps you grow younger. And well, while that's not the point, I'd say that if it is in her, this tradition is all she'll need to love reading. If I am 1% right about the above, I would say that it's never too early. Focus on having fun, so select your material wisely (don't start with Ulysses or The Iliad...). ",

There's something nice about the cadence of mom or dad's voice, sharing words in a friendly way, that gets the reading habit started.  And, of course, if it's a picture book, you're turning the pictures and pointing to items of interest. Some of that will register at a very tiny age. Starting now is just fine. Both of you will be surprised and delighted as comprehension starts to click in during the months ahead. Some favorites in our house were Good Night, Gorilla, as well as Counting Crocodiles and Sheep in a Jeep.  But in a pinch, almost anything will work. I made a go of the  Gettysburg Address once. You can even read your boss's emails, which --  if you get the tone just right -- will leave both of you howling with  laughter. Be warned: your kids may want to hear the same story 30x or more. ",

With my little munchkin I started reading to her starting from when she was a month old. And not to forget reading to the baby when you are pregnant. The more you talk or speak to the baby when you are expecting them, the faster they recognise your voice when born. The familiar voice they heard in the womb soothes the new born and makes them feel better. My little one is hardly 16 months now and absolutely loves books and enjoys being read to. It is such a positive distraction from the tech savy world around them. I would happily read to her the whole day rather than let her watch TV or play on the mobile phones. Reading to babies is a great way to introduce them to the world of books and inculcate in them a love for reading. Also it helps you form a special bond with the little ones. One of my greatest pleasures as a mother is to see my baby turn pages of just any book she can lay her hands on. And oh. Yeah.. Be prepared for a lot of pulling and tearing of the pages. Go for board books till they learn that books shouldn't be torn. ",

Kids in general love listening to stories. Once they get hooked to stories, start reading out from books. Chance are, they will ask you to repeat their favorite stories many times.T Be patient. Once they are older, this will make them want to read the stories on their own. And you will have a child who's proficient in the language. If you belong to a place more than one language is spoken/studied, read out stories in both the languages. Good luck!  Be your own sunshine and choose to be happy! UK ",

At first you are probably just going to be showing them the book instead of \"reading\" but it paves the way.  When they get older you can read more interesting and challenging books.  When they are old enough, take them to the library and have them help choose books to read. Get stacks of books and if you get a dud, you don't need to read it. I always liked to ask questions about the story or comment on it.  I think it is good to keep it up even after they can read on their own. But by the time they are 8 or 9 or so the window starts to close. They read faster on their own than you can speak so they are off and running on their own. Some books you may read many many many times. In fact some I read so often and in a state of sleep deprivation that I found myself having completed reading it and having no memory of even turning the pages.  Enjoy it while you can and keep it fun and happy. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think it would hurt to start at the most early stages of life. I want to tell you somethings about the Islamic child development practices. It may not explain anything for certain but it gives you something to ponder upon. When a child is born, on the third day after their birth, a revered person or the father holds the kid and recite in their right ear the call to prayer (Athan), then to their left ear the start to prayer (Iqama). These are words attesting the concept of Islam, that is there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger. This also happens to be the same thing a child hears (even if they don't understand it) at least five times a day. The outcome: these words usually end up as the first words a child learns and thus imprinted on their minds forever. This is to give you an insight on how reading to a child at an early age gives a head start and becomes an advantage. The main derivative is the recitation of the Qur'an at the earliest to the child. Thus in the manner now being exemplified, you have Muslim children memorizing the whole 114 chapters of the Holy Qur'an by heart in as little as 7 years old. One can say that it is just specific to the Holy book but you should get the point. Start now and help give this world one more bright future through your child. ",

First Book of Sushi - has bright red and black pictures with fun rhyming words, even better if you actually eat the stuff with your kid; 2.  Moo, Baa, Laa Laa Laa.  This is a crowd-pleaser up into the 3-4 year old group.  3.  Hungry Caterpillar.   They won't pay attention much.  They'll try to chew on the book.

When I would stop reading, he would crawl over to me and stare at me or pat the book. He was actually listening and enjoying the book even though he wasn't looking at it. My sons are now 10 and 12 and both avid readers. I contribute that to the fact that 1.) We started reading to them early 2.) We surrounded them with plenty of books to choose from and didn't freak out when the pages were torn (after all, a pristine book is an unread book) 3.)We made sure that they saw us reading for fun as well, be it a magazine or book.

Even letting the child simply handle the books and gain a sense that books are for them is valuable. Try to make book time as entertaining as you can. Use funny voices and expressive face gestures that will keep them engaged. For babies consider getting books that have tactile aspects as well. Small children love feeling different textures. My young children also loved books that had music at a touch of a button.

When he was a bit older still, I'd use my finger to emphasize that the sounds were coming from the words, and point out the occasional easy word that repeated throughout the book. I don't know if this happens for all kids but at some point our boy started rejecting books and we just let him. It lasted about a month, (probably) when he realized books weren't something we were pushing on him. At 6, he's a avid reader. ",

Even if it seems like you're reading to the air, your baby can hear everything you are saying. Over time, their mind will make sense of what you're saying. Before you know it, seriously, your baby will understand everything you're saying. About six months later, you will hear your baby's first words. Language learning works like this: Listen, Speak/Read, Write. Understanding comes way before speaking. But you don't need to be able to speak a word to be able to read it. You just need to be able to understand it. An example being: diaphragm. I knew this word before I knew how to say it. I knew what it meant and by seeing it, I knew what it was. But it was a while before I could pronounce it correctly. That and Hermoine Granger. ;p ",

That is the first stage. If you can keep her interest then you will explain things on the picture and keep repeating funny sounds. Eventually you will take it a step further and explain simple story lines. You can improve and build the attention span with the same book again and again. Kids just love the familiar. Once she talks, she will tell her own story. Don't correct her unless she asks for it. The story itself is of secondary importance. The illustrations and her imagination is everything. I created my series for my grandchildren. They grew up with \"Oliver and Jumpy\" and were asking for more stories all the time. It was an event for them to see what Oliver was up to again!

Have books around for them to look at, whether there are words or just pictures. Kids put stuff together and it doesn't always have to be the symbols we know as letters. Start the habit, and give them the materials to keep it gong. ",
