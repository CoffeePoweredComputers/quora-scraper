            "answer_text": "Hi, Coaching is not essential or mandatory as you can prepare for upsc with best study material from the best upsc coaching center. My cousin has studied from the postal course from Rau\u2019s IAS and highly recommends the postal course of Rau\u2019s IAS. The following are the points which you should consider before you select the best upsc coaching center in India:- 1.Teacher & student Ratio:- The best teacher and student ratio should be 80:1; i.e. the students should be comfortable in asking their queries and on the other hand the teachers can teach properly and concentrate on each student. In today\u2019s era, there are many institutes which have 300-500 students in one batch and only have one faculty member to teach as well as solve their queries. Please don\u2019t choose such a coaching center because it will seem that you are watching a video rather than taking action in reality. 2.Compact & practical Study Material;- Next vital parameter is the study material; there are instances that you have to consult the notes and study materials which are provided to you by your coaching center. The study material should be updated and should have the latest answer writing format which would help the students to get accustomed to the new form of answering the questions. Opt for the coaching center which issues a special edition on current affairs which will boost your preparations and save your time. 3.Positive & fresh Ambience:- If you opt for the regular coaching then around 4- 5 hours, you will be there in the coaching center, so it will matter how the environment of the institute is. It is recommended that the ambiance of the institute should be positive and motivational which would intricate you to focus and study hard. If the environment is not healthy and you are not comfortable, then there will be unnecessary hindrances in your preparations. 4.Experienced & pioneer faculty member:- Please do some research on the faculty members before joining the institute; you should join a coaching center which has experienced, motivational, and subject matter expert teacher. IAS examination is the mother of all exams, so to study for this exam, you have to study from experienced faculties who know the trick to teach the subjects properly and guide you with the changing trend of the syllabus as well. The teachers should follow the golden standards of teaching which help the student to comprehend each topic minutely. 5.Teaching Mediums:- Mostly IAS coaching centers teach in English, which is often a problem for Hindi speaking students or who are uncomfortable in studying in English. So it\u2019s better that you join an institute which teaches in both Hindi and English because it might happen that you might have problems in understanding any topic in English and you want an elaborate explanation in English and vice- versa. 6.Location:- Proximity is another factor which should be considered as while choosing the institute. An institute which has branches should be preferred so that you can choose the institute which is in your habitat area. It will reduce your traveling expenses as well as make sure that you reach your class on time. 7.Cost Effective:- Today there is an infinite number of its coaching centers around India, but please choose the institute which you can afford, unnecessarily don\u2019t invest a lot of money and make your mind occupied with unnecessary tensions. There are centers which have different packages for different courses which you think you should opt for. ",

            "answer_text": "It is possible to crack the UPSC Civil Services examination as well as get the top rank without a coaching institute. Still, if you ask some of the recent UPSC toppers, most of them would admit that they had joined one or the other IAS coaching institute. This is because it is often expedient to do the UPSC preparation by joining a coaching institute. Nevertheless, joining or not joining a coaching institute largely depends upon the preparation requirements of a particular candidate and a decision on this should be made only after being certain about the utility of coaching. What I mean is that you should first try to find out the set of the requirements for preparing for the UPSC examination. Thereafter, find out those features of preparation that are provided by a particular coaching institute. If you can fulfil all the requirements of UPSC preparation on your own then you will not need a coaching institute. However, if there are some parts of preparation that you cannot manage on your own and they are provided by a particular coaching institute then it would be wise to complement your preparation by joining a coaching institute. The bottom line is that in order to crack this examination you must fulfill all the requirements of UPSC preparation with or without the help of a coaching institute. Now, let us list some important elements that are required as part of serious preparation for the Civil Services examination. The first requirement is the study material. If you look at the syllabus of the UPSC, then you will find the word \u2018etcetera\u2019 at various places. Interpretation of this word at various places needs the expert analysis of previous years\u2019 questions papers to understand the area of study actually prescribed by the UPSC and to be covered by an aspirant. In a good coaching institute, normally there is a team dedicated to demystify such elements and prescribe the true nature of the syllabus. They also have dedicated teams working towards producing study materials which are closely in accordance with the prescribed syllabus of the UPSC. Such exercise normally takes a long time and doing it alone would amount to diverting a lot of precious time which could have been otherwise utilized in actual learning. Suppose you have managed to collect the relevant study material on your own, then the next requirement would be to understand whatever is being read. As you may have noticed, the UPSC syllabus, especially that of the General Studies, is very vast. Covering the syllabus of the General Studies would require you to first build a basic understanding of the various disciplines such as History, Geography, Indian Polity, Economics, etc. However, during your graduation, you normally specialize in one or a few subjects whereas for the General Studies of UPSC you will be required to have an in-depth understanding of many disciplines. A good coaching institute provides a set of faculty members who are experts in their respective academic disciplines and having access to them on a regular basis helps in quickly clearing the doubts that may arise in course of your preparation. The third important element of the Civil Services examination is a regular practice. The mock tests that are regularly conducted by good coaching institutes are quite instrumental in developing a sound retrieval method. Such mock tests cannot be done alone and in absence of regular mock tests, the chances of clearing the Preliminary examination may become dim. Similarly, for the Mains examination to regular writing practice is required and it becomes quite expedient to take the specialized help of a dedicated team as provided by a good coaching institute rather than doing it alone. In short, the realization of the nature of competition is very important for clearing the UPSC examination and a coaching institute provides good glimpses of such competition. Let me sum up by saying that it is for you to judiciously decide under the above guidance whether it is advantageous for you to join a coaching institute. In any case, your end should be cracking the UPSC examination and getting the top rank; joining or not joining a coaching institute should only be treated as a means to that end. Best of Luck!!!!!!!!! ",
