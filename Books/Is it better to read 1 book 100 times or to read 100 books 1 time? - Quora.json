            "answer_text": "I honestly don't know. Reading the same book again is like revisiting a friend. If the friend was annoying the first time, they might improve upon further acquaintance or they might worsen. If it is a well loved friend, than even after the 100th time, it will still be fun. But you also need to make new friends and bring some variety to your life. I also believe, it depends on who you are, in the way you select a book to read, and your preferences at the time. Personally, I have a sort of cycle, in which I'll read lots of new things and then revisit a well loved series, then back to trying new books. Some of my favourite books have been read more than 20 times, in the last decade.. In the end, it's all about finding your balance, and the answer is different for every one. ",

            "answer_text": "How a person can read same book for 100 times?  Please don't try it also , this will create disinterest on the topic.  It is OK that you read one book and in-between if you don't understand any topic or paragraph then you can repeat that portion only. In this way you will not need to read the same book again and again. So why to read only one book read different book this will improve your knowledge and you will come to know the different opinions and views. Happy learning. ",
