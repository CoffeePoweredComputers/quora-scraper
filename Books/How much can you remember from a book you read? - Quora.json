            "answer_text": "As a versatile and fast reader ever since the early 90's, I have found that the best way to remember what you have read is to practise a deliberate and disciplined reading ritual: Here's my reading ritual (condensed version), to serve two primary objectives, as far as I am concerned:  (1) gathering information;  (2) generating insights from (1);  1. PREPARING THE MIND:  First and foremost, learn and practise some simple relaxation sequences, with slow but deep diaphragmatic breathing routines, so as to help center your mind from distracting thoughts, but more importantly, to help create a resourceful and superior state of mind, with a physiologically relaxed body to go along with it. 2. BEGINNING WITH THE END IN MIND:  Decide on your ultimate application, and whether you want a global overview or detailed information from your reading, as well as how much time you are prepared to invest, as your decision will determine your reading pace. 3. VISUAL PACING:  Use a pen or pencil as a pacer, to control the visual sweep of the saccadic movement of your eyeballs, as attested by most fast readers. 4. ASKING QUESTIONS:  One quick way to achieve productive results in your reading navigation is constantly asking:  - what is the author talking about here?  - what is important and relevant here, in terms of my predefined objectives or desired outcomes?  This questioning initiative helps you to stay engaged with your reading material. 5. MAKING NOTES:  Don't hesitate to make Marginal Annotations, or intellectual graffiti as I like to call them sometimes, by making notes in the white spaces of text passages, with personal relevancy to call-to-action.  Always express them in terms of: A2T (Actions-to Take)/T2D (Things-to-Do)/Q2P (Questions-to-Ponder). 6. CONSOLIDATING:  Upon completion of your reading endeavour:  Recap and Summarise, preferably with an idea map or cluster diagram or graphic organiser, so as to consolidate and synthesise quickly what you have just read. 7. RELEVANCY TO ACTION:  In conjunction with 5):  Think and Reflect:  - Where do I go from here?  - What's(are) my Next Step(s)?  - How can I use these learning takeaways from my reading to add/compound/multiply value to my life/to my work/to my business/even to my client(s)? These tactical initiatives as outlined in (3)(4)(5)(6) and (7) make your reading pursuit more purposeful, meaningful and productive! More importantly, they keep you awake and alert, as you are physically engaged and intellectually alive with your reading navigation! A word of expert advice:  Read only what you need, so as to fulfill your ultimate application and time urgency.So, in a nut shell, you actually don't have to finish the whole book! It's also pertinent for me to point out that, the fire test of your personal or professional reading actually comes from what you eventually do with the ideas and insights generated from what you have read. Godspeed! Enjoy your reading and assimilation! [Note: For the extended version, please search the Quora archives.] ",
