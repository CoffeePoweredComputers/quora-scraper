            "answer_text": "Yes, but make sure to find someone who is well-versed in your genre. Below is a blog post I wrote in response to this question before: 1. Send it to beta readers Send it to at least 3 \u2013 5 readers, preferably more. The best beta reader you can get is a regular reader in your target audience, i.e. someone who you would want to buy the finalized novel when you eventually publish. Someone you don\u2019t know, and who would recommend it to their friends (who you also do not know) if they liked it. 2. Listen carefully (and selectively) Your beta readers are bound to find minor typos, but will also have opinions on your work. Now, don\u2019t listen to everything they say, but if at least two readers point out the same thing, it might be worth rethinking it. 3. Repeat #1 & #2 until satisfied If you\u2019ve really narrowed down your target audience, this is when you no longer have several readers point out the same issue. (Mind you, it might of course be that they all get annoyed with the same thing, if that\u2019s the effect you are seeking!) 4. Have it professionally edited If you can afford it, having your manuscript professionally edited is definitely worth it. It will mean more rewrites, but it\u2019s all for the better. Make sure to find an editor who knows your genre \u2013 there is no use in having an expert on non-fiction comment on your romance novel! 5. Get a good cover In order for readers to pick up and begin to read your carefully crafted words, you need a good cover. Most important is that it doesn\u2019t look like someone photoshopped it at home. It should look like whoever made it knew what they were doing, otherwise your potential readers will think the inside is just as unprofessional. 6. Publish (and market) Now, you\u2019ve made sure your story is the best it can be, and you\u2019re ready to hit that Publish button. Keep in mind, though, that it\u2019s not enough to just put it out there and wait. If you want to stand out through the noise of the more than a million titles that are published each year, you need to take on some clever marketing strategies. But that's for another answer  So you\u2019re done with your 1st draft and plan to self publish \u2013 what now ",

            "answer_text": "Hiring out for something like a cover design makes sense since you\u2019re no pro at design, but an editor seems unnecessary when you already consider yourself a wordsmith. You\u2019re basically a jack of all trades at this point, so why hire an editor? You might as well save some money and count on your own editing, right? Wrong. In fact, not hiring an editor is one of the biggest mistakes a self-published author could make. No matter your style of writing, you should plan on having an editor before releasing your work. A few editing mistakes can ruin the reading experience for future fans, and waste all the time and money you spent on promotion and design. Readers can mistake editing mistakes as a lack of care for the piece, and you can miss out on a crucial edit to make your piece meaningful to the public. And repeated typos and discredit your skills as a writer. On the other hand, there are many perks to bringing on an editor: You\u2019ll receive editorial education working one-on-one with an editor.2. An editor can give an outsiders perspective so you can be sure that concepts that may be clear in your head are coming through in you work. 3. Any work that contains a story should follow a narrative arc. An editor can help you build your story arc in a way that audiences will find compelling. 4. An editor will help you learn how to improve your voice without changing the essence of it. 5. A well edited book makes the reading process a smooth and helps your readers trust you. Those perks sound pretty good, right? But now you\u2019re tasked with finding and hiring the best editor for your book, BecomeShakespeare publishing house is one of the best options to consider. ",
