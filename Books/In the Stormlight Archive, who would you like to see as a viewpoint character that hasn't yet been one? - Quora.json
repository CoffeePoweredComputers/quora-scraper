            "answer_text": "I think the easiest answer would be Wit/Hoid, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see his POV until the Dragonsteel series (or Stormlight Archive Era 2 at the earliest). Other than Hoid, I\u2019d also love to get some POVs from someone in Worldhopping groups/organizations on Roshar like Ghostbloods or the Seventeenth Shard. If we\u2019re talking about Rosharans specifically (no OB spoilers), I\u2019m most interested in getting POVs from Jasnah, Gavilar, some of the Heralds (like Nale or Taln) or spren like Syl, Stormfather or Nightwatcher. I think we\u2019re supposed to get Gavilar\u2019s POV in Book 5\u2019s Prologue, and one of Era 2\u2019s books is supposed to be centered around Jasnah\u2019s flashbacks. Apart from those characters, I\u2019m also curious about Axies the Collector. We got small interlude chapter from his POV in WoK and we saw him briefly in the Reshi islands in WoR, and I\u2019d love to have more of his POVs. Edit: I had forgotten that we already got Wit\u2019s POV in the Epilogues of WoK and WoR. ",
