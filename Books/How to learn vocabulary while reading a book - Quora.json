            "answer_text": "So what you can do is keep noting down difficult words on a piece of paper or as a note on your phone and look them up in the dictionary when you are done reading a few pages. Over time, you'll start guessing meanings of words that seem difficult and won't need to refer to a dictionary every time you come across a new word. You can also learn basics like neo means new, biblio is books, etc. It'll make it easier to guess meanings of words. Hope it helps! ",
