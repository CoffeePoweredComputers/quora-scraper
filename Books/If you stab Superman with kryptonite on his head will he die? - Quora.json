            "answer_text": "Like all things, it depends. If you somehow stabbed him and destroy his brainstem or something just as important, he would die pretty quickly. If you missed something vital to Superman\u2019s immediate survival and pull out your knife after stabbing, Superman\u2019s regeneration might come in and he could survive.  Kind of like how Zod was able to survive after destroying a part of his brain to get rid of a bomb. On the other hand, if you meant that if you stabbed Superman with Kryptonite on his head. As in Superman was somehow wearing a Kryptonite hat and then you stabbed him, it would be like the same scenario above. Except his chances of survival are much higher, as all he has to do is get rid of his kryptonite hat for him to start regenerating. -Nailuj ",

If the shard of kryptonite is sharp and hard enough, yes it could penetrate his greatly weakened skull and thus kill him. What amazes me is that no one has yet considered a kryptonite \"bullet\" aimed directly at Superman. ",
