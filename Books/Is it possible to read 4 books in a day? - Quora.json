            "answer_text": "Yes. When I was fifteen I often read 4 books in a day of binge reading, usually on a Saturday. I would often lie on our blue couch all day and read one book right after the other. I was a fast reader but even more than that, I was hungry for stories. A used paperback novel\u2014a science fiction book or a mystery or a western\u2014cost only about 10 cents in the 1960s. And the library was full of great books you could check out. Gradually, over the decades, I have cultivated the habit of providing my own stories. I now write more and read less than at any time in my life. Part of this is that I find myself to be somewhat less interested now in what other people have to say. My curiosity index has decreased. From about 20 on a scale of 10, I am now down to about a 12. I am not sure whether this is a normal part of the life process, or has to do with the particular times we are living through. Or maybe it\u2019s just me. ",

            "answer_text": "So you wanna make some record\u2026!? If yes then go ahead and yes it's quite possible to read 4 or you can even opt for 5 books a day! Reading a book is like talking to its author . We listen to his words . Then we talk to him and he listens in silence . When we read a book we are not merely conversing with the author . We participate in the life described in the book . If the book describes ancient Greece or Rome , we feel that we are in ancient Greece or Rome . The book transports us to the past , and we feel that the ancient heroes are our companions . If the book is a novel , we feel that the characters are our companions . While reading a novel we often identify ourselves with one of the characters, and share his or her experience . Sitting in our own room, we can travel round the world or journey into the past if we have book with us . Thus reading a book is often a journey through space and time . So I would say let's not get into number of books finished in a day rather enjoy each one of them! ",
