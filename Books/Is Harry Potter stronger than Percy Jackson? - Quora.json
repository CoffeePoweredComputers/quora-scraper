            "answer_text": "Percy is infinitely more powerful than Harry. \u201cAnd I charged. The first skeleton fired. Time slowed down. I won't say I could see the bullet, but I could feel it's path, the way I could feel water currents in the ocean. I deflected it off the edge of my blade and kept charging.\u201d- The Titan's Curse, pg 168 Rick Riordan. \u201cI used my wand this time, catching his blade in the crook of ivory and channeling a burst of magic straight up his arm. The air between us flashed and crackled. Camper boy stumbled back. Blue sparks of sorcery popped around him, as if my spell didn't know quite what to do with him.\u201d- The Son of Sobek, loc 149, Rick Riordan. \u201cJason called down another lightning strike, but Ephialtes caught it on his spear and deflected the blast, melting a life sized plastic cow.\u201d- The Mark of Athena, pg 527, Rick Riordan. In the first quote, Percy deflected a bullet. Using in canon values, the bullet would move at ~759 m/s. If Percy was 2 meters away, he would have around 0.001 seconds to react. In the second quote, Carter Kane uses a spell on Percy, and it does nothing. In the third quote, a giant that was not noted to be faster than Percy and Jason deflected lightning. Since it said he caught it, we an assume that Ephialtes moved AFTER the lightning started moving. Percy scales to Jason, who survived more energy than a Tomahawk middle with a conventional warhead. \u201cThe explosion was hotter than the giant's breath, blinding Jason with golden light. The force knocked him off his feet and squeezed the breath out of him. When he regained focus, he was sitting at the rim of a crater. Enceladus stood at the other side, staggering and confused. The javelin's destruction had released so much energy, it had blasted a perfect cone-shaped pit 30 feet deep, fusing the dirt and rock into a slick glassy substance.\u201d- The Lost Hero, pg 463, Rick Riordan. Percy and Jason are rough physical equals. Jason has lightning timing. \u201cJason swung at the first spirit. His blade passed through it, and the creature\u2019s smokey form disintigrated. The other let loose a bolt of lightning, but Jason\u2019s blade absorbed the charge.\u201d- The Lost Hero, pg 23, Rick Riordan. Jason had just cut down another spirit, so he would have to move AFTER the second spirit shot the lightning bolt. At a high end distance, the spirit would be ~21 meters away. It was likely, close, but whatever. Lightning travels at 89408 meters per second on average. 21/89408 is 0.0002 seconds. Jason had that much time to react. Again, this is likely a low end, and the spirits, were likely closer to him. Percy kept up with Jason in a sword fight when he was not cursed or waterboosted. And Percy and Jason have mountain level strength. \u201cBefore they could get very far, Enceladus slammed his spear against the ground. The entire mountain shook.\u201d- The Lost Hero, pg 452, Rick Riordan. Jason raised his javelin to block the giant's next strike-a big mistake. Don't fight force with force, a voice chided him-the wolf Lupa, who'd told him that long ago. He managed to deflect the spear, but it grazed his shoulder, and his arm went numb.\u201d-The Lost Hero, pg 461, Rick Riordan. And one more feat for Percy. \u201cI met Kronos\u2019s first strike with Riptide. The impact shook the entire bridge.\u201d That was the Williamsburg bridge, which is over a kilometer long. So we can see from these quotes that Percy is much stronger and faster than Harry, in addition to being magic resistant. Therefore, Percy can dodge the spells and punch Harry in the face, breaking his neck. Or Percy can cleave him in half. Meanwhile, Harry's spell hit Percy harmlessly, and he can't do anything about it. And before you say \u201cmuh sword of Gryffindor,\u201d Harry has zero skill with a sword. He can barely swing it. So, in conclusion, Percy stomps with minimal use of powers. And if Harry gets here Hallows, Percy gets the Curse of Achilles and the Nemian lion cloak, making him completely invincible, as well as the Legion Eagle staff, which shoots lightning. Oh, and he can host and Egyptian goddess, which enhances his strength even further, and gives him a combat avatar. Percy is stronger and faster than Harry physically, and is more powerful. Harry cannot compare to Percy. ",

            "answer_text": "Powerful? Not even close. Stronger? Don't even think about it. If I have to compare a character from historical stories with percy Jackson, HERCULES would cross my mind every now and then. And with all the feats that he has achieved all these years, he is basically a LEGEND that Rick wanted to create. If I compare only the PJO percy version and Harry from Deathly hallows 2 even then Percy has more impressive FEATS. I like Harry potter series not because of the world that they were built on, but the way their Characters developed and how Rowling connected the dots and dashes. Other than that, it's not an adventurous one, except it only reminds me of the Boarding schools that I studied on. I might get hate or Backlash for this one, the books are more related to feminine stuffs. Let me explain- Battles- I'm sorry I don't think the last conflicts in Deathly Hallows 2 is fit to be called as Battle. There isn't one in this universe. And what do they even learn in the Dark arts classes, if Harry pointed his direction to other teachers for help to defend against dark creatures? On the other hand, The battle in the Manhattan's of the Last olympian was terrifying, let alone a drakon as huge as a school bus. And let's face it, Wizards and witches weren't training for a war. But demigods are, practicing harder and harder as though they are expecting a FIGHT anytime! The only time Harry got to leveled down the main villian Voldemort was because he was getting weak due to the destroyed Horcruxes. Now that AID could be related with Percy dipping himself in the River Styx, and Kronos was growing even more powerful as time went on. And let's face it Harry won't be mentally prepare for what he's about encounter. Whether its a death Battle in an arena or a battle like capture the flag in a Forest, Percy would come on top. A human favoring Harry would otherwise be kidding itself. And as I type it down, I'm beginning to think this isn't a fair Fight comparison. People asks this often because of the popularity that Harry Potter series has achieved so far. But deep down, this is like comparing Goku and Yamcha. Yup. Last point, Percy has deflected the lightning with his Riptide, has been blast on the chest with the lightning, has fought Ares when he was 12, has fought giants that are basically warriors, has caused Earthquakes, has killed loads of Monsters for breakfast, fell in to the depths of tartarus and came out alive. I don't know what worse thing could you do to that kid anymore. He adapts. He survives. He wins and most of all he is SASSY. GOOD DAY! ",
