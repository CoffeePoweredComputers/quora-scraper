            "answer_text": "An excellent question that many people should ask more often but didn\u2019t. America was often referred to as a mixing pot but not all mixings would turn into a good stew or delicious salad. Bad neighbors could be that particular spoiler for the perfect sanctuary. Real estate is about location, location, and location. Good fences made good neighbors can only go so far when sometimes moats and swamp can\u2019t stop the intrusion of hatred. Then what when you already own the home and moving is the only alternative. How do you define bad neighbors? Bad as those in Breaking Bad whose house became a Met Lab? A* holes kept throwing cigarette ashes over the fence? Nosy? Nudity as those who love to roam around in birthday suits? Someone who only takes care of the yard only when grasses are kneehigh? One who are hoarders of trashy items? Religious freaks who had a cross on the roof? Some of these can be spotted and other hints could be more subtle. Although many realtors claim they are THE Neighborhood Experts. Information about the neighborhood could be a tongue-tied issue in the USA. Neighborhood definition has been clouded in the USA with laws about Steering and Block Bustering for instances. Steering is driving potential buyers toward or away from a certain neighborhood and Block Bustering is about scaring people to sell using race as a tactic. Discrimination is another big no-no issue for realtors to speak freely. To begin with, I like to point out the obvious when showing a house: lawns and no deferred maintenance such as peeling paints and messy front lawns. Toys strewn around are dead giveaways about \u201cchildren noises\u201d. Gym equipment and BBQ by the front door are signs of hillbillies and muscle flashers. Nosy neighbors would show their inquisitive nature through behind the curtain peeks. Some neighbors need no mentioning when national or cultural pride were fully on display with their castles. Have you ever seen \u201cMy Big Fat Greek Wedding\u201d? It could make you shuttered just thinking about living next door to Greek Architecture fanatics? How about those love to flaunt their wealth? Arcadia, California was once a lovely town with tasty lovely houses on large manicured yards now lined with gigantic houses. Many houses were sold to people who could care less about nostalgic and historical significants. I often feel sad but helpless when little charming houses were overshadowed by these look-alike monsters. The best caveat I like to mention is the out of control animal lovers and breeders. That whinny sounds from puppies/kittens could easily drive anybody up the walls especially during hot summer nights when windows were wide opened. The lady across the street from us is a cat lover and her house is filled with all sorts of stray cats. Be prepared for repeated episodes of \u201cCats on the hot tin roofs\u201d and I can guarantee you it wouldn\u2019t be melodies like Memory. Additionally, you need to beware of the farmers in the city if you don\u2019t want to be woken up every morning by a rooster. Don\u2019t want to be sexist but hens also cooed after laying eggs. Then the guy a few doors down loves homing pigeons and those cooing moans were hard to ignore. So far, I have mentioned neighbors you can spot with your eyes and ears. My next suggestion is to put your nose not to the grinder but just flair up. Pot smoking is legal now but the smell is offensive to those virgin noses. The sensitive smell is easiest to detect walking through side fences and the backyard for those lingering scents. The smells from Kimchi or Curly are next on the list as well as some of those cultural related issues. Other than Nosey Nancy and Chatty Kathy who are borderline bearable, the number one are those party lovers who can practically put the entire neighborhood on edge. I\u2019m talking about loud music that you can\u2019t do anything about but move. I have once sold a house not knowing my client has a pet-peeve against loud music and parties. Found the house in the suburb with a large one-acre lot in a Cul-de-sac filled with fruit trees and a lovely cottage. I got a call from them a few months later that they wanted to sell. Turned out that their Hispanic neighbor has a huge family and Mariachi Music was blaring with family gatherings every weekend when my clients wanted most was relaxing with peace and quiet. Similar situation with the clients who felt violated by backyard karaoke parties held by their Asian neighbor. Other potential issues I love pointing out are schools, colleges, and daycare centers. The impact of traffic in and out of the neighborhood would make these public structures bad neighbors; let alone high schools and colleges that have football or band practices with glaring lights. Walk to school may be beneficial to those with young kids but will definitely make you start your days cussing. Should I say more? ",

            "answer_text": "First looks can be very deceiving. Never base your opinion on the first thing you see. There is a house behind mine that looks as though it\u2019s falling down. It hasn\u2019t been painted in 30 yrs, the wood siding is literally rotting in places, some of the windows looks to be falling right out of the walls and the house appears to have shifted on it\u2019s foundation. It \u201clooks\u201d like a disaster waiting to happen. The grass was always allowed to grow so tall, it took a small tractor to knock it down. This was in no way representative of the inside of that house, nor it\u2019s residents. The man worked like he had a steam engine driving him and the woman was disabled with seizures and other physical disabilities. She is the reason the man worked so hard, he had 3 jobs and spent most of his time away from home just trying to pay the bills. They were renting this house and by no means did they have much. They had a single vehicle that was as run down as the house they lived in but it got the Mr from home to work and back again every day. They were the sweetest couple and Mr would literally give you the shirt off of his back. We had spent a day of non-stop work in our yard one day. Mowing, weed whipping, tilling flower beds and a garden spot. It was hot, we were tired and had stopped long enough to talk about what to have for dinner. At that moment, Mr came over with a paper plate filled with food from the BBQ. There were a couple of burgers, hot dogs, chicken and a few sausages. He plopped them on our patio table and said \u201cWe saw you working real hard today and figured you didn\u2019t have time to stop and eat. We have more than enough and just knew you two would be hungry!\u201d Before we could object, he was back home. We had a literal feast that night. I whipped up some pasta salad and a tossed salad to go with the meats and we never did get back to the yard work. Our bellies full, we just wanted a shower and sleep. The following weekend, we treated them to some of our own BBQ and took over some baby back ribs, potato salad, pasta salad and grilled corn on the cob. They were both overcome with emotion and told us that none of the neighbors had ever done this for them before. I couldn\u2019t believe it! I saw this man giving to his neighbors all of the time! How could they not repay his kindness? When I really thought about it though, one incident came to mind\u2026 My husband used to walk around the neighborhood in winter with his snowblower and help out any neighbor he saw shoveling or doing the whole driveway of a neighbor he knew was elderly or disabled in some way and couldn\u2019t do for themselves. He loved being out in the snow and didn\u2019t mind helping out where he could. One day after a pretty heavy snow, my husband was in the garage doing maintenance on the snowblower because he knew it was going to take a beating that day. The phone rang and I answered with a cheery \u201cHello! You\u2019ve got the Girardi home!\u201d The noise from the other end made me yank the phone away from my ear! It was one of our \u201cable\u201d neighbors. One who had long stopped shoveling his drive because he knew my husband would be by. He called to tell us that \u201cHe needed to get into town to the grocery store and where is your husband? Why hasn\u2019t he done my drive yet?\u201d And on and on he went\u2026 I tried to explain but he wasn\u2019t having it. He slammed the phone down and marched right over to our garage, demanding that my husband clear his drive immediately! I happened to be standing in the garage when he came over and after his tirade I asked him \u201cDo you need to sit down? Are you out of breath from the walk over? Do you have a heart condition?\u201d He waved me off and said \u201cNO! What makes you think I\u2019m some sort of invalid?\u201d I said \u201cWell, my husband has been clearing your drive for a few years now with no expectation of compensation nor recompense of any kind, I never see you out there even attempting to clear it yourself, you just rely on my husband\u2019s good will and NOW you THINK you can come to MY HOME and make demands? Let\u2019s make a deal, you pay my husband for all of the times he has cleared your drive and all future clearings at $40 per and you can rant all you want about a service you are PAYING for. If you don\u2019t want to pay, then get OUT of our garage, OFF our property and make other arrangements to clear your driveway because my husband WILL NOT be spreading his good will anywhere NEAR your home again!\u201d This was a neighbor who had every toy you could imagine but the one thing he could never afford to buy was a snowblower. Huh, imagine that. Unless there are obvious code violations such as a yard full of garbage or they are standing on their front lawn giving you the finger as you go by, you really can\u2019t know what they will be like. There\u2019s also the possibility that they may take to you and no one else in the neighborhood. Be kind, be courteous to all and you just might have someone deliver you an amazing plate of BBQ after working all day. Some people just react to the world around them with what they are given. Others demand much of others and never give in return. Neighborhoods are a crap shoot, you never know which ones are steaming piles of dung until you sit down. ",
