            "answer_text": "I think it doesn't, because you can do the double slit experiment with a single-photon source and detector - and if you want entangled photons usually you must do something on purpose (say Spontaneous parametric down-conversion), photons don't interact with each other directly so entanglement can't happen on accident without external help.   P.S. Single-photon interference is weird, huh? ",
