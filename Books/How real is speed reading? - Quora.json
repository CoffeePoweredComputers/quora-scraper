            "answer_text": "Real enough. I took a speed reading course some 35 or so years ago and at the end I was able to hit over 2000 WPM with about a 90% retention rate. This was in fiction. In in the denser non-fiction it was much slower but still faster than the average bear. Using all of the techniques the course taught, I could knock off the average paperback in one-half to three-quarters of an hour. However, like most other skills, you have to constantly practice. I originally took the course because I was in a job that required a lot of reading of (frankly) crap. But it was business and I had to keep up with the flow. and the memos written by my peers, research, and the volumes of words handed down from higher up the food chain. I now read mostly for relaxation and enjoyment. Spending a lazy two or three hours reading a new Science Fiction novel on a rainy afternoon is my ideas of heaven (especially if there are Dr Pepper and nachos). Diligently applying the necessary techniques and keeping tightly focused does not enjoyment make - neither does finishing your relaxing afternoon in 45 minutes. So I don\u2019t do it anymore and the skills have faded away. Good riddance! ",

            "answer_text": "How real is swimming or riding a bicycle? Very real. Many people can do it, yet some people can\u2019t. You can learn it but it takes time. You won\u2019t know how to do it just by reading one single book about it. You need to practice. You need to implement the things you learn. You need to constantly improve your techniques. Just because you know how to do it does not mean you will be the fastest at it right from the beginning. You need to practice over and over again. Oh you were asking about speed reading?Well, it\u2019s the same answer. ",
