            "answer_text": "I never thought I could ever sum up my life into a single book. I started thinking about this upon seeing this question. Can I really sum up my life in a book? If so, what would the title be? I kept wondering. A thought came to me, what has been my life so far? I looked into my childhood and my growing years. I looked into what has shaped my life, how it has shaped my life, how my mind has evolved, my ambitions and sorrows, and what is becoming of me as time goes by. Perhaps that would sum up my life, I thought. Recently I have published a book. It has been released only yesterday. I found my entire life journey up till now, when I think about all those things I have written there. I have described everything that really sums up my life in the book. Perhaps the title of that book is the right answer. This thought came to me while penning this reply. But the subject of the book is very different. It is biographical in nature, about someone else in its central theme. But embedded in the biographical writing, is my entire life story and everything that really sums up my life. So, if you ask me the title of the book, I have no other answer except for the title of this particular book, even though from that title one cannot even have a hint that is is about my life and my life journey. The title of that book, strangely is, \u201cThe Trail to Enlightenment: Life and Teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti\u201d. The book is in three volumes or three parts because of its bulk, covering a total of around 1450 pages. The volumes are subtitled: \u201cPart 1: The Hidden Side of Life\u201d \u201cPart 2: The Great Coming\u201d \u201cPart 3: The Key to Super Consciousness\u201d Yes, my entire life journey is there, embedded in the book in the three prologues and three epilogues, and also in the main chapters. It really tells my story too apart from the amazing story of Jiddu Krishnamurti. So that, I will say, would be the title of a single book that sums up my entire life. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cTuesdays with Morrie\u201d, by Mitch Albom. I have read many books throughout my life, but no books have given me better ideas and a better view about life than this one. Some of the quotes from this books may encourage you to give it a read: \u201cDeath ends a life, not a relationship.\u201d\u201cSo many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.\u201d\u201cThe truth is, once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\u201d\u201cDon't let go too soon, but don't hold on too long.\u201d\u201cWell, for one thing, the culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. We're teaching the wrong things. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it. Create your own. Most people can't do it.\u201dTo all the people out there, whoever is finding life to be harsh, finding difficulties to lead the life, this book is for all of YOU. ",
