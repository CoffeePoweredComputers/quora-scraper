            "answer_text": " Both languages nodejs and php has own advantages and benefits. But for a backend development you can go for Nodejs. Because Node.js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Some of its major business applications of node js development are listed below: - Easy to install and execute locally - Multiple-platform compatible written code, Rapid minimum viable product (MVP) delivery - Fast and comprises of speedy native bindings, High performance - Tight coupling between client and server, Compatible with open source packages and modules - Cheap hosting, Cloud scalability, Node.js lightweight services It is also better for you to learn Node Js from the Online Courses.

            "answer_text": "PHP was one of the top languages of an ancient Web era. Node.js is a representative of a younger web development generation. PHP is a good choice for a standardised solution such as a blog, news site, landing page or web portal. WordPress community has created thousands of customisable themes that open vast opportunities for web designers. Unlike PHP, Node.js is not a language, but a run time environment that uses JavaScript for the server-side application development. With Node.js, it\u2019s also easier to implement web services in which the server-side functions as a REST API that provides the connection between the client and a database. So, when choosing between Node.js and PHP, you should definitely consider what type of application you are going to build, what are the hosting requirements and what is the speed of development. If you are looking for a standardised solution with an extensive hosting support, you should consider using PHP. On the other hand, Node.js is a better option for Real Time Applications and Single Page Applications ",
