            "answer_text": "Street photography is one of the challenging types of photography. It makes you think a lot about composition. The things that are happening on the streets are not under your control so you cannot direct your subjects. Everything happens in a flash so it gives you less time to react and unlike other genre if you miss the moment you cant come back again and get it right. The one genre where your GEAR does not really matter but pure SKILLS. Few tips i can think are I\u2019d prefer using a prime lens over a zoom one. The fixed focal length of prime lens makes you to think more about composition as you don\u2019t have option to zoom in or out. But Hey, you can still do that zoom part with your legs. 35mm on crop sensor and 50 mm on full frame would be good.Shoot at f/8 or more, as street photography is not always about BOKEH or shallow depth of field. Over the years I find using manual mode with Auto ISO is the best setting that works for me. You can quickly set aperture and shutter without worrying about ISO. I would not worry about my camera choosing high ISOs because the noises are not really annoying in the street photography, In fact i like noises it gives you the film look.Try using low shutter speed something around 1/25. i found it is really interesting, as the range is high enough to freeze the still people and low enough to cause motion blur of moving objects. Really gives some interesting shots.Don\u2019t always shoot in Black and white. Many people does this!Some basic composition techniques are.Contrast: Try adding contrasting parts in the image like old/young, rich/poor, black/white, motion/still, sit/stand.Reflection: Add reflection in the scene by shooing through a mirror or water.http://www.streetviewphotography.net/top-10-reflections/Minimalism: I found the following websitesMinimalism in Street Photography \u2013 Black and WhiteCollectionDramatic, minimalist street photography that captures the quieter side of TokyoJuxtaposition: use Juxtaposition in street photography.10 Tips How to Create Juxtaposition in Your PhotographyWorld Street Photography Awards 2016 - Juxtaposition 1Using lines:11 Ways To Skyrocket Your Street Photography Composition With LinesRule of thirdsStay safe and Happy clicking..

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019ve done any research at all on street photography, you\u2019ve probably already heard all the basics (Rule of Thirds, Leading Lines, etc.). So, I won\u2019t spend time boring you with another post about those. I\u2019ll try to take it one step further. I read somewhere once that good photographers know how to follow the technical rules of photography, but great photographers know how to break them. I think this is especially true when it comes to street photography. Why? Because you\u2019re capturing life \u2014 moving, living things. But you\u2019re doing so candidly instead of posed. Anything could happen. You have to be on your toes. And if you want to get shots that really stand out, you have to break the rules in just the right ways. You have to tell a story. Throw in a little chaos to make your audience do a double-take. Make it just imperfect enough that it captures in essence of the human condition without looking staged, but make it still look purposeful and artistic. Not an easy task at all. It\u2019s easier to show you what I\u2019m talking about rather than tell you.  In the raw version of this image, there was a lot of bustling about and the frozen-still little girl was a tiny object in the lower part of the frame. I cropped the image to focus on her because her expression captivated me during post-production in a way that I hadn\u2019t even noticed during the actual shoot. Photo taken by Brianna Langley, owned by TEAM. So, this photo is a perfect example of what I\u2019m talking about. It kind of follows the Rule of Thirds, but it starkly breaks another rule: The girl is facing the side of the frame that\u2019s closest to her instead of the side with the most space. It\u2019s jolting. But I did this for a reason. Partly because I wanted to show the man in the background busily going about his day, unnoticing of her little sad face. I think that tells a better story. But also partly because I want it to be jolting. I want you to take a second look.  This is one of my rare black and white shots, which I don\u2019t do very often. But the contrast of the light and shadows and the dark basket and white eggs begged for a more dramatic flare. So I made it black and white. Photo taken by Brianna Langley, owned by TEAM. This shot follows almost no technical rules. And that\u2019s intentional. If I had followed the Rule of Thirds, I would have lost this basket of eggs (which is my subject) amongst all the other basket of eggs surrounding it. So I chose to center it instead. There really isn\u2019t any Framing or Leading Lines here either \u2014 for me, the magic of this shot was always meant to be the rich contrast of textures. And in order to showcase those, I really had to keep it simple. By keeping it simple, the textures get to speak for themselves. Okay, let\u2019s have a look at one last picture.  Everything came together perfectly for this shot. Street photography is exhausting because it requires constant focus and observation. But getting to create mood and tell visual stories like this makes it all worth it. Photo taken by Brianna Langley, owned by TEAM. This shot seems like a mix of imperfections, technically speaking. It only sort of follows the Rule of Thirds, and the Framing seems bulky and botched. And yet, it perfectly captures the moment. The subject in the background is beautifully lit. Her expression captivates the imagination. Is the blurred man in the foreground holding the bottle, or is she? Now, you\u2019re looking even harder. I could have cropped the man out, but I love the way he frames her face and leads your eyes across the photo. It\u2019s perfectly imperfect. And more importantly, it portrays a mood and a story.

Situations happen and dissolve so quickly that a street photographer must learn to predict and 'see' the shot even before it happens, just as an baseball outfielder knows where the ball will be before it gets there.The photographer must know exactly what he or she is shooting and why. Not generally, like this looks like a good shot, but exactly. What is interesting and important.Then follow these three rules both in taking and editing the picture: Place the important thing(s) in important placesMaximize the impact of the important thingsMinimize the impact of unimportant things.If the photographer doesn't know why the photo is interesting and why it was taken and if all that information isn't in the photo, then the photo will fail.

Like the great photographer, Josef Koudelka used to take shots and then check according to his preferred \"Triangles Composition\" only. If it comes up as per it. He used to keep it or else dumps that photograph irrespective about what subject it is. But we amateurs are not so courageous enough to do the same. hahaha..!! But what i really meant to say, in the start of his career he faced the same problems but with his hard work and dedication towards his passion made him establish the quality, so later he easily anticipated the perfect composition within \"the decisive moment\". But still he re-checked his photographs to pick the perfect one. In short : Just shoot as much as you can, to master the art and to be on the safer side, cheat, yeah cheat. Whatever you want to shoot, take a bit wide angle shot of it according, so you can easily compose them as per you preferred composition.. Keep Shooting, Have fun..!! ",
