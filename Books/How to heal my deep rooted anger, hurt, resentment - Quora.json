            "answer_text": "The very first thing towards healing your anger is to find the very reason for it. There have to be something which is fixed in your subconscious mind that is affecting you. Can be related to your childhood. Someone has hurt you really bad. And though you moved away from that incident or person but you have not forgiven him and made peace with it. And so your mind is not at peace. Find it first. My girlfriend left me in 2011 suddenly because of some misunderstanding. I loved her a lot and tried my best to explain it to her, but she completely ignored me and that thing affected me deeply. I never had a closure on that. And somewhere in my subconscious mind it got fixed. Now I crave for love and acceptance of others to be happy. So the same thing is with you. Something in their that happened with you. Share it with your loved one/ones. Find that closure. Make peace with it. That\u2019s the way to heal yourself. I know it is difficult and sounds hectic. But trust me you don\u2019t want to carry this thing with you for 7\u20138 years or maybe your entire life. Lack of affordability of psychiatrists is major concern in today\u2019s India. ",
