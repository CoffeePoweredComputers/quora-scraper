            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve learned from a website called litopia that readers, agents, and publishers base 90% of their decisions about a book on the first few pages and on the last page. So, how you start your novel is very important. Within a few pages, a reader has to care about the protagonist and have a sense of the whats, wheres, whens, and hows of the world in which she lives. This all has to be conveyed while immersing the reader in descriptions which awaken their sense of touch, smell, and sight. The reader needs to be physically drawn into the scene. The first time I started my novel, I wrote it in third person omniscient - kind of like the narrator in Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, but I later learned that it is more fashionable and easier to hook your audience if you write in first-person. So I switched. I\u2019ve also been advised to avoid using a prologue because it tends to present an incomplete picture and a reader is more often hooked by jumping into the middle of the action and showing the story instead of telling it. A fight scene is a good way to dive right in. I have mixed feelings about this because I tend to get bored with writing that is all showing and no telling. It just strikes me as an inefficient way to convey information. It is like fleshy excess which slows things down for me when I want the bones of the story to come alive. At first, I followed this advice and started the story off with a fight, but the scene I wrote was rather contrived and it made the protagonist unsympathetic rather than making people want to identify with her. So, in my present version of the story, I ignored advice about avoiding a prologue and went ahead and wrote one to frame the story. I showed the protagonist in a sympathetic light and took my time to drop her into her first crisis. This may have been a mistake, but I\u2019ll find out soon enough. The crisis builds up slowly as the protagonist leaves home and has to face the world by herself. As she wanders through a strange world, she sees danger lurking around every corner and while trying to improve her situation, she falls into a dangerous trap. When it seems that she is saved, she falls deeper and deeper into the trap. Her attempts to climb out of the trap compose most of the story. I wrote 60,000 words and put them up on Amazon last summer but now, I\u2019ve extended the story to 120,000 words and changed the beginning from what I published last summer. There is definitely a learning curve associated with crafting stories. Book marketing is an entirely different learning curve.  ",

            "answer_text": "How does your novel start? Or, is the question: how should it start? Some general observations: Many famous authors say they don\u2019t pick the opening scene until the novel is finished. Hemingway said he revised the beginning 37 times. For my third book, Mary Carroll Moore, who wrote Your Book Starts Here, advised me to see where the status quo is about to change. It turned out it was on page 37. (That number again.) Four chapters of setting, backstory, and throat clearing had to go, or get chopped up and incorporated somewhere else. Lewis Campbell\u2019s well-written example here would be best to start with: \u201cShe noticed the book on the corner of the desk\u201d if that is what launches the plot.At pitch conferences with top agents, I see they look at just the first paragraph or two. They get a thousand queries a week and have to decide very fast. Unfortunately, that means that the wonderful twist or inciting incident, the change from normal, must come early. Or must be hinted at or foreshadowed. Sadly, they just won\u2019t get there if the start is all description and back story.There are genre conventions, though Some genres, like mysteries, do well with prologues. But here\u2019s the thing: Is it really a prologue or is it setting or backstory? It must be a scene. It must be near or at the crisis/climax. I understand that sci-fi and fantasy often need to do serious world-building right up front. As a reader and writer of mysteries, I want a fragment of a critical scene right up front. Here\u2019s a rough draft of the opening of my new novel: \u201cGulls swirled around him, screeching and diving at his head. Their well-defended aerie had been breached by his fall from the cliff. Taro flailed at them. \u2018Leave me alone!\u2019 They flew off, regrouped, and resumed the attack. A wave crashing a few feet below scared them off. They would be back.\u201d",
