            "answer_text": "Maghoosh has reviews for several GRE preparation books. It has reviewed the Manhattan 5lb book too.Manhattan GRE 5 lb. Book of GRE Practice Problems, 2nd Edition (Instructional Guide Series) Book ReviewIn crux, it says that the book isn't good enough for verbal but quant is better. I don't know how much you've been scoring in your practice tests right now, which could've helped me to answer better. Even if you score >165 above in Quant, you still need to get atleast a 155 in verbal.I used Manhattan books in my preparation too, but I guess their best book for verbal is certainly their Reading Comprehension guide. Its Text completion and Sentence Equivalence guide is simply too hard especially in terms of vocabulary and I would not recommend using it. It would be better if you could take a diagnostic test (if you have the time) to first determine your weaker areas. If it is RC, you are in luck as the book I have mentioned is very good. In case it is TC or SE, you need to improve your vocabulary in addition to practicing more. Anyways for 320 above your best bet would be to score a 160 in verbal which is not very difficult if you can ace RCs.Also before you purchase or refer to any other resources be sure to check maghoosh's book reviews. Also, in case you are scoring very less in verbal, start off from Barron's as it has relatively easier verbal questions. It will help you build a foundation so that you can move on to tougher problems. For quant I recommend using Barron's books entirely, their questions were very similar to the difficulty of the questions I saw in the ETS official guide and in the actual test too.More importantly, do not forget to solve problems from the ETS official guide and the ETS verbal guide. No resource can give you a better picture of the questions you would face in the actual test. Furthermore, doing several practice tests would definitely contribute a +2,+3 to your score. P.S.
