            "answer_text": "Please don't read classics just to look smart. You can accomplish that in so many other ways even if you truly dislike reading.  That being said:  Don't rely on what your teachers, your parents, and your friends have told you to read.   Start with shorter books, more modern books, generally, before you read longer books with outdated language. Then, try to familiarize yourself with old expressions and look up challenging vocabulary you come across often. It is always a matter of preference: choose books that engage you. That will vary from person to person, but for most, I don't think that would be English novels by people such as Jane Austen and the Bront\u00eb sisters. I personally really like Wuthering Heights, but that era of English novels really should be avoided by people who don't like reading to begin with. I would recommend American authors in general, for their accessible diction. I could see most people reading some Fitzgerald, Steinbeck, Twain, and Hemingway and liking it. Short stories, Grimms fairy tales, and myths are also great. Once you read myths and familiarize yourself with your chosen pantheon(s), you can read epic poems, which are much longer. Shakespeare would be good for someone who likes theater. George Orwell is good, as is Brave New World by Aldous Huxley for those who like dystopias. Just look around at all the different genres considered classic and read from those that suit you best.  Never force yourself to read a book you don't like no matter the era in which it was written. You can revisit these books, but there are so many more you can read. Try them first. I recommend going to the library if you do not want to waste money on books you won't read. Also, many are available as PDFs online. Try not to collect books you won't read, especially when starting out. Thanks for reading.  ",

            "answer_text": "I always like to recommend starting by reading the Bible and Shakespeare. You'll be amazed at how many more little events happen in books that are actually references to the Bible or to a Shakespeare play. While the Bible is dull, repetitive, contradictory, and was written by many people which resulted in inconsistent writing styles, a lot of classics are based on Biblical stories, so it's good to be able to have the text as a reference. Shakespeare is great to read, though you may find his early works to be a lot more crude and a little less developed than his later works. Still, with his inventive writing style he was hugely influential on writers who came after.  The reason I recommend those two is that I personally have found they're probably the two most commonly referenced sources in literature, so for the sake of having at least a little bit of a background in what's going on in a lot of classics, I think those two are very helpful. Otherwise, hile this may be overwhelming because it's a 300 page+ PDF, I'm a big fan of Penguin's classics list, and they have a PDF of their entire catalog here, ordered by name of author, and it lists all of the books they have by that author: http://www.penguin.com/static/pages/classics/penguinclassics-backlist-09.pdf  ",
