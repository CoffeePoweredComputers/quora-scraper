            "answer_text": "I think it really depends on what you enjoy in watching a movie. Would you watch Star Wars in the order of the episodes or in the order they were made and released? Would you watch Rogue One before watching Episode IV: A New Hope? If you haven\u2019t seen any of them and enjoy doing something different watch them in a random order and have fun putting the pieces together as you watch them. You do that a little bit by watching the in the order released. But really, there is no wrong way of watching them since they all fantastic and fun. And when you rewatch them (because you know you will) you can watch them in a different order. Enjoy!! ",
