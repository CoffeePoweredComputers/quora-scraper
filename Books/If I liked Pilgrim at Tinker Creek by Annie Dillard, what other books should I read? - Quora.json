            "answer_text": "If you liked Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, you might also love her collection of essays, Teaching a Stone to Talk.  She's just such a brilliant writer. In terms of books by other authors, you might check out: The Snow Leopard by Peter MatthiessenA Language Older Than Words by Derrick JensenThe Golden Notebook by Doris Lessing All three of those feature wonderful narratives and keen observations. You'll learn something new about the natural world from the first two, and Lessing made me gasp at her ability to express the inner world of her characters. ",
