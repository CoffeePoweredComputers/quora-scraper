            "answer_text": "I have given away tens of thousands of ebooks since 1997 and never had a complaint. I advertise them with the phrase, FREE, and PRICELESS which defines the state of quality I intend to deliver. But maybe you\u2019re talking about \u201cfree\u201d ebooks that demand your email address? I consider the value of your email address to be a minimum of $99.72. I personally advise the groups I own to NEVER pay for a \u201cfree\u201d product with their email address. They already HAVE your email address; what they are trying to buy is YOUR PERMISSION to let them sell their products and services to you. I don\u2019t even keep an email address of people asking for my help. One lady last week took over 30 hours of my time before I finally saved her email address, and that is not on a mailing list. ",

My logic is that all my life I have discovered authors for free at libraries, so why shouldn't someone get to try my books for free? I know many talented authors who offer their first book free for the same reason. As to whether the books are worth it, that depends on your personal tastes and the particular author. And that has nothing to do with price. ",
