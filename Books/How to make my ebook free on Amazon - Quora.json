            "answer_text": "The price matching approach from external sources doesn\u2019t always work. I had one book priced matched within 24 hours, and yet another that took nearly a year and a half with no success. So below is what I have learnt so far. First, decide on what you really wish to achieve. Amazon will be receptive to your request, but they don\u2019t like the yo-yo price game. If you want your book free, it\u2019s usually best left as free, and not change it back and forward. They might refuse to set your book back to normal price once you set it to free. It has happened before.Second, the quickest way to get your book price matched to free is just to email Amazon directly. Seriously, just email them a pleasantly worded email, requesting that they set the book to free, and how it is going to boost your series\u2019 sales. Amazon likes to make money, not give away free books.However, before you email Amazon, send your book to Draft2Digital (https://www.draft2digital.com/) Yes, you can send it to Smashwords if you are not in a hurry and you enjoy waiting, but Draft2Digital is reliable and responsive. They will push your book out almost immediately. You have to wait until iBooks loads your book onto their system, and sometimes they can take their time. If you make sure that you tick the option to send the book to iBooks, your book will be set to free on all the markets that Amazon competes in, so you can use the links to make your request. You will need to collect a set of links for all these markets because Amazon will only set you book free on the markets that it knows about. Therefore, you have to tell them about the places where the books is if you want your book freely available around the world. It\u2019s not that easy to get the URLs for iBooks so you are welcome to use my list of links and simply replace the \u2018id828736791\u2019 part with your own books id. If you use Draft2Digital, they will give you this information on your books page, just not all the worldwide links. Simply get the book\u2019s id from the US link, and replace it on my list of URLs.    Canada: https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/id828736791   Germany: https://itunes.apple.com/de/book/id828736791   Brazil: https://itunes.apple.com/br/book/id828736791   \u200bFrance: https://itunes.apple.com/fr/book/id828736791   Spain: https://itunes.apple.com/es/book/id828736791   Italy: https://itunes.apple.com/it/book/id828736791   Netherlands: https://itunes.apple.com/nl/book/id828736791 \u200bJapan: https://itunes.apple.com/jp/book/id828736791\u200b   \u200bMexico: https://itunes.apple.com/mx/book/id828736791   Australia: https://itunes.apple.com/au/book/id828736791 I couldn\u2019t get a link for India at the time, but you can look it up yourself. So below is the proof on Amazon. It is now free on all markets. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.in/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.es/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.it/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00INBTJGE https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B00INBTJGE ",

            "answer_text": "I would agree with Eric Zar's comment and go with Smashwords. I currently have three perma-free books (that's what we call a permanently free book). I got them that way by going the Smashwords route. It's not easy, or at least wasn't in late-2013 when I first did it. I had to contact Amazon a bunch of times and I used a thread on Kboards for people trying to get Amazon to price match their book. None of those things worked. What did work was a promo that got me 20 sales one week. That must have kicked the Amazon algorithms into play and they noticed the book and scanned it or something and saw that it was being offered free on all the retailers but Amazon. So that's how Amazon price-matched my book to free. It was the first in a series so I did really well with Books 2 and 3...until I got some bad reviews on Book 1. That's the thing - perma-free books often get lots of 1-star reviews. I will say that some were warranted. So...try the Smashwords route, contact Amazon, and hope for the best. They're much more receptive to this now than they were two years ago. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There is another way. I always wondered why everybody has those complications to change the price of a book to $0. Now I know that I did the right thing to use the services of an aggregator to put my book on many ebook platforms and service them for me including promotions. I had the unique situation that I published 13 books and than another seven books in one go. I then made each book as a free download for a period of six weeks while I promoted it to get reviews. Once I have over 50 reviews, I tell my guys to make the book paid again and the next one in the series for free. This works beautifully and does not cost anything. I guess the aggregator has better connections to Amazon and all the other platforms! bedtimestory4you.com ",
