            "answer_text": "I agree with the prior answers. In the US accounting profession, not having passed the CPA exam is viewed as a negative compared to those who have. Of course, you can pass the exam and never get certified if you do not actually work as a public accountant (depends on state/chapter). Even in those circumstances, I would still recommend passing the exam and maybe augmenting your credentials with other certificates. The most recognized of the other certifications is the Certified Management Accountant (CMA). It is probably not as rigorous as the CPA for accounting, but includes topics not covered on the CPA. When I took the CMA many years ago it covered IT subjects, internal auditing, and budgeting, among other topics not covered on the CPA exam. You will have over the course of your carrier many opportunities to add other certifications. I suggest that your required continuing education be used to pursue other certification. This makes your CPE more valuable as you gain understanding of other areas and will be more interesting for you. There are many certifications out there covering areas such as turnaround management and finance (Certified Turnaround Professional and Certified Insolvency and Restructuring Advisor), forensic accounting (Certified Forensic Accountant) {the most interesting CPE I have taken}, and valuation (there are a number of these), to name my favorites. These other areas of study can be very valuable to you in public accounting or consulting. As you move forward in your career, specializing in areas such as these can make you more valuable to your firm and clients. ",

            "answer_text": "From what I\u2019ve been hearing during my studies and reading during my free time, the CPA is the most revered credential. The others can be add-ons to that, such as the CFE, CFF, CIA, CMA, etc. I hear that although these are also challenging to obtain, they are not as tough as the CPA exam. So the CPA being most desired makes sense. ",
