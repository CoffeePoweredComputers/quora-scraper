            "answer_text": "Okay, technically, you cannot self-publish (which is the only way a \u201c5-page book\u201d could get published) a 5-page print book. The minimum page count for KDP Print (Amazon) is 24 pages, and for IngramSpark is 18 pages. You certainly could self-publish a 5-page eBook, but why would you? Also technically, 5 pages does not a book make. Here are some parameters for you: Short-short stories are under 2,500 words.Short stories can range from 2,500 to 7,500 words.Novellettes are from 7,500 to 20,000 words.Novellas are from 20,000 to 50,000 words.Novels are from 70,000 to 90,000 words.The above is according to: Word Count and Story Length on BetterStoryTelling.net. This range varies greatly depending on the source. But none of them are 5 pages. WritersDigest states: \u201cThere are general guidelines for each literary category: Short stories range anywhere from 1,500 to 30,000 words; Novellas run from 30,000 to 50,000; Novels range from 55,000 to 300,000 words, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend aiming for the high end, as books the length of War & Peace aren\u2019t exactly the easiest to sell.\u201d Then you have flash fiction which can run from around 100 words up to about 500 or 1,000. Fewer words than that is considered micro-fiction. Notice the word BOOK is nowhere in there. You can find flash fiction collections for sale which contain dozens of stories and are most likely at least 50 pages in length. But how does knowing word count help you? Some people suggest that to figure out a page count based on word count, the industry standard is 250 words per page. That most likely refers to manuscript pages, not book pages. To determine those, you\u2019d need to know what size print book you\u2019ll be creating. To calculate the page count for a 5\u2033 \u00d7 8\u2033 book: 10 pt type \u2013 divide your word count by 40011 pt type \u2013 divide your word count by 35012 pt type \u2013 divide your word count by 300More information is provided in this article: Calculate book page count using word count - for book design If you have a 5-page story you would like to get out there, I suggest publishing it to a site like Medium or Wattpad or even Quora. Maybe you\u2019ll get feedback that will inspire you to write more, and you can publish something with more meat to it. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You can try to publish a 5-page book, but first you have to get through the hurdle of printing. You cannot print a 5-page book. The inside pages must be a minimum 4 pages, and then the next up is 8 pages. Then there\u2019s the 4 faces for the covers (outside front, inside front, inside back, and outside back). If you\u2019re okay with 3 blank pages, then you\u2019ll be fine. If not, you\u2019re going to have an almighty argument with your printer \u2014 and you won\u2019t win. After going through that hurdle, then you can properly publish the thing. And hopefully the content will be earth-shatteringly phenomenal to land the sales. ",

However, a few words of wisdom: Even if you describe the story as \u201cshort\u201d \u201cvery short\u201d \u201c5 pages\u201d - readers will get annoyed. I\u2019ve offered freebie 5\u201310 page shorts before and even though I say THIS IS 5 PAGES all over the place, they still get angry.You will likely need to offer it for free, because 99 cents is more common for longer works now.My advice - do a collection of various short stories and publish that, rather than one 5-page work.",
