            "answer_text": "I own an ASUS X555LJ since August 2015. It came with Intel i5\u20135200U, 2GB NVIDIA GeForce 920M, 8GB DDR3 1600MHz RAM, 1TB 5400RPM HDD, 1366x768 TFT LCD. It was priced at \u20b945,990 (bought cheaper). This was the best deal then within \u20b950,000. Performance fell in 1 year. Installed an SSD, and now its a breeze. Most mid-range laptops put in HDDs. No complaints there. My biggest issue is with the palm rest assembly. It\u2019s not very solid. Moreover, the keypad is not firmly attached to the base. It is riveted to the palm rest at. I had my keypad failing thrice. Replaced twice and just use an USB keyboard now. The rivets had to be broken and the replacement wasn\u2019t firm. The experience is gross.   The second issue is with the battery. Batteries on these laptops don\u2019t essentially stay long. Drainage was normal but mine got swollen since last year to the extent that it took away trackpad click. I removed it.  These two issues remove the main point of having a laptop. The rest of the hardware is fine. The performance is adequate and it doesn\u2019t heat much. It is still my primary computer but it no longer serves as a laptop. It directly runs from the plug point and I have a wireless keyboard, mouse always connected. They didn\u2019t really work on the body. Not to forget, spare parts aren\u2019t as available as for HP, Dell, etc. The keypad issue also occurred to a friend\u2019s ASUS laptop. The body isn\u2019t what you want. In addition, I\u2019ve handled a VivoBook and it felt a quality product. However, note that it is a premium series. So, as of now my impression of mid-range ASUS laptops isn\u2019t very nice. That\u2019s where it matters because prices are lower than a HP/Dell. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. They are not the best, as there are specialty venders that build their own systems that can arguably be \u201cbetter\u201d, but ASUS is a huge company with a reputation which means when your buying their product your also buying the brand itself. ASUS happens to be one of my favorites for ANYTHING because of their customer service and support. I have an old P6T-LE Mobo of theirs that they\u2019d still help me with, despite it being well past it\u2019s due date for shut down gaming wise. (mobo has since given up to the ghost now) Now, on that note, that particular P6T Mobo is an example of why ASUS isn\u2019t THE BEST, as it was plagued with several flaws for a few revisions of it that as far as I\u2019m aware, were never fully addressed. ASUS wifi systems also have a few kinks, despite being very effective. However, over all, their reliability is high, their price is good, and their support is one of the BEST. If you\u2019re looking into gaming, get something from ASUS offshoot for gamers - a ROG (Republic of Gamers). ROG systems are more adequately designed for gamers - usually has better gear, hardware and more efficient cooling. They\u2019re also a steal at times. An $800 ROG system will serve you well, even if the thing is barely upgradable. ",
