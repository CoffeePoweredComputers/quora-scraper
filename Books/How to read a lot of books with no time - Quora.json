            "answer_text": "Great question! Here\u2019s a few things I do to try to read more. Remove distractions, especially cell phones. Whenever I need to go somewhere or do something that\u2019s going to require a little waiting, instead of having my cell phone with me I take a book (or two) to read.Track your reading times. There\u2019s a cool app for the iPhone called \u201cTime\u201d where you can set the amount of time you\u2019d like to read each day (the average person can read about 30\u201340 pages per hour, by the way).If you\u2019re reading nonfiction, learn to ignore \u201cfluff.\u201d A lot of nonfiction books, especially \u201cbig idea\u201d books contain a ton of fluff, or anecdotes/supporting paragraphs. Much of this can be ignored.For nonfiction, don\u2019t read page to page. Read it like you would a textbook, first reading macro and then working your way to micro. Start by reading the introduction and table of contents. If there\u2019s chapter summaries, read those next. Many nonfiction books also organize the content like blogs, with various headers. Skimming these header titles and focusing on the paragraphs with the content you care about can help you move through a book quickly. Some of these are techniques speed readers use.Get rid of Netflix, Hulu and any other visual content medium that\u2019s taking your time away from reading. Not only will it save you money (that $12 can be put towards a new book), but you\u2019ll learn more faster.If focus is an issue, try reading multiple books at once. There\u2019s no rule that says you\u2019ve got to read a book cover-to-cover before starting on a new one.Remember: if you sleep 7 hours each day, that leaves you 17 hours in the day. 9 of those hours will go towards commute and work. 1 of those hours will be for feeding yourself. And 1 more can be for hygeine, showering, etc. That gives you 5 hours in the day to read. Good luck with reading! ",

            "answer_text": "I would start listening to books rather than reading them. Subscribe to audibles or any other website that provides you with audiobooks (I like audibles a lot and will tell you why in a second). Many lybraries nowadays allow you to download audiobooks and it\u2019s free. Why audiobooks? The reason why I use them it is because in audible (as opposed to other platforms) I can play the audio at a speed faster than the way kt was originally read so, if abook takes 9 hours to finish and you play it at 2x the speed, you\u2019ll finish it in 4.5 hours. That means that you can finish the average 9 hour book in a couple of days if you listen to it 2 hours a day. You can listen to it while driving or doing anything else that does not require intense brain activity. I bought some bluetooth, in ear, earbuds on Amazon and listen to audiobooks while running. Keeping my mind on the book makes me run longer. It may have a different effect for you but you could try. Playing the audio at 1.5x or 2x the original soeed is easy to do and it takes just a few minutes to get accustomed to it. Now, when I can dedicate 100% of my nrain to just listening, I play them at 3x. It sounds like chipmunks in the beginning but then you get used to it and when you play it back at 1.5x it sounds to you as it was being played in slow motion. I do not retain everything I listen to, unfortunately. But I have tested with plain reading and I am way slower and retain the same amount so I\u2019ve opted for audiobooks. This way I can read 50+ books per year and, if you think that to accomplish that you only need to read 1 book per week, you\u2019ll realize how doable that is. The great thing is that you can learn while doing other things your muscle memory is controlling. I don\u2019t know if this will work for you but give it a try and see if you like it. I was never much of a reader because I never seemed to make the time to read or when I had time I did not have my book on me. Hope it helps. ",
