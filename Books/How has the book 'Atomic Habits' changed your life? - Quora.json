            "answer_text": "It opened my eyes to the power of consistency and 1% improvements. I'm 28 years old and until 47 days ago I couldn't do a single pushup. I've tried in the past, I've been to the gym on and off and I've never been able to do a single push-up. I realized that I was focussing on the outcome rather than my process and thus began my journey. I started with knee push-ups and slowly made progress and around the 30day mark I was able to comfortably do 10 regular push-ups in a go. I was amazed, these things don't happen to me because I always give up at the first chance. It's all different now, I can finally see how gains as little as 1% makes a difference when repeated consistently. I built a habit of doing push-ups, showering, writing a journal and then reading a book before hitting the bed. As a kid I loved to read but as I got older and got a job I lost the habit. But now with this new ritual I've managed to finish 3 books in 45 days. That's three books more than last year. I highly recommend this book, it could be life altering if you read and introspect and experiment with the concepts. ",

Focus on your system instead.\u201d This book can totally change my view about system of doing any work. It totally explain how to make good habits in a easier way and make bad habits to the hardest one. Some of the principal of the book- 1. How tiny changes make a big difference. It's my favourite part because it explains about a very deep message.   2. How to make good habits obvious. 3. How to make good habits attractive, easy and satisfying. It also explain about how to reduce the affects of bad habits. At last I can enjoy the whole book and when I look the world through it learning I find a lot of difference in my view point. ",
