Take a few journalism classes to bring you up to speed on ethics, handling sources, editorial interactions, etc.  It sounds like you have the writing skills and area expertise to start submitting freelance articles \"on spec\" to the magazines you find most interesting. Start building a rapport with their editorial staff. At some point, they might start giving you specific assignments or ideas. And, if you are becoming recognized -- may offer you a job.  Be prepared for rejection -- and you can always re-work or re-shop your rejected piece to another publication. Just remember, exclusivity -- no shotgun submissions to multiple publications simultaneously.  Good luck. ",
