            "answer_text": "Of course, it'll make a lot of difference! Here is a list: You'll get to know Peeves the Poltergeist, a character that is much more a troublemaker than the Weasely twinsYou'll actually see how badass the Weasely twins were, and trust me, from the movies - you don't know their personalities at allYou'll actually be able to FEEL the power and greatness of Albus Dumbledore.The duel between the two greatest wizards of all time, Dumbledore and Voldemort - its mesmerizing, and nothing like what's shown in the movieThe infamous \u201cDI JA PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIYAH\u201d reference\u2026 you'll know what this is when you read the Goblet of Fire.Many, many misconceptions that create contradictions for you and make you think Harry Potter is not a well thought series would clear out, like, people flying casually without any brooms or such, people easily apparating and disapparating to and from Hogwarts, etcHow Dumbledore bashed out the Dursleys in the half blood prince, when he came to pick up Harry - No, he did not take Harry straight out of some subway station duh!How madeye frightened an unfortunate uncle Vernon at the end of the order of the phoenixAnd many many more\u2026So, you see, it'll absolutely change how you see most of the characters, the story line. It would have been awesome, if you wouldn't have known the major spoilers, but that's just a very small part of the fun. The actual change you will see is the feel you get from the books. After watching movies, you might've liked Harry Potter, but after the books, you'll fall in love with it! ",

            "answer_text": "Of course you can\u2026..It\u2019s what I did. I started my journey of the Wizarding World by the movies, around 2005\u20132006 when I was only 5 year old. I watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s stone, and, frankly speaking, didn\u2019t understand it much. It is for kids, I know, but it is a bit advanced for a mere five year old. So I lost my interest there. I again got my interest back in my age 10\u201311 where I saw in my TV, Harry fighting the basilisk in HP2 Chamber of Secrets. I was thrilled. I decided to watch the first 2 movies, and so I did. But I again lost interest afterwards. So you can understand, this was my initial experiences with Potter. Then the real journey began after a long time. I finished my 10th board exams, and thought to watch Harry Potter again\u2026\u2026. But now, I decided\u2026.told myself\u2026.. \u201cLet\u2019s give it a jump start.\u201d At this time, I fully understood and appreciated what Harry Potter really meant to the world, what it means to me. I fell in love with this series, and finished watching all the movies. I watched again\u2026and again\u2026and again\u2026.and again\u2026..until I realized that some part of the actual story are missing here, some loopholes are there. Of course, I can\u2019t blame the script writers for this, it is impossible to put down all the details of an average 800-pages book in the movie. So I decided to read the books. It took me nearly a year to buy and read the books and completely understand the series. I had to need longer time if I didn\u2019t see the movies first. and talking about any differences\u2026..obviously it will. As I told you earlier, many facts and stories are missing in the movies. So, do read the books, and I assure you, you\u2019ll LOVE IT! Till now, I have read the whole series 15\u201320 times, and watched the movies umpteenth times. But still today, if a Harry Potter movie is shown on TV, I stick to the channel, and gape at it. So I cannot underestimate the movies, but still, NOTHING BEATS THE STORY OF ROWLING. So my suggestion would be\u2026..  Cheers :) ",

Reading a book takes more effort than watching a movie so you there is a very good chance you will loose interest in the books because you have seen the movie. It is better to read the book and criticize the movie rather than the other way around. Also in the books there are multiple subplots which are not shown in the movie. Therefore it is another reason to get bored. Also once you have read the books the characters have developed better and have a deeper impact on you rather than other way around. So it is better to watch the movies after reading the books ",

There are many characters that play a secondary or even active role in the books, that are completely omitted or mentioned only. These include: \u25e6\tCharles Weasley \u25e6\tPeeves \u25e6\tLudo Bagman \u25e6\tBertha Jorkins \u25e6\tCuthbert Binns \u25e6\tAndromeda and Ted Tonks I can list a lot of differences but I would like to you to discover them on your own.

It was bliss. It was the most beautiful experience I ever had. You would actually realize what the Harry Potter series are. It's time you had a taste of magic. ",

While the movies are good (?), they leave a vast number of questions behind: Who are the Marauders?What's the deal with Ariana Dumbledore?Does Harry just break the Elder Wand?Et cetera, et cetera.The books also give an insight to what people are feeling, which helps us understand why they do what they do. Trust me, if you enjoyed the movies, you'll love the books. ",
