            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not even close to being accurate, especially for the era. We should have seen so much more, and so much worse. Examples just from my life (I\u2019m roughly Carol\u2019s age): In Kindergarten, all the kids filled out booklets for their futures. The boys were asked what they wanted to be, fill in the blank. The girls were asked what they wanted to be, select one: teacher, nurse, secretary, or mommy. I still have this booklet.In third grade, I was competing for something. (I don\u2019t remember what now. An award, maybe?). But I was competing against a boy. Both the (female) teacher and my parents pulled me aside to explain that I being selfish for continuing the competition, because it was more important to the boy\u2019s future that he win. They also made it clear that if I did win, I still wouldn\u2019t get the whateveritwas.In fifth grade (different school) it happened again.In middle school, two boys harassed me constantly by tugging on my clothes, poking me with things, and making lewd suggestions. When I complained, I was told \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d No teacher/parent/counselor made any effort to stop them.In high school, my (male) guidance counselor explained that if I took an advanced math class, I\u2019d never get married, because \u201cboys don\u2019t like smart women.\u201dThe same counselor told me I couldn\u2019t take a shop/auto/woods class because those classes were only for boys.Meanwhile, my father explained that when I started dating, I had to be prepared to do whatever the boy wanted (I think he meant for e.g. going to sporting events, but that\u2019s not all the message I got) and my interests didn\u2019t matter, so I shouldn\u2019t discuss them.My high school decreed that dance and cheer didn\u2019t count as athletics. But boy\u2019s golf did.Girls were pulled out of PE for classes in how to not be raped. Boys were taught to wrestle.Years later, when I was married and expecting my first child, a common question was \u201chow much longer until you quit your job?\u201d When I said I had no plans to do so, I was assured that I\u2019d change my mind after the baby was born. (Spoiler: I didn\u2019t.)That\u2019s a short list off the top of my head of moments that stuck with me. There are so many others, and I\u2019m just one woman who was raised in the suburbs. ",

            "answer_text": "There are already some great answers, so this will be short, but I want to add one more thing. Saying that the sexism in the movie was underplayed is a major understatement. There are no words to convey how underplayed it is. Someone else stated already that women were not allowed to fly before the 90\u2019s. Well, the situation of women in the US military is way worse than that. There\u2019s a documentary about it :  The Invisible War Warning : Very difficult content. Watch only if you are not over sensitive. This documentary explore the sexual abuses in the US military. All branches of the military, on women as well as men. Result : 20% of active-duty female soldiers are sexually assaulted while serving.In 2010 over 100,000 veterans were confirmed for military sexual trauma.In the same year, the Department of Defense reported more than 3,000 new assaults.The Department of Defense also estimated the real number to be close to 19,000.Only 244 perpetrators were convicted.And this film is from 2012. Seven years ago. When we thought things were already getting better for women. Now, imagine 20 years before that. Lots of survivors were interviewed for this documentary, all incredibly touching and terrible to hear. I will not give any details here as they are chilling. Watch the film if you are ready for those. The point of this answer is, Captain Marvel showed some sexism in the US Air Force, but these scenes are nothing compared to reality. ",
