I would only ask u to go through physics book of arihant publication whose writer is dc pandey . Its a fantastic book and it clear the concepts within minutes . It first makes us understands about the type of questions that can be made and the ques are in increasing difficulty level to make us prepare from good to even worse ques that can come in a medical examination. Now u would be thinking that is me (Preshit) a fool , first he said that its not good now he is saying that its best for physics. There is a reason behind there as i have gone through the arihant publications book and i found that it wasnt appropriate for biology and chemistry as most of the ques have wrong answer and the methodbof solving is also not correct which will not be helpful for your neet exam . So i would reccomend you to buy physics by dc pandey , chemistry and biology by mtg (ncert at your fingertips) So thats it and i hope u crack neet with very good rank . See u later\u2026\u2026..\u263a ",

Other than that, for reference, use OP Tandon, Himanshu Pandey, Pradeeps, Morrison and Boyd etc BIO: Start with NCERT, . Then go ahead with previous year questions. You can also refer to Trueman\u2019s. Physics: Start with SL Arora HC Verma. Practice from NEET Champion, NCERT at your fingertips !.. Then go ahead with previous year Questions directly. Dont go for any other crap books. Practice previous year questions MANY TIMES.Become perfect in them.Solve other people\u2019s doubts. These will help you score better :). People run after so many modules and crap test series. Instead you should focus on limited material and do it more number of times !! Many questions ask only basic concepts but a good clarity in them. Best Wishes Satnara IIT AIIMS Academy (an initiative by IITians.. ) ",

Owing to the vast syllabus and fierce competitive levels, NEET is deemed as one of the toughest competitive exams. Before you start your NEET preparations, students are recommended to know and understand each topic the syllabus has to offer. You can use Arihant\u2019s Practice sets as they are some great questions that would help you to practice. The book Chemistry for Medical Sciences by Preeti Gupta (Arihant) is also very good for this purpose. If you wish to get your hands on these books for free, you can check out MyPustak. They deliver the books to you and just take shipping charges in return. Happy Reading!  ",

Now a days they are following the trends of multiple choice questions. Day by the day the arihant books are getting better. They are designing bests for the exams. But you should know that Neet is a high precisely exam. In which you have to give your best. Nowadays the medical exams seats are filling faster. And day by day students are getting into it. Now come on the the question I may recommend you the DC pandey book for physics. It is best book and is surrounded by best questions. But their question need more efforts from you to come on the answers. In NEET you have shortage of time so you need to manage the timing of question. So don't go for many books at a time go for one and practice them perfectly. You will gonna to achieve good marks in it. Follow some MCQ books of arihant. There books are not enough you should go through some theories parts also so for biology select the best book which contain both theories as well as good number of questions for practice. Best of luck\u2026. ",
