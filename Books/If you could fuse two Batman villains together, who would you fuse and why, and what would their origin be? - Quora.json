            "answer_text": "Bane+Mr. Freeze=Cold Bane Victorio Fries was born and raised inside the Santa Prisca prison. At the age of 18 he fell in love and married Nora, an inmate with incurable disease. Because of the harsh environment inside the prison and lack of medics, Nora's terminal illness couldn't be cured. Sworn on finding the cure for his wife, Victorio dedicated himself to physical and mental training in order to one day leave the prison and find the cure. Eventually he escaped from prison and ended up becoming an assistant to a scientist and when the scientist discovered a cure for Nora Victorio volunteered as test subject. The scientist installed tubes into his body and pumped Victorio with cryo fluid. Because of his already healthy body the cryo fluid damaged Victorio's mind and drove him insane. After the experiment was over Victorio murdered the scientist and gave himself a new name: Cold Bane. The more cryo fluid Cold Bane pumps into himself, the bigger and stronger he gets while also his body temperature drastically drops. Joker+Hush=Punchline I'm already aware Punchline exists as an original character (being Jokers sidekick and all) but this character is something new. Presumably Batman's childhood friend, the Punchline is a dangerous criminal who hides his disfigured 'Joker' face under bandages, the last thing his victims see. Deadshot+Deathstroke=Deathshot Floyd Wilson is an ex Marine turned full time mercenary, he is experienced marksmen who's primary weapons are firearms and throwing daggers. He is so well trained that he can pin small insects with toothpicks, even from few feet away. Riddler+Scarecrow=Trapmaster Jonathan Nigma grew up in a poor household and his father was an abusive jerk who traumatized him at the age of 9. 3 years later Jon would enter a school competition, the goal was to solve puzzles and the price was 50 grand. Since the competition was too difficult, principal decided to prolong it for one week to see will there be anyone who can win the prize. Jon practised nonstop puzzle solving at home, sometimes even solving 100 piece jigsaw puzzles while simultaneously solving a Rubik's cube. He pushed himself real hard until he finally became a master at solving all kinds of puzzles and when time was right he won the 50 grand. When he got home he didn't tell his abusive father about the money so he hid the money in his room. Every day for the rest of the year Jon would spend his money on chemistry lab parts, piece by piece until he finally assembled the full set. Whenever his father would leave the house Jon would take the household chemicals and with the guidance of chemistry book he took from library he would begin his fear toxin project. After few failed attempts Jon finally makes the concoction and stores it in his attic, when his dad returned once again Jon knocked him outcold and afterwards remodeled the house into a death maze. When his dad finally awoke Jon unleashed his fear gaa and forced his dad to solve the riddles while high on fear gas. Little to say that his pop couldn't make it and that was the start of Trapmaster.

            "answer_text": "Batman has an impressive rogues gallery. What would it look like if we combined some of these villains?  Freeze-Face (Mr Freeze + Two-Face) We go with the typical Harvey Dent story\u2014acid melts half his face\u2014but this time, his situation would be lethal unless he froze half his face. The schizophrenia remains, one side warm and sympathetic, the other with a heart of ice. Lunch Lord (Condiment King + Clock King) It\u2019s time to spice things up. The pun material with this combo is phenomenal. Boy locked up in a clocktower only has one thing to look forward to: lunchtime. When he finally breaks free, it\u2019s no surprise that he\u2019s a little crazed and makes his debut as a saucy villain with impeccable timing. Cheshire Cat (Catwoman + Riddler) Ignoring the fact that Cheshire already exists, picture this. \u201cRiddle me this, Batman,\u201d she purred. \u201cA black cat lay on a black tar road\u2026\u201d Batman cannot help falling for his enigmatic feline foe. The World\u2019s Greatest Detective always loved a mystery. Poison Croc (Poison Ivy + Killer Croc) Despite living in the sewers, Poison Croc is incredibly attractive and possesses a deadly kiss. Large and reptilian, this croc can snap you in two, but also has a soft spot for gardening. Harley Guin (Harley + Penguin) This was done purely for the name, but let\u2019s roll with it. Rich, clever, and rather plump yet agile, Harley Guin has an innate love for penguins and umbrellas. Harley dances in the rain and steals for the thrill of it. Antagonising Batman is all part of the fun! Kitestroke (Deathstroke + Kite Man) After losing his son, Kitestroke trained to become one of the deadliest martial artists in the world. Previously an engineer with dreams of soaring, he combines his skills, using them to take revenge on Batman, the man he blames for his son\u2019s death. He continues to spread fear throughout Gotham as he swoops down at the Bat from a glider, kites swirling behind him. He is, by far, the true terror of Gotham. ",
