            "answer_text": "Economic globalization is the increasing economic integration of national economies and regional economic blocs across the globe through rising cross-border movement of goods, services, labor, technologies and investment.  This form of globalization works best by creating win-win situations which benefit the deploying and receiving end, including all stakeholders involved. However, durable globalization requires in addition to the economic dimension also moral credibility, i.e. demonstrated responsible action to improve the state of the global collective. E.g. in the area of environmental sustainability and social dignity and justice. ",
