            "answer_text": "With Audible, each month you pay your membership fee and get one credit (Or two if that is what you pay for. Or you can get them all yearly.). I don't count those as free books, they are the ones that you pay for with your fee. Each month, there is a selection of about 6 Audible Originals. A member can select two of these each month for no additional charge. There are several 2 for 1 credit or 3 for 2 credits sales each year. These are selected from a larger selection of books, usually several hundred. I do think of the extra books I get this way as free. I usually pick one book that I would have bought anyway, and one that I'm taking a chance on. Of course, nothing is really free. It's all part of that membership fee. You can look at it any way you want. ",
