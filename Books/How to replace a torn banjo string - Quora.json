            "answer_text": "You\u2019d be best off having someone show you how to do this, but I\u2019ll link this video:  And now I\u2019ll try to describe the process. Firstly, change your strings one at a time, don\u2019t take them all off and put a whole new set on. It\u2019s not a huge deal, but this will make sure the neck remains under relatively even tension. Loosen the string you want to change. You should be able to loosen it to the point where it easily comes off the tuner. If there\u2019s a knot in it, use wire cutters and try your best to unravel it.Remove the string.Take the new string you\u2019ll be putting on and put the loop end on the tailpiece. This will vary significantly depending on the kind of tailpiece you have, so pay attention when taking the string off how it was held so you know what to do.Thread the string through the tailpiece, if your tailpiece is of the style where this is required.Thread the string through the tuner and pull it taught.Pull part of the string back through the tuner so it\u2019s loose enough that you can hold the string about 20cm or so from the fretboard.Put a 90-degree kink in the string just past the tuner, in the direction that you\u2019ll be winding the string. Strings 1 and 2 (the two thin strings furthest from you) will be wound clockwise and the bend should be facing away from you. Strings 3, 4 and 5 will be wound anti-clockwise and so the bend should be facing towards you (or in the case of the 5th string, downwards).Hold the string so that there is a small amount of tension both at the tuner and at the tailpiece (if you don\u2019t have tension at the tuner, it will slip while you tighten it, if you don\u2019t have tension at the tailpiece, the loop-end may slip off, depending on the kind of tailpiece you have). This takes some practice - I tend to put my arm on the string to provide tension at the tailpiece, then use my index finger to hold it down near the nut and my thumb to hold the string up to provide tension.Start turning the tuner (see step 7 for the direction). This takes a little finesse to start, practice and you\u2019ll get it right consistently. Expect to not be so great at this the first few times. On the first turn, the slack part of the string should go underneath the rest of the string, and on each subsequent turn, it should go over it.Keep turning until the slack that you\u2019re holding onto becomes tight (at which point you can start letting go).Tighten it to the correct pitch.Cut the slack part of the string to leave about 5mm of slack string showing. For the 5th string, thread the slack back through the hole and pull it so that it\u2019s almost tight and you\u2019re left with a very small loop, and cut the slack as near to the hole as you can. This will prevent the slack of the string piercing your hand while you play or tune the 5th string (this is a trick you definitely want to learn).And hopefully at this point you\u2019re done! Expect it to take a long time if it\u2019s the first time you\u2019re doing it, but once you\u2019ve done it a few times it shouldn\u2019t take too long. Good luck and happy pickin\u2019! ",

            "answer_text": "You should change your strings AT LEAST every month, it\u2019s only like 6 bucks for a decent set of strings. Just hook the string into the tailpiece, ALWAYS keep tension on it with your hand to keep it from slipping off the tailpiece, then feed the string through the hole on the post of your tuner(make sure the tuner is set so the hole faces towards the tailpiece), then pull the string toward you wrapping it around the post at a sharp angle, then feed it under the part of the string closest to the tailpiece. Then pull it so that it locks the string in place. Then be sure to wind each string on the inside of the post. ",
