            "answer_text": " Yes. Me. I rarely endorse things because I know as a teacher existence, application and outcome vary. But I have made, saved, recaptured a minimum of maybe a million for myself and family using his books directly as learning tools, testing ideas, playing the Cashflow games. I started an online business a few months after going to his seminar here in NYC. I was making about $50k on the side a year. I've studied taxes, taken his advice, graduated up through tax professionals. I specifically stopped and restarted my business after his 3rd and 4th books when I realized I'd graduated to being an Employed /Self Employed. It's taken 10 years on top of that to get to Business owner, able to walk away profits and quality continues. For the past few years I've been looking at rental properties and when with realtors, I whip out my multi-page checklist from the back of one of his books. I've looked at maybe 20 good properties, of eventually 100, to find 10, to buy 1. It takes time as my attention is divided but I have a plot of land I might buy in another state just to pop my ownership out of state, don't live in it property, cherry pick to use for leverage-equity. Kiyosaki specifically said in the seminar his goal was to change our context----how we thought, not content, which is material manifestations, that's on us. It also means I've gone to real estate seminars, read more books, experimented, tried out some business ideas, went and got sales jobs to get the free training at A&S, Lord & Taylor, Walmart, MCI, because that's my weakness\u2014-customer, sales. I also pay particular attention to the design of the the sales floor, the sales systems they\u2019ve designed, the computerized inventory systems, the accompanying sales systems and strategies\u2014-turning a job into a full fledged sales training. I also had to expand my own thinking. I had a micro glimmer of the working projects I\u2019m doing now. I would say it is almost a 15-20 year, psychic orientation change. Jay Z posits that most capable people are poor because they won\u2019t sacrifice 10 years in to voluntary poverty as adults, and work on a project/business of vertical profit, to have a lifetime of wealth. Balling him and Kiyosaki together I would agree, building a self sustained business portfolio is very Zen, very light handed and yet I can say it is what I think about 80% of my waking time. You either love the process or not. Like I suppose soldiering or porn or sewer work, the mentality shift is not available to everyone. But I will add folk call things scams rather than look into themselves and say I cannot do that, I do not possess that ability. ",

When somebody's super poor to the point of not having three square meals a day or a roof above their head - no. At least not the breadwinner. But to someone who is tired of the monotony, who's not rich enough to fit into the elite or poor enough to live in slums, who's having an undiscovered prick somewhere, this can do wonders. It can open up the possibilities they never thought of and the choices they're free to make. I've read the book and it has knowledge. To one, who doesn't have any proper financial guide, it works wonders. To the person who's desperate to get out of his current turbulent situation, that guy who is having a burning desire to change his life right then and there, this can move mountains. It really depends on the situation of said person. That said, a book is, at the end of the day, millions of words running across pages. It is only when we implement it, would people come up. Answering your question, yes, it has. It's my dad. ",
