            "answer_text": "Oh I personally love reading books and this is with me . I don\u2019t just read the book at the speed of 40 pgs /hr . Just reading the book for the sake of reading makes you forget it easily . If it is a novel or a story just do following things- Imagine the characters (particularly give faces to them)\\- Be it some actor or someone whose personality matches with that character . This will help you remember them .Go slow with your reading - Now when you are reading then go slow as you have to enjoy the story ; so don\u2019t just try to read and finish the book . Enjoy the minor details of the story and again close your eyes for a second or two and imagine the whole thing happening with your imaginary characters.Give your opinions - Say \u201cOh how did she do this !\u201d, \u201c He must behave better.\u201d , \u201cI think that was the best thing they ever did\u201d , \u201cHis redemption is so damn necessary\u201d. Blah blah blah . When you do this , you let the story affect you and your thinking . This helps you remember it for a longer time .Feel the emotions -Try to feel what the person in there must be feeling . This will not only help you remember the story but will also make you more thoughtful towards humanity .See it as a movie - Although watching a movie is much easier task than reading a book , but you cant really mach the feel of reading . So in this dilemma why not just mix up. While reading your book just think that you are watching a movie . (all the above points lead you to the same ). So this might help you .",

            "answer_text": "Read slower. If it's fiction, try to imagine a scene in front of you. If it's nonfiction, I find that taking handwritten notes helps enormously with information retention. I recently got myself an iPad and pencil for this same purpose: I open the e-reader app on one side of the screen and a note-taking app on the other, and I scribble notes as I read. If you're reading a physical book then maybe a paper and pencil will work just fine for you. ",
