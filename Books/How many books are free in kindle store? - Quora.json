            "answer_text": "Buying an Amazon Kindle is a one-time investment whose benefits you can reap for years to come. There are more than 3 million free books currently available on Kindle. The list keeps getting updated and increased as more authors publish their books. I have a kindle myself but still feel that it cannot replace a physical book. It becomes really inconvenient to read on the device at times. The lighting is also harmful for the eyes and when I zoom too much, the pixels start breaking and the text blurs. I have also felt that most of the books that kindle offers for free are classics which I have already read. New books that come in the market are almost never available for free on Kindle. There is a website by the name of MyPustak that I find quite economical. They sell all books completely free of cost and all you are required to pay for is the shipping fee.  ",
