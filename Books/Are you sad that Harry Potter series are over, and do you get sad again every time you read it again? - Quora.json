            "answer_text": "I think yes in a way but also no. See, the story of Harry Potter is told and I think it would not be the wisest idea for JKR to keep on writing and putting this guy into more trouble, Harry deserves a rest, so thats why I am not sad if theres no more books about that. However - I HAVE A DREAM. And that is, that one day, JKR writes books about other characters in the potterverse. See, there is no reason to believe Harry Potter is the most interesting character or the only interesting character one could write about. I often catch myself at the thought where I wish for a book describing maybe a fourth year Ravenclaw or a sixth year Hufflepuff in Hogwarts, paying less attention to adventures and more to the life in the school itself. More info about subjects, homeworks, teachers, locations. Or maybe a book about Mr. Weasley and his work at the ministry or the complete other way around, a book about Bellatrix Lestrange or the Malfoys, their rise to power and the long and painful fall. You know, the potterverse is massive and even tho JKR backs us nerds up with informations from Pottermore, books is what we need and want. And I think more single books, or smaller series about different characters would do better than continuing a story about a character whose life has been the topic of 7 books by now. And because my heart still hopes for some of those books to be published by her one day.. I am not sad that the story of HP himself ended with the cursed child.;) ",

My despondence however stems from that idea that the end of a wonderfully transfixing story like this would tug at the heart strings of any devoted supporter, the end of something beautiful is always regrettable and hard to bear. As with any good story however the pain of the conclusion of a loved story is always alleviated by pleasure of having known it. Yes I am sad it is over but I am elated that I have crossed paths with it. That for me it gives it so much grandeur because I have been have fortunate enough to visit a world that has given me so much. It is over, but it will never die. Not in me anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "No. On the contrary, I am actually glad it is over. Allow me to explain: Cliffhangers suck. There would be no way to reasonably continue the series without either creating plot-holes, contradicting the original films, or having to shift the focus away from Harry. We know all of Harry's teenage years, the Dursleys in the summer, Hogwarts the rest of the time. Nothing about Harry is unknown, and shifting the focus takes away some of the magic. The best thing for the series is to let it end. But that doesn't mean I don't want more from Rowling about the world of HP. ",

For years, there was something to look forward to, a sense of anticipation for the new installment in the Harry Potter series. It was a bittersweet moment, but at the same time, I really enjoyed the final book and was glad the series was finished. I like knowing the complete story from beginning to end. Even epic journeys should have a conclusion. If I get nostalgic about it, I can always read the series again, and there is always some new minor detail or perspective to appreciate. ",
