            "answer_text": "Dear Raj Sen I am classical Urdu poet and I am definitely looking forward to get a collection of my ghazals published. Usually, I get approached by atleast two publishers whenever I turn up to recite my ghazals in a poetry event. But this is more like pay and get your piece printed, just like we get a print-out from a shop. They hardly care about (or believe in) the content of a book and will publish anything (read any piece of shit), if you pay them well. They don\u2019t care about the quality of the content, hence they try to earn more and more from the writer itself, as they know people will hardly expense their own money to buy such books. In one line, they try to earn more from authors and not from readers. I ain\u2019t looking for a publisher who merely means business. I am looking for a publisher who also has a good knowledge of good and bad poetry. A publisher who can invest his faith in my poetry (of course, after checking the quality), a publisher who believe that \u2018yes, this particular book is going to get me the needed readers\u2019 and who will be ready to publish with minimum contribution from the author. If you are ready to your invest faith in an author and detemined to earn from the readers, you\u2019re welcome. Thanks for asking! Rahul Jha ",
