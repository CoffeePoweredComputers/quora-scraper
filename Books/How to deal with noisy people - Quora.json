My suggestions would be to read Elaine Aron\u2019s book by that name, to help you understand how you\u2019re wired and how to work with it. Loud TVs, loud people, bright lights all stress me out. Other people\u2019s moods can overwhelm me. Don\u2019t stay overnight in their house, period. Limit your time there to a manageable amount, say, one meal. Duck out for a walk when you feel you\u2019re getting overloaded. Meet them at a restaurant if at all possible. Take exceptionally good care of yourself before and after any such visits\u2014 quiet time, reading, naps, meditation, quiet walks, etc. Work to accept (even celebrate) your sensitivity, and adopt an unapologetic mindset about it. Dr. Aron says HSPs are about 25% of the population. You\u2019re normal! ",

Metal is great for drowning out unwanted ear rape.This one either works or has no effect, but I just ask that person to be quiet. Hopefully the one making noise isn\u2019t an asshole.",
