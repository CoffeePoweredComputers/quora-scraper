            "answer_text": "I would not say it is the best book but it is definitely worth reading for in depth understanding of the subject especially for class 11 and 12 where concepts play a crucial role. Books like McGraw Hill or Dinesh Publications are also very good even though I personally recommend McGraw Hill. It is precise and does not have unnecessary information that a student of class 11,12 needs to know. You can get a lot of books for chemistry on MyPustak which delivers free second hand books for a minimal delivery fee. ",
