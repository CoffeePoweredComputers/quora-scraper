            "answer_text": "One of the last things Chaucer possibly wrote in his life was \u201cChaucer\u2019s Retraction,\u201d where he apologizes if his funny or dirty stories have led any souls astray from God. Chaucer was a religious man, and while some critics disagree, to me his religious parodying in the Canterbury Tales is pretty tame and joking, at least compared to something like Piers Plowman. Chaucer never mocks belief itself, only those who practice it wrongly. He lampoons some people in church vocations, such as the Nun\u2019s Priestess for being too sentimental, the Monk and the Friar for being more interested in girls or worldly temptations, and the Pardoner for being a complete fraud who just wants money. But as David writes, he has affection for the honest Parson, so much so that he allows him to close the Tales. ",

            "answer_text": "How does the Canterbury tales mock aspects of religion or Christian beliefs? As others have said, he doesn't mock Christian beliefs, but does mock falsity and hypocrisy. In fact there is a suggestion that he was at least a sympathiser with Lollardy, a reform movement associated with John Wyclif. Apart from the quite obvious barbs, such as his observation that the Pardoner\u2019s \u201crelics\u201d were pig's bones, it's also important to note detail in his descriptions of people. Think of things like the nun's medallion with the words, Amor omnia vincit, where caritas would be the more appropriate expression of Christian love, or like the Prioress' greater devotion to dogs than people.
