            "answer_text": "Although,I am myself an aspirant but i can tell u how to get a good hold over chemical bonding\u2026\u2026.I was told the chapter has a lotta theory but most of it can be effectively visualised \u2026.Initial portions like description of bonds isn\u2019t a great task to complete.You can understand it in one read or probably two.The chapter a lot of parameters on the basis of which an order of certain compounds in any regards is depicted like lattice energy,Bond enthalpies,Magnetic behaviour..Etc. Other than this rest all are theories of bond formation like the VSEPR,Valence bond theory and MOT..These topics are really interesting if u can visualise how beautiful the geometries are,How beautifully different overlaps occur,and atlast the fascinating quantum part in MOT,,how super beautifully the Waves show interference,,Those bulky appearing but really easy Energy level diagrams\u2026.Now after expressing my interest for this chapter i suggest u to enter into the microscopic world of atoms and visualise the happenings\u2026Rest others\u2019ve told..Make condensed notes(A HABIT I LACK :) }}\u2026thnks.

            "answer_text": "Follow NCERT. That's the most important thing you can do. The questions from this chapter are score making. Every year 2\u20133 questions (sometimes even more) come from this chapter and can be solved easily if you have understood it. The tables and graphs in ncert are very important like the one of Shape and geometry, hybridisation, linear combination of atomic orbitals etc. Read the chapters with full concentration and then solve previous year questions. If you want to practice more you can refer to Dinesh Objective book. I am sharing my notes here from this chapter. Maybe it would be beneficial for you.          In the upper image you should compare hybridisation of NH3 or CH4 with water. Then it will be easier to understand it for a longer period.          I know my handwriting in the notes is not much clear. But I think it can help you in understanding the chapter. ",
