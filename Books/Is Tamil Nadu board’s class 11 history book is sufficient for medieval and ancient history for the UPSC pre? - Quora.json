            "answer_text": "Yes it is sufficient. But for revision only. If you want to take Ancient and medieval history lightly then it is sufficient. But, in my suggestion Ancient and medieval part of history in UPSC syllabus is very simple and interesting. It is also a very small portion and easily covered within 15 to 20 day even for a laymen You must read these following books 1.India' Ancient past -- R.S Sharma for ancient india. You cannot skip this book if you are serious about UPSC . You have to read this book for Ancient History of india. It has only 363 pages .  2. History of medieval india by satish chandra. You can skip this book but , try to have atleast one reading of this book it has only 391 pages.  You also read FINE ARTS class 11th NCERT for art and culture  Above mentioned books are sufficient for Ancient, medieval and Art & culture After reading these books you will definitely read Tamilnadu board 11th class history book . I have this book in pdf so this is the screenshot from my mobile. I finish above mentioned book 3\u20133 times each and now i use to read Tamilnadu board book 1 chapter per day before going to sleep. It has 23 chapters divided into 258 pages.  Hope this will help. Happy learning. ",
