            "answer_text": "The previous answers cover how to become a professional book reviewer very well, so I won't repeat their advice. What I will say, having reviewed professionally for several years, is this: It is nearly impossible to make a living solely off reviewing books. It's so difficult because the time required to read the book is typically not compensated \u2014 only the completed review is, and those are often compensated per word. Ten cents a word for a 1,000-word review is $100, which sounds great until you realize you spent 18 hours reading the book and 2 hours writing the review, so you made $5 an hour. And 20 hours reading for a 1,000 word review is pretty standard. Review lengths are often relative to book lengths. You might only spend 4 hours on a novel, but you're probably only writing 250 to 300 words about it, too. Then there's the fact that entire genres do not pay for reviews, ever, at all. Academia is the largest culprit, but others exist. Academia expects grad students and new scholars to do book reviews free as part of their learning/CV building process, and there are thousands who jump at the chance. If you love reviewing, do it. Get paid. But be prepared to supplement that income in other ways. ",

I would start a blog (perhaps on something like Medium if you\u2019re non-technical) and write 50 book reviews in a year. Then I\u2019d start linking to one review every week from my Facebook account, from relevant Reddit comments, from Quora answers, and from any other social media I used. Once I had a following, I would try to reach out to publications, link to my blog, and ask whether they\u2019d be interested in picking it up as a column. ",
