            "answer_text": "Build out your website with what you\u2019ve learned. I\u2019m not sure how far you have progressed so I will advise you in a conservative way. Keep it safe at first by not working with a database until you learn more about Validating and Sanitizing user input. SQL Injection can be devastating. You can build out a nice looking website that uses what you\u2019ve learned so far. Depending on your skillset with HTML and CSS will determine how the site looks and feels. You can always use a front end framework like Bootstrap \u00b7 The world's most popular mobile-first and responsive front-end framework. which comes with a lot of really nice features and is easy to work with. As you continue learning PHP, enhance your website and ultimately, connect it with a database like MySQL. You can also check out either WordPress, Joomla or Drupal which are all CMS\u2019s built with PHP. Or you can check out a PHP Framework like LaravelCodeigniterCakePHPYIISymfonyetc\u2026There are many to choose from so have fun checking them out and seeing which one will deliver what you\u2019re looking for. Happy Coding. ",
