            "answer_text": "First off: the neutrals are not seen as morally \"neutral\"; in fact, as you have noted, they are in hell. Secondly, while we are pretty sure this figure \"who made the great refusal\" is Celestine, we are not 100% sure, since his name is not mentioned. Most likely, the weak Pope Celestine V appears with the neutrals because he abdicated the papacy in 1294 to, essentially, go live as a hermit (so this happens right around when Dante begins to write the Commedia). Perhaps the worse sin was that Celestine was followed into the office by Dante's \"archenemy,\" Boniface VIII. Let me quote Hollander's translation of the section we're talking about, so you can see just how much Dante despised the cowardice of the neutral souls (the verses supposedly mentioning Celestine are in bold, and I made a couple changes in brackets to clear things up a bit): \"After I recognized a few of these [people], I saw and knew the shade of him who, through cowardice, made the great refusal.  At once with certainty I understood this was that worthless crew [displeasing] alike to God and to His foes.  These wretches, who never were alive, were naked and beset by stinging flies and wasps  that made their faces stream with blood, which, mingled with their tears, was gathered at their feet by loathsome worms.\" (If. 3, 58-69) Now you tell me if Celestine is portrayed as good or bad.
