            "answer_text": " Here are few such online platforms, websites, and resources that can help you earn money online. Blogging: It starts with a hobby, interest, and passion and soon blogging becomes a career option for many bloggers. There are a number of full-time bloggers in the country. There are two ways to start a blog: you can either create a blog through Wordpress or Tumblr, which requires no investment, or go for a self-hosted blog.Virtual Assistant: Doing all the corporate stuff from one's home is what a virtual assistant (VA) does. VAs basically work remotely with their clients and manage the aspects of their business that they are too busy to handle themselves. When you work as a virtual assistant, you can choose to work as an employee or you can set up your own business.Affiliate marketing: Once your website is up and running, opt for affiliate marketing by allowing companies to insert web links on to your site. When visitors to your site buy products or services by clicking on such links, you earn out from it.Social media: In addition to interacting with friends and strangers, social networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat can be used to make money. Companies and popular brands pay social media strategists to further boost the popularity of their products. With lots of competition around and the constantly shortening of attention time of online viewers, creativity is essential to create posts, videos etc that can go viral quickly and enhance the brand value. Remember, social media needs dedicated time and energy to stay relevant. Hence, you need to share posts regularly and interact with your followers on a regular basis.",

            "answer_text": "Awesome ways to Make Money from Internet by using your phone or computer so here we start First Let\u2019s go ahead and get this out of the way. There are all kinds of websites that will pay you for various things, such as shopping, taking surveys or testing products. No, I\u2019m not getting paid to promote any of these and no, these websites won\u2019t make you a millionaire, but they are great for earning some extra cash. I\u2019ll leave out the scams. Here are some legitimate websites that pay: 1. Swagbucks \u2013 Swagbucks is great for earning some extra cash. You can do a variety of things to make money, from taking surveys to using their search engine. You won\u2019t get rich, but you will earn a few bucks. If you have the time to kill, you can spend it earning some extra cash, instead of surfing the web. 2. InboxDollars \u2013 InboxDollars is similar to Swagbucks, since you\u2019re going to be taking surveys, shopping, etc., so if you want to maximize your return, sign up with both websites. They also offer a search engine that pays you (like Swagbucks) and you get $5 just for signing up. I won\u2019t continue to list survey sites one after another down the list, but if you want to get paid to take surveys, also check out GlobalTestMarket, E-Poll Surveys and Survey Club. Photo credit: Source 3. Project Payday \u2013 Project Payday is one of those sites that has testimonials of people who have earned thousands of dollars by getting paid to get trial offers. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ll earn thousands, but it is legit and you can earn some extra cash. They assume that by paying you to do a free trial, you\u2019ll either like the product and purchase it, or forget to cancel the trial and get charged for it. If you can keep track and cancel before you get charged (if you don\u2019t want the product), then this is a great site for making some money. 4. User Testing \u2013 User Testing pays $10 a pop for testing websites. A test usually takes about 15-20 minutes. The purpose is for a website owner to watch someone, who is new to their site, try to navigate it. The value that the site owner gets by watching an actual user experience is worth a ton, but $10 isn\u2019t a bad pay-out. 5. Fiverr \u2013 Fiverr is a great place to make a few bucks or spend a few bucks if you need some of the services people offer. Basically, everything is $5. You either pay $5 or charge $5. They call them \u201cgigs.\u201d You can offer your services however you choose. If you sell art and you\u2019re fine selling pieces for $5 each, that\u2019s a gig. If you\u2019re a graphic designer and you want to offer your services for $10/hour, simply offer a 30 minute gig. If they need two hours of graphic design, they pay you $20, or $10/hour by buying four gigs. 6. IZEA \u2013 IZEA works in addition to a blog or on its own. You get paid to blog, tweet, take photos and take videos. The pay is mostly based on your following, so if you want to make money with your tweets, you\u2019ll need to grow you Twitter following. Likewise, if you want to make money with blogs, you\u2019ll need substantial blog traffic (more on blogging below). Freelance Writing Freelance writing is one of the most popular ways to earn money online. Many successful freelancers can earn an average of 50 cents to a dollar per word. Some are earning twice that! Of course, it doesn\u2019t start out like that. You\u2019ve got to build your portfolio and your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, blah blah blah. If you\u2019re interested in writing, I\u2019m sure you know this. If you\u2019re not interested in writing, I wouldn\u2019t recommend traveling down this road just for the money. It takes dedication and time, though it can be highly profitable if it\u2019s what you love. Assuming it is what you love, let\u2019s talk about making money with it. Before you decide to start reaching out to all of these freelance writing companies, you need to have a web presence. You need a blog (in my humble blogger opinion, of course). Or you could just have an online portfolio. Even a LinkedIn profile works to get started. When you\u2019re ready to start, here are 150 resources to help you write better, faster and more persuasively. If that\u2019s intimidating, just start with these 50 resources. Now for what you\u2019ve all been waiting for; once you\u2019re ready to actually start making money, here are 10 websites you can start with: 7. Listverse \u2013 Listverse pays $100 for each accepted post. The article must be a list, it must be at least 1,500 words and you must include at least 10 things. Other than that, you can get pretty creative with it. 8. TopTenz \u2013 TopTenz pays $50 for each accepted post. Again, the article has to be in a list format and it must be at least 1,500 words, with few exceptions. They post often so your chances of getting accepted are fairly high. 9. A List Apart \u2013 A List Apart pays $200 for each accepted post. They\u2019re not first on the list, because they tend to publish less articles, which means you have a smaller chance of getting accepted. Same guidelines as above, 1,500 word minimum. 10. International Living \u2013 International Living pays $75 for each accepted post. They are mostly looking for travel experiences from countries you have visited. For this site, it\u2019s more about your experience than your writing ability. 11. FundsforWriters \u2013 FundsforWriters pays $50 for each accepted post. They are looking for articles about writing and making money with it. They only accept articles between 500-600 words, but they want you to make each word count. 12. Uxbooth \u2013 Uxbooth pays $100 for each accepted post. They do tend to take four to eight weeks to accept and post articles, so don\u2019t count on this being a quick money maker. They take so long, because they pair with editors to only publish amazing content. 13. iWriter \u2013 iWriter pays up to $15 for each accepted post. That may seem small, but they aren\u2019t as strict as many of the others above and they also allow you to pick exactly what you write. You can write as many or as few articles as you want. 14. Textbroker \u2013 Textbroker pays up to five cents per word, if you\u2019re a 5-star writer. You\u2019ll start by submitting a short sample article and you will most likely start as a 3-star writer, but you can work your way up by writing more and writing great content. 15. Matador Network \u2013 Matador Network pays up to $60 for each accepted post, but standard pay is around $20-$25. They don\u2019t really focus on a minimum word count, but they have a maximum count of 1,500 words. 16. The Penny Hoarder \u2013 The Penny Hoarder pays up to $800 (rarely), depending upon the number of page views you receive. The pay starts at $100 for 50,000 page views, so this isn\u2019t a guaranteed paid article, but it can potentially be highly rewarding. There\u2019s no doubt that you can make money with freelance writing, but it\u2019s a process. Once you start building your portfolio and your writing skills, you can start making some serious money. If you\u2019re not an experienced writer, expect to put some time in before you really start to see some dough. Sell Your Stuff Ever since the idea of online auctions came into existence, the online selling market has been on the rise. Many are interested, but don\u2019t know how to get started. There are still all kinds of ways to make money by selling online, whether you\u2019re selling what you already have or buying and selling like a store. Before we get started, here are a few general tips when selling anything online: Get a PayPal account. If you don\u2019t have a PayPal account, you\u2019ll want to get one if you\u2019re doing business online. It\u2019s the standard in online business for receiving payment and paying others. Take good pictures. Some of the options below don\u2019t require you to actually take the picture and sell the product, but for the ones that do, make sure you take a clear picture that makes your product stand out from the others. If you\u2019re going to be taking a lot of pictures, set up a small \u201cstudio-like\u201d area in your home with a backdrop and proper lighting to really make your pictures come across as professional. And of course, you\u2019ll want a good camera too. Be honest. If you\u2019re selling used items, be honest about every dent, scratch, blemish, etc.. This will reduce many issues you could run into and keep your reviews positive. Do good business. Plain and simple. Whether you\u2019re selling on a small site or opening an online store, your customer service matters. You\u2019ll want to get those positive reviews and make a good name for yourself. Respond to questions, concerns and complaints. Offer a guarantee if available. Follow those guidelines and you will do well in online sales. When you\u2019re ready to start selling, here\u2019s where you go: 17. Amazon \u2013 Have you heard of FBA? It stands for \u201cFulfilled by Amazon\u201d and it\u2019s getting pretty popular. Basically, you buy products (in bulk is best) and ship them to Amazon for them to store. When your products sell, Amazon packs them up, ships them out and sends you the money (after taking their cut). There are people making a full-time living from FBA, while others just do it for some extra money. 18. CraigsList \u2013 Some things don\u2019t ship very well. Other things may make you feel uncomfortable to sell to someone across the country. Anytime you\u2019re selling a large item or something you just don\u2019t want to ship, Craigslist is a great place to go. It\u2019s simple to list your item (again, take good pictures!). If you don\u2019t like the idea of putting your phone number out there, the interested individual can send you a message to your inbox without even getting your email address. Photo credit: Source 19. eBay \u2013 Of course you can\u2019t read an article about making money online that doesn\u2019t mention eBay. You can start an eBay store and get serious about it or you can just sell some stuff to declutter your home. Either way, I\u2019ve made my fair share from selling on eBay and it\u2019s still a popular way to earn money. If you decide to start an actual eBay store, you\u2019ll want to find a drop-ship business like Doba that will store and ship items straight to your customers so you don\u2019t have to deal with an inventory. 20. Etsy \u2013 If you like to create arts and crafts, you can sell them on Acquista regali fatti a mano, vintage, personalizzati e unici per tutti\u2019s completely free to open an Etsy store. You simply sign up, post pictures of your creations and starting selling. You can choose your payment option, but PayPal is generally the easiest. Etsy makes it easy to sell and keep track of your inventory. There is a small listing fee and they take 3.5% of every sale you make. 21. Facebook \u2013 Facebook swap shops are great for selling things locally. It\u2019s like CraigsList, but a little easier. You simply search for swap shops in your area and ask to join the group. Once you\u2019re in, take a picture of the item, write a quick description with the price and post it. It doesn\u2019t get much easier than that. You can generally expect to get about what you would get at a yard sale, maybe a little more. Blogging Hey look, an article about making money online that doesn\u2019t mention blogging. . . oh wait, here it is. First off, I\u2019m a blogger so it seems wrong not to mention it, but more importantly, it\u2019s a legitimate way to make money. It\u2019s quite possibly the least straight-forward way on this list, but it\u2019s very doable and it\u2019s also quite possibly the funnest way on this list. I love blogging and I know hundreds of bloggers who feel the same. So let\u2019s talk about making money blogging and what it really means. Blogging is something that requires patience, persistence and discipline. It may mean writing everyday for over a year before you really start to see any money from it. There are exceptions to the rule, but from my dealings with other bloggers, it seems to be pretty common to spend one or even two years building your blog, your brand and your authority, before making any serious amount of money. Some people argue that you can make money without a lot of traffic and while that is true in some circumstances, you will generally need a lot of website traffic to start earning from a blog and that takes a while. Once you\u2019ve reached that point, here are the primary ways to monetize your blog and start earning: 22. Advertising \u2013 This is definitely the most old-school way of earning money with a blog. It\u2019s also starting to become the least common way. You can sell advertising spots directly on your site or you can sign up with a company like Google AdSense or Media.net | One of the largest ad-tech companies worldwide. Either way, you won\u2019t see a whole lot of money from ads until your views are well into the thousands each day. 23. Affiliates \u2013 There are many affiliate networks, such as FlexOffers and CJ Affiliatethat allow you to promote other people\u2019s products and services. You simply put a link or a banner on your page and then you get a percentage if someone clicks through and buys the product/service. You\u2019ll want to select products that are specifically within your blog\u2019s category.This is an effective way to earn money once you have the traffic coming to your blog. 24. Membership \u2013 Many people have created a paid membership area on their blog. This is typically for exclusive content that you can only access in the \u201cmember\u2019s area.\u201d If you have a really great idea on what to include, this can be a great idea. You\u2019ll have to create something that can\u2019t easily be accessed around the web. 25. Products \u2013 You can create your own product, such as an ebook or computer software. You would then use your blog as a promotion tool to get people to buy your product. As long as you create a legitimate product with a whole lot of value, you should be able to get some buyers, but like everything else with a blog, you\u2019ll need the traffic to get the sells. 26. Services \u2013 You can offer a paid service, such as life coaching, blog coaching, goal setting or financial planning. Just be sure to investigate all the legal implications and make sure you\u2019re not claiming to be a professional if you\u2019re not one. With a service like this, you\u2019re basically using your blog to sell yourself. You\u2019ll need to convince people that you\u2019re worth buying and then be able to back up your claims once they purchase your service. 27. Sponsored/paid posts \u2013 Many blogs publish sponsored and paid posts. Sponsored posts are basically just posts about a specific brand, product or service. A company will pay you to publish an article about it. It\u2019s similar with other paid posts as well. Your basically selling the spot for the article on your site. If you decide to take this route, you\u2019ll want to build your traffic before you will get many offers. 28. Subscription \u2013 If you think of something valuable (newsletter, online magazine, etc.) that you can consistently offer on a certain basis (weekly, monthly, etc.), you may want to offer a subscription service. This could be a fee charged each time your product is sent out or on a monthly basis. Either way, this has to be something that your customers can only get by subscribing to your website. 29. Videos \u2013 This could be an entire section on it\u2019s own. Many people have made money by creating YouTube videos. Evan of EvanTube is a kid and he has made millions by creating reviews of products that other kids his age would use. It\u2019s not easy to get views into the millions, but once you do, you\u2019ll start seeing some cash come in. Many bloggers have completely turned to videos to get their point across by starting a video blog. If you\u2019re truly interested in becoming a blogger, start by looking through the archives of ProBlogger, Copyblogger and Boost Blog Traffic. Then go read through all the free guides over at Quick Sprout. It may take you a year to complete those tasks alone, but it will be worth it. You\u2019ll practically have a MBA in blogging. Work-at-Home Companies Finally, there are some companies that will hire you to work from the comfort of your own home. If you\u2019re interested in working for someone else, while still making your own schedule and deciding where to work from, here are a few companies that will let you do just that: 30. CrowdSource \u2013 CrowdSource offers many types of jobs from \u201cmicrotask\u201d jobs to larger writing and editing jobs. You decide how much you work and you can do most of it right at your computer. 31. Demand Studios \u2013 Demand Studios is hiring all kinds of creative professionals, from writer to filmmakers. The pay isn\u2019t amazing, but it\u2019s competitive for a work-at-home job. 32. Fast Chart \u2013 Fast Chart allows you to work from home as a medical transcriptionist. There are some requirments and qualifications listed on the page, but if you meet them, you\u2019ll make competitive pay for the industry. You\u2019ll also be able to set your own schedule since you\u2019ll be working from home. 33. Leap Force \u2013 Leap Force is one way that Google rates websites for search engine ranking. If you\u2019re hired, you make decent money (usually over $11/hour), you set your own schedule and it can be pretty fun to view and rank websites. 34. Liveops \u2013 Liveops is a call center that allows you to work from home. Once your set up to take the calls, you can begin making a weekly schedule and working from home. The pay is generally close to $10/hour, but you can earn more with commissions. 35. SpeakWrite \u2013 SpeakWrite will pay you up to $15/hour to transcribe information. You set your own schedule and work from home. Now you\u2019ve got many different options to start earning online. If you saw something that really interests you, try it out and learn more about it. If you\u2019re really wanting to make a full-time income online, you need to be dedicated to learning how to do what you want to do. There are tons of free resources out there. You just have to search for them! Now Second let\u2019s talk about online selling work deeply so these are the below options for you: Selling products online and tapping into one of the fastest growing online business trends in internet history. AMAZON FBA The term Amazon FBA stands for \u2018Fulfillment by Amazon\u201d. In this process of business, you need to send all your products and items to Amazon. Amazon is one of the most trusted names in the arena of online business. They are the people who have a very large customer gamut or base throughout the world and their professionals can take care of all the functions related to inventory management and transportation and logistics of goods. In this system of business, you need not worry about any operational hassles. However, you will have to abide by the rules and the regulations of Amazon, will have to share a huge part of the profit with Amazon and also the name of your brand will never gain eminence. To the customers, it will always seem that it is Amazon from where they are getting their products. It is best to use ecommerce website development services like Shopify to do the job hassle free for you. So lets start with dropshipping now\u2026 Dropshipping If you\u2019ve ever tried to find out for ways to make money online, you might have come across the term dropshipping. I\u2019ve always wondered if starting a dropshipping business was a viable way to generate income. So, after doing some research, I decided to open my own dropshipping store. Within 48 hours, I had setup my store, added about 30 products, run some paid advertising on Facebook, and made my first sale: I\u2019m excited to continue my dropshipping experiment, but I also wanted to share the progress so far So Let\u2019s discuss.. What is dropshipping? How to start a dropshipping business: cost, logistics, suppliers, etc. My dropshipping concept. Paid advertising and dropshipping? Lessons I have learned. So Let\u2019s get to it! So What is Drop Shipping? Dropshipping is a retail strategy that involves outsourcing your manufacturing and fulfillment process. As a dropshipper, you will never actually keep your products in stock. Rather, you purchase your stock from another merchant/manufacturer who then ship it directly to your customers. By dropshipping, all you have to worry about is marketing and sales. Manufacturing, order fulfillment, and logistics are taken care of by the suppliers you source your products from. Drop shipping really requires arbitrage to be successful. In other words, you need to purchase your inventory for less than you sell. You also need to reach your customers through marketing before your competition (or supplier) does, as well as hope your customers don\u2019t do too much price comparison or shopping around. Ultimately, the need to buy cheap inventory leads to many dropshippers utilizing platforms like AliExpress to purchase items in bulk. Your dropshipping process might look like this: You source a product from a cheap supplier on AliExpress. Let\u2019s say, a pair of sneakers that cost $20. You create an online storefront that sells this pair of sneakers for $60. When someone purchase these sneakers from your store, you pay $20 (the original price) for the supplier to ship the sneakers to your customer. This costs you $20 but results in $40 of profit. Now Let\u2019s see How to Start a Dropshipping Business:- There is no exact formula for starting your own dropshipping business. After all, as long as you can create a situation of arbitrage (buying low, selling high), you can make money. However, there are some incredibly useful tips, tools, and strategies that can help you get on the right track with making money online. This answer is going to get rather in-depth, and will cover these core concepts: Conducting market research for dropshipping. Sourcing your products. Setting up your store. You initial startup costs. Marketing your dropshipping business. Finding Products to Dropship \u2013 Identifying a Niche: Many dropshipping guides assert that there is a definite price point, product type, or audience you have to market to in order to be successful. However, dropshipping is ultimately all about arbitrage. You need to rely on your consumers NOT doing any price comparisons or shopping around. In other words, you need to take advantage of price discrepancies between Chinese/cheap manufacturing costs and North American/European expectations of product pricing. When considering what niche you are targeting, your products should be distinctively lower in price than their competitive alternatives. So When consumers see your product, they should immediately notice that you are the cheapest option they have come across for a particular good. Not so cheap as to be alarming, but cheap enough to be an obvious deal. Here\u2019s my first dropshipping sale as an example: It\u2019s a hunting-themed camouflage baseball cap. I sell it for $11.76 + $10 shipping for a total of $21.76. The cap costs me $7 to purchase from a Chinese manufacturer. However, when my target market sees a decent quality cap that\u2019s only $21.76, that is actually much cheaper than many other brand of caps or hats sold elsewhere in the world. This is a great example of a good item to dropship. I can mark the price up and it still remains competitive. When you think about a niche to start your dropshipping business, think of your product list and ensure it can spark this sense of excitement and value in consumers. Additionally, avoid products/niches that are important purchasing decisions. You want consumers to see a great deal, get excited and purchase. If you sell very expensive items that require consumers to do their own research, you might have difficulty selling. Sourcing your Dropshipping Products: From what I\u2019ve read and am slowly starting to experience, there are a few guidelines for sourcing your dropshipping products: You need to find reliable suppliers. Your products should remain (roughly) between $20-$150 once they have been marked up. You can certainly market more expensive items, but your consumers might be hesitant to spend that much money online. You should be able to mark the prices of your product up by 100% to 200%. You need to keep things simple. Find your niche and stick to it rather than being a Jack of all trades. I\u2019m going to use AliExpress in this example since this is where I find my products and suppliers. AliExpress has many cheap suppliers, a wide product variety, and the quality of some items isn\u2019t bad. They also provide decent shipping rates, customer support, and are used by many other dropshipping businesses. Here\u2019s how you can go about sourcing your products: Head to AliExpress and search for your product idea: In this case, let\u2019s find some more caps to sell. Sort by free shipping and orders: This will display products that have been frequently ordered and also offer free shipping Now, find products that: Have 4-5 stars. Have as many orders as possible (I aim for at least 50-100 orders). Offer ePacket shipping \u2013 this is a form of shipping specifically designed for speedy and cheap eCommerce shipping. Are cheap enough to remain in the $20-$150 ballpark even after you mark the price up by 100% to 200%. Here\u2019s an example of a product I would pick: It has good reviews, plenty of orders, and it\u2019s very cheap. I could easily add this hat to an army-themed clothing store and sell that hat for $15-$20. If you want to get more in-depth, be sure to check out additional information on the product such as: Their return policy. If the supplier offers tracking information. How long the manufacturing/fulfillment process takes (the shorter the time, the better). How their product photos look (you\u2019ll need good photos for your marketing efforts). Conduct this process several times for each product category you plan on dropshipping. Gather a list of about 20-30 items you want to dropship just to make sure you have enough variety to launch the initial version of your store. You are now ready to start your business! Now Setting up a Dropshipping Store:- Personally, I recommend using Shopify as your dropshipping store platform. Shopify is affordable, offers sleek designs that support eCommerce, and can implement some necessary dropshipping tools and plugins. Shopify is also great for dropshipping because it allows you to process payments very quickly, provide customer support, and effectively manage your shop. Additionally, you can also pause your Shopify dropshipping store at any time to put your payments and storefront on hold. So, there\u2019s really no harm in trying out a free 14 day trial of Shopify or even paying for a month or 2 of having your own store since you can always put it on the back burner! Once you have decided on your dropshipping niche, here\u2019s how you can setup your storefront: Head over to Shopify and sign up with my link to receive a free 14 day trial! Create your account and store name. Don\u2019t overthink this. Select a free theme to use for your storefront. Start importing your products with Oberlo How to use Oberlo for Dropshipping: There are plenty of guides on how to use Oberlo, and I\u2019m not going to go very in-depth since the process is actually very simple. Just head to the Shopify App Store, search Oberlo, and download the app. Then, download the Oberlo Chrome extension. When you find a product on AliExpress you want to dropship, you can use this plugin to import the product into your Oberlo dashboard: The product you want to dropship will now appear on your Oberlo product import list Here, you can edit your product information, price, product variants, and included images. AliExpress suffers from keyword stuffing and poor grammar, so be sure to do a thorough review of your information and fix any errors: As you can see, I\u2019ve edited how the product will appear on my store to make it more appealing/logical. You can also choose your price point, as well as how great of a \u2018sale\u2019 your product is on for: In this example, I\u2019ve chosen to sell the cap for $16.10, which is also cheaper than the comparison price of $19.32 (which I randomly made up). When you are ready to publish a product to your storefront, just hit push to shop. That\u2019s all there is to it. How you design your storefront and categorize your merchandise is up to you. Chances are, you\u2019ll need to play around with your shop settings to make your storefront look appealing, but this isn\u2019t too difficult. Oberlo\u2019s free plan allows you to import up to 500 products. This should give you plenty of room to design a dropshipping business that can become profitable. Setting up a Dropshipping Store \u2013 Additional Costs:- While Oberlo is free, there are 2 main expenses you must also factor in for your dropshipping business. Firstly, you need to buy a domain name for your website. If you maintain a free Shopify store. Then This is simply unacceptable. You are operating a store, and you need to remain professional. Purchase your domain name through the Shopify dashboard. It will cost around $15-$18. Secondly, you need to purchase a Shopify plan. The Basic Shopify plan is sufficient for starting a dropshipping business. To break even each month, you\u2019ll only need to sell 1-2 products which is certainly possible. If you can\u2019t afford a domain name and monthly Shopify plan at the moment, I would suggest conducting your product/market research and creating content for your website (like blog posts) until you are ready to purchase. My Dropshipping Strategy: A lot of dropshipping guides don\u2019t disclose their own products, market, or progress. As usual, I want to be transparent and actually teach people something. Feel free to copy my idea if you want\u2026I do love a good competition! My dropshipping business is Buy Hunting Gear. It specializes in hunting apparel, accessories, scopes, and spotters: Currently, I have about 30 products and am planning on adding more products as time goes on: Here\u2019s why I picked the hunting niche for dropshipping: Hunting season is starting. Hunting gear is overpriced (in my opinion) in the United States and Canada. Companies like Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods practically have a monopoly on certain hunting products. I can mark the prices of my products up by 100% to 200% and still remain competitive. There are dozens of great suppliers on AliExpress to choose from. These products aren\u2019t high-involvement purchases. Additionally, I predict that sales of hunting related goods will actually increase in the future. As gun laws potentially become more strict and limit the sale of semi-automatic weapons, I think the rifle market and hunting industry might see an increase in consumers who just want to shoot shit in their spare time. Dropshipping Marketing Strategies I Use: Long story short, you need to use Facebook and Instagram. My first sale came within 48 hours as a result of Instagram. Instagram is already generating additional traffic as well: I suggest creating a Business Instagram page that describes what you do, links to your website, and also has high quality pictures of your products: I\u2019ve been operating my page for 3 days, and I have gained 150+ followers by posting photos with relevant hunting hashtags, following people who like hunting related pages, and commenting on other people\u2019s photos. I expect to slowly grow my Instagram page and eventually drive some sales from the platform. You can also setup your Instagram to automatically post to Facebook when you submit a post, which effectively automates your Facebook marketing process. Just be sure to also set up your Facebook page to represent your business in a professional manner. I have also dabbled with $20 of paid advertising on Facebook, with mixed results: I ran a slideshow-style advertisement for some hunting caps. I targeted men in the United States and Canada between the ages of 20-50 who have liked specific pages related to hunting, such as Elk Hunting or Deer Hunting pages. Here are the results: Key Points: No sales \u2013 Someone has a cap in their shopping cart at the moment, but even if they purchase, I have lost money with this ad campaign. 41 actions taken \u2013 41 people interacted with the advertisement. Mediocre relevancy score \u2013 I could have refined my targeting or run a different product that appeals more to hunters. Ultimately, I am happy to have tested paid advertising. I will run 1 more advertising campaign for $20. Hopefully I can drive some sales through Facebook. If you want to try your hand at advertising your dropshipping business, be sure to enable Facebook Pixel Tracking before you advertise. This will allow you to re-target customers who have seen your advertisements on Facebook before and visited your website, and these customers will theoretically be more likely to purchase your products. Also, anticipate having to spend $50-$100 before you begin to get an understanding of what works and doesn\u2019t work for your target market. Lessons I\u2019ve Learned from Dropshipping: You can start dropshipping in 24-48 hours: I put in roughly 10 hours of work before launching my website. You will have to A/B test: Until you get dropshipping down to a science, always split test your product choice, advertising efforts, and marketing strategies. I plan on refining my second advertising campaign to be even better. Don\u2019t over prepare: You can spend months researching products to dropship, but this won\u2019t drive sales. Plan and prepare, but don\u2019t be afraid to pull the trigger (haha hunting jokes). Use coupons: Your profit margin is going to be massive, so don\u2019t be afraid to create a Shopify coupon and advertise it on your Instagram/Facebook page. I have a 5% off coupon but might increase this. Can you Make Money Dropshipping? There are plenty of dropshipping success stories that prove the best people in this business can succeed. Peter Koch from the website Seller At Heart has a great series on how to start a business on Amazon by purchasing products from Alibaba. He shares his own experiences, insight, and results. While this isn\u2019t exactly dropshipping, it\u2019s a similar concept and I highly recommend giving his series a read. At the end of the day, a retail arbitrage business model can succeed if you know how to conduct product research, find reputable sellers, and efficiently advertise to your target market. How Hard is it to Start a Dropshipping Business? Dropshipping absolutely works. It is possible to start a dropshipping business with almost no startup cost and successfully scale your business through a mixture of social media promotion, SEO, and paid advertising. How do I know this? Well, there are many dropshipping success stories, and I\u2019ve seen enough companies advertising their obviously AliExpress-sourced products on Instagram (for months at a time) to know there are some big businesses out there that spend a lot on advertising\u2026if they weren\u2019t profitable, they wouldn\u2019t realistically be advertising so heavily for months on end (unless the investors have very deep pockets). However, starting a successful dropshipping business is not easy. I have now realized that I was too greedy in my initial store launch for Buy Hunting Gear. The dropship space is crowded; gone are the days of easy 100% profit margins on countless niches and products. If I could redo my dropshipping experiment, I definitely would have lowered my margins on every single item in my store to remain competitive on pricing. I had dozens of customers add their products to carts or reach checkout, but only 1 person actually converted. I blame myself for underestimating just how competitive the market was and how willing people would be to shop around and compare prices. I think starting your own online store provides many valuable lessons, and you may even make money by starting a dropshipping business. However, you will need to put in a great deal of effort and time for several months before your store can begin to run on semi-auto pilot (and even then, if you scale, you will work). I currently don\u2019t have an extra hour or 2 per day to focus on dropshipping, and this is ultimately why I have put the store on hold for the time being. I felt I owed everyone a more detailed explanation as to why this money making experiment has stopped, so there it is! Hopefully I can take another crack at starting a dropshipping business sometime in 2019! Is Dropshipping Unethical? I grappled with this question after making my first sale. At the end of the day, all retail business models operate upon the concept of arbitrage. If they didn\u2019t, no business could remain a float. Therefore, I don\u2019t think it is wrong to act as a \u2018middleman\u2019 and mark your products up, even if it is a 100% to 200% margin. However, I think it is necessary to remain transparent with consumers. On Buy Hunting Gear, I provide brand names in my product descriptions and explain that I am ordering them from a manufacturer. I might not plaster the fact that the products are made in China all over the website, but hey, look up the brand name of something before you purchase. I also outline additional information in my About and Shipping sections that explain what to expect with shipping times, how to go about returns or cancelling orders, and how customers can give feedback. Dropshipping is a real business model. As long as you are honest and provide quality customer service, I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with this practice. I hope you have found this answer to be informative and useful! I am just getting started with dropshipping, but if this experiment works it will definitely become a new part of internet. Now the next thing to sell products online is affiliate marketing\u2026 Affiliate marketing So How does affiliate marketing work?? If you are sharing any kind of tutorial with a supply list, you are leaving money on the table. And if you are linking to sites that sell the products you\u2019re promoting and you\u2019re not an affiliate, you\u2019re really LOSING money!! So Here are some common misconceptions about affiliate marketing:- Affiliate marketing costs my followers more money. THAT\u2019S WRONG \u2013 Affiliate marketing is a way for the SELLER of the item to pay you for referring a buyer to them. It doesn\u2019t cost the buyer more money. The price for the buyer is the same whether they click your affiliate link or not. In fact, sometimes affiliate offers include a DISCOUNT the buyer might not otherwise receive. Affiliate marketing is really hard to do, with coding involved. THAT\u2019S WRONG \u2013 Advanced affiliate marketers use coding and specialized techniques but everyday affiliate marketers like you and me just need a unique product link with our identifier in it. The affiliate program will generate these links for you. So Now, let\u2019s get started with affiliate marketing:- 1. Sign up for a program The first step is to sign up for an affiliate marketing program. So I recommend Amazon because it is fast and easy to sign up and get approved. There are two basic types of affiliate programs \u2013 those run directly by the company itself (Amazon runs their own in-house program) and those run by an agency . To find the affiliate program for any retailer you want work with, simply google the retailer name and \u201caffiliate program\u201d. Here are a few affiliate programs I use and recommend: A)Amazon Associates B)Clickbank 2. Find links In the affiliate program, find links for the products you are listing in your blog post or YouTube video (yes, you can put affiliate links on Youtube!). Check the guidelines of each affiliate marketing program to find out where links for that program are allowed to be placed. For example, some affiliate programs may not allow affiliate links in email or to be posted on social media \u2013 they only want their links on blogs or websites. The \u201cback end\u201d of the affiliate program website usually has multiple assets you can use to sell their products, from banner ads to sales copy and ads to product links. I typically only use product links because it\u2019s simple. You can dig deeper in any of the programs to really make them work for you. 3. Add the links to your post The best place I have found for adding affiliate links in a blog post is the supply list. DIY and craft bloggers always have supply lists \u2013 we want our followers to be able to recreate the project with success. By linking the supply list to the EXACT products you used, you can ensure that your followers will find the right product and have success. You can get fancy and build widgets and embed buttons and things on your site but to get started, I recommend just finding the product link and hyperlinking that product in your supply list. Since you\u2019re making money from your affiliate relationship, be sure to mark the links as \u201cnofollow\u201d (click here to see how to do that). Hit publish on your blog post and you\u2019re ready to earn! Here\u2019s a recap: Sign up for an affiliate program for a retailer that sells what you\u2019re promoting. Find affiliate links for the products you\u2019re using in your blog post. Add the links as hyperlinks to your blog posts. Make sure affiliate links are marked as \u201cnofollow\u201d in the code. Publish and promote your post. How to Market Your Products more efficiently In many ways, no matter how far we\u2019ve come when it comes to technology and online selling\u2026 the same principles of marketing and consumer psychology hold true. And that\u2019s definitely the case with your online venture. The name of the game here is direct-response marketing. Back in the day, this was done with snail mail flyers, letters, magalogs, catalogs, and other printed material. Yes, so-called \u201cjunk mail.\u201d But they wouldn\u2019t send it out by the millions if it didn\u2019t work. These days this sort of content is sent out electronically. And it still works like a charm to get customers to open their wallets. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to spend a ton of money when you engage in direct-response marketing online. Email marketing is a virtually free method to reach sell your products. And that will be the basis of your marketing efforts. The basic idea is create a list of email subscribers. You send them both useful content \u2014 free valuable information related to your product/niche, as well as offers to buy products. Sending them the free content will speed up the process of them knowing, liking, and trusting you enough to buy your paid products. The novelty of buying stuff online wore off years ago and now people have a lot to choose from \u2014 you must give them a warm fuzzy feeling to be the one they buy from. Yes, only a small percentage of people will actually respond. But that\u2019s how direct response works. You should have enough prospects coming in that even a small percentage of conversions will result in a profit. To build an email list, you can employ a variety of methods. Search Engine Optimization: In a nutshell, you use valuable content on your website or blog to catch the attention of Google and get listed high in the search results. Paid ads: Whether you use Google\u2019s own pay-per-click ads or banner ads or run ads on a blog network, this can be a viable option, albeit expensive. Social Media: Networks like Facebook are invaluable at reaching a targeted customer base these days. So how do you take it to the next level? You tap into that small amount of people who buy your introductory product, also known as a front-end product. You contact those people differently than your normal subscribers. Because they have bought something, they are more likely to buy similar products. So you offer them more in-depth, higher-priced products, known as \u201cback end products.\u201d That\u2019s where the big money is. A back end product could be one-on-one coaching or an event, for example. Putting It All Together As you can see selling products make for the perfect online business. They\u2019re digital, easy to create and deliver. And the profit margins are huge. So next steps\u2026 Find your niche \u2013 make sure it has bestselling potential. Figure out which format works best for your niche: caps, shirts ,glasses, videos, ebook, etc. Select and Create your information product(s). Create an email list and then market to that list. Profit! P.S.- If you want to read some other money making projects I\u2019ve started, I\u2019d suggest you check out my quora profile. So additionally, if you want to start your own dropshipping business, I would highly recommend Shopify.

            "answer_text": "I'll keep it straight with you (and anyone else interested): The BEST ways aren't free.  You ALWAYS pay; financially or through tons of effort developing a skill -- or both. The question is, are you will to pay the price? ...are you willing to put several weeks into a project you \"thought\" was going to kick-ass and fall hard on your ass, literally, in the end? ...are you willing to push through obstacles and mental barriars we set for our- selves to reach your goals? ...How far are you willing to go? I can give you several good ways to earn money online, but I'd bet a million bucks you or the average person wouldn't do it because they're not prepared to answer those questions above. In fact, they don't even want to *give it any thought, let alone experience it for themselves*. This is not a scare tactic. If you're going to be serious about this you need to know this before you waste your time. You need to KNOW there will be effort you will have to put into everything you pursue to make it as profitable and glamorous as you see online. ...because let me tell ya'. It's real. The results. The money. The lifestyle. It's real. If you're willing to tough out the rough times to get to the good. After reading the above, I'll give you what worked (still works) for me: 1. Selling affiliate products via clickbank 2. Marketing/selling my own products 3. Freelancing What you'll discover is that freelancing and marketing are two different skills. It's one thing to write for other people, it's another thing to make money from your own writing. ...but they're both worth learning. Not only will you make very good money the experience will teach you a lot about yourself.  ...one of those lessons is, \"You only make money if you care enough about solving other peoples problems\". This can't be faked. You must genuinely want to solve other peoples problems before you can accept financial compensation. People can sense otherwise via email, on the phone, even when skyping...people can *sense* if you have their best interest in mind. ...which means you have to ditch your original question altogether and ask yourself, \"How can I SERVE more people to reach my goals\". You might think this is B.S. but if you take this far, which I doubt you will (just being honest), you'll learn that lesson -- and it's a tough and beautiful lesson to learn. The most successful money makers are those who focus on solving other peoples problems   Anyways, I'm done yapping. I've asked myself that same question 4 years ago and could NEVER find the right answer -- in spite of all the ways to make money there is NEVER good way too make money -- only good ways to serve PEOPLE to make money.

            "answer_text": "One legitimate way to earn extra income online is to blog about topics that you are passionate about. For example, if you are really into baseball or a specific team like the New York Yankees, you could post your thoughts, opinions, etc. on your blog. Setting up a blog is free. Use a tool like WordPress to get started. You do not have to know computer programming to do it. Once your blog is up and running you can sign up for free accounts with sites like Commission Junction (cj.com). From there you can access banner advertisements to place on your blog. Choose advertisers that would be relevant to your blog audience. For example, if you blog about travel topics you can place banner ads from Expedia, Travelocity, etc. and when your readers click on those ads and buy something, you will earn a commission.  Some ads pay just for the click while other ads require something to be purchased. There are hundreds of ad networks like Commission Junction so once you get comfortable, search for ads from other sites too such as LinkShare, Share-a-Sale, Adknowledge, Reach Media Group, etc. My blog is the DailyDollar (www.dailydollarnewsletter.com) and in just over 3 years we have generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions from advertising revenue.  We also expanded DailyDollar to include www.dailydollarcoupons.com. Like anything else, it takes work, patience and commitment to do a good job. ",

I'm an affiliate marketer so one of the ways I make money online is by referring products to people and every time they make a purchase I get paid, My method to make more sales is giving them the gift of value first before I try to close a sale, I tell them about the product and how it's making life better for me when I give them that gift first, I now have established a relationship of trust and they are now way more likely to spend more time and spend more money with you because you took the time to establish that groundwork. could you imagine if you came to a stranger and asked this question and they said \u201cPay me $20 first, then I'll tell give you an answer\u201d Why would I open up my wallet to someone who hasn't first established that relationship of trust? If that was me I'd simply walk in the opposite direction, who knows, He could have possibly had a fantastic answer but I'll never know because He didn't take the time to establish that relationship of trust.

            "answer_text": "Top ways to make money online and offline 1 No-risk matched betting : Hands down the quickest way to make a lot of money (well, without breaking the law). Lots of students have genuinely made \u00a3100s from this technique. It\u2019s completely legal, risk free, tax free, and anyone can do it. It works by taking advantage of free bets regularly offered by betting sites through \u2018matching\u2019 them at a betting exchange. Matched betting eliminates the risk (you are betting both for and against a certain outcome). This leaves you being able to squeeze out the free bet, which can be as much as \u00a3200! Multiply this by how many betting sites there are and you can quite easily come away with a profit of a few hundred pounds. Owen walks you through how to make your first \u00a315 profit (using a real life example) in this gem of a guide to matched betting. If you know of any better way to make \u00a330/hr sitting at home, please let us know! 2 Online surveys : An increasingly popular way for students to make money is to fill out online surveys in their spare time. Research companies are always recruiting new members to answer surveys and test new products. For a few minutes of form filling, you can make a couple of quid which is paid as cash or rewards. You can bag up to \u00a33 ($5) for some surveys! 3 Paid for searching the web : Interested in earning cash for doing what you already do online? This has to be one of the easiest methods of making money online without really any effort or change in your behavior. This innovative idea by Qmee.com rewards you for searching in Google, Bing or Yahoo. You just install a simple add-on to your browser and when you conduct a search there may be a few sponsored results alongside your normal search. Each Qmee result has a cash reward attached \u2013 if you are interested in it simply click on it and collect your reward. The best thing is there is no minimum to cashout \u2013 our first one was just 72p wired to our Paypal account. You also have the option to donate it to charity. Sign up now for free and start earning from your own searches! 4 Social Investment Networks : The historically hard-to-break world of investing in stock markets and currencies has been cracked wide open. Today there is no need to be a fat cat or fund the yachts of Wolf of Wall Street style stock brokers. You can do it all yourself with the help of online market trading platforms. Having spent many hours researching this new opportunity, I\u2019ve been experimenting with the two biggest platforms: Plus500 and eToro.com. Both offer free practice accounts, and Plus500 also give you a free \u00a320 (without depositing) which is worth taking up. Overall I prefer eToro with over 4 million users worldwide. It was recently featured in the BBC 2 documentary \u201cTraders: Millions by the Minute\u201d and the Financial Times One of the best things on eToro is the CopyTrader feature. This lets you literally see, follow and copy the investments of other top performing traders. Follow George\u2019s complete guide to trading on eToro to learn more. I think $200 is a good amount to get the most out of the learning curve by trying out a few different markets. If nothing else you\u2019ll learn a great deal about various investments and industries. Warning: trading can be volatile and you can lose money, so don\u2019t throw your life savings into it! 5 Sell your notes : If you don\u2019t mind sharing your notes with other students it\u2019s a great way to generate a little extra cash. There are sites out there that you can upload your notes to, along with your price, and then when another student downloads them you get paid. Sites like Notesale are free for you to list your notes but tend to take a cut of your profit in order to handle the marketing etc so that you don\u2019t have to go out there and promote your notes yourself. You will most likely have to upload PDFs but it\u2019s worth it for the return and you can submit handwritten notes but you\u2019re likely to make more money if they\u2019re typed up. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was in college, I worked one of the best jobs for college students I could possibly ask for. I was a team lead at my school\u2019s indoor recreation center. I loved my job. Seriously, who wouldn\u2019t love getting paid to do homework and play pool? And as a team leads, I took my job pretty seriously (nerd alert ?). It was my job to train the new employees, manage our events, and do my damndest to make sure everyone had a good time. Unfortunately, not everyone I worked with shared my same level of commitment to the job. Every day students would call in or forget their shifts, and I would be stuck cleaning up the resulting mess. At the time it was super frustrating, but in hindsight, it\u2019s a little easier to empathize. College is busy. Working through college can help offset some big expenses, but between classes, volunteer work, and enjoying some of the best years of your life, it can be difficult to fit into a rigid work schedule. That\u2019s where the Internet comes in. 13 Legit Online Jobs for Students To Earn Money If you\u2019re in college and want to work but have trouble finding the time, these online jobs for students to earn money can give you the flexibility you\u2019re looking for. Not to mention working online often pays way better than your regular campus positions. Double win. 1. Social Media Manager What it pays: $15-$40/hour Most of us spend hours a week on social media anyway. Why not get paid for it? Every business uses social media, but managing it in-house is more expensive (employee taxes) and employees\u2019 time is better spent elsewhere. That\u2019s where independently contracted social media managers come in. Social media managers help build brand awareness by curating content, building relationships with potential customers, and driving new leads. Your job is to be the online voice of the company. Get started as a social media manager by approaching local businesses and telling them about your services. Start by reaching out to businesses you already frequent \u2014 yoga studios, coffee shops, boutiques, restaurants, etc. Focus on whatever social media platforms you\u2019re most comfortable with, and talk about how you can use it to grow their business and reach new customers. 2. Blogger What it pays: varies (some bloggers make $100,000+ per month) If I could go back in time, I would for sure have started a blog in college. (As a finance major, I could have used the creative outlet.) The key to making money as a blogger is to write content that provides value to your readers. No one wants to read an article titled \u201cMy Family Vacation to Hawaii,\u201d (except maybe your mom and aunt Jody). On the other hand, a piece on \u201c7 Things You Need to Know Before Vacationing in Hawaii\u201d is both intriguing and helpful. Before you start your blog, choose a topic you enjoy writing about, and make it specific. As they say in marketing, if you speak to everyone, you\u2019ll speak to no one. Once you have your topic, write down at least 20 blog post ideas, then get to crackin\u2019 on your first five posts. This is a good test of whether or not you actually enjoy writing on your chosen subject (or even at all). Once you\u2019re ready to start your blog, the next step is to choose a host for your website. HostGator is a popular option and the one we recommend for beginner bloggers. It\u2019s not free \u2014 plans start at $2.75 per month \u2014 but it\u2019s an essential first step. See our step-by-step guide to starting a profitable blog to kick things off on the right foot.  3. Freelance Writer What it pays: $50-$500+ per article Don\u2019t sweat your credentials here \u2014 if you have good grammatical skills and a desire to write, you can make it as a freelance writer. Freelance writing is a flexible and lucrative way to make money in college. And think how cool it would be to add to your resume \u201cPublished in the New York Times\u201d or some other big media outlet. Having an online presence in the form of your own blog can help you land high-paying clients faster and serve as a portfolio for your work. Otherwise, you can get started as a freelance writer by picking up clients on Upwork. Once you\u2019ve got some work to show and testimonials to back you up, start pitching to jobs on Problogger and Freelance Writing Jobs. 4. Virtual Assistant What it pays: $15-$200+ per hour Virtual assistant services range from data entry and customer service to copywriting and email marketing. The amount you can charge as a virtual assistant depends on your skillset and experience. Specialized skills like copywriting or email marketing are premium services that pay premium rates. Businesses hire virtual assistants to outsource tasks that don\u2019t need to be done in-house. For example, a cafe makes food, keeps the dining and kitchen areas clean, and serves customers. They don\u2019t specialize in social media management or content marketing. By hiring a virtual assistant, they can avoid paying employee taxes (since VAs aren\u2019t employees of the businesses they work for) and have someone experienced managing their digital marketing efforts. It\u2019s a win-win. Start working as a virtual assistant by making a list of services you can offer. Then create profiles on Zirtual and Virtual Assistant Networking to start booking your first clients. For more information, see our guide on the exact steps to become a virtual assistant. Watch my video on How You Can Make Money Online Today with a Small Youtube Channel. 5. Graphic Designer What it pays: $25-$50 per hour You don\u2019t have to be a graphic design major to make money online as a graphic designer. All you need are the right tools and an eye for detail. Small businesses need appealing graphics for everything \u2014 business cards, logos, social media images, etc. If you don\u2019t yet have the necessary skills but still want to try your hand at graphic design, sign up for the free Graphic Design Basics course on Skillshare. This class is a short overview of the fundamentals of visual design. Once you\u2019re ready to get started, reach out to small businesses in your area. Let them know what services you offer (business cards, branding, flyer design, etc.) and how you can help them increase brand awareness. In addition to local businesses, many bloggers use freelance designers for Pinterest pin creation and other social media imagery. Email your favorites and see if they could use your new skills. 99designs and freelance sites like Upwork are also promising sources for freelance designers. 6. Proofreader What it pays: $10-$45 per hour If you\u2019re like me and enjoy judging your Facebook friends on their poor grammar and leaving snarky comments (\u201cyou\u2019re\u201d not \u201cyour\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s not that hard!) then you were made to be a proofreader. Yes, it\u2019s one of the best online jobs for college students since you\u2019re using your proofreading skills all the time anyway. Editing and proofreading are two very different things. Editing involves restructuring, deleting, and adding content, whereas proofreading is checking for spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors. It\u2019s the final stage right before a piece of content is published. Begin booking proofreading jobs by setting up a freelancer profile online. There\u2019s no shortage of opportunities on Upwork and Freelancer. 7. Resume Writer What it pays: $50-$75 per resume/$10-$25 per hour My freshman year of college I went to my first career fair with a resume that was three pages long and said basically nothing. Yikes. Online jobs for college students don\u2019t typically expect tons of background and experience on our resumes, but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try to make our resume stand out. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but I could have gone beyond my friend group and turned my little workshop into a nice side hustle. Now I\u2019m here to warn you so you don\u2019t make my same mistake. Take advantage of free resources to help build your skills, like school workshops or this resume writing class on SkillShare. Again, the easiest way to start offering your resume writing services is through freelance sites like Upwork or Freelancer. Even better? Ask around in your circle and see who\u2019s looking for a job or summer internship. It may not be online, but it\u2019s faster than freelancing with less competition. 8. Online Jobs From Home Tutoring What it pays: $14-$20+ per hour Teaching online is how I was originally able to quit my full-time job and work online jobs from homeinstead. The best part about tutoring is that you\u2019re reinforcing what you\u2019ve already learned, so if you tutor subjects in your major, it\u2019s like getting paid to study. But if you need a breather from school, you don\u2019t have to stick to academic subjects. You can also tutor in your other areas of expertise, like an instrument or sport. Here are the best places to start offering your tutoring services online: Wyzant (tutors set their own rates)Chegg (tutors start at $20 per hour)VIPKID (only available to graduate students since you need a bachelor\u2019s degree; pay is $14-$22 per hour)9. Web Developer What it pays: $20-$75 per hour I dated a guy in college who ran a side business as a web developer. He was an economics major, but that didn\u2019t stop him from learning to code which led to many online jobs for college students for him to work on. This course taught me everything I needed to know to start booking clients and paid for itself in just a week. Of course, one class didn\u2019t make me a professional coder, but it gave me a good foundation and the confidence to take on my first clients. For new web developers, it\u2019s best to start with smaller projects. Most of the work I did was editing existing websites rather than building new ones. The main things to learn are the most popular languages and how they work together to form a website. (And WordPress. Definitely learn WordPress.) With your new coding skills in your back pocket, you can begin by bidding on projects on PeoplePerHour, Upwork, and Freelancer. Good web developers are always in high demand.  10. Survey Taker What it pays: $2-$20 per survey Surveys aren\u2019t the most fun gig, but they are one of the easiest. Survey sites collect consumer data that companies use to improve their products. The resulting increase in their bottom line is why these companies are so eager to pay everyday people for their opinions. In just a few minutes a day, you can make a nice side income with paid online surveys. Our of our favorites is Swagbucks because of the many different ways to earn (watching videos, taking surveys, playing games, browsing the web, and more). To get started as a survey taker, create an account for each site you plan to use. Since you won\u2019t be eligible for every survey, you\u2019ll earn more by signing up with several (Survey Junkie is another favorite). 11. Search Engine Evaluator What it pays: $12-$15 per hour We love Google, but technology isn\u2019t always perfect. That\u2019s why search engines rely on real people to provide feedback on the relevance and usefulness of their results. These types of online jobs for college students are usually 10 to 30 hours per week and can easily work around a busy college schedule. Find search engine evaluator jobs on: LeapforceLionbridgeiSoftStoneZeroChaosAppen12. Five Dollar Fiverr What it pays: $5-$995 per gig Five dollars doesn\u2019t sound like much, but for tasks that take just a few minutes of your time, it adds up fast. And it only goes up from there. Projects on Fiverr range from $5 to $995, and you can offer three versions of your services at three different price points. Many Fiverr sellers have turned it into their full-time gig, while others use it to make money on the side. Services on Fiverr include everything you can imagine. There are the usual services like writing, web development, and graphic design. But if none of those tickle your fancy, try something a little unorthodox like prank calls or celebrity impressions. 13. Data Entry Online Jobs What it pays: $10-$17 per hour Data entry online jobs are relatively stress-free and don\u2019t require any specialized skill, which makes them great online jobs for college students who don\u2019t want a serious commitment. Check out these websites for data entry online jobs: ClickworkerDionData SolutionsThe Smart Crowd There\u2019s no shortage of online jobs for college students with no experience. Working online is the best setup for most college students and it doesn\u2019t always require any experience to succeed. The gigs are flexible, usually pay better than campus and other brick-and-mortar jobs, and you don\u2019t have to take off for holiday breaks. If you find something you\u2019re really passionate about, you could even turn your college side gig into your full-time career.

            "answer_text": "1. Website Building If the internet is a country, then websites are like real estates. I\u2019m hoping by now you have a general understanding that real estates are valuable in the physical world \u2013 digital real estates work the same way. By building a website, you\u2019re creating your own plot of online \u201cland.\u201d You can fill this land with whatever you want, but you have to promote it through social media (and anywhere else you can think of) for this to be successful. When you build traffic to your land, you can sell people whatever you have to offer. In order to build a website, you need a host (i.e GoDaddy), a template (i.e WordPress), and content. The first two parts are easy to find, and content is only as difficult as you make it. You can post blogs, items for sale, pictures, videos, or whatever you want. Opening up your own website gives you the potential to make money from the avenues I\u2019m going to mention. 2. B2B Marketing An online business model I love is utilized by GetVoiP, an affiliate marketer based in New York. GetVoiP acts as an agent for business communication providers. They maintain updated listings of VoiP providers, including ratings, comparisons, consumer reviews, in-depth knowledge of market and end-user trends, and expert opinions from business professionals on a variety of topics related to business consumers. By not only keeping abreast of news, but providing detailed analysis of products being offered, GetVoiP is able to generate traffic to their site and increase their clout with businesses. The more online clout you have as a business, the more money you\u2019ll make. If you\u2019re known for making lasting connections (as is the case with GetVoiP above), then you\u2019ll have no issues building your online brand. You\u2019ll be recognized in your community and begin to build a buzz in your industry. Tracking your numbers (how many people view your site, click each ad, and make a purchase from that click) gives you the leverage to expand this part of your business, enabling you to continue building your online rep. 3. Google Adsense  If that sounds like too much technical information for you, there is an easy button \u2013 Google\u2019s advertising platform is as simple as signing up, enabling (on Blogger) or pasting a small code on your website, and allowing the advertisements to automatically roll in. The problem with this program is that you don\u2019t get any commissions \u2013 and you don\u2019t get to control the ad content. This is useful for some, but powerful users will want something a little more robust. 4. Amazon Associates Amazon has an Associates program for site owners and bloggers. They offer a search tool to find the right products and services from their site and a variety of ad styles to display on your site, including text-based and banner images (digital billboards) like this: Each item purchased through your Amazon links give you a commission. It doesn\u2019t take high volume traffic to achieve results, either. I began making money with the program when I only had 1,000 hits per month on my site. They can apply your earnings to your Amazon account balance, issue you a check, or direct deposit into your bank account. If you love Amazon, you\u2019ll love their associate\u2019s program. Click here for another Lifehack dedicated to Amazon Associates. 5. Rakuten Linkshare Amazon and Google are far from your only options for online advertising. Rakuten Linkshare is a great place to search for other affiliates for your ads. Through their program, you can get customized ad links, email links, and banner ads for Starbucks, Walmart, iTunes, and a slew of other popular brands. With this program, you can also find smaller companies, regional or specialized brands, and more. I run a combination of Google, Amazon, and Rakuten\u2019s programs, and my monthly income is approximately $150 from these programs. It\u2019s not a lot of money, but it\u2019s also not a lot of work for residual (it means recurring\u2026since the ads are permanent\u2026) income. 6. Company Referral Programs  Speaking of the benefits of permanent ads, banners and links aren\u2019t the only ways to earn a little bit of dough off your online endeavors. By having a website, you gain the power of emailing companies to ask them for things. I have no shame in letting the yoga company whose mat I\u2019m looking into purchasing know that I have a blog and write for yoga publications \u2013 it sometimes gets me discounts. Other times, I gain a valuable business contact in PR, advertising, or other aspects of corporate sales. Sometimes I just get a free drink. Either way, money in and of itself is worthless. Ditch the middle man and use the internet to barter what you have and can do for what you need. 7. Klout If you have a social media account, try out Klout. The company tracks your social media usage, determines how big and what type of audience you draw based on the subject matter of your updates and posts. Using this information, you\u2019re qualified to receive free items, tickets, etc. Check their website often to find ways of earning free stuff by doing what you\u2019re already doing online\u2026boring the rest of us\u2026 8. EBay If you have anything you want to sell, then EBay is the place you need to seriously consider doing it first. Personally I\u2019m not a fan of the site because of the work it takes to build up a reputation. If you\u2019re willing to grind through that process, you\u2019ll be rewarded with many privileges \u2013 people have gotten rich selling books about how they got rich selling everything on EBay: Click here for a few tips from the pros. 9. Amazon  If you start getting too big for EBay or decide you want to try a different flavor, Amazon has a marketplace as well. I prefer using Amazon because I can depend on their shipping, have a Prime account, and trust their reviews (overall, not usually singularly, although occasionally that as well). Learn more about Amazon\u2019s marketplace by clicking on this Lifehack, and delve into the marketplace. The difference between Amazon and EBay is that EBay (though still filled with new items) is seen as a used marketplace between individual parties, whereas Amazon (which is filled with offers for new and used merchandise from the 3 rd parties) is viewed as a Wal-Mart-type superstore. As a consumer, this difference leads me to use Amazon, so it only makes sense to target on my own demographic. 10. Etsy If you\u2019re crafty (and I mean that in more than one way, wink wink), you\u2019ll enjoy Etsy. Handcrafted items are the bread and butter here. Plenty of people make decent side money on the site, which is basically an EBay for crafters and artists. Set up a sellers account with Etsy, and you\u2019ll be asked to set up your virtual storefront and put up at least 5 goods for sale. Once you have this down, you\u2019ll be a budding Etsy entrepreneur. Provide great quality to your customers, and they\u2019ll often return. Many people are willing to pay a premium for quality handmade designs. Etsy (like EBay and Amazon) takes a cut off the top for selling items through their site. PayPal takes another cut, and you have to be careful with taxes on all income, so be diligent while building your online business. 11. Craigslist Craigslist is the modern equivalent of the classified ads that dominated the days of newspapers. These quick ads are easy to navigate and use, and they\u2019re geographically linked. Whether you\u2019re selling something or offering a service, this lifehack is a great place to start learning the intricacies of Craigslist. Posting ads on Craigslist is technically easy, but people often have fears about posting their personal information on the site. I communicate mostly through email when doing business on Craigslist, and I\u2019ve never run into any issues. I\u2019ve never been ripped off, nor have I been murdered or raped for using the site. It takes common sense, so use your best judgment, but don\u2019t assume someone is a thief just because of their preferred communication method. For an extra bonus, google \u201cfunny Craigslist ads\u201d to see some delightful examples of guerilla and grassroots marketing. 12. Indeed  Maybe what you need is a job. It doesn\u2019t matter which job search site you prefer using (even Craigslist) \u2013 Indeed tracks them all, and then some. You can find jobs posted on company websites, through temp agencies, and more at Indeed. If money is something you really need, Indeed is most definitely the place you want to visit to browse career opportunities. 13. Upwork Where Indeed excels at finding job postings across the web and acting as a search crawler for employment, maybe a full-fledged career is too big of a commitment at this point in your life. Elance is a site to find freelance work of all types. I\u2019ve used it for quick writing, editing, copywriting, resume building, and other odd jobs and temp gigs. The experience has been great. Elance offers a wide array of technical, data entry, accounting, and other freelance and temp gigs. If you\u2019re just looking for something short and sweet, log in, input and showcase your marketable skills, and begin searching through their job database, using any parameters you desire. Once you submit a bid, you\u2019ll receive an acceptance or denial \u2013 you may get a few rejections, but don\u2019t sweat it. Negotiate the terms of your bid, and get to work. You have money to make. 14. Mturk If you\u2019ve heard of crowdsourcing (and even if you haven\u2019t), Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk program is a great place to get involved. Much like at Elance, you input your info and skills. You then are able to search for different menial tasks ranging from identifying inappropriate web content to transcribing audio recordings to basic data entry work. Just like at any other job, the more work you do, and the better your quality, the more opportunities you\u2019ll have to make money. The payouts are often small, and your payment is received in Amazon credit, but Mturk is a great place to make mindless money while veg\u2019ing on the couch watching TV. 15. LinkedIn  LinkedIn is a social media site for professionals. This isn\u2019t a direct way to make money, but it\u2019s a great way to connect to your current and potential peers, customers, clients, vendors, and more here. You\u2019ll build a reputation and get in the loop on important developments in your chosen career path and/or industry. One day an old college buddy may hit you up for a dream job you never considered at the exact moment you are looking for a new vocation. Whether you like it or not, keeping your LinkedIn profile current is a great way to get surprised with new work opportunities out the blue. 16. Care.com If you\u2019re an experienced nanny or babysitter, Care.com is the place you want to make money. By listing yourself on the Craigslist of Childcare, you\u2019ll broaden your reach and increase your odds of finding the right gig at the right time. You can be pickier with what kids you watch when you have the reputation and traffic to pull in more customers. Join Care.com and start making money by investing in the future of our youth. 17. ThePirateBay I support bootlegging \u2013 I don\u2019t see it as being immoral or unethical in any way. I used to bootleg quite a bit in my youth, and I still do on occasion today (although not yet today in particular, I more meant \u201cin the present\u201d). If you want to hustle for your money, do what you must, baby. Download some software, music, movies, or other assorted digital goodness here and start slangin. It\u2019s not an easy life, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. ",

Do you want to sell on ebay with no inventory or products of any kind? So here is how I make a good living selling products that I never see. First I m going to explain about Dropshipping. Dropshipping is a retail method where you don t keep the product you sell in stock. Instead, when a you sell a product, you purchase the item from a third party and have it shipped directly to the customer. As a result, the merchant never sees or handles the product. I started selling on eBay about 10 years ago, I made a few dollars but nothing to brag about. I thought there must be a better way to make money on eBay, as there were many Powersellers pulling in over 10 grand a month. So I started searching and searching and I found the Dropship method. Hey, frigging great just what I needed but to find an reliable Dropshipper was the thing. Many are just Scammers. After many hits and misses, I found WHOLESALE2B who said their suppliers were guaranteed dropshippers who they checked out very carefully. So I bit the bullet, paid their monthly fee, which was fairly reasonable and BAM, I found hundreds of suppliers with thousands of items to sell.I didnt have to deal with any of them unless I wanted to. All I had to do was find the products I wanted and with a couple of clicks the product was listed on ebay. Join Wholesale2b for Free, check out their products and videos, choose a plan and START selling. Click the email link to go to Wholesale2b NOW!

To start earning you need to register in this project. After registration, you will be sent questionnaires to your mailbox to fill out. For a completely completed survey, you will be paid money from 30 to 100 rubles. With the help of online surveys, you can earn from 100 rubles per day without investment. True, research for making money is not sent every day. Expert Opinion - site questionnaire for participation in a paid survey. For registration in the project and filling out profile information about yourself, you will be immediately credited 80 rubles. Application forms for passing also come to the e-mail indicated during registration. A simple and intuitive interface of the resource will help even a novice user to understand it. COPYRIGHT AND REWRITE - writing articles, copyright only - writing a new article based on several existing ones, or from scratch, and rewriting - just rewrite the article in your own words. There is a difference between them! Most often, such work is chosen by women on maternity leave, students and pensioners try. So, if you decide to get down to business, but you are not strong in Russian, try to improve your writing. Open textbooks from school, or start rewriting the text of your favorite work. There is nothing shameful in self-education! In terms of aids for beginners, school textbooks are the best educational aids. Start small! Nobody will require financial investments, but deceptions happen, so be careful! For example, they will be given the task to write an article, they will accept it and not unsubscribe - they will steal it, and you will not get money. The customer gives the task to copywriters. You write an article, it is checked for grammatical and stylistic errors. If anything, they ask you to edit or correct, and then when the text suits you, the payment for the work goes. Articles are measured in Characters Without Spaces (SBS). For 1000 zbp pay 1 $ and more, or less, depending on the experience of the copywriter. Work for yourself with Envato: programmer, developer, freelance artist, musician One of the largest Internet sites for the sale of exclusively intellectual property goods has managed to establish itself well. There have not yet been cases of freelancers complaining about life with Envato - Top digital assets and services. Diligent domestic enthusiasts who are able to independently study and create objects of art feel especially well. So for a month, successful web programmers get from $ 300-5000 on selling templates for websites. Not bad, huh? At the same time, for certain Envato services (and there are a huge number of them), you can put up for sale: photos, musical compositions and cuts, video effects, plugins for sites and programs, games; 3d models of objects. And that's not all Envato has to offer. As you can see, there is where to unwind. All money is transferred through Swift payments, and the benefit of the service is that it receives a certain percentage of each sale, acting as an intermediary and providing a certain level of security. The only mandatory requirement (apart from the main direction) is knowledge of the English language, or the ability to use translators. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the best things about making money from the internet, is that you can go into business for yourself from the comfort of your house. You just need a wi-fi connection, and you can start to earn money online. There are so many different ways to make money from an online job. All you have to do is identify the profitable niche market appropriate for you. So, let\u2019s analizy what kind of job you can start working from home, with you personal computer: 1. Affiliate Marketing: is one of the oldest online moneymakers out there. Here\u2019s how it works: You'll need your own web presence: website, blog, social media platforms, landing pages, sales pages, banner ads, or e-commerce site. But instead of selling your own products, you sell the products of other companies, and you get a commission for every completed sale.Chose a hot affiliate niche market; one with many potential customers.Provide important content and marketing messages aimed at your clients.When clients on your digital platform click on a link to make a purchase, they are taken to your affiliate partner\u2019s site to complete the transaction. The best part is you don\u2019t have to deal with shipping or customer service.2. Selling on Amazon, eBay, and Etsy: E-commerce giants like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy are powerful sales and marketing platforms with millions of people that regularly shop on these sites (and the numbers keep growing)! These super-sites make it easy to set up shop so clients can browse your products, and you don\u2019t need to build your own website. In short, you avoid a lot of the expense and hassle of setting up an independent e-commerce website! Amazon: you can even have them fulfil your orders. There are more than 2 million sellers on their website, representing 45% of all sales. eBay: the procedure is very similar. You simply start by becoming an eBay seller and stay in good standing by making sure your PayPal account is verified. Then you can sign up for your store. These steps allow you to piggyback on eBay\u2019s reputation, reach, and sales and marketing infrastructure in order to sell your own products. Etsy: The web portal is focused on handcrafted and unique one-of-a-kind items and has 1.5 million sellers around the world. Like Amazon and eBay, you can set up your own online shop on Etsy's site. The common denominators among all these sites are that you need to use clear, high-quality photos of your products, keep product descriptions detailed and specific, and know what your competitors charge so you don't out-price yourself. 3. Blogging: If you provide valuable content on a regular basis, you attract people interested in your niche information and products. Your readers are compelled to keep reading to find out more and buy. People are primed to buy your products either via ads or affiliate links in your posts. Because you\u2019ve been providing useful free content and people have come to know and trust you. Also, you make your online storefront attractive in the eyes of Google by regularly adding useful information in the form of articles, videos, etc. This results in higher rankings in Google's search engine so, you appear on page 1 because most people don\u2019t go to page 2 on Google. 4. Your Own YouTube Channel: Top YouTubers can make millions each year. You don\u2019t need millions of viewers to earn money on YouTube. Some ideas for valuable videos include how-tos such as recipes, unboxing (where you open a product for viewers), food and travel reviews, music videos, comedy skits, and so on. Here's how: Set up your channel, the place where your videos will live.Upload videos consistently and be specific when describing the content in your video. Make sure your videos are high-quality and contain entertaining and useful content.Put the word out on your social media platforms like Facebook and your email marketing list. Share your videos on social media!Respond to comments from viewers to create a fan base. Your job is to create a community.Allowing YouTube to include ads in your videos. When viewers click on an ad, you split the fee with Google. The more views, the more revenue for you!5. Selling E-books: E-books represent about 20 % all book sales in the U.S. The good news is you don\u2019t have to be a publisher to get in on the action. As an internet entrepreneur, you can sell ebooks directly from your own website, selling your own books or a public domain work. Simply upload it to your website and start publicizing it on your social media platforms, on your email list, your blog, website, etc. 6. Develop Apps: Don't panic if you're not a programmer. You\u2019re the entrepreneur. So you can hire people to create it. With the availability of programmers available at reasonable rates, you could find someone on a site like Upwork or Fiverr. Of course, the exact amount you\u2019ll pay your developers depends on the complexity of the app.  Tese are the tips I give you to start earning money from online business.I started my online business about 3 years ago, and this choice allowed me to completely change my life, working from home and freeing myself from my 9/5 job. So don\u2019t procrastinate and start earning money from internet jobs! ;) Federico :-) ",

            "answer_text": "1. Google Adsense A source of revenue that many site administrators / bloggers use is Google Adsense. Invest in your own domain name via a web host (such as WordPress or Weebly), and consider how you think you attract a lot of visitors. A good idea for this is starting your own original blog. Once your website is reasonably visited, you can earn a nice pocket money by placing Google Ads on your page. This may only be \u20ac 0.03 per visit, but it is completely effortless once you have a website that is well attended. More views also means more money, so bring your website to the attention of your acquaintances. A disadvantage of Google Adsense is that many people nowadays use adblockers, so that the ads are not seen and it also yields nothing to you. Keep in mind that it takes a lot of time and effort to set up a well-visited website, so it's not easy to earn! 2. Complete surveys Through many sites you can sign up to fill in online surveys of the most diverse companies. You get small fees for this and sometimes even other rewards in the form of gift vouchers. What you earn per completed survey varies per survey, from \u20ac 0.50 to \u20ac 5.00 each. Remember that filling in takes time and you often have to leave your data behind. It is therefore advisable to create a new e-mail address where you receive all the advertising you will receive after leaving your data. 3. Read e-mails Another way to earn some extra money in an easy way is by opening (many) advertising emails. There are several websites where you can register for such mailing lists. You will receive e-mails from affiliated partners with advertising, and for every open e-mail you get between \u20ac 0.005 and \u20ac 0.05. This of course does not mean anything, but if you open one hundred e-mails one day, that's quickly around \u20ac 1, - to \u20ac 3, - per day. That is not exactly to write home about, but if you do this well every day, you will earn about \u20ac 700, - easily earned money per year. You have to register via multiple websites (so that you get more emails) and every day nicely your mailbox full of advertisements. 4. Gambling A controversial activity in the Netherlands but one that is legal for now: gambling. If you feel good about numbers and cards, there may be a market for you in the poker world. You obviously need a starting capital so you can participate in tournaments and regular online gaming tables, but if you have a little talent for it, you can earn a nice penny.Another form of gambling that is gaining in popularity is gambling at sports competitions. You can bet on all aspects of all possible sports competitions. If you are a bit aware of the news, the form and the possible injuries of teams or players, you can possibly take advantage of that. How much you earn with gambling depends entirely on the amount you want / dare to bet and whether you actually win. ",

Just take a look at how making money with apps works. The following nine free mobile phone apps can do just that. You can even make up to 100 euros a day with them. This is how you can earn money with these 9 apps - by the way You don't have to become an influencer or play poker to make money online.

We present the best \"micro-jobs\" for the smartphone that you can easily integrate into your everyday life - even on the sofa or on the way to work in the subway. Make money with apps - these are the best applications. # 1 CashQuiz Are you already a fan of QuizDuell and programs like \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" you should like this app: Every CashQuiz user has the chance to win up to 100 euros a day. For this you have to answer - surprise - in a duel with other quiz questions on different levels. If you play against friends, you collect points that you can exchange for vouchers. The app is available for Android and iOS. **Note**If you want a even better way to make money online feel free to send me an email at brineedm@gmail. com and I'll send you some free training. # 2 Streetspotr, Roamler, AppJobber, Streetbees If you are constantly on the move, these mobile applications could be something for you. According to Noizz, they should even bring the most money to mobile phone apps on average. The concept is similar for all of them: You walk through your city and fulfill orders from companies. For them you can find out how and where their products are placed. You can also find out restaurant opening times or post reviews of purchases. The remuneration is based on the workload. It will be credited to your user account. The apps are available for Android and iOS. # 3 iGraal The principle of this mobile phone app is simple: you earn money with your smartphone via cashback. This means that you will receive a commission for each purchase in one of the partner shops. But that also means that you are dependent on the app. If you shop the products outside of the application, you will not get this discount in any case. After all, you can also have monetary values \u200b\u200bof 20 euros or more paid out to your PayPal account. The app is available for Android and iOS. # 4 Fotolia Instant Hobby photographers can do it too: earn money on the side. You simply upload the photos and videos you have shot yourself and offer them for sale. There is a commission for every picture sold, which is based on your ranking as a Fotolia photographer and the demand for your pictures. If you have accumulated a certain amount of money, you can have it paid out. Earning money with the app has never been easier. By the way, don't be unsettled: a picture can only bring in 40 cents or one euro, but it can still be bought thousands of times. That adds up. In addition, your most beautiful photos will be distributed all over the world. The app is available for Android and iOS. # 5 Isay, market agent These two mobile phone apps, among others, satisfy your need to express your opinion. You will receive surveys on your smartphone tailored to your user profile, which you simply have to answer and send back. This expenditure of time is rewarded with money. From certain accumulated monetary values, you get them paid out. Market Agent also gives you the opportunity to test products for free. But of course you have to give your address. The app is available for Android and iOS. # 6 Slidejoy Earn money with the app with your lock screen? Sounds strange, but that's how it is. The concept of the Slidejoy app makes it possible. The effort is relatively low: every time you unlock your phone, an ad pops up that is tailored to your personal interests. Swipe right to get rid of it and left to view the information. No matter what you do, there are \"Carats\" as a reward for every advertisement. You can redeem these for vouchers or money that you can have paid out via PayPal or donate to charitable organizations. **Note**If you want a even better way to make money online feel free to send me an email at brineedm@gmail. com and I'll send you some free training. The app is available for Android and iOS. # 7 Gold donkey Watching video clips, writing reviews, taking part in surveys - you do that every day with your smartphone anyway, right? Then start making coal. This is possible with the Goldesel app. With every completed \"task\" you receive credit in your account, which you can exchange for Amazon vouchers, Google Play Store or iTunes credit or have it paid out directly. The app is available for Android and iOS. # 8 Swagbucks Swagbucks is a portal that works with point currency. You can then redeem these later for free vouchers or PayPal money. There are eight different ways to earn money, including answering (making money with surveys), watching (making money by watching videos), and searching (using Swagbuck Internet search and making money). Allegedly, 250 million euros have already been paid out to over 50 million members. The app is available for Android and iOS. # 9 BlaBlaCar Maybe you've tried them before. It is a car sharing agency. All bookings are made via the app and, depending on the driver, also the payment. So the next time you have a car ride ahead of you and still have space in the cart, register and take some (hopefully) nice people with you - and earn money with the app, after all, the fuel costs are shared. The app is available for Android and iOS. Earning money with mobile phone apps: It's that simple. **Note**If you want a even better way to make money online feel free to send me an email at brineedm@gmail. com and I'll send you some free training.

            "answer_text": "I would suggest to start as Affiliate Marketer !  There are HUGE benefits to promoting affiliate programs. Let\u2019s look at 15 of the best reasons to join affiliate programs. 1.No Production Costs: With affiliate programs production costs aren\u2019t an issue. The product has been developed and proven \u2013 all on the merchant\u2019s nickel. 2.Low Set-Up Cost: Compared with building a brick and mortar store, starting a home-based Internet business is relatively cheap. You probably already have a desk, Internet-connected computer and word-processing software, which is all the equipment you may need to start making easy money from affiliate programs. 3.No Fees or Licenses:Let us say that one were to compare doing business as an affiliate, with distributing a line of products in the real world. The biggest difference is that the distributor must often pay for a license to distribute products within a limited geographic region. Affiliate programs on the other hand, are usually free to join, and geographic market reach is limited only by the affiliate\u2019s ability to promote his website. 4.Sell Almost Anything: What isn\u2019t sold online? That list must be shorter than the one describing all that IS sold online. There are thousands and thousands of affiliate programs selling every product under the sun. That makes it easy to find products related to your current or planned web site. 5.No Sales Experience Required: Companies often provide excellent marketing material. Using their sales copy, you are able to get an affiliate site up in less than a day. 6.No Employees: Employee salaries are usually the biggest business expense. Although you may need or want someone to work for you on occasion, you\u2019ll never have to worry about hiring full or part-time employees while working as an affiliate marketer.When you have a project you want to hire out, it is easy to find specialists in every computer-related field who can work for you from the comfort of THEIR own homes. You pay only for the project, and never have to worry about ongoing employee related benefits and deductions. 7.No Merchant Accounts: Setting up a merchant account is time-consuming and costly. However, affiliate marketers don\u2019t need merchant account. Merchants bear all the costs for payment processing. As an affiliate, you\u2019ll never lose sleep over chargebacks, fraud or losing your merchant account. 8.No Inventory: As an affiliate marketer, you can sell large items without storage concerns, even if you live in a small one-bedroom apartment. 9.No Order-Processing: Forget the problems associated with collecting and storing names, addresses, credit card numbers, etc. The merchant does all that! 10.No Shipping: The cost and hassle to prepare and ship products to customers worldwide could be staggering. Affiliates never have to worry about packaging supplies or postal rates. 11.No Customer Service: Do you hate the prospect of dealing with nasty people or customer complaints? Don\u2019t worry about it! The merchant handles the snivelers. 12.Make Money While You Sleep: What other business allows you as a sole proprietor to keep your doors open and keep making money even when you take breaks or after you go home for the night? 13.Worldwide Marketplace: The Internet is the world\u2019s largest marketplace. You can drive more visitors to your online store in a day, than a small-town merchant will see in his or her brick and mortar business in a year. 14.Minimal Risk: The product you chose isn\u2019t making money? Dump it. Take down your links and promote another! It\u2019s that easy. There are no long-term contracts binding you to products that don\u2019t sel 15.High Income Potential: If you have a job, your salary or hourly wage is probably pre-determined. Maybe there\u2019s not much, other than working overtime, that you can do to increase your income. With your own affiliate business on the Internet your income potential is limited only by your desire, effort and imagination. No other business is so inexpensive to start yet offers such high profit potential without investing years of labor.Affiliate programs enable you to work from Almost Anywhere in the World! Best Wishes. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Start an eCommerce Site and Sell Physical Products  If finding a better solution to a problem hundreds or thousands of people have doesn\u2019t seem like an option right now, you might be better off setting up a virtual shop and selling physical items. These days, this couldn\u2019t be easier. Sites like Shopify have made it easier than ever to build a customizable, powerful eCommerce site in a weekend and start selling products now. This is probably one of the oldest and most time-tested ways of making money online. Plenty of digital entrepreneurs have created sustainable businesses by either: Creating physical products they know people in their niche will lovePurchasing low cost goods manufactured in foreign countries, repackaging or combining them with other products, and selling them for higher prices on domestic online marketplaces2. Find Freelance Clients and Sell Your Services If you have a marketable skill\u2014like writing, designing, web development, marketing, project management, or anything else\u2014one of the easiest ways to make sustainable extra money online is to start freelancing. And while freelancing might not be as scalable as some of the other ideas we\u2019ve spoken about, it\u2019s not uncommon for solopreneurs to build healthy six-figure freelance businesses for themselves. (In fact, I\u2019ve interviewed tons of them on my podcast!) Today, over 54 million Americans are opting to forego traditional careers and start a freelance business. There\u2019s plenty of work and clients to be found. If you know where to look. To start, you need to know if there is enough demand for your skill to make it worth the effort to go out looking for work. Start by searching for freelance postings on sites like Flexjobs, SolidGigs, Contena, greatcontent or one of the dozens of other skill-specific freelance job boards. How many postings are there for jobs similar to what you do? If there\u2019s a decent amount and it looks like there\u2019s steady demand, put those skills down on a shortlist and start researching the companies and industries that are hiring. 3. Start Online Coaching and Sell Your Advice  Similar to selling your freelance services, you can also start selling your knowledge and advice in an area you specialize in as a coach or consultant. If you can bill yourself as an expert, there are tons of people out there willing to pay for your time. Being an online coach or consultant is a great way to make money online, as instead of giving your client ongoing deliverables (like when you\u2019re a freelancer), you\u2019re teaching them to be better, faster, stronger than the competition. Your expertise becomes the product you\u2019re selling. Even better, if you can find ways to package your experience and coaching skills into an easily digestible program, you have the potential to significantly scale this business model. Now, if you don\u2019t know people who might want your coaching services, there are a number of online tools and communities that make it incredibly easy to find clients and teach, on just about any topic area you can think of. Community driven platforms like Savvy. is, Clarity. fm, and Coachme provide you with a network of potential clients to interact with, as well an integrated payment solution. And while it\u2019s one of the most limited businesses as you\u2019re only able to charge for the time you can provide, many online coaches make hundreds or even thousands for their packages. Let's know something more about making money online. ",

            "answer_text": "Freelance writing is one of the most popular ways to earn money online. Many successful freelancers can earn an average of 50 cents to a dollar per word. Some are earning twice that! Of course, it doesn\u2019t start out like that. You\u2019ve got to build your portfolio and your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, blah blah blah. If you\u2019re interested in writing, I\u2019m sure you know this. If you\u2019re not interested in writing, I wouldn\u2019t recommend traveling down this road just for the money. It takes dedication and time, though it can be highly profitable if it\u2019s what you love. Assuming it is what you love, let\u2019s talk about making money with it. Before you decide to start reaching out to all of these freelance writing companies, you need to have a web presence. You need a blog (in my humble blogger opinion, of course). Or you could just have an online portfolio. Even a LinkedIn profile works to get started. When you\u2019re ready to start, here are 150 resources to help you write better, faster and more persuasively. Now for what you\u2019ve all been waiting for; once you\u2019re ready to actually start making money, here are 10 websites you can start with: Listverse \u2013 Listverse pays $100 for each accepted post. The article must be a list, it must be at least 1,500 words and you must include at least 10 things. Other than that, you can get pretty creative with it.TopTenz \u2013 TopTenz pays $50 for each accepted post. Again, the article has to be in a list format and it must be at least 1,500 words, with few exceptions. They post often so your chances of getting accepted are fairly high.A List Apart \u2013 A List Apart pays $200 for each accepted post. They\u2019re not first on the list, because they tend to publish less articles, which means you have a smaller chance of getting accepted. Same guidelines as above, 1,500 word minimum.International Living \u2013 International Living pays $75 for each accepted post. They are mostly looking for travel experiences from countries you have visited. For this site, it\u2019s more about your experience than your writing ability.FundsforWriters \u2013 FundsforWriters pays $50 for each accepted post. They are looking for articles about writing and making money with it. They only accept articles between 500-600 words, but they want you to make each word count.Uxbooth \u2013 Uxbooth pays $100 for each accepted post. They do tend to take four to eight weeks to accept and post articles, so don\u2019t count on this being a quick money maker. They take so long, because they pair with editors to only publish amazing content.iWriter \u2013 iWriter pays up to $15 for each accepted post. That may seem small, but they aren\u2019t as strict as many of the others above and they also allow you to pick exactly what you write. You can write as many or as few articles as you want.Textbroker \u2013 Textbroker pays up to five cents per word, if you\u2019re a 5-star writer. You\u2019ll start by submitting a short sample article and you will most likely start as a 3-star writer, but you can work your way up by writing more and writing great content.Matador Network \u2013 Matador Network pays up to $60 for each accepted post, but standard pay is around $20-$25. They don\u2019t really focus on a minimum word count, but they have a maximum count of 1,500 words.The Penny Hoarder \u2013 The Penny Hoarder pays up to $800 (rarely), depending upon the number of page views you receive. The pay starts at $100 for 50,000 page views, so this isn\u2019t a guaranteed paid article, but it can potentially be highly rewarding.There\u2019s no doubt that you can make money with freelance writing, but it\u2019s a process. Once you start building your portfolio and your writing skills, you can start making some serious money. If you\u2019re not an experienced writer, expect to put some time in before you really start to see some dough. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways to earn money from the internet:) Even I\u2019ve earned money from internet. I\u2019ve come across many income sources on the internet. Here now I would like to share my experiences and knowledge regarding earning money from the internet.  How I have earned money from the internet? In my 20s I\u2019ve been figuring out many passive income streams. So I found some ways to earn money from internet. Let me elaborate on some income streams from the internet- On the internet, I earned money by selling e-books The first income which I earned from the internet is through ebooks. Actually I was reading newspapers and was very aware of current affairs. So I thought I should share my knowledge with aspiring students who were preparing for competitive exams. Then I created the quiz books. This was all about general awareness quiz. In my first book, I covered current affairs quiz around 3 months. It was very useful for those who were preparing for competitive exams. So I earned money from these ebooks. Even got some good response from students. How exactly I started to earn money from ebooks on the internet? First I prepared the PDF of my ebook. I think I took around 15 days to create it. Well, I don\u2019t remember how many days I exactly took to write that ebook. But I covered almost all important current affairs in the form of quiz as Multiple Choice Questions (with answers). Then I found an online platform where I can list my book and sell. The platform was \u201cInstamojo\u201d. Here one can sign up easily by filing all the details. And the main required document is the PAN card. Then other details like bank account, phone number etc. So I signed up on Instamojo. I listed my ebook in the category of \u2018digital product\u2019. Then decided some reasonable price for my ebook and published my ebook. The price depends on you and the quality of content. I mean who can decide the price of the book. If your ebook will be really useful for people then you can keep the price high. But you must analyse your audience first. So after publishing my ebook, I started to promote my ebook. I shared my ebook on my FB page, Instagram page, FB group and even on my YouTube channel. So wherever possible I tried to promote that ebook. Then people started to buy my ebook. Whenever they were paying for my ebook on Instamojo, Intamojo was transferring my money to my bank account within 2-3 days. And hann .. Instamojo deducts it\u2019s 2-3% on every sale. Signing up, listing the book, everything is free. But when anyone purchases your ebook, it charges 2-3% commission then transfer your money to your bank account. This is actually a good service. So if you think you have good knowledge of any particular topic then you can write your own ebook and sell. But I advise not to copy anybody\u2019s book or ebook. Create your own, share your knowledge through your writing. Other income streams on the internet-  I have tried other income streams also on the internet. And I\u2019ve answered this question on Quora with details. You can check that answer too. ( Note: I\u2019ve created the above infographics. All the infographics are subject to copyright. So kindly mention the source if you want to use them anywhere.) ",

            "answer_text": "The internet is more than a source of news and entertainment gossip. Today, tens of billions of dollars are being exchanged via a multitude of legitimate activities. More and more people are starting their own businesses on the internet and making money online. Some are even turning their online ventures into full-time internet businesses. Are you ready to turn your passions into profits and start your own online business but not sure where to get started? Let's take a look at seven ways to make money online that won't require a lot of time or cut into your regular routine. Think of these options as supplemental sources of income with the potential in some cases to be a whole lot more. 01 Starting Your Own Blog  supermimicry / E+ / Getty Images One of the most popular ways to make money online is by starting your own blog. You can start your blog around just about any topic that you're passionate about, but you may want to consider choosing a profitable niche market if you intend to make money with your blog. Use your blog to share hobbies, thoughts, and passions with others and use your blog to make real connections with people. The mechanics are straightforward, and you'll be able to profit with your blog via online advertising (e.g. Google Adwords), affiliate marketing (see below), and subscriber-based lists to produce a steady stream of income. There are many ways to make money with a blog. This is one of the fastest ways to get your own piece of \"virtual real estate\". One thing to keep in mind is that these days there really is little difference between a website and a blog. Most websites are actually run on blog based content management systems, such as WordPress. Your blog doesn't just have to include blog posts, but can include regular web pages, sales pages, e-commerce, product pages, etc. 02 Affiliate Marketing  Enis Aksoy/Getty Images Even if you don't have your own products or services to sell, affiliate marketing gives you a chance to earn strong commissions through a series of one-time sales (or ongoing monthly sales). Online merchants provide you with an affiliate website (or a simple affiliate tracking link) and marketing support \u2013 all you have to do is promote the company with your link via social media, search engines or perhaps ideally your own website or blog (see above). With all of these methods we're discussing you'll want to be sure to build your email list so you can continually follow up with your subscribers and generate additional sales. The great thing about affiliate marketing is you don't have to create your own products, you don't have to provide any customer support, and you don't have to create your own marketing materials. All you have to do is pick a profitable market, promote the products as an affiliate and earn a commission anytime a sale is made. Affiliate marketing is one of the fastest and easiest ways to make money online. Even if you are offering your own products and services man people choose to also promote other people's products as an additional income stream to what they are already doing. 03 Start Your Own E-commerce Website  Thomas Kuhlenbeck/Getty Images Another great opportunity to make money online is with an e-commerce website/store. This is where you are selling physical products from your website. The most common (and hassle-free) way to do this is via drop shipping; where you simply take the orders on your website and use a third-party source that manufactures and ships the products for you. They key thing you'll want to do is focus on one specific niche and be a specialty store that just caters to that market, don't try to be all things to all people like an Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more. Speaking of Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more, though you may want to tap into other websites such as Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more, Electronics, Cars, Fashion, Collectibles, Coupons and More | eBay, Shop for handmade, vintage, custom, and unique gifts for everyone, etc. as a way of reaching additional people you want to be sure that you have your own web presence with your own store so that you have 100% control over your business. 04 Online Publishing (E-books)  John Lamb/Digital Vision/Getty Images Regardless of your current occupation and lifestyle, there is probably a book inside of you that's screaming to get out. Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) platform has given thousands of people a chance to become published authors and earn money. It may also serve as a way to get noticed by more established and traditional publishers. Not only can you sell ebooks on platforms like Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more; but you can also sell ebooks directly from your own website as well. This allows you to sell your ebooks at higher prices and get all of the profits. You can also repackage multiple ebooks into larger \"packages\" or use the ebooks as a foundation to sell higher-ticket online courses or even coaching and consulting services. Publishing ebooks is a great way to make passive income, grow into bigger projects, and establish your authority as an expert in your market. With simple to use tools, access to outsourcing graphics, cover design, etc. anybody can self-publish a book and have the same professional presence and credibility as a big publishing house. For many people, the idea of writing a book can be intimidating but keep in mind that if you are writing ebooks that you're selling on your own website or publishing to Amazon Kindle you can write shorter books that are more focused on a specific niche or issue... you don't have a write extremely long books that take months or years to crank out. 05 Online Surveys  Getty Images/Peter Dazeley Online surveys are one of the easiest ways to earn extra cash. Brand name corporations and market research firms are desperately seeking people's opinions on products and services and will offer good remuneration for it. Depending on their complexity, each survey can be worth five, ten or more dollars. There are many reputable survey companies to choose from, but you may want to limit yourself to 3-5 in the beginning. Stick with the survey companies that give you plenty of surveys to take and pay a decent amount and stop using the services that don't end up being worth your time. You also want to avoid illegitimate companies; as this field is widespread with scam opportunities that will take a lot of your time and pay you very little money or even scam you out of your money. Though you're probably not going to be able to make a full-time income taking surveys it is a realistic way to make a couple hundred extra dollars a month. 06 Online Freelancing  svetikd/E+/Getty Images If you have specific writing/journalism skills or are adept in various IT/software domains, freelancing may prove to be a lucrative source of secondary income. Increasingly, companies are implementing a content marketing strategy and turning to outside sources for specific assignments, and if you can prove your worth there will be more work available. Even simple skills like data entry may be to your liking, provide you can offer at least 5-10 hours weekly. All you need is a computer with an Internet connection and the desire to build a respectable clientele. Chances are that these opportunities will allow you to gain valuable experience and skills that will prove valuable in your existing business and professional career. If you're already writing ebooks in a particular niche market (see above) then why not make your services available for other companies; as you already have the expertise to take on the niche writing assignments. Though it's not really a passive income stream, doing freelance work is one of the fastest ways to generate income. 07 Coaching and Consulting Online  Getty Images/FaberrInk With the low cost of communication and technology, you can connect with anyone around the world. If you're already making money selling information online via Kindle books, affiliate marketing, or your own information products as mentioned above then you definitely have the opportunity to add coaching and consulting online as a source of revenue. This isn't nearly as scary is it sounds if you've never done it before. Most people who are buying from you would love the opportunity to speak with you to answer specific questions and get personalized advice. With tools like Skype, video conferencing, and webinar technology you can offer one-on-one calls, group coaching calls, and small mastermind meetings. A simple Kindle book or ebook sale can lead to a high-end client who wants to pay to work with you one-on-one.

            "answer_text": "The Internet today provides many home-based employment opportunities for people who find it necessary to make some extra income to make ends meet. With the ever-rising levels of inflation that characterize day-to-life in these times, even those individuals with secure jobs and working salaries are forced to search for more monetary provisions to sustain their budgetary requirements. A number of websites on the Internet focus primarily on providing skilled workers and paying contractors with a platform to meet & greet, and thereby engage in mutually profitable transactions with each other. Upwork and Fiverr are some famous examples of these new-age remote working platforms, with Freelancer - Hire & Find Jobs[1] proving itself to be a fierce contender to their two-fold online dominance. Many professional workers have established entire careers on these virtual venues, and continue to earn as much (if not more) than many of their peers working in brick \u2018n\u2019 mortar offices. Another way to work through the Internet and earn money is to set up your own business concern on a social media platform like Facebook or Instagram - or develop your own website from scratch. By being an entrepreneur (and one\u2019s own boss), many people get to evade the constant strife, cultural decadence and turmoil of a messy office life, and focus more productively on their passion. If you perform a casual Facebook search on the kinds of remote businesses currently operational on its network, you may discover an entire range of bakery shops, freelance writing & software development firms, and even legal affiliates offering their services to the public. In order to work through the Internet (be it under your own venture or for a contractor), it is important to subscribe to a high-speed Internet service. Charter in the U.S is a recommended example of such a service, and its stellar support team (reachable through the Charter Internet Service Area[2]) makes your subscription experience highly memorable.

            "answer_text": "Dear Dikshant Thank you very much for your amazing question. I am so delighted to meet a soul mate who is still looking for financial freedom. Nature gave us a super computer that we have named the human brain. It took thousands of years of evolution to get such an amazing tool that we possess now. Nobody in human history has had the access to knowledge that we have today. It is time to use this potential to liberate ourselves from financial slavery. Too much information is available nowadays. So, it is not easy to find the right source. First of all, we live in the Internet era. It would be silly not to use such an asset. Secondly, if you made a decision to start your own business, the least financially risky way is to start up an online business. Thirdly, please do not think of setting up a retail business at least in the beginning. Fourthly, never invest an amount of money which would dramatically impact on your life in a negative way in case of business failure. Use only money that you can afford to lose without painful consequences for you and your family. Fifthly, take an inexpensive test as experimentation to see if your business will work or not. It doesn`t matter how confident you are about the success of your business idea. I would highly recommend Affiliate Internet Marketing to start with. The main reason is this is the cheapest and most effective approach to start up your own business which can grow gradually. The idea of affiliate marketing is very simple. You promote products and services of other people on your own website and you show and explain why these products are good, and you give the link to a direct website of the company that produces the products or services. If a person buys the product or service, the company transfer you % from sale. For example, if you are successful in promoting a $10000 holiday trip and a customer found information out about this trip and if he clicks on the link of a tourist company from your website and buys this trip, in that case a travel company will pay you commission for example 10% which is $1000. % from sales can vary and depend on companies\u2019 policies whom you promote. Usually, it is between 1-10% and sometimes up to 50%. This scheme works 24hours a day without any weekends or holidays. If you would like to know more about affiliate marketing, please feel free to ask. I would be more than happy to help you out. Kind regards, Andrey  ",

Your interests are indeed important and so are your overall goals for WHY you actually want to make money online. Is it because you\u2019re desiring the modern-day \u2018laptop lifestyle\u2019 in order to be geographically free? Do you wish to make a few bucks a day in extra cash? Or, do you want to build up a 7-to-8-figure online business? Everything is possible. Everything is achieved differently. I think that the best way to answer this question (since it is fairly broad) would be to tell you a little bit more about how I make money online myself. I am a full-time laptop/digital entrepreneur and have been for the past 3 years. For me, my income gets generated in 3 different ways: I run a funnel building agency where we strategize, build and design sales and marketing funnels for businesses and entrepreneurs. It\u2019s quite exciting really because we work with international companies in all sorts of industries and markets.Next, I co-created an online course program together with 2 business partners of mine. It\u2019s an Academy really, called Funnel Pro Academy. We specialize in teaching people the essentials on what it takes to strategize and build successful sales funnels for themselves, how to scale them to 6-figures and how to potentially use this newly acquired skills and sell them to potential clients in order to do those \u2018funnel services\u2019 for them.Finally, I earn regular affiliate income from the different services and softwares I recommend to my clients as well as students.I make well over 5-figures a month from all of this and by scaling each of the income streams, my team and I are going to hit 6-figure months pretty soon. Anyway, I hope that this post didn\u2019t come across as salesy at all. I just wanted to give you some ideas and let you know a little bit more of what a digital entrepreneur potentially can do and the kind of money we make - plus, where it actually comes from. Hope it helps.  ",

You could source products from ClickBank, Commission Junction, Rakuten Marketing, Share-a-Sale,Impact Radius and many others. Plus, many of the larger companies have their own affiliate programs as well. Do your due diligence and find the right company with a relevant product or service to your audience that you can sell as an affiliate. In some cases, you will need an active website with substantial traffic to get approved. Selling as an affiliate isn't easy by any means, but if you do have the audience, it can definitely amount to a substantial amount of income. Start a blog. If you're serious about making money online, start a blog. Blogging is one of the easiest and most sustainable income sources. As long as the blog is setup the right way, in the right niche, with the right content targeted at the right audience, and the offer is complementary to the content, you could make a tremendous amount of passive income from a blog. While some might think that starting a blog is an arduous effort, when you understand the precise steps you need to take, it becomes far easier. It all starts in the decision of choosing a profitable niche and picking the right domain name. From there, you need to build your offers. You can easily sell things like mini-email courses, full-blown trainings, ebooks, and so on. Email marketing. The money is most certainly in the list. If you're at all interested in online marketing, setup email software and create a lead magnet that you can use in your sales funnel. Then, build up that list. It's often said that you can expect to earn about $1 per subscriber per month. If you have a list of 10,000 subscribers, that means you can earn roughly around $10,000 per month. You will need to deliver value and not pitch them on every email, but it is a very achievable goal in a short period. There are many ways to get people onto your list. Lead magnets are one such resource. For example, you can build ebooks, checklists and cheat sheets. But you can also do content upgrades, such as PDF versions of an article with added resources in them, four-part video training series, and more. Think about your audience and what you can offer them to better serve them, then treat them with some respect and you'll eventually reap the rewards. ",

            "answer_text": "What Is Affiliate Marketing? Affiliate marketing is the process by which an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another person\u2019s or company\u2019s products. The affiliate simply searches for a product they enjoy, then promotes that product and earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make. The sales are tracked via affiliate links from one website to another.

Join today to grow your revenue with the leading ecommerce platform. Industry-leading commissions Pre-made content for your website A dedicated account manager focused on your success JOIN TODAY How Does Affiliate Marketing Work? Because affiliate marketing works by spreading the responsibilities of product marketing and creation across parties, it manages to leverage the abilities of a variety of individuals for a more effective marketing strategy while providing contributors with a share of the profit. To make this work, three different parties must be involved: Seller and product creators. The affiliate or advertiser. The consumer. Let\u2019s delve into the complex relationship these three parties share to ensure affiliate marketing is a success. 1. Seller and product creators. The seller, whether a solo entrepreneur or large enterprise, is a vendor, merchant, product creator, or retailer with a product to market. The product can be a physical object, like household goods, or a service, like makeup tutorials. Also known as the brand, the seller does not need to be actively involved in the marketing, but they may also be the advertiser and profit from the revenue sharing associated with affiliate marketing. 2. The affiliate or publisher. Also known as a publisher, the affiliate can be either an individual or a company that markets the seller\u2019s product in an appealing way to potential consumers. In other words, the affiliate promotes the product to persuade consumers that it is valuable or beneficial to them and convince them to purchase the product. If the consumer does end up buying the product, the affiliate receives a portion of the revenue made. Affiliates often have a very specific audience to whom they market, generally adhering to that audience\u2019s interests. This creates a defined niche or personal brand that helps the affiliate attract consumers who will be most likely to act on the promotion. 3. The consumer. Whether the consumer knows it or not, they (and their purchases) are the drivers of affiliate marketing. Affiliates share these products with them on social media, blogs, and websites. When consumers buy the product, the seller and the affiliate share the profits. Sometimes the affiliate will choose to be upfront with the consumer by disclosing that they are receiving commission for the sales they make. Other times the consumer may be completely oblivious to the affiliate marketing infrastructure behind their purchase. Either way, they will rarely pay more for the product purchased through affiliate marketing; the affiliate\u2019s share of the profit is included in the retail price. The consumer will complete the purchase process and receive the product as normal, unaffected by the affiliate marketing system in which they are a significant part. How Do Affiliate Marketers Get Paid? A quick and inexpensive method of making money without the hassle of actually selling a product, affiliate marketing has an undeniable draw for those looking to increase their income online. But how does an affiliate get paid after linking the seller to the consumer? The answer is complicated. The consumer doesn\u2019t always need to buy the product for the affiliate to get a kickback. Depending on the program, the affiliate\u2019s contribution to the seller\u2019s sales will be measured differently. The affiliate may get paid in various ways: 1. Pay per sale. This is the standard affiliate marketing structure. In this program, the merchant pays the affiliate a percentage of the sale price of the product after the consumer purchases the product as a result of the affiliate\u2019s marketing strategies. In other words, the affiliate must actually get the investor to invest in the product before they are compensated. 2. Pay per lead. A more complex system, this program compensates the affiliate based on the conversion of leads. The affiliate must persuade the consumer to visit the merchant\u2019s website and complete the desired action \u2014 whether it\u2019s filling out a contact form, signing up for a trial of a product, subscribing to a newsletter, or downloading software or files. 3. Pay per click. This program focuses on incentivizing the affiliate to redirect consumers from their marketing platform to the merchant\u2019s website. This means the affiliate must engage the consumer to the extent that they will move from the affiliate\u2019s site to the merchant\u2019s site. The affiliate is paid based on the increase in web traffic. Why Be an Affiliate Marketer? What are the reasons to become an affiliate marketer? 1. Passive income. While any \u201cregular\u201d job requires you to be at work to make money, affiliate marketing offers you the ability to make money while you sleep. By investing an initial amount of time into a campaign, you will see continuous returns on that time as consumers purchase the product over the following days and weeks. You receive money for your work long after you\u2019ve finished it. Even when you\u2019re not in front of your computer, your marketing skills will be earning you a steady flow of income. 2. No customer support. Individual sellers and companies offering products or services have to deal with their consumers and ensure they are satisfied with what they have purchased. Thanks to the affiliate marketing structure, you\u2019ll never have to be concerned with customer support or customer satisfaction. The entire job of the affiliate marketer is to link the seller with the consumer. The seller deals with any consumer complaints after you receive your commission from the sale. 3. Work from home. If you\u2019re someone who hates going to the office, affiliate marketing is the perfect solution. You\u2019ll be able to launch campaigns and receive revenue from the products that sellers create while working from the comfort of your own home. This is a job you can do without ever getting out of your pajamas. 4. Cost effective. Most businesses require startup fees as well as a cash flow to finance the products being sold. However, affiliate marketing can be done at a low cost, meaning you can get started quickly and without much hassle. There are no affiliate program fees to worry about and no need to create a product. Beginning this line of work is relatively straightforward. 5. Convenient and flexible. Since you\u2019re essentially a freelancer, you get ultimate independence in setting your own goals, redirecting your path when you feel so inclined, choosing the products that interest you, and even determining your own hours. This convenience means you can diversify your portfolio if you like or focus solely on simple and straightforward campaigns. You\u2019ll also be free from company restrictions and regulations as well as ill-performing teams. 6. Performance-Based rewards. With other jobs, you could work an 80-hour week and still earn the same salary. Affiliate marketing is purely based on your performance. You\u2019ll get from it what you put into it. Honing your reviewing skills and writing engaging campaigns will translate to direct improvements in your revenue. You\u2019ll finally get paid for the outstanding work you do! Common Types of Affiliate Marketing Channels Most affiliates share common practices to ensure that their audience is engaged and receptive to purchasing promoted products. But not all affiliates advertise the products in the same way. In fact, there are several different marketing channels they may leverage. 1. Influencers. An influencer is an individual who holds the power to impact the purchasing decisions of a large segment of the population. This person is in a great position to benefit from affiliate marketing. They already boast an impressive following, so it\u2019s easy for them to direct consumers to the seller\u2019s products through social media posts, blogs, and other interactions with their followers. The influencers then receive a share of the profits they helped to create. 2. Bloggers. With the ability to rank organically in search engine queries, bloggers excel at increasing a seller\u2019s conversions. The blogger samples the product or service and then writes a comprehensive review that promotes the brand in a compelling way, driving traffic back to the seller\u2019s site. The blogger is awarded for his or her influence spreading the word about the value of the product, helping to improve the seller\u2019s sales. 3. Paid search focused microsites. Developing and monetizing microsites can also garner a serious amount of sales. These sites are advertised within a partner site or on the sponsored listings of a search engine. They are distinct and separate from the organization\u2019s main site. By offering more focused, relevant content to a specific audience, microsites lead to increased conversions due to their simple and straightforward call to action. 4. Email lists. Despite its older origins, email marketing is still a viable source of affiliate marketing income. Some affiliates have email lists they can use to promote the seller\u2019s products. Others may leverage email newsletters that include hyperlinks to products, earning a commission after the consumer purchases the product. Another method is for the affiliate to cultivate email lists over time. They use their various campaigns to collect emails en masse, then send out emails regarding the products they are promoting. 5. Large media websites. Designed to create a huge amount of traffic at all times, these sites focus on building an audience of millions. These websites promote products to their massive audience through the use of banners and contextual affiliate links. This method offers superior exposure and improves conversion rates, resulting in a top-notch revenue for both the seller and the affiliate. Tips to Help You Become A Successful Affiliate Marketer 1. Develop a rapport. When beginning your affiliate marketing career, you\u2019ll want to cultivate an audience that has very specific interests. This allows you to tailor your affiliate campaigns to that niche, increasing the likelihood that you\u2019ll convert. By establishing yourself as an expert in one area instead of promoting a large array of products, you\u2019ll be able to market to the people most likely to buy the product. 2. Make it personal. There is no shortage of products you\u2019ll be able to promote. You\u2019ll have the ability to pick and choose products that you personally believe in, so make sure that your campaigns center around truly valuable products that consumers will enjoy. You\u2019ll achieve an impressive conversion rate while simultaneously establishing the reliability of your personal brand. 3. Start reviewing products. Focus on reviewing products that fall within your niche. Then, leveraging the rapport you have created with your audience and your stance as an expert, tell your readers why they would benefit from purchasing the product you are promoting. It is especially effective to compare this product to others in the same category. Most importantly, make sure you are generating detailed, articulate content to improve conversions. 4. Use several sources. Instead of focusing on just an email campaign, also spend time making money with a blog, reaching out to your audience on social media, and even looking into cross-channel promotions. Test a variety of marketing strategies to see which one your audience responds to the most. Make frequent use of this technique. 5. Choose campaigns with care. No matter how good your marketing skills are, you\u2019ll make less money on a bad product than you will on a valuable one. Take the time to study the demand for a product before promoting it. Make sure to research the seller with care before teaming up. Your time is worth a lot, and you want to be sure you\u2019re spending it on a product that is profitable and a seller you can believe in. 6. Stay current with trends. There is serious competition in the affiliate marketing sphere. You\u2019ll want to make sure you stay on top of any new trends to ensure you remain competitive. Additionally, you\u2019ll likely be able to benefit from at least a few of the new marketing techniques that are constantly being created. Be sure you\u2019re keeping up to date on all these new strategies to guarantee that your conversion rates, and therefore revenue, will be as high as possible. Start Affiliate Marketing FREE today ",

            "answer_text": "Affiliate marketing is one of the most popular ways of making money online. It is about a relationship between three main parties: the affiliate (publisher), the merchant (advertiser), and the customer. Affiliates act as extended sales and marketing departments of the merchants and help the customers choose products. Affiliate marketing can provide you with a steady flow of income. What you can earn depends on how successful you are in converting your audience into buyers and service subscribers. It is cost effective and you can work from any place in the world. Sounds easy, doesn\u2019t it? Although affiliate marketing doesn\u2019t require a fortune and years of experience to get started, you shouldn\u2019t expect great results overnight. It is very competitive and you need to spend some time choosing products, making sure that they meet market needs, learn how to promote them and how to measure the success. What is affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing. When you sign up for a partner program, you are assigned a link with a unique ID that makes it possible to track all traffic you send to the advertiser\u2019s site. If your visitor clicks on it and performs the qualified action, you will receive a commission. The qualified action depends on the compensation model. The most commonly used one is pay per sale model which is based on the revenue sharing when a merchant pays an affiliate the percentage of the sale. How to become an affiliate marketer Even though becoming an affiliate marketer can seem like a lot of work, you can make your life a bit easier by organizing your work a bit. By following these steps, you will be able get your own affiliate marketing off the ground in no time. 1. Find your niche In order to succeed you need to start with three basic steps: Find your proper audience,analyze the problem your audience is facing,solve their problems and help them achieve their goals.If you are not sure what products and solutions your audience would benefit from, you should do proper research. Start with forums and websites popular in your specific industry. What are the most common questions and the most popular products? 2. Become an Expert in your niche When you write products reviews you should know more about them, than your average site visitors. Make sure you provide an honest description and accurate information. If a merchant offers a free trial, make sure to sign up and test it. You can start with the products you use and know well and share your own experience. If you decide to build a website from scratch with the purpose of affiliate marketing and the topic is completely new to you, you will have to spend a lot of time doing proper research. It can bring great results, but before you dive in, first make sure you are enthusiastic about the chosen topic. 3. Find affiliate programs to promote Once you have a category of products selected, you need to choose affiliate programs. You can either sign up for affiliate networks or choose independent programs run by the merchants. Don\u2019t choose advertisers based solely on the highest commission. There are a couple of important factors: Does the merchant have a good reputation and sell quality products? You wouldn\u2019t like to promote a brand that generates bad word of mouth. Don\u2019t forget that you are putting your reputation on the line too when promoting a product to your customers. Would you buy it yourself or recommend it to your family? If you don\u2019t trust the company, don\u2019t promote it. If you don\u2019t know the product well, check review websites and read testimonials from other users.Does the merchant look reliable? You don\u2019t want to promote the business that probably won\u2019t be on the market in a couple of months.Think about the payout. Do you prefer high one-time commission or do you prefer making money on each payment your customers make? When you promote SaaS products, a lifetime recurring commission may seem to be much more attractive in a long term. Do similar brands offer similar percentage? As mentioned before, don\u2019t fall for a very high commission and get\u2013rich\u2013quick promise.What\u2019s the performance model that works best for you? If there is not a lot of traffic on your website, don\u2019t expect to make a fortune in a pay per click model. However, if you have even a small group of loyal readers, there is a chance that they will buy a product you recommend (pay-per-sale should be your choice then).Is this program free to join and do you have to be a customer?How the lifetime cookie works? Will your visitors be assigned to your affiliate account if they return to the merchant site after several months?Check the terms and conditions for clauses in the agreement that you find unacceptable eg. whether trademark bidding on search engines is allowed.How about reports? Will you be able to easily track your results?4. Start promoting There are many traffic sources and you can try them out simultaneously to increase your chances of making money: Banners: linking images and banners to the merchant\u2019s website is the least you can do to get started. Focus on quality, not quantity. One well-placed banner is worth a thousand spread across the whole website.Social Media: testimonials on Twitter and Facebook can bring great results, but you can also try other channels. Pinterest disappointed many users by removing the affiliate links in Feb 2015 to bring them back over a year later. Now you can share photos of your recommended products (relevant to your boards!) and include affiliate links.Newsletters: collect emails from your website visitors and let them know when you publish a new post.Reviews: share your personal opinion about a product. Why do you find it useful? How did it improve your KPIs? Visitors read reviews to learn something new and find out what experience other people had with a product or service.Comparison posts\u2013 who\u2019s offering the best deal? What\u2019s the difference between product A and product B?Tutorials: step\u2013by\u2013step instructions and tips on how to make the most of the product.Resource page: recommend solutions that you use on your website.Ebook: if you consider yourself a writer and have interesting statistics or stories you\u2019d like to share, publish an ebook. You can include your affiliate links in text or images.Anything else you can think of: be creative and come up with new ideas. A comparison post doesn\u2019t have to include a table. For example, you can come up with a quiz for your audience and show the products that match their answers.Remember: Products you promote and the content you create should match. Your audience comes to your website or signs up to your newsletters to read valuable articles. Focus on your readers, the problems they may face, and how to solve them. If your content is of real value and doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s been created for the sole purpose of promotion, people will more likely click on links. 5. Monitor your results In affiliate marketing it is important to test various promotional strategies and track your online marketing efforts. Affiliate marketing done right Affiliate marketing is not as easy as it seems, but when it\u2019s done right, it\u2019s worth the effort. Foster relationships, learn every day to become an expert in your niche, and focus on creative ways to promote affiliate programs. => Join our team to learn more: Here Is Your Opportunity To CLONE Our $20k A Month Proven Affiliate Business System!

            "answer_text": "There is no magic formula to make money online, it will all require you to put in a lot of time.Sure there are many websites that want you to believe something else, they want to sell you a video course or an ebook where they explain you how they became a millionaire\u2026 The only \u2018trick\u2019 I can tell you is: buy low, sell high. This method of money making works everywhere, it is what stores do and it is what you can do. Let me give you an example. There are websites like Upwork where you can make an account and sell your skills. For example: you are a webdesigner and through this website you can find customers and offer them to build a website.The problem with Upwork (and all the similar market places) is that there are people from all over the world offering there skills, most of them for crazy low prices. So selling your skills here really isn\u2019t a good idea. Now lets turn this around. Instead of offering your skills here, you buy other peoples skills. You start a company where you offer a certain service, lets stick with webdesign for this example.You start Joe\u2019s Webdesign Company and as soon as you get a customer, instead of building this website you go to Upwork and get hire a webdesigner through there for very little money. Then you sell this website for a high price to your customer. Profit. Of course you will have to put in effort yourself: getting the customers. And I now took webdesign as an example, but you can do this for so many things. ",

            "answer_text": "YES\u2026 and that through Youtube. Its been 3 yrs\u2026 after passing out from the school/ completing 12th standard, i didn\u2019t have much things to do\u2026 so in my free time i used to explore internet and that time jio provided free data so i used to spend my whole day basically on my laptop. One day i came to know about that we can make money online from youtube. So i thought of giving it a try\u2026\u2026. first i uploaded a song video on youtube and just after 2 or 3 minutes copyright strike came on my channel (because i was a beginner at that time .. didn\u2019t know much about youtube stuff). At that point of time my dedication was on its peak so i decided not to quit and i started learning about youtube from watching videos on youtube itself. It took me about 3 to 4 months to learn each and everything . Main problem was that i didn\u2019t have my own content .. instead of that i used to post wrestling videos after editing it in such a way that it won\u2019t get noticed by youtube algorithm . Back then many people used to do these dirty tricks to earn money on youtube. So finally one day i posted a video titled \u2018\u2019BOBBY LASHLEY VS GOLDBERG\u2019\u2019\u2026 it was a wrestling video. I just posted it randomly. Next day when i checked my channel stats \u2026 i was completely shocked to the core because first time ever my video crossed 500k+ views. From that video only i made $110 (10000 in rupees) . I received that amount in my bank through google adsense. Later my video got terminated due to copyright guidelines. That is how i made money from internet. ITS YOUR BOY ISHAN ",

            "answer_text": "Start on youtube, don\u2019t start a youtube channel though,but rather start on youtube with doing research , also use quora to get information about the topic , and once you know how you can make money , decide what you want to do , and what you are going to do depending on what would be easier for you to do and then plan what you are going to do after that and all the way till the end, try creating a visual of different things in your mind after you learn some ways to make income, what type of income do you want etc\u2026Then whatever you don\u2019t understand look it up, quora and youtube, a lot of times we might think we don\u2019t understand but it\u2019s not that , a lot of times it\u2019s a matter of actually doing something and taking action , some questions might never end, you can still make money and not understand every little thing that neurotypicals usually don\u2019t care about, since they might also usually be more successful due to their willingness to take actions by being more impulsive , while adhd people or aspergers might struggle more, i know this is kind of irrelevant for most people but i had to tell. Anyway , fight analysis by paralysis , i know that for sometimes it can be psychological , people think that they don\u2019t deserve things, try to deal with your own emotions or for some people motivational talks might help, emotional intelligence = success , once some of those people get therapy or whatever they feel much better and confident A lot of times i feel like there is a lot to be told about that If you\u2019re still looking for answers check my best answer here ",

You choose the topic you find the most interesting. Now is time to work, work, work on building a system of revenue. You can create and sell products, or buy and sell other products. Products is a broad term, they can be physical or not. You can build an online business. Business is a broad term. You can just generate traffic for websites or you can build a huge complex website like Quora. If you are more of a performer, you can be on YouTube or create online courses. If you are wealthy you can also buy and flip and sell websites. Domain ownership is a business. Some people offer their services online as freelancers. There is cryptocurrency and investments in general. There are many many different systems, a little something for everyone. So begin with yourself.

            "answer_text": "I saw this question in my feed, and smiled a bit. Reminded me of a recent answer to a question, so let me steal a few of my own words from the other answer. I have been active online since the early days of when the internet went commercial in the mid 1990s. I have seen so many websites come and go with money making opportunities. If you are looking for the quick and easy way to make money on the internet, be careful out there! If you have the time to invest, there are many sites which will give you a variety of ways to earn rewards, or a few dollars. I have seen people invent a lot of time, and the rewards were relatively small. If you only invent your time and not money, you can chalk it up to a lesson learned. Be careful if you are asked to pay to join something, or put up some money upfront. The odds are against you. The one answer here tells you about how to make money writing on the internet, the text in the answer is copied word for word from other websites. It is what I call the snake oil \"sales pitch in a can.\" If someone is giving you advice or information on how to make money, how to get rich, and that is the focus of their pitch. Walk away. Run away. Find another way. I have been involved in technology all my life. There are certain topics about technology that are my passion, perhaps even an obsession. People read what I have to say because they realize I speak from experience, I am passionate about the topic. I know that writers that write without passion, that write just for the sake of writing, are starving writers. You want to be a writer? Become passionate about a topic, or solving a problem. Learn as much as you can about it. Find the stories of others who have been successful in that field. Tell others about your passion. That's a writer. Yes, there are many internet millionaires, or billionaires, but they created a product or provided a service. I've been involved in a few businesses, helped many others start up businesses. I own a few websites, helped many others create their own websites. I am not trying to sound corny or cliche, but the truly successful people in life are passionate, some are obsessed, with something that interests them, aside from making money. You are NOT going to find the answer to your question in a 1000 words or less answer on Quora. Making money on the internet is never as quick and easy as people make it sound. ",

            "answer_text": "That`s goona be a long list lol Here is what i do personally and what works for me: Here you can start with 100$ or so(but if you start with more, you will earn faster): Rev-shares: very simple - all you do is buy some advertising packages and surf 10 ads a day. Then reinvest your earnings and scale it up . Makes a nice income after a while. And if you want to refer others to the site you can do so and earn commissions(about 10% on their purchases, this will boost your earnings!). Here you can start with little money. I would maybe start out with 500$ to 1 k here. My results in this one Homepage - MyPayingAds.com : started with only 80$ 8 months ago and now i have over 5300$ in this account - and the growth gets faster and faster. Or/And I also do automated trading(binary options or forex, available globally). With the forex trading i would start out with 1 to 2 k, let it make profits and once you are comfortable in how well it works you can put in more money anytime. There are lots of scams in this field but i found a software which actually really works and has a win-rate of about 70%. A brand-new account went from 500$ to 670$ in 2 days lol - Attention: this is not a typical result, but the software generates huge profits! We in our group do not risk a lot per trade - 1 to 2% of the capital we have. This way we always stay save with our account - there are good days and bad days - it is real trading - but the end-result is a big win rate here! And this helps to build the account quickly. If you want to have a look - check it out here INFINii Signal Forge Automated Binary Options Trading Program V - RichiT | eCommerce Experts And get in touch with me then i can add you to our closed members only facebook group where we share our successes and results! Or/And Cryptocurrency mining. Mining your own coins is a long-term asset and this will get much bigger in the future - currently i mine with 2 companies and over the next few years this is going to be job-replacing income for me. If you don`t know what cryptocurrencies are just go to youtube or google it - you will find lots of info(Bitcoin, Dash, Altcoin \u2026.). And if you want more info from me, just let me know. With mining it is recommendet to start out with at least 2 to 3 k to get into profits quickly. Then from day one you will keep earning for life!!! Right now there is a new coin being established which experts predict to be even better than Bitcoin!!! And Bitcoin went from 0,0001 per coin to over 1100$ per coin(currently about 720$) - Can`t reveal it here for everybody, but if you want to learn more, get in touch with me :). This is a one time investment - you can start to buy coin mining for as low as 97$(plus a one time fee of 49$). For more ways to earn just google: ways to earn online - and you will find heaps of more ways. I hope that gives you some ideas. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to earn money online. I will list down a few of them. Blogging As per my experience with blogging, this is the best way to make money online. What you have to do is create your blog and find the niche, in which you can write good content. Start monetizing it once you get enough visitors. You can start with some free platforms like blogger, WordPress for creating your blog. Once you get an idea about this I will suggest spending some money and buy your domain (TLD) and web hosting and start building your blog. If you are good with web designing and programming then you can create it by yourself otherwise you can use WORDPRESS Content Management System. That is widely used CMS. It gives you flexibility for managing your blog. Okay, if you are done with the building and designing part. Create content, promote it using social media sites. You can google \u201chow to promote blog post\u201d. It will take some time to learn and apply the rules. But believe me, you will enjoy doing this, if you like writing and in the long run, your content will pay you a decent amount of money, if you do this in the right way. You can apply for ad networks and put ads on your blog. The earnings will be CPC (cost per click) or CPM (cost per thousand impressions) based. AdSense is the best ad network, you will be lucky if you will get approved by Google AdSense. YouTube If you are creative and you have got something that can attract viewers. You can try making videos and upload it to YouTube. Showcase your talent to the world and in return get paid by AdSense. Paid Writing If you are good at writing, be ready with some samples of your work. There are many websites where you can earn 2$ to 10$ per article. Affiliate Marketing It\u2019s only for people who know how to sell things. You will be promoting products of other companies. The more customers you bring in, the more commission you will get. These are some of the genuine ways of making money online. Don\u2019t fall for fake apps and websites that promise you pay good amount of money. ",

I can however share my experience on this and what I have found to be a constantly profitable way to make money online I have tried many methods over the years but I found that a lot of them have a much higher time input than was warranted by the returns I was drawing out. A lot of things that fitted into that category were filling in surveys, trying toget fiveer jobs (albeit my marketable skills do not transfer very well to there). One way that I came across and I have stuck to for a good few years is matched betting (forget the connotations between this word and thinking it is instantly gambling). Matched betting is the process of using bookie offers in a no risksituation to your advantage to make guaranteed cash. This like anything will take a time input requirement but if you want to make money online then you have to be willing to put the time and effort in. Once you have learnt the processes then it does become a lot quicker to make the money.I work full time and spend approximately 30 minutes to an hour a night working through the offers (maybe totalling 8 hours a week cherry picking the best most valuable offers) and last month made just over \u00a32000 in my pocket, in the UK earnings like this aredeemed as betting so are tax free which does give a big boost to anything you make. As in anything time is money it is certainly worth using a service to learn from and to help you find all the offers, if they highlight \u00a310-\u00a350 of offers to you every couple of days that you otherwise would not be aware of then they morethan pay for themselves, many times over. The one that I use is http://amateurrunner.co.uk/pm. They offer a \u00a31 trail introduction so it gives you a chance to try it out and see if this is for you. Any questions please ask away and I will do anything I can to help ",

            "answer_text": "This is a pretty broad question since there are really a ton of options to make money online. The first thing that you need to consider is if you want to work for yourself or for someone else (like a remote online job). A lot of people choose to work for someone - Freelancing and so on. Since I\u2019m working for myself, I can\u2019t give you much advice when it comes to freelancing and things like that. If you want to build your own business and work for yourself than it all comes down to traffic and monetization methods. First you need attention (traffic) and you need a monetization method that you want to use (or several). When it comes to getting traffic there are again a ton of ways, and it all depends on your skillset and in some cases the niche you are in. Some of the popular traffic generation methods: SEO (Traffic From Search Engines)Social Media (Organic Traffic From Social Media Platforms)Paid Social Media Traffic (Social Media Ads)Influencer PromotionsPaid Search Traffic (Google Adwords, Bing Ads, etc)Other Types Of Paid Traffic (Native, Mobile, etc)Some monetization methods: Affiliate MarketingAdsSelling Your Own Physical ProductsSelling Your Own Digital ProductsSelling Services (Consulting, Coaching)DropshippingEmail MarketingCPANow as I\u2019ve mentioned you want to choose the best combination of traffic sources and monetization methods that fits your niche. Some of these methods require initial investments in terms of money, while others require investment in terms of time. If you are completely new to making money online and want to start building something for yourself, I would definitely suggest social media marketing, because it\u2019s pretty easy to learn and it doesn\u2019t require investment in terms of money. Right now, the hottest social media platform is Instagram, it can generate a ton of traffic and it\u2019s pretty easy to monetize. It\u2019s also pretty easy to learn how to grow. If that\u2019s something you are interested in, I would suggest you to check my 0 to 10k series, this is a challenge where I\u2019m growing completely new Instagram account from 0 followers to first 10k followers and showcasing everything live on YT (including the username). I\u2019m growing it to 10k precisely since after that it\u2019s pretty easy to maintain the growth + with 10k you get swipe up story option, which allows you to link externally and start making some money. I also have a website dedicated to making money online where I share my methods, guides and tutorials, so it\u2019s definitely worth checking out as well. If you have any questions, feel free to ask anytime. Hope that helps. ",

Bollywood & Entertainment (Fun and Gossip)CricketPoliticsStartups and MarketingMedia (News and Trends) TechShoppingFinanceHealthEducation JobsFashionChildcare and ParentingFoodTravel You can mix and match more than one market to make your business unique and useful. For example, Travel+Fashion, Finance+Education, Startup+Job If you do a decent work in those markets, 99% chances are that you will get success. The failure will happen if you failed to take action - not because of a bad idea or bad market. In fact, I was never sure that I will get the massive success with my personal finance business. I became successful because... My entire focus was to write useful content for my audience. My blog was my experimental lab. Whatever I was learning from books and blogs, I was implementing on my blog. There was no risk because I invested a small money in the domain and hosting. The rest of the investment was \"Time Investment\". And the immediate return was the learning (that I am sharing with you today). Online businesses are no-loss business. (Only gain) First, you can start with a little investment and then\u2026 #1. If you get visitors then you make money#2. You become valuable for others even if you can\u2019t make money from your online business. You learn bits and pieces of online business and you can help others startups with digital marketing. \"The practical failure is much valuable than theoretical success.\u201d I openly shared my failure story with the world still I got high value consulting work from startups. Why? \"Because failure teaches you more lessons than success.\" You have following choices of business models after you decide your industry. #1. A product startup#2. A service startup#3.

I will tell you the difference in tomorrow's emails. A product startup needs VC funding in most of the cases. A high investment game in terms of money & team resources. I stopped giving gyan in this segment. A service startup can be run with almost zero investment. (Consultants, Accountants, CA, Lawyer, Interior decorators, Beauticians, Teachers) E-commerce store can start giving you revenue within the first month of setup (Read the story of Akshay who is making more than 3,00,000 monthly revenue by selling T-shirts on his online store + All the step by step guide for you to start an online store) Affiliate marketing depends on your blogging skills.

            "answer_text": "If you have a computer and an internet connection, you can use them to make money from home. The best way how to do it is to use the internet as an intermediary to help people solve their problems. Basically, you will need to solve different types of problems by offering solutions. If you already know how to do something, then you are ready to help people and get paid for doing it. Here you will find four steps that you need to accomplish before you even start to think about making money. 1. You will need to find a topic which you will use to offer your help. It can be anything. Let's think about your life experience. Maybe you know how to grow different types of vegetables. This can be a great topic. Maybe you know how to lose weight. You can use this as a topic as well. These examples may sound easy for you, but there are people who have no idea how to grow vegetables or lose weight. Therefore, you will need to choose a topic and use the internet to help people by giving them advice. 2. You will need to write a digital book about your chosen topic. It will be a \"How to\" book that will give the answers to the reader questions. It doesn't need to belong. For example, it may be only 10 pages long. First, you will have to write it using Microsoft Word software. Next, you will have to convert it to PDF format using an online converter. This format allows you to upload your eBook on the server and makes it downloadable. 3. You will need to make a website that will collect visitors' contact information such as email addresses and names. It is called a squeeze page. It should be very simple and understandable. Basically, it should have a headline, some information about your eBook, and two boxes where visitors can enter their contact information. In order to collect email addresses, you will need to open an autoresponder account that will collect email addresses and send emails automatically. 4. You will need to sell your eBook to your established customer list. It is a list of email addresses that you will have to create using an autoresponder. Now your task is to establish a relationship with each of your customers. It can be done by talking about their problems. Once you have a good relationship with your customers, you will need to send an email that will be a sales page of your ebook. ",

            "answer_text": "Nearly every business you can think of has had to modify itself to meet this increased commercial activity taking place online. Those who have not have created enormous opportunity for individuals and smaller business to fill in the gaps. Yet, according to the Voice of America, only one in four Americans made money online in 2017, and of those about 40% were through an already established company such as Uber or Airbnb.  But what if you wanted to go alone to maximize your profits? Aren\u2019t you smart enough to make money online? Given the shifting patterns of commerce and your ability to use a computer isn\u2019t there an opportunity for you if you could just figure it all out? The Internet is replete with stories of 20 somethings raking in hundreds of dollars a day, what have they got that you don\u2019t? To answer those questions, we looked at the top 7 ways that anyone with a computer and internet connection can earn a profit online from anywhere in the world 24 hours a day 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Part of the appeal is in using the technique known as \u201cpassive\u201d income. In other words, transactions are taking place on your behalf automatically by an app running on the internet on your behalf. There was a time when people were compensated for the surrender of their labor power, and that still is true today. However, as we have moved into an Information Age, people are able to receive remuneration because they know things that others do not. Consider however that while the income is passive; learning, networking and working online require action and commitment. In other words, just because you know something, like how to make money online, you still have to act on it and commit to it to see results. 7 Serious Ways to Make Money Online: Affiliate Marketing \u2013 there is nothing more fun than introducing people to the opportunity to buy something you know they already love and desire. As an affiliate marketer, you introduce buyers to sellers, and the seller gives you a \u201cfinder\u2019s fee\u201d or commission for bringing the buyer to them. Building a network, being helpful and understanding things like demographics, requires an online community so you can follow people who have succeeded. Scroll to the bottom of just about any website for a company that produces something you like and there is generally a link for affiliates. It is also the link for people who want to make money. If you can create a website or a blog or some kind of magnet that causes people to buy as a direct result of your actions, then you will get paid. Drop shipping \u2013 create a virtual storefront without the need for inventory, when orders are placed through your website you have a manufacturer or supplier fulfill it. The classic \u201cmiddle man\u201d you become an online storefront, selling whatever your manufacturer supplies, or whatever you can find in good supply. You need some up-front capital, it takes a while to figure out and a lot of stuff here is out of your control. For example, with drop shipping you cannot dictate inventory, quality or even the accuracy of what it is you sell. If an item becomes popular and your supplier sells out or cannot supply anymore then you have to turn away all those customers and give them their money back. Further, there is the issue that in most cases you will not have seen or handled that which was sold, so there is no way of knowing if it\u2019s any good. Blogging, creating courses, YouTube etc. \u2013 if you know something or can do something others can\u2019t, then it\u2019s a good chance there is value in sharing your talent. Let\u2019s face it, people are fascinated by each other and enjoy seeing all the possibilities. It takes time, commitment, and some equipment to produce, and once its done, you still have to promote it. Just because you have a website, or a YouTube video doesn\u2019t mean you can make money off of it. In this case you are selling your intellectual capacity which somehow must be manufactured and packaged in a way that makes it desirable, which means you have an awful lot of work to do. It can also be dangerous because this is your name on the line, unless you develop a fictional character for whom you ghostwrite \u2013 still it is kind of complicated.  Digital Marketing \u2013 where the rubber hits the road, you are the person who gathers people near and far so that things can happen for them. You are the source of information, entertainment and persuasion for them; an influencer, you figure out how to get people to listen and respond, whether they want to or not. You have to learn all the tools, tips and techniques and restrain yourself until you are ready (learning by doing is expensive), but you can be a real force on the Internet, a person who determines the fortunes of others. Nearly each of these ways to make money requires digital marketing and while there is a steep learning curve and a lot of trial and error there are also enormous resources available as digital marketers love nothing more than a community. Not only is there a collective intelligence, but digital marketing depends on the network and referrals to make things work. A digital marketer is keenly aware that if not you then someone in network probably is interested. Be a test subject for research \u2013 there are several opportunities to earn income filling out surveys, watching videos, etc. While it is not technically a passive income, it is a way to make money online, it is just not a way to make a living online. Still, you can find people who are willing pay you to hear what you have to say about what they are trying to do. These can also be risky, of all the methods on here, this the toughest one to get paid from. Most of these are fly by night operations in that once the research is done, so are they. It can also be hard to find these opportunities, most of the time to be a test subject requires your fitting a certain criterion ahead of time. Reseller \u2013 maybe the oldest trick in the book \u2013also called arbitrage. Find something in one market where its cheap, sell it in another market for a higher price and keep the difference. Some people do this using thrift stores and yard sales and selling on Ebay, others sell things they find online at sites like Fiverr and yet others resell whole websites, stores and domains on sites like Where businesses are bought and sold Also not an example of passive income, being a reseller requires you to love that market and know it inside and out, after all, this is the method used in Stock Markets all over the world.Being a reseller online can be relatively easy since there is usually no inventory required you can just only when you have a buyer, however it is very difficult to scale and can be complicated because you often have multiple suppliers. Leveraged affiliate \u2013 a newcomer to the scene as a leveraged affiliate you invest in or use the very product you are selling as an affiliate. The people who buy the product are not just a buyer, as they are in affiliate marketing, but they are also business partners because their success not only feeds you money but validates the product on the whole as well. This is kind of like the person who sells vacation trips, they not only get to go on the trip for free but make money off of everyone else they sold a ticket to going with them. Leveraged affiliates are tightly bound groups where the success of one is equal to the success of the collective. Leveraged affiliate can also be good if you enjoy working with people, can take and give constructive feedback and can be honest. As a leveraged affiliate your name brand means everything as people must trust both your judgement and your capacity to deliver. Make no mistake about it, starting a new business venture requires a monetary investment as well as an investment of time, energy and effort. The most important thing is to find people or a person you can trust to guide you through the learning process if this is something you are doing for the first time. Once you get started with any of the strategies above, a whole new world of opportunity will open for you. Here\u2019s my suggestion to promote - BuilderAll.

            "answer_text": "I sure can! But I will only suggest one method. Because you should only focus on one method at any given time. FOCUS= Focus on cause until successful. Okay enough with the cheesy acronyms and more on the answer. My friends if you want to make money online then I suggest Affiliate Marketing. Now here are my reasons why\u2026 First: There are over 3 BILLION INTERNET USERS ONLINE!!!! Second: As the internet and technology is becoming more accessible more people prefer to shop online. Sweet so the internet is the tool to connect to consumers and their money. Thirdly: The cost of tuition and institutional learning is so costly that now days people want to avoid that and learn online because it is more cost effective and efficient. And that leads me to the product side of affiliate marketing. Many of you may be familiar with amazon affiliates where you earn commission on any sales generated through their website. But every single day more people are using the internet for e-learning and educational purposes. As stated before the cost of college is ridiculous but people will always pay for knowledge if it can better them in a particular area of their life (especially if this means they will become more valuable in the market place and therefore can earn more dinero/moolah/money). So their plan B is to look online for courses that can supplement institutional learning at a lesser price. And this is where you the affiliate marketer joins the cycle. You can bet that most of the courses available online (90% plus) offer affiliate programs. So why not be part of the cycle and help those individuals online who are actively searching for learning/knowledge courses to spend their money on find what they are seeking. And in doing so you earn yourself the affiliate commission. It is a simple business model but do not get me wrong- it will require hard work. But I never said the work is complicated. Anyone can implement this model successfully in any niche with the right discipline and focus. And the internet has some amazing tools to make the entire model run smoothly- giving you accurate insight into what is and isn\u2019t working. So if you aren\u2019t by now you should be excited because I have just saved you a huge amount of time going through bullshit online business proposals that won\u2019t last long term (surveys, SEO blogging, fiverr gigs). Now if you want to see how I got started with this model then you can go through myguide which explains exactly how I started affiliate marketing and made my first sale without spending a single dollar. It\u2019s yours to replicate the entire process and remove or the uncertainty into what you should be doing. In my opinion if you delay starting because you\u2019re unsure then you may just be missing out on one of the biggest opportunities in your life. Why not just dive in the deep end and learn from your mistakes as you go? That is what I did and I couldn\u2019t be any more satisfied with what I have accomplished. Hoping everyone can understand my writing (slightly illiterate- no hating). If not just leave a question in the comment thanks. Wishing all the best in the online hustle. Best Felix ",

YouTube: It is the second largest search engine on the planet so you can earn plenty of money on it. On youtube, you have to make videos related to a topic which can help people or you can also entertain people if you are good at it as blogging you can make money from YouTube by displaying ads through the Adsense, Affiliate links, etc.2.Blogging: In this way, you can create a blog related to a topic about which people are searching across the web, as you get traffic on your blog you can minimize your blog with Google Adsense, Affiliate links, etc.Affiliate Marketing: I have mentioned it in the above points so in this you don't have to great any content all you have to do is sign up for any good affiliate programme like Amazon Affiliate programme and many more. As you create an affiliate account then all you have to do share the product links on social media if anyone but the product through your given link you will get 4 to 5 percent comprising of product total cost for eg: if the product is of $100 you will get $5 per sale.Thanks for your time, Have a nice day!

According to your question you are at the point when you don't have a clue what to do on the internet in order to make (some) money. Which is perfectly normal. I started by literal googling: How to make money online. SO, you will need TIME to figure it what is that you want to do. Start from things you like or love to do. Just google How To Make Money: by reading books, by washing cars ( you wouldn't believe what kind of money one dude is making of this), in video games ( so so so many many many ways in this niche), by folding clothes ( you wouldn't believe what kind of money one Chinese girl is making of this), from cows, from village, from cactuses.... I have started from video games that led me to create very basic landing pages, that lead me to create my online shop, that lead me to online marketing, that led me to cryptocurrency, that lead me to write a blog on Quora about cryptos, that lead me to Faculty of Economics in my country ( they read my blog about cryptos on Quora), that led me to start my own blog about cryptos (which is now by the way on the first page of google on my language) , that led me to invest in one ICO ( I am making money now when everyone is losing in crypto world, this is my passive income), that lead me to be a virtual assistant for one Californian solar company ( were I am very happy to work on different projects because I have a very broad knowledge regarding different subject on the internet). Probably, I left something out. Can you imagine the number of people in my contact list I have now? Was everything easy? NO!!!!!!! In the beginning, I was spending literally minimum 12 hours a day (up to 16), by searching/exploring and reading/learning what can I do ( or not) online. It took me 3 days to create my first landing page!!! That is up 5 min. of work. It took me 6 hours to connect pay pall to my Shopify store. I read everything there is to be about it online( including legal obligations, banks term of use etc.). This is a 3 mouse click job. And I don't have an online store anymore. I lost count on how many online jobs I have applied and nothing. Oh, and I even borrowed the money and quit my job!!!!!!!!!! 18 months ago I was 38 years old waiter! Knowing that Google is browser and I presumed that Gmail belongs to Google. You already started your online journey by asking Quora community for advice. Stay on the path! Lazar P.S. Word of advice that crucially helped me. Try as much as you can (I even quit my job), NOT to waste your time on things that distract you or choke you in your life. ",

            "answer_text": "I would recommend that you learn affiliate marketing. Besides being the most common, one of the most profitable, and one of the least expensive ways to start making money online, it allows you to generate residual income. This means that you can post content once but continue to profit from it \u2014 without a bunch of extra work. This is due to how the search engines and Youtube work. This is also why you hear phrases like \u201cmake money while you sleep\u201d associated with making money online. Once you lay the foundation and set up things the right way, you can actually make money while you\u2019re sleeping. When you promote products on the internet, you aren\u2019t bound by boarders. I don\u2019t know if you realized this, but did you know that every country has it\u2019s version of Google (based on the language spoken)? This means that, when you get ranked in U.S. Google for a particular set of keywords, you\u2019re also getting ranked in the Google engines of other countries. This is why, when you have a blog or Youtube channel, you get traffic from all over the world! Besides this, affiliate marketing is something that you can do AROUND YOUR SCHEDULE. It\u2019s something you can do \u2014 even if you only have an hour or two to spare a day. It\u2019s also something that can be done part-time but that allows you to generate a full-time income. If this sounds like something that might be of interest to you, you can get started here. ",

            "answer_text": "No-risk matched bettingHands down the quickest way to make a lot of money (well, without breaking the law). Lots of students have genuinely made \u00a3100s from this technique. It's completely legal, risk free, tax free, and anyone can do. It works by taking advantage of free bets regularly offered by betting sites through \u2018matching' them at a betting exchange. Matched betting eliminates the risk (you are betting both for and against a certain outcome).This leaves you being able to squeeze out the free bet, which can be as much as \u00a3200! Multiply this by how many betting sites there are and you can quite easily come away with a profit of a few hundred pounds.Owen walks you through how to make your first \u00a315 profit (using a real life example) in this gem of a guide to matched betting. If you know of any better way to make \u00a330/hr sitting at home, please let us know!An increasingly popular way for students to make money is to fill out online surveys in their spare time. Research companies are always recruiting new members to answer surveys and test new products.For a few minutes of form filling, you can make a couple of quid which is paid as cash or rewards. You can bag up to \u00a33 ($5) for some surveys!A few good ones to try are: Toluna, Vivatic, MySurvey, Valued Opinions, IPSOS, Global Test Market, The Opinion Panel, Crowdology, YouGov, Pinecone, OnePoll, SurveyBods, PopulusLive, Hiving, PanelBase, MintVine, Opinion Outpost, Harris Poll, Mind Mover, New Vista, iPoll.Also sign up for Swagbucks which rewards you for surveys as well as simply surfing the web, watching videos and playing games.Update: See our new full guide to the best paid online surveys!Paid for searching the webInterested in earning cash for doing what you already do online?

You also have the option to donate it to charity.Sign up now for free and start earning from your own searches! Click here to start.Online market tradingThe historically hard-to-break world of investing in stock markets and currencies has been cracked wide open. Today there is no need to be a fat cat or fund the yachts of Wolf of Wall Street style stock brokers. You can do it all yourself with the help of online market trading platforms.Having spent many hours researching this new opportunity, I've been experimenting with the two biggest platforms: Plus500 and eToro.com.Both offer free practice accounts, and Plus500 also give you a \u00a320 signup bonus (without depositing, terms apply) for their CFD service which is worth taking up. Overall I prefer eTorowith over 4.5 million users worldwide. It was recently featured in the BBC 2 documentary \u201cTraders: Millions by the Minute\u201d and the Financial Times.One of the best things on eToro is the CopyTrader feature. This lets you literally see, follow and copy the investments of other top performing traders.Follow George's complete guide to trading on eToro to learn more. I think $200 is a good amount to get the most out of the learning curve by trying out a few different markets. If nothing else you'll learn a great deal about various investments and industries.Disclaimer: CFD trading can be volatile and you can lose your entire capital, so don't throw your life savings into it! Trading CFDs may not be suitable for you. Please ensure you fully understand the risks involved.Start your own websiteInterested in generating passive income? You need a website. It's THE way to make money while you sleep.Starting a website with Bluehost takes less than 20 minutes, costs hardly anything and can be done by an 82 year-old. It only takes a bit of plugging on social media to get your first visitors, and there are plenty of ways to monetise your site.Save the Student is just one example of a successful website, started at university by Owen Burek in his first year, which has since grown into a full-time and sizable enterprise.Read Owen's step-by-step guide on how to start a website in 20 minutes. It's really one of the best assets you can have.Review websites & apps for cashWell it seems like you're pretty nifty with a web browser, so perhaps it's time to turn pro and browse websites as a paid and fun job!Introducing UserTesting.com \u2013 a new platform that pays everyday people to review all kinds of websites. Each review takes around 20 minutes and bags you $10 (\u00a36.50) via Paypal.Simply sign up here, complete a test review and look forward to receiving websites in your inbox.The \u2018Disney Vault' secretTo keep demand high across generations, Disney Studios carefully restrict the supply of some home release classics. They are locked away in the \u2018vault' for 8-10 years before being released for a short unspecified time.Buy them in this window at normal retail price and you can turn a nice profit when they go off sale for another decade or so.For example, in 2011 you could buy Beauty and the Beast on Blu-ray 3D for just \u00a324.99. In just a couple of years it was on Amazon for a staggering \u00a374.99!Importantly, not all Disney releases are subject to the vault and only the true classics will maintain such demand.Right now there are just 2 titles out of the vault which I would recommend snapping up. They are Bambi Diamond Edition Blu-ray and The Lion King Diamond Edition Blu-ray.\u2018Get Paid To' sitesSimilar to making money from online surveys, GPT sites reward you in cash and vouchers for completing various offers or activities online.The most popular sites today are Toluna, Swagbucks and InboxPounds.Exciting update!

With the Amazon Kindle store, anyone can publish an eBook and make money.And the Kindle app is now available on almost any device (laptops, iPads, smartphones and yes, Kindles) so your global market is huge!List your book for \u00a31.49 \u2013 \u00a36.99 and you earn 70% of the sale. Considering Amazon is the ultimate selling machine (and remember people are looking to spend), that is a fantastic deal.The key to success with eBooks is to create value, and write non-fiction. Simply bundling information you have researched and complied on a common problem (eg. \u2018secrets' to finding a job) and then presenting it in an easy to digest format (an eBook) justifies someone spending a few quid on it.Another big tip is to have a great cover designed so it stands out, and once your book is live on the Kindle store it's really important to get some reviews so it shows up higher in results. Encourage readers to leave an honest review at the end of your book.The best thing about this lucrative idea is that once you've invested the time (say 20 hours), you'll earn a passive income for years to come! For a step-by-step guide to publishing and earning with eBooks, see \u201cHow to write a nonfiction eBook in 21 days\u201c.Affiliate marketingIf you've got a good presence on social media or perhaps you even have a blog or website, you can start bringing in money immediately by promoting all sorts of companies, products, services and offers online.Sign up as a publisher on the Awin network, check their offers blog or browse the merchant listings to find something you think your friends would be interested in, grab your affiliate link and share it. If someone buys (can be within up to 90 days) using your link you'll make a nice commission. To take it a step further, set up a website (read our guide) or a topical Facebook page and invite all your friends to join it and post your affiliate offers on there.Mobile phone recyclingCredit: CannedTuna \u2013 Flickr.comSee how much you can get for your old mobile phone using our in-house mobile phone price comparison tool!

More often than not, if you are a student working during the year, you will be overpaying income tax.Why? Simply because few students reach the personal tax-free income allowance each year but are put on an emergency basic tax-code by their employers meaning tax is being paid when it shouldn't be learn more and calculate how much tax back you might be due, see our guide on student tax refunds.Get cashback when shoppingI earned this much in 2 yearsThis is not only a way to make money but also to save money as a student.

Whilst it might not seem like much, it can quickly add up and there are plenty of examples of people making a really good living from the site. The key is to get a system in place which minimises the time spent on each gig.But there is another way to profit even more from Fiverr for potentially far less work. How? By simply reselling gigs elsewhere. For example, find a decent logo designer then reply to jobs on Upwork or even local classifieds.

There are sites out there that you can upload your notes to, along with your price, and then when another student downloads them you get paid.Most of these sites like Stuvia & Notesale are free for you to list your notes but tend to take a cut of your profit in order to handle the marketing etc so that you don\u2019t have to go out there and promote your notes yourself.You will most likely have to upload PDFs but it\u2019s worth it for the return and you can submit handwritten notes but you\u2019re likely to make more money if they\u2019re typed up.Sell second-hand course booksOne great way to make money is to buy other students' text books at the end of the year, and then sell them just after freshers' week \u2013 when the new intake of students know that they need them!You can either advertise on campus or list them online very easily on Amazon.co.uk Marketplace (just bear in mind they take a commission on books sold).Here's 28 other things you can sell right now!CompetitionsEntering competitions of course comes with no guarantees, but there is a growing community of so-called \u2018compers' in the UK consistently making up to \u00a350,000 a year through all sorts of competitions.Types of competitions available to enter range from simple registration forms and Facebook page liking to answering questions correctly over the phone to being a TV game show contestant. Imagine you made it onto Deal or No Deal instead of just watching it!Start by entering our very own monthly student competition (Like our Facebook page to see when our next one is)!Then head to our active competitions page to enter other free competitions that we have found. Just note that some of these sites may send you spam so use an alias email address and opt-out of as many of the offers as possible.For loads more tips on achieving success and making money from competitions, read our guide to entering competitions.Buy and sell domain namesA domain name is just a website address (eg. \u2018Save the Student - Student Money, Discounts and Jobs' or \u2018http://mysite.co.uk') and there are lots of extensions (.com, .net, .http://co.uk etc).They cost as little as \u00a31.99 to register with 123-reg.co.uk or GoDaddy.com yet premium domain names can fetch \u00a31,000s if not millions when sold on. In 2007 VacationRentals.com went for a cool $35m!Now you're probably not going to come across anything like that, but you can still turn a quick profit with a bit of searching. The trick is to find available domain names which have some commercial value, snap them up and then list them for sale on a site like Sedo.com.Mystery shoppingToday becoming a mystery shopper is easier than you think and you can get rewarded handsomely.We've recently come across a really fun smartphone app called Roamler that pays you in cash for completing various tasks in your local area. So definitely check that out first!More traditionally, there are plenty of agencies that pay you to visit all sorts of shops to feedback on how they are performing. For more info on where to apply see our guide to becoming a mystery shopper.Be an extraDo you fancy yourself as a budding young actor or just that person that walks past in the background shot of an episode of Eastenders? It could be you if you apply to be an extra.The pay isn't bad either \u2013 \u00a360-80 a day on average, and you hardly have to do anything!You can apply at Be On Screen for a number of opportunities or 2020 casting is another agency (just know they take a cut from your earnings).Sell all your old CDs, games and moviesIf you are looking to make a very quick buck, then selling your old bits and bobs that are cluttering up your room is a good idea.The best thing about it is that you can rip all the songs and films onto your laptop or external hard drive before selling them. This means that you are only really selling the plastic and artwork!You can earn anything from 10p to \u00a320 per item, and the earnings can really add up if you have a large collection. Whilst you're at it, see if your parents have any \u2018clutter' they'd be happy to see the back of.You can also sell almost anything for free on Amazon Marketplace or Preloved and sites like MusicMagpie will pay you instantly for sending in unwanted items.For more tips and places to sell check out our guide on selling DVDs, CDs and games.Sell on your education!Becoming a tutor to other students is easier than ever. Until recently your market was limited to local face-to-face sessions, but thanks to online tutoring sites you can go global!Udemy allows anyone to create an online course (on literally anything!) and get paid forever after as users take it up.For one-to-one tutoring, list yourself on Superprof, SchoolsTrader and UK Tutors.You can expect to earn upwards of \u00a310 an hour, and you don't have to be highly qualified to tutor younger GCSE or even A Level students. Get started with our guide to making money as a private tutor.Sell your photosIf you think you've got a good shot and a little creativity, try uploading your photographs for free to stock websites. A good starting point is Fotolia or istockphoto.Make more money selling photo subjects that have fewer search results but you feel would have some demand. It might be a good idea to test them out in print first yourself (get free photo prints here).Rent out your car parking spaceSome student accommodation comes with a drive or garage. If you aren't using your parking space and you live in a busy area then you might be in luck. There are plenty of people that may work in the city centre and are fed up of paying through the roof for daily parking.Advertise your space on Gumtree, Parklet or Just Park.Or, check out our full guide to renting out your parking space.Become your own bank\u2018Peer-to-peer' lending is the future of banking. It cuts out the middle-man, passing on higher interest rates to you and cheaper loans to borrowers. And it's all managed online from the comfort of your sofa.Founded in 2005, Zopa.com is the most established site lending around \u00a31m every day. Right now you can expect to achieve up to 5% fixed return (before tax), depending on how long you choose to lend for.As with any traditional bank, there is some risk attached with peer-to-peer lending. Zopa have gone a long way to mitigating this with their Safeguard feature, which effectively spreads your money across a wide range of borrowers (who are also credit checked).Work as a charity collectorOk so this job takes a certain kind of person, as you'll have to take a lot of rejection and be persistent.But if you are bubbly, personable and reckon you could sell ice to an Eskimo then this could actually be a great student money making idea. You get paid commission on new sign ups (typically around \u00a320).Have a look at Wesser as well as charity websites like Oxfam.BabysittingIt's a classic money-maker, and for good reason. You get paid (well) to watch TV and not very much else!Be warned that you will need a CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check to look after small children, even though some parents may not ask for one. If you are wondering what to charge, look at local Gumtree ads, but you can expect to be paid over \u00a38ph even if you aren't trained in child care.Dog walking & sittingIf babies ain't your thing, then maybe canines are\u2026 looking after other people's dogs is big business. Just think that as a student you're likely to have free time during the day when others are out at work and worried about their pets at home.You could bag around \u00a37 per dog for an hour walk, and it's also a great way to keep fit. Join Tailster who will match you up with dog owners. Alternatively advertise your services locally with fliers or on classified websites such as Gumtree.Rent out your house for filmingDirectors for TV and film are always on the hunt for houses to film in. For instance, a scene for Coronation Street was recently filmed in the student house one of the Save the Student editors used to live in!Not only can you make good money but it's crazy seeing your own place on TV. Start out by looking at this site.Rent out your bodyAccording to our recent survey, 7% of students use their body in some way to make a buck.If you are comfortable taking off your kit then why not try life modelling. Sit there in the buff while budding artists capture your every curve (or pokey bits) in frightening detail! Try RAM, a website especially designed for these kind of jobs.You could also get involved in clinical drug trials, but be sure you fully appreciate any risks attached.Warning: Do not do anything you are not comfortable with, no matter how desperate you are for money! There has been an unhealthy rise in student prostitution in recent years \u2013 do not fall victim to it!Freelance workPerhaps you enjoy writing, managing Facebook pages or doing a little bit of graphic design in your spare time. There are so many freelance jobs out there that require simple skills or just time that someone else might not have.And the best thing about freelancing is that you can work for clients in the UK and around the world with just an internet connection from home, to your own hours whilst developing valuable skills.A great place to start is with the leading freelance site Upwork.com. Or try using our student job search to find freelance jobs closer to home.Sell clothes on eBayEveryone's best friend when it comes to getting rid of junk is eBay. Online auctions are a sure-fire way to turn that sleeveless jacket (which came in and out of fashion in a week) into hard cash.Some eBay sellers look at trends and try to predict what will be big ahead of the market. If you are good and don't mind taking a risk then you can buy early in bulk and sell on when the craze hits.For lots more tips on selling on eBay read this guide.Sell your stories and videosIf you have an interesting story then you could try selling it to the papers. It could be anything from sleeping with a professional footballer to getting caught in a clothes horse!One of the Save the Student team was unfortunate enough to have a pigeon fly through and smash their window at university and sold the story to The Sun for a tidy \u00a350.You could also film your mates at all times and send it into You've Been Framed to net yourself \u00a3250 and a few seconds of fame.YouTube videosAccording to recent stats we now watch more videos on YouTube than searches on Google. And with the recently introduced YouTube Partner Program you can now profit from making and uploading videos. You will receive a percentage of the advertising revenue collected per 1,000 views.Depending on how successful you are (virality, subscriber base and topic) you can make a lot of money, and there are plenty of stories every week of more and more YouTubers making it their career.For more tips read our guide to making money from YouTube.Network marketingAlso known as Multi-Level Marketing (MLM), this is a business model that allows you to generate ongoing income in two ways: by making a commission selling products and by recruiting other members who go on to sell. The later allows you to make money from the sales made by those you have recruited.Importantly, this is not a pyramid scheme (they are illegal) because there is an end goal which involves a customer buying a product or service of Value Resources and Information.'s also not a \u2018get rich quick' scheme. You will have to work I'm afraid! However with the growth of social media, network marketing is becoming easier and lots of people are now making a decent living from it.This is a serious way of making good money on your own terms and it's well worth reading up on it. I recommend getting \u201cThe Business of the 21st Century\u201d by Robert Kiyosaki.Source property for wealthy investorsWe all know how much money there is in property, but on the surface (with house prices as high as they are) you might be thinking this market is off-limits.Truth is, lots of people make a great deal of cash simply sourcing suitable properties for wealthy investors who simply have no time.The trick is to find properties below market value (BMV) by avoiding estate agents and instead flyering your area with your contact details offering to buy houses. Then approach investors with a no-brainer offer to pass on the details of cut-price property in exchange for a % of the sale value.Most cities will have monthly networking events for landlords and property investors. Track these down, sign up, put on your best suit and go along with lots of business cards. Or you could start on LinkedIn or even Twitter to build some initialcontacts. As you might imagine, this isn't necessarily a quick way to make money but once you've got a few investors in your phone book it can prove to be very lucrative in the long run. If you're interested, I recommend reading this book.",

            "answer_text": "I stole my own post from a hugely popular article/post I did on here a few months back. It was targetted at Uni students, but it can be used by anyone really! It\u2019s of online money making, and a little offline money making. But should give you a few ideas! Also, a few of them are quite neat little tricks ;) Making a little bit of extra cash at University is basically a must these days. with tuition fees through the roof and basically no money at all, it's getting a little harder to scrape together some cash for the beans on toast or the cheeky beer or two (or three...or five) down the pub. So let me take some of that burden off of you and give you a few ways to make money at uni, or at least save a little! 1. Get a job Yeah, this one is not a popular one, I can give you that much for free. But, you may actually want to consider getting a part-time job, nothing too strenuous or backbreaking. Maybe take a job part-time at your local Sainsbury's or take up a few shifts at the Wetherspoons around the corner. Whatever you decide to do, make sure you can be flexible with your shifts, or at least have the ability to call in favours for when your housemate decides to have a cracking party and you can't quite bring yourself to go to work the next day. 2. Claim your tax back Seriously, this goes hand in hand with number 1. Most students get thrown onto emergency tax codes when they start working. This means you will be paying a higher rate of tax, usually disproportionate to the amount you have made from your part-time job. As such, it's a good idea to either ask the company who you work for to give you the right tax code. You can also go to the HRMC Website and check your tax code! You can also request them to update the code they have for you and to reassess your situation! As you more than likely won't earn enough to even reach the tax-free personal allowance, you will more than likely get yourself a nice big wad of cash back at the end of the year when they calculate it all for you!  3. Join survey websites I see this tip everywhere. You cannot get away from it, why? Because the fundamental idea is actually pretty good and can be a good way to make money at Uni. Essentially you can sign up to websites, who in turn will send you surveys to fill out. Once you have completed the survey, the site will then provide you with a payment (anywhere from a few pence/cents all the way up too \u00a3/$s). Many of these sites claim you can earn up to \u00a3300 a month for filling these surveys in, but you have to be quite lucky (or know a few weird tricks..) to be able to earn this amount. Most of the time I would expect you to earn around \u00a350 - \u00a3100 a month. Companies such as GoldOpinions who boast an average survey payout of $5 - $10 so you will need to do around 10 a month to earn between $50-$100 (\u00a335-\u00a370 with current exchange rates). They are also offering your first month for $1 so that's also a good start! Other sites that are good to look into include Cash Surveys Only (though they look to be more US-based) & Paid Surveys at Home. You can read more about earning money online with Survey sites here. It provides you with a little more in depth information than I could get in here! 4. Sell yourself OK, not what you are quite thinking here... well actually you could sign up for friendship services. What I mean is, look at selling your skills. Sites such as Fiverr allow you to sell gigs or small projects for anything from \u00a33 (or $5) and up. In my first year, I used to sell business plan advice to people! Look at the skills you are learning at University and see if any of these can be used to make money at uni. Maybe you are doing an art degree? How about creating cool little graphics for people? Maybe you are doing a degree in the political landscape of Russia in the 1700's...ok, I don't have one for that. The most popular gigs on the Fiverr include Graphic Design (logos, Social media headers, icons), business plans and translation gigs! There are plenty of gig sites out there these days, so be sure to check them out, but make sure that they have a customer base, and are not charging you for the privilege of being on there! Paying a % of the sale is fine, but try to avoid ones that try to charge you up front. 5. Sell your stuff (or other peoples) By 'sell your stuff' I don't mean pack all your stuff into a van and take \u00a350 for it. I mean look through your stuff and find things you really don't need.... for example, the George Foreman grill you bought in your first year that you really really wanted but just never got around to using it. Or the 25 pairs of shoes that you have accumulated over the years in-store sales, but you never actually wear. Other options you can look at is to buy things in shops that are in the sales, and then resell them on websites such as eBay or Amazon it's an awesome way to money at uni! If you haven't heard of it, or not read it yet, I recommend reading or looking into guys like The Amazing Seller as you can learn an absolute ton from this guy, for free! If you are going down the Amazon Route, I would highly recommend checking out AmzScout it could save you hundreds!  Find garage sales to pick up items! It's also worth looking into apps such as Profit Bandit or TeraPeak (they are both paid for Apps, but if you are serious about selling items on Amazon or eBay from items bought in stores, they are a must-have for quicker item lookups!) 6. Sign up for Pick My Postcode (Or Free Postcode Lottery) Update: Free Postcode Lottery recently switched their name to Pick My Postcode, after they got into a bit of hot water from another well-known post code lottery based company. It's not really a money maker, and more of a 'you never know your luck'. It's one that I did quite a while ago, I signed up for a site called, Pick My Postcode. Now, it is a UK only site and there is no guarantee you will ever win anything from it...but what's the harm? They give away around \u00a3400 - \u00a31200 a day, split across multiple draws. The site is funded by the advertisement they show around, which can be annoying for some, or semi-helpful for others. It's also based on a random number generator, so everyone has an equal chance of winning. I would recommend using an email that you don't care about, i.e one you use for signing up for free goodies websites etc, just in case. It's not going to make you a millionaire, but it might boost your wallet once in a while and best of all, it's free. I also bagged myself \u00a327 the offer day from them the other day after winning a stackpot prize and then adding my current bonus (so that's another win). 7. Cashback sites Again, not exactly a money maker, but it could save you a few pennies each year, and give you a little bonus at the end of the year. Cashback sites work, much like affiliate sites. They refer you to a website, and in exchange, they receive a percentage of your check out or basket and pass some of that on to you. So you may buy something from H&M through a site like Quidco or TopCashBack and in return, they will give you 10% (for example) back on your purchase. Again, this may not make you money at uni, but it will help you save a little. 8. Start a blog One of my original blogs that I started before I even got to University, was completely focused on gaming, and how to guides on games such as COD, DOTA2 and games like that. It was created on a free web hosting & website builder - That had a drag and drop style web builder, and gave me a free domain and hosting. It wasn't brilliant, but it allowed me to write about something that I enjoyed (and still do enjoy). The great thing about blogs is that people are always on the lookout for reviews or information about pretty much anything. So you can always find traffic, it may be slow, but it will always be fairly steady. Plus, if you get a good enough following and you become good at your writing and information, people will start to stop by your blog more and more. I Learn how to make a Blog quickly and easily - It can take as little as 30minutes to get one up and running. 8.1 Making money with the blog Running a blog is actually a great way to make money at uni, as it allows you to; A) Advertisement - Traditional via Google Adsense, or even less traditional via Fiverr gigs (I used to sell ad space for a few $'s a week and keep revolving the spaces, so each space was worth $15 a week to me!). You may not become rich off of the money you get from this, but it might start paying for a few nights our or a drink or two down the pub, and that's a great start B) Affiliate Commission - If you are reviewing products such as gaming chairs, game consoles or even snowboards, you can pretty much make it into an affiliate product using the Amazon Affiliates service. Simply link up the product that you are reviewing with its relevant affiliate link, and if someone goes onto buy it, you get a % of the sale. C) Be paid to post content - Again using the gaming theme, publishers and console creators will start to send you games, items and other merchandise (including money) to review products. A good friend of mine is sent make up each month to review as well as being able to add her own affiliate links to the website. Essentially giving her the ability to review a product for free and then get a % of each sale. If you are stuck for ideas, I would recommend checking out this guide. 9. Tutoring or Teaching a Langauge You could add this to the one about doing Fiverr gigs, or be selling yourself, but it deserves its own one. Tutoring can come in all shapes and sizes, from teaching year 10 kids how to do basic mathematics, to helping a 50something how to do Excel spreadsheets! A good friend at University used to tutor a kid in French because the kids' mother was worried they were falling behind! You can also bundle in Teaching a Language here, but requires a little more confidence. Many universities do language swap classes, or even hire students to teach other students how to read/write/get on with new languages. It's a great idea to check with your uni to see if they offer the ability to teach other students.  Some websites include OnlineTutoringJob who will post up jobs within their forum for you to apply for. The current average earning from websites like this can be upwards of \u00a33,000 if you are willing to put in the hours! Not bad for a side hustle, beats that Costa job as a way to earn money at Uni. 10. Test new products This can be tied in with your blog, as long as the products you are testing don't have None Disclosure Agreements attached to them. You essentially sign up to a website they then screen through all their users, see if you fit the bill and send you free stuff. You will have to fill out surveys and give your honest opinion, but in return, you get free items, and on occasion get paid for your time. Websites like UserTesting will pay you $10 to test out apps and websites (again if you fit the bill). Again you won't get mega rich from doing this, but an extra few $ a month is always handy. Other platforms like AppCoiner give you the ability to test hundreds of apps or websites through their platform. They link you directly to the app builders themselves, you then have to write an honest review of their product, the developer will then give AppCoiner some cash and in turn, AppCoiner pays you. It may not make you a millionaire, but you could earn yourself some great beer money doing it. If you have a gaming background you can join forums or websites such as Gaming Jobs Online (websites like this are more focused on giving you long-term jobs on the side, and some will take a % of your earnings - a bit like a finders fee..). You may need to fork out money up front for some of them, and some offer a \u00a3\u00a3 back guarantee if you haven't found or made money with them. 11. Start an eCom or DropShipping business This is ideas is for those with a little bit of time and some leftover beer money that they can use to test out products. A good way to earn money at uni is to create a drop shipping site (you can also do this via eBay and Amazon, though harder). The great thing about DropShipping is that you don't own stock, and don't buy the product until after your customer has paid you! If you are serious about learning about eCom or selling via DropShipping, then I would recommend looking into these two courses. eCom Elites - For those who really want to learn how eCom works and how to become successful within DropShipping and e-commerce Print Profits - For those who have a little more money to spend and want to learn about how to build Print on Demand businesses. 12. Become a lab rat... Oh come on, you have always wanted to be Pinky or the Brain...right? All joking aside, if you are a healthy person, and you meet the right criteria, you can join drug trials to test out new drugs. After new pills and tablets pass animal trials, they have to go through very thorough human trials, which of course need to be tested on healthy (which then become unhealthy) humans! You can earn quite a lot of money from them, in the 000's if you do the longer ones or a few hundred if it's a low-risk sleep in this room for one-night style test. Talk to your University, they usually have information, or even speak to your local GP - They may know! BONUS! 13. Become a Herbalife or ItWorks Facebook Rep! Only if you want to lose all your friends and sell pointless products...  14. Fine, the REAL bonus. Become an online marketer You have seen it everywhere. People telling you that you can make money at home and earn $4,000 or about \u00a33,500 a month without lifting a finger. Well, it's semi-true. Nothing in life is ever free, it may not cost you money, but it costs you time, and that's valuable. I spend around 2 hours a day updating blog posts, sending emails, replying to emails, writing new reviews, writing fun new articles to help people (such as this one). But it does provide me with a second income. How? Well if you read the part about starting your own blog above, then you may have guessed it. I am what is known in the industry as an Affiliate Marketer. I give brutally honest reviews about products, and then if I like them or think they are worthwhile, I share them with people. In return, I receive a % of the purchase price (makes no difference to the buyer and sometimes comes with better pricing and bonuses). Sounds good right? It is. Fancy a go at something similar? I am currently running some free training with a mentor of mine, who actually gave me the balls to redo this whole blog from the ground up. You can grab your seat here! Good luck with your venture :D ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there! Not long ago I was in the same position as you and I was pondering upon the same question. Over the course of time, I came across many such ways in which you can make some money on the side. If you are a student there is the option of working part-time along with your studies but if you are already involved in a full-time job, then working somewhere else is not an option. However, the power of the internet has plenty of opportunities to offer. I am going to list some of these that I have researched and tried out myselfbelow. Freelance sites:I have mentioned this before in myprevious answers to similar questions. I know a lot of successful entrepreneurswho have a rigid prejudice against such sites. They have an opinion that sites like upwork, freelancer, truelancer, writershub, etc. do not pay freelancers their worth. That is true. You earn way less starting out.But you will gradually develop credibility. As you work, you will start earningsubstantial amounts of money. You can do almost any type of work you are good at or like doing. These sites are something to look for when starting out. Some other sites that do pay but are lesser known are: 1] clickworker and 2] iwriter 2. Own website: This takes a little bit of investment while getting personalized hosting and domain, but if you areconsistent enough, you can not only earn on the site a passive income but soonyou will be able to make a full-time income from it. You can write blogs, offer various types of services and charge as per your requirements and the market rate of course. But you need proper marketing strategies and knowledge of parameters such as SEO, SEM, social media marketing and keyword research There courses out there that can teach you this and for free! My recommendation would be to go for the courses on \u2018Googe digital Unlocked\u2019. 3. Affiliate Marketing: This would be my top recommendation. It is an excellent source of passive income. There are various companies you can register with so as to join their affiliate programs. Some of the companies that are pretty good are: 1] Amazon associates 2] Clickbank 3] MaxBounty 4] Google Adsense However, you do need a deep understanding of affiliate marketing, positioning, posturing, sales funnels, etc. But do not worry, there are platforms where this training can be achieved. So do your research before you register with any of these. And remember to promote only those products that you stand behind. Also investing in buying licenses for high ticket affiliate products will really get money flowing on a substantial scale. 4. Surveys: There are tons of opportunities on the internet where you can find websites that will pay you to take up surveys. The process of getting involved with surveys is extremely simple and will earn you a few extra bucks. 5. Typing jobs: Do you type very fast? If yes, then you have found golden opportunities waiting for you. This might sound bizarre but yes there are companies out there that need you to do tasks like data entry and google research and can use your typing skills. Some typing jobs pay up to a $100 a day depending upon the amount of work that you put in. As long as you are consistent, you will find something or the other waiting for you that is going to help you make some extra cash each month. I HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL! ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose your question is how you can make money just by doing tasks that you send over the internet. You're not going to be involved with mailing physical goods. You don't want to bother with picking up the phone and actually calling people. I know where you're coming from. I make my money through the internet. Believe it or not, there are lots of people all over the planet who would pay you good money to provide digital services. If you can read English really well, you might want to consider becoming a voice-over artist. You can advertise your services at microfreelancing platforms. Believe it or not, there are people there making $10,000, $20,000, or $30,000 a month just doing very short one minute or half a minute voice-overs. Check it out. If you know how to promote online, there are companies that would pay you to become an SEO consultant. You can find these companies just by looking up affiliate marketing forums. Just go on Google, look for these forums, and look for their classifieds or marketplace sections. These forums are all over the place. You shouldn't have a tough time finding them. Finally, you can make money by rewriting existing content. There are tons of websites launching, but they don't have budgets. As a shortcut, they hire people to rewrite high quality content. You can get paid a decent amount of cash every day just by rewriting stuff. What I like about this is that there is no research. Just read the original source, put it in your own words, and write it out. If you're interested in earning off the internet through rewriting, click on my profile. I give practical advice to people who are looking to earn US dollars rewriting existing online content. Learn the DO\u2019s and DONT\u2019s of quality rewriting. Step up your game so you can charge more! ",

There is a big myth online that you can earn a lot of money and get rich fast. You probably believe that myth yourself. I know i did... for a long time. But you can't, it's simply not true. In fact, most of people that believe in that myth are the first ones to quit. So stop. Stop believing that you can become rich overnight. But look. It is possible to get rich relatively fast online. By 'fast' i mean a year or two. But it is difficult. There are a few online businesses that are hot right now. 1. Dropshipping - creating an online store and selling products from another supplier (e.g. ebay,amazon) 2. Affiliate marketing - connecting buyers and sellers and getting a commission of every sale (companies like clickbank can pay you up to 70% of sale but it depends on the product) 3. Print on demand - design t shirts. You don't have to own any of them. You just create a design that is unique and good looking, do a little bit of ads and make sales. The best part is that when you make a sale, your print on demand partner (the website you signed up for to design t shirts, Viralstyle and Teespring are the best ones) ships the items for you. 4. Freelance jobs - you are probably skilled at something, whatever that is. You sign up on Fiverr and sell your skill (writting, web design and so on). Those are the hottest. If you didn't understand this you can check out my website for more info. I also review some great courses and tools to help you out. Link is in my bio. Hope I've helped. ",

            "answer_text": "You wan to earn money online. So many people are trying to do this these days. A few have success but the majority fail and then say it is just a scam. If you want to earn an income online there are certain things you should do and things you should not do. Lets start with he things you should not do. Do not expect to get rich in a few days or weeks. It takes time and effort. Do not grab an affiliate link, post it everywhere you can think of and expect to get rich. This may seem harsh, but it is a fact. All you will do is get yourself banned for spamming. Now lets look at the things you should do if you want to make money online. The first thing you should do is to spend some time doing some research. Check out what people are looking for and what is selling online. Good places to do this are web sites such as Google Trends or Amazon. Having found popular items, the next stage is to find an affiliate product for that item. The best places to look are places like ClickBank or Offervault or you can do a search on Google for affiliate products. Once you have got your product, the next thing to do is make a compelling landing page telling the customer about the product and what it can do for them. If you don\u2019t know how to do that just enter \u201cHow to create a landing page\u201d into YouTube and watch the videos about it. At this stage it is all about setting things up correctly Having got your landing page set up, the next thing to do is to find potential customers. One of the best places to do this is Facebook. Just join groups that are related to your product. In the first two weeks get to know the people and offer them plenty of free information. That way they will learn to trust you In the third week you can then put the link to your landing page at the bottom of your post Gradually you can join more groups and repeat the process. This is the correct way to promote your products I know it takes time but the benefits are well worth it. If you are interested in making money online then check out my business at home group. ",

How not to earn online - Stop falling for all those \"too good to be true adds\" as they say. If its too good to be true its surely is not. Bloggers generally earn online Via advertisementsIf you have a website with decent traffic you can partner with Google AdSense or Adwords and get a small amount every time some one interacts with the add. Affiliate marketing is also a good source of incomeSo for e.g. you have a blog focusing on some technology or products. You can create and account with Amazon get a referral code and encourage the users to buy the product using your link. Every time a user buys via your link. You can earn commission. YoutubeIf writing is not your thing , you can try creating videos and uploading them on youtube. Youtube lets you monitize the videos and you can earn a decent sum. Direct Advertisements on your WebsiteIf you have a website you can directly approach a business for cash in exchange for putting up their banner on your website. Well most of these things are easier said than done. A half hearted approach will not work. Consistency is very important. You will initially most likely earn only small amounts at a time. And most of these schemes have a min payout. What that means is until you earn a predetermined $100 - $200 you won't see any cash or in this case cheque. ",

            "answer_text": "Monetize with CPC or CPM Ads One of the most common ways bloggers make money is through placing ads on their site. There are two popular types of ads: CPC/PPC Ads: Cost per click (also called pay per click) ads are usually banners that you place in your content or sidebar. Each time a reader clicks on the ad, you are paid for that click.CPM Ads: CPM Ads, or \u201ccost per 1,000 impressions,\u201d are ads that pay you a fixed amount of money based on how many people view your ad.Sell Private Ads Working with advertising networks isn\u2019t your only option when it comes to selling ads. If you end up with enough traffic, advertisers may come directly to you and ask you to place their ad on your site. You can also contact advertisers yourself. The biggest difference from the above mentioned option is that there is no middle man, which means you can set your own ad rates. Selling private ads can come in the form of banners, buttons, or links. You can even make money writing sponsored posts where you write about or give a review of an advertiser\u2019s product or service. Another option is to write an underwritten post or series, which is where you can write about any topic, but the advertiser pays for a \u201cBrought to you by\u201d mention in the content. The ways you make money with this can vary. For instance, you might charge a one-time fee for a link within a post. If you are hosting banner ads, you might charge your partner monthly. Include Affiliate Links in Your Content Affiliate marketing is also another great tool for monetizing your blog. An advertiser has a product she wants to sell. She agrees to give you a commission from each sale if the buyer is coming from your site.She gives you a unique link that tracks your affiliate code. That way, she knows when a buyer used your link to make a purchase.You include your affiliate link on your site. You can do this directly in the content or through banner ads. If a reader clicks on your unique link and buys the product you have recommended, you earn a percentage of what she purchased.You can utilize affiliate marketing through ad networks like Flip kart affiliate marketing, or you can create private partnerships with advertisers and businesses with an affiliate program. Sell Digital Products If you would rather not advertise other people\u2019s products on your site, or if you are looking for another stream of income, consider selling digital products. This can include items like: eBooksOnline courses/workshopsImages, video, or music people can use in their own contentApps, plugins, or themesJust remember that if you are going to choose one of these avenues that you make it relevant and useful to your readers. A lot of bloggers make the mistake of assuming they are developing a product their readers need; listen to your readers first, and then create a digital product that will meet their needs ",

I found it about 7 weeks ago and have been able to make some pretty decent money in that short amount of time. I'm not just getting lucky though I actually am educating myself and they're actually helping me learn how to trade on my own.

It seems from your question that you can write English without making mistakes. If you are a total beginner, then you will have to offer something extra that others are not offering. I did my first job for an extremely low price, but if you can write a good proposal, then you can get good money right from the start. Address the client with his\\her name and do not lie, but I think you can exaggerate a little. Find a job that you can do and also make sure that you see how many people have already applied for the job. If it is your first job and less than 10 people have applied, then I recommend applying for the job. Do not hesitate to inform the client when something is not possible and they will understand. I had one client who wanted me to write more words on a topic than I could write because of the lack of information online. I told him that it is not possible at all. He argued, but finally he understood that I was right. Try to get 5 stars in your first job, but don't panic if it doesn't happen. I got 3.5 stars after my first job, but I was still able to get others jobs with 5 star feedback. Freelance writing is not an easy job, but it is very rewarding if you are willing to work hard. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions. ",

You can earn a billion of dollars by using the internet, as you said, not just extra money. One thing you need to understand is, not \"using the internet\", but \"creating on the internet\". \"Create\" is the key solution. There are, to be obvious, more ways to create, then to use.  The idea you are going to use is great, no questions. For instance, the idea to ask questions on Quora and get the instant answer/s.  But the idea you are going to create, far greater and superior.

The most genuine way that i know and you should also try is Youtube and Bloging. These two ways are genuine as well as a good money making method. In order to earn money online the first thing you need to learn is patience. If you think that you start working today and got the result in a single day,single week or single month.

Many people thinks that options for making money online are somewhat limitless and that's really it. However it's not that true at all. You are set to some set of options and not more. For example trading your own goods with production of them from some website with processing. Then someone else goods but bought by you at first. Then someone else goods but you simply promote them, then selling ads or something like that. Than placing ads of some network, then probably selling related services like SEO, programming, design, 3d modelling, science research and so on. Then selling digital goods yours and not. Then simply websites promoting offline services and service overall - startups. ",

Once you make the sale, your job is done! There are thousands of affiliate programs available, so make sure to choose one that give you a good change of making decent money.  The business and finance niches are usually the most profitable.  For example, ProfitPress pays $100 per sale.  If you look around you'll find similar programs that offer high payouts as well. The hardest part about being an affiliate is getting traffic.  This can take some time, but once done it becomes somewhat of a passive income source.  Good luck! ",

Sometimes the people that do give it out for free have great advice but since they gave it for free nobody puts value on it, and doesn\u2019t even take the first step. To make money online you need to have a clear goal, a 1 - 5 - 10 year goal, start with the first year and move up as you go. Once you figure out where you want to be in 1 year figure out how you are going to achieve it. You need to do bla bla, or need to earn X amount a month etc. Once you have the when and how the last thing is to write out small but meaning full tasks you can complete each day that slowly get you closer to your goal. Be consistent, work hard and the discipline you have learned will carry further than you would have imagined. ",

Too much variety in topics does not help you gain trafficPhotos: Take good quality photos on a DSLR or a high end mobile such as Google Pixel, iPhone 7, etc. and upload them to stock photo sites. If you are Indian, then you are in for good as if you could provide some decent Indian stock images, those would sell like hot cakes and provide huge commissions to youAffiliate & Referral marketing: Join up across sites like Big Basket, Amazon, Flipkart, etc. get in to their affiliate and referral marketing schemes, promote good products with nice reviews and earn money for every sale/transaction that happened via your referralHope this helps ",

There are several other methods to make money online as well, such as drop-shipping, vlogging (Youtube channel with adsense enabled), stock trading, cryptocurrency trading, freelancing, creating websites with great traffic (with google adsense or other alternatives enabled), affiliate marketing and so on. However, forex trading was the most captivating and easiest route suiting my personality. When I mention \u2018forex trading\u2019, don\u2019t ever have an impression that it is easy to make money from forex trading. In fact it is one of the hardest ways to make money in long term. Both profit potential and loss potential are immensely high when trading on leverage. But for someone with great patience, discipline, control over their emotions and a decent starting capital, sky is the limit with forex trading. If you have a decent capital to start with and know some great trader with several years of trading experience, it could be easier. Having a good capital is important because targeting smaller profit % is safer in long term. With good capital even smaller % becomes a decent sum in dollar terms and tendency to over-leverage is less (only if you are able to control the \u2018greed\u2019 and \u2018hurry\u2019 factors). I have written several answers on this topic before. So you may also check out my profile for some real good help to get started with forex trading with minimal risks.

The key is to find products that pay high commissions and look for membership based products, they will continue to pay month after month. ",

For every product you refer and make a sale, you receive a percentage of the profit.  Affiliate marketing is such a powerhouse because there is NO START UP COST. You\u2019re recommending products to your viewers and by linking them, you make a commission. It\u2019s that simple.  HOW DOES AFFILIATE MARKETING WORK? The most successful form of affiliate marketing is through blogging because different affiliate programs have rules on where you\u2019re allowed to post their links. For example, Amazon doesn\u2019t allow you to use affiliate links in Facebook groups or on e-mail lists. The best way is to create your own website. You can post your blog article with affiliate links ANYWHERE with no penalty. One blog post with proper affiliate marketing can easily make you over $10,000+! That\u2019s just for a couple hours work. #Source from pinterest ",

There are lots of great tools out there you can use to teach yourself in your spare time, or take a class on it.  Just remember that it will be like anything else.

In this particular context, it means taking advantage of the price difference of a given asset across the marketplaces which sell it. Many low hanging fruits have been picked already. The rise of quantitative trading led to efficient markets for most traditional asset classes. That said, there are still opportunities if you are willing to take risks or put on work. If you can afford risk, you can currently buy cryptocurrencies on Asian exchanges and sell them substantially higher on American exchanges. Of course, a naive approach to this would expose you to price fluctuations which could kill your profit and put your invested capital at risk. If you can afford work, look for physical goods substantially cheaper on Alibama compared to Amazon. Of course, you will have to do tons of reasearch to identify viable opportunities. You will be the owner of an international business requiring you to manage complex logistics. ",

You buy, say, Bitcoin worth $50, and when the price rises, as the trend indicates that it will, you sell, and make a profit. Now you have say $75. You repeat the process, and so on. That said, if you do short-term trading like that, you will be biting your nails watching price fluctuations. In my personal opinion it is better to buy and hold for a long time. Many people are saying that the massive price increases that are happening with almost all cryptocurrencies will continue on an exponential curve. But remember never to invest more than you can afford to lose, and keep your secret keys offline, and safe, (not in an exchange) but don't forget where you have hidden them, as some people have done, who have lost millions.
