            "answer_text": "Back in the college days, while I was still trying to master the Japanese language, I joined a group that gathered once a week just for reading books in Japanese. Our awesome teacher had just a couple of rules for the reading session, but the first and the most prominent one was the \u201cSayonara rule\u201d. The book is too difficult/boring/intimidating? Sayonara! Leave it and try another one! (He always emphasized this by pretending to toss the book through the window. Loved his teaching methods). Not long after graduating, he asked to meet up for coffee and discuss my reading list. I wished I could play dead since I realized that it has been a year since I have read anything. \u201cShame on me! I should definitely catch up, especially with the books that are considered classics!\u201d. I tried. I bought myself a Kindle and filled it with one-too-many books. In every language I knew. However, most of the time, I never got past the first couple of pages. Every time I tried, it made me feel bad about myself. I was such a bookworm, how could this happen? I only ended up dreading the reading, and not picking anything up for another year. Then, recently, I saw the TV series \u201cHis dark materials\u201d. It is based on Philip Pullman's books I read as a child. I decided to give it a go once again. It was as fun as the first time, took me down the memory lane, and I enjoyed every second of it. I finished all three books in a couple of days. It was then that the \u201cSayonara Rule\u201d reappeared to me. I started applying it once again. The book is boring? Delete. Try something else. There are so many books available. Try this one, try that one. Oh, I went through 30 pages without noticing! In a month, I ended up reading more books than I have read in the past three years. So, what worked for me was taking advantage of the \u201cSayonara rule\u201d. Books you have don\u2019t interest you enough? \u201cSayonara\u201d. There\u2019s the internet, there\u2019s the bookstore, there\u2019s the library. You\u2019ll find soon enough something interesting to read that will capture your attention. Don\u2019t get stuck on one book and deny another a chance to wow you. (What\u2019s more, your interests will change. A book could be boring now, but it might be the perfect read for you in two years. You can always try again later, don\u2019t allow the fear of missing out pressure you to read something you don\u2019t find interesting.) Bonus tip: I also found out that the \u201cSayonara rule\u201d can make many other things much more enjoyable. A lot of stuff that are \u201cgood enough\u201d or \u201cshould be done\u201d took a lot of my time and energy. Now, I am using it for movies, TV shows, music, hobbies, clothes, even some people. Choose your battles, they say. And if this doesn\u2019t work, \u201cSayonara\u201d to reading! Seriously. Try something else for a while, and go back to it when you want to. There is absolutely no good reason for you to push yourself to do something you\u2019re not enjoying when there are so many things that could make you happy! ",

            "answer_text": "I have several different hobbies. These include gardening, walking, reading, writing, knitting, crochet, painting and needle tatting. I find that for me, the enthusiasm for a particular hobby waxes and wanes over time. For a few months, I may be crazy about knitting, and produce sweaters for everybody\u2019s birthday. Then I suddenly lose interest in it, and want to spend half the morning writing in my journal. Last year my husband bought an acre of badly overgrown land to play with, and I spent all summer happily working on it. This year it is not top of my priorities because of other things going on which require me to spend more time at home, so I have done a lot more reading instead. It seems as though after working hard at some hobby for some months, perhaps even more than a year, fatigue sets in. Or is it boredom? When I have had a rest from a particular interest for some time I can return to it with my enthusiasm renewed. Sometimes there is a physical component to this loss of motivation. It is difficult to keep on walking on the scenic byways if your back hurts, or to crochet for hours with arthritis in your wrists. Similarly, it may be difficult to keep reading if your mind is distracted with stresses and worries, or if you have not been getting enough sleep. That is how it is for me, but you are you. You have received some great suggestions here, but only you can know which of these answers can really help in your own situation. ",
