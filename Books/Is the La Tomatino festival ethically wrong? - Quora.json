            "answer_text": "It is an absolutely wrong thing to do. Millions of people die of hunger around the world and if we take pride in wasting the food in this manner, it is a shame.  It is equally ridiculous that educated people around the globe are supporting this event. You guys can still enjoy a mass festival by not crushing valuable food below your feet.  I come from India, where food is worshipped. On Diwali, when we worship our goddess of wealth, we also place a clay lamp (dia) near our foodgrains.   When we sit to eat, a prayer is generally said to thank god for the food in front of us.  Rather than wasting food in this manner, if all people attending this festival, cook meal for the homeless and the needy for a day, it will be beneficial to the society. ",
