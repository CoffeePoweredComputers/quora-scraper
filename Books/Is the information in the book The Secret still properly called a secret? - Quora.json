            "answer_text": "In my view \u201ca secret\u201d can be blantantly overt and still be more or less ignored, undetected because it is mostly over and under eyes, noses and heads, eluding thresholds of conscious awareness. In other words a \u201csecret\u201d can be revealed, including \u201cindirectly\u201d so that, for example a particular political ideology that will have adherents that formulate validations with an \u201cimplied obedience.\u201d Thus, a \u201csecret\u201d does not have to be spelt out and the \u201creader(s)\u201d can fill in their own subjective justifications to keep the secret or to spill the beans. But \u201cspilling the beans\u201d does not require that anyone should understand the secret, nor that it would make any difference. The secret can also act like a \u201cseed\u201d where the implantation of information can skid in patterns across time. That is, one book does not have to reveal the entire secret, and even if it does, it would be up to the writer to position the nodes of association that provide the image of the secret so that only some \u201cget it.\u201d I would suggest that most of us don\u2019t have a clue what the secret is in \u201cTHE SECRET.\u201d Given that it would be both a secret/non secret because some know the secret.
