            "answer_text": " The longer I\u2019m alive, the more I realize how simple life is. But, we also tend to make it complex to execute. For example, when I am afraid of speaking in front of people, what exactly am I afraid of? And why am I afraid of it? Is there an example that sticks out in my mind? I have stood in front of audiences for one reason or another for more than three decades. To this day, I get butterflies before I speak or sing. If I were to think of those \u201cbutterflies\u201d as fear, what am I really afraid of? What are we afraid of? When I was about 8 or 9, we were visiting one of my cousins. He\u2019s just gotten some new skateboards. I\u2019d never skateboarded before. he explained how it worked and off we went. It wasn\u2019t pretty. Tony Hawk we were not. But, we were moving around and breaking a sweat. We must have looked like we were having fun because my 5 year old brother came excitedly running over when he saw us coming back down the block. As soon as I hopped off the skateboard, he decided he wanted to ride. Before we had a chance to give him any instructions, he propped one leg up on the board, then hopped up and down to see if he could propel himself forward. There was no movement. So, he decided to jump a little higher, this time with both feet. As he came down, the skateboard slid just enough to cause him to lose his balance and go crashing on to the sidewalk. He quickly jumped up, screaming and ran inside. My cousin and I continued to skateboard. We were kids and my brother seemed ok so we went on with our day. Later on, he saw us coming down the block and he quickly ran inside the yard until we passed. Now, the skateboards were a sign of danger. For a few weeks, every time he saw a skateboard, he would run away. What causes the fear? In flipping through my memory bank, I don\u2019t remember any early situations in my life which would have caused public speaking trauma. I don\u2019t have any skateboard stories about speaking. So, what causes the fear? Sometimes, we confuse our feelings. Whenever we attempt anything new, there is some level of anxiety. That anxiety can feel a bit like being afraid. But it isn\u2019t fear. It\u2019s the unknown. It\u2019s a lack of experience. You don\u2019t know what to expect. Have you ever watched a movie and felt your heart begin to race as you watched a chase or fight sequence? Why does that happen? It has nothing to do with you. You won\u2019t get hurt. You won\u2019t be embarrassed. You are not involved in any way, except you are watching. Yet, there is a physical impact. It\u2019s the unknown; it\u2019s the lack of experience; the anticipation. And sometimes, we misinterpret it as fear. This misinterpretation comes from our self-focus. We\u2019re focused on protecting ourselves from pain in situations where there is no pain apparent. So, what if we were to re-frame it? What if we understood the information for what it really was and corrected the context? Fixing the Fear With regard to public speaking, shift the focus to your audience. Shift your focus to the story at hand. When you passionately get into a story, the time passes quickly and you don\u2019t think about failing. When you are mentally present and outwardly focused, those \u201cbutterflies\u201d can now present themselves as passion and energy for your story. So, before you begin speaking: Take a breath;Find a set of eyes that look like they are receptive to your story;Smile;Begin a conversation with those eyes;Wait for their response;Then continueStart simply. Over time, your confidence will begin to grow. But, it all comes back to creating connection and a conversation. Remember, your fear is not what it seems. But your success will be real if you act! ",

            "answer_text": "if you\u2019d like to feel what it feels like to speak with more clarity and confidence, here are some tips that will help you control the fear and succeed as a speaker.  1. Big words don\u2019t make you look smart One of the problems that a lot of educated people encounter with public speaking is that they think if they use enough big words, people will think they know what they\u2019re talking about. As it turns out that isn\u2019t true. People think that when you use big words you\u2019re trying to hide behind them, thereby making your arguments actually appear weaker than they are. Who would have thought? This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t occasionally use big words. Sometimes they\u2019re just more precise than their smaller cousins. The thing is when you do feel the need to use big words, define them! Otherwise, your audience will end up exasperated, or annoyed, with what you\u2019re saying. 2. Speak more slowly  A lot of people will talk so quickly their tongue runs ahead of their minds. Then, when they no longer know what to say and their brain needs a moment to catch up, they throw in this big \u2018\u201duhhhh\u201d. That isn\u2019t necessary at all! Instead, speak more slowly. That way your mind and your lips can stay in synch and you can avoid those big sounds that really do nothing to enhance your speech, but certainly make people doubt your intelligence. Note that when you do this you might feel like you\u2019re speaking too slowly. That is rarely true. After all, your audience isn\u2019t just listening to what you\u2019re saying, their minds are also shooting off this way and that way as they consider the implications of your words, that strange email they got last night, and wonder what\u2019s for lunch. By speaking more slowly you\u2019re giving them time to come back to the conversation before you\u2019ve gone so far ahead that they can\u2019t figure out how to get to where you\u2019ve gone from where they left you. 3. Write well  If you can write well, then you\u2019ll find that speaking more clearly becomes easier. This is because when you write a lot you\u2019re constantly using your vocabulary, sentence structures, and arguments, which then become second nature to you. Then you don\u2019t have to spend your time paying attention to them, but can instead worry about the structure of your actual presentation and avoid mistakes. 4. You\u2019re not an airplane  So don\u2019t wave your hands around like one. Instead, imagine a box that runs from your chin to your navel and from shoulder to shoulder. Keep your hands in that space at all time. If you can do that, you won\u2019t look like you\u2019re trying to direct a marching band. This is very important! Because however well you might talk, if you\u2019re waving around your arms it won\u2019t matter! People will be wondering what you\u2019re doing (and if you\u2019re quite possibly slightly insane) and that will completely distract them from whatever you\u2019re saying. 5. Don\u2019t use sub-clauses If you\u2019re writing, you can often put one argument inside another as your audience will be able to look back and re-examine the beginning of your sentence in case they lose track of what you\u2019re trying to say. That isn\u2019t possible when you\u2019re speaking. So don\u2019t nestle one idea inside another inside another. Instead, use short sentences and finish one thought before you start the next. That way you won\u2019t lose your audience. And that has to be a key point of a good talk, right? 6. Keep things in perspective  Remember that what you\u2019re saying isn\u2019t that important and that most people will have forgotten about it 10 minutes after they\u2019ve walked out of the room. That sounds horrible, right? It shouldn\u2019t because it means that even if you completely bomb while you\u2019re on stage most people won\u2019t notice! And even if they do, they\u2019ll have moved on in their thoughts when whoever is speaking next gets up there, they check their email or somebody asks them who that blond in the third row is. You are peripheral to most people\u2019s lives and unless you do an absolutely outstanding job or walk onto a stage without any pants on, you\u2019ll probably stay that way. And as most of us can remember our pants, all we have to worry about is becoming outstanding. Now who\u2019s afraid of that?  Image source: google.com ",
