            "answer_text": "Jerry Seinfeld became rich due to the show that is named after him. He is worth around $950 million, more than Jennifer Lopez. In 1998, when the series ended, Seinfeld was worth $267 million. The show ran for nine seasons. Seinfeld was offered $5 million per episode for a tenth season, but he turned it down. He just believed that it was time for the show to end. He has since made his fortune from syndication of the hit series. The amount has slowly lessened over time, but he still makes around $32 million a year. ",

            "answer_text": "Much of Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s income and net worth comes from: (1) His eponymous show Seinfeld and its years of syndication. Netflix reportedly agreed to pay $100 million for a pair of Seinfeld specials, plus the full library of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. (2) Best-selling books (3) Public speaking (4) Endorsement deals (including a $10 million deal to make ads for Microsoft in 2008) Seinfeld makes a lot of money from reruns. \u201cSeinfeld\u2019s cut comes to about a whopping $400 million over that time period,\u201d CNBC noted back in 2015. That means that Seinfeld earned its namesake comedian at least $440 million. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that Hulu paid $160 million for the rights to the entire Seinfeld catalog in 2015.
