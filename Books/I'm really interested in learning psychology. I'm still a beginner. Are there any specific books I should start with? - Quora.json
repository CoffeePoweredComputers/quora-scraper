After finishing them you can proceed to Dr Paul Blooms lectures from Yale university on YouTube. He is a very engaging teacher and you would enjoy the series of 20 lectures. If your interest still survives then purchase Introduction to Psychology by Baron, Mishra. It is a comprehensive guide to Indian perspective in psychology. ",
