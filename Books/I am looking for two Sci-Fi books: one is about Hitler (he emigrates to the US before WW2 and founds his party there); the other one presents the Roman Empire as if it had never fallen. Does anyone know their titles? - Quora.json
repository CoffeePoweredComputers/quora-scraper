            "answer_text": "The one about Hitler sounds a little like THE IRON DREAM, by Norman Spinrad. The title is the name of a novel Hitler writes after moving to the U.S. and comprises most of the text of the book. It\u2019s framed by an account of Hitler\u2019s career as a minor science fiction writer with crazy ideas. I don\u2019t recall that he actually founds a Nazi party in America; he just writes a fantasy of how he wants the world to be. So that could be the book you\u2019re thinking of, although the correspondence to your question isn\u2019t exact. ",
