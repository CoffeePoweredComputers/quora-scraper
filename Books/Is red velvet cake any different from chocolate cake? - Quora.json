            "answer_text": "Chocolate Cake and Red Velvet Cake have a few things in common. They are both desserts, everyone loves them, and you just can't get enough of them. But that\u2019s it. Red velvet cake has distinctive red color that makes it easily identifiable from chocolate cake. I am not sure why the two cakes have confused so many people for so long. Maybe it\u2019s because both the cakes use similar ingredients. It\u2019s not clear how, when, or where red velvet cake was first made. But the initial recipe used almond flour, cocoa powder, cornstarch, buttermilk, coffee, and vinegar.  Image via BBC When vinegar and buttermilk are mixed, they react in a such a way that they bring out the mahogany tint in cocoa. The batter produced is also much smoother than the one that was used in traditional cakes. As time passed, bakeries started adding artificial food color to the batter. Nobody is clear about the origins of its trend but a lot of food companies have claimed credit for it. Before food color was added, red velvet cake was actually rust-colored. Also, there was no frosting used on the cake. The velvet portion in the name referred to the lightness of its texture. Amanda Rockman, corporate executive pastry chef for New Waterloo hospitality group in Austin, Texas, says, \u201cTraditionally, red velvet cake had a buttermilk or vinegar component that activated with the baking soda to make it super fluffy or velvety. Plus the cocoa powder wasn\u2019t alkalized, so that would turn it a reddish-brown color when those combined.\u201d  Image via Healthination This changed the deep mahogany shade of the batter to a bright red. Today, most of the red velvet cakes that we see around us also rely on food coloring. However, that\u2019s not the only way of getting the red tint. You can also make an all-natural version of Red velvet cake. This version uses beet juice to add the redness to the batter. You can also find other uses that use pomegranate juice instead. Both chocolate cake and red velvet contain cocoa. However, buttermilk and vinegar aren\u2019t used in it. Because of this, the texture of chocolate cake isn\u2019t as fine, smooth, and rich as red velvet cake. Red velvet cake is definitely not chocolate cake that is just dipped in red dye. Making red velvet cake is a long process, but the results of all that work is always sweet. Quite literally! I hope this clarifies the difference between red velvet and chocolate cake. ",
