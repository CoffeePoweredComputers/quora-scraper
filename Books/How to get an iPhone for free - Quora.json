            "answer_text": "There are two sections to this answer, one for the purists, and the other for people, who are really looking for a free iPhone. Section 1:Firstly, nothing is this world, is for free. If you judge something as being 'free' only because it doesn't cost any money, then that is an error in judgement in my opinion. You always have to give something to get something in return. Always. (Except for mother's love, maybe)Think about it, even a beggar puts in a lot of effort to 'earn'/'beg' (whatever you want to call it) his money, by slogging it out throughout the day, usually in unhygienic conditions. So the payment he makes here is in the form of his effort. Regarding the question asked here, it is clearly evident that you are looking for a shortcut to success, and haven't yet realized that it is non-existent. I would advise you to look for ways to work hard and earn money instead, and THEN go on to buy an iPhone with that. It would surely feel much better than if it was bought with someone else's money. If you are satisfied with this answer, then you should stop reading now. If not, and you really want a free iPhone, then keep going.  Section 2: This is for those people who are blessed with immense luck. If you think that you stand a great chance to hit the jackpot if you buy a lottery ticket, this one is for you. There are many tech companies that hold international giveaways for new, popular products. One I can think of is the recent Samsung Galaxy S6 giveaway by Android Authority. You can look for similar giveaways where the prize is an iPhone. If you are lucky enough, you might just end up with a brand new Apple product.  Since you are still reading, I shall assume that you might have read the first section as well. As I had mentioned there, NOTHING is for free. You need to have a great amount of luck on your side to win an International Giveaway. Cheers, and thanks for A2A! ",

            "answer_text": "I mean it would be very hard to get an iPhone for absolutely no cost whatsoever but you can definitely get a nice phone for very cheap if you buy it the right way. Most people sell cracked iphones on apps like Letgo, Offer up, 5miles relatively cheap. So maybe look there and get your screen replaced and you could be looking at a used iphone for around 200$. I would also try asking people you know personally if they have an old iphone laying around, I bought my phone (cracked 6s) from this girl for 150$. I replaced the screen myself, screen costing me 35$ . For 185$, I essentially have a brand new phone that sells on apple\u2019s website for 400 to 500$. If you do buy a used iphone off someone you\u2019ll want to check the imei number to make sure its not blacklisted/icloud locked or bad esn. Basically checking the imei will tell you if its been stolen and put in lost mode, and you can aslo see if the person is still making payments with their network. You want to buy a 100% clean phone, not signed into icloud as well. Definitely do some research because phones that are locked in that way are often sold extremely cheap (because they are basically useless). You don\u2019t want to spend 100$ and find out what you bought has no use to you, believe me! ",

            "answer_text": "YES , you can get iphone for free if you you are in india ! and can ear profit too , all you do is simple maths > lets say you want to want to buy an iphone X , it is priced at 89000 ! ( nearly 1 lakh ) .wait till December end for new year sale , the same iphone would be selling around 79000 plus cashback upto 5000 ! along with 24 month no cost EMI .technically you will get iphone for 79 - 5 = 74 % 24 = 3084 per month for 24 months !now comes the catch iphone x nearly costs you 1 lakh , invest that 1 lakh rs into a aggressive mutual fund on monthly dividend basis !MF like motilal oswal multicap is giving avg of 28% return or 2.33% monthly , if you have invested 1 lakh you would get approax 2333 interest credited to your account every month !you earn interest 2333 and your emi is 3084 ,so basically every month you are paying out 751 rs every month , in total 24 months you would pay 18024 ONLY !now after 24 months sell your iphone x , 90k iphone would easily sell for 35000 . so you will get 35k after selling and you have paid only rs 18024 and in addition you have your 100000 invest in MF ( which you can take out anytime )35000\u201318024= 16976 !! YES you would be earning 17 K profit plus you would use the IPHONE X for 24 months for effectively FREE !!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Give fast food a miss- the cost can really add up.Try save a small amount every day. $2 or so every day gets big quick.Every time you spend- think about your goal of an iPhone and if you really need it.Buy used and save money If you are willing to go back a generation or two you can save a solid amount.Take advantage of the used market- keep your eyes open on eBay and the like.Reevaluate your expectations An iPhone 6 can be had for under $400 USD and will still run the latest iOSiPhone SE can be very cheap and will get you into apple\u2019s ecosystem while still having the horsepower of an iPhone 6SHope this helps!

Some big YouTubers do such giveaways but they have 1 phone for some millions of subscriber which makes no sense at all and hoping to win is pointless and waste of time. I am personally more happy to buy some older iPhone or Android phone than make myself look miserable to myself and hope to win an iPhone. Not gonna lie.. I did put my name in some of such giveaways but never won any lol. I didn't wanted to product either lol.. it was a galaxy fold phone\u2026 Ew.. but anything free is always welcomed. ",

For me, this is the cheapest way to get one. And, if you are in the USA, most carriers offer a free upgrade when a new iPhone is released. Also, you can always buy a version or two lower than the latest. For example, as of writing, you should be able to get the iPhone 6 at a really good price whether second hand or brand new on Amazon, eBay or even from a carrier. Best regards, Jesse ",

The popups on websites \u201ccongratulations you have won yourself an iPhone\u201d are click and bait strategy that either downloads malware and virsues on your computer or may later ask you to deposit some kind of money to release your gift. The Facebook post by fake Apple/iPhone pages claiming to be giving away some hundreds/ thousands iPhone as anniversary gift, special promotion, customer appreciation blah blah blah if you like their page and share the post is another scam and nobody should fall for it. If it Sounds Too Good to Be True, it Probably Is. The only people I know who get free iPhones are apple reps, 3rd party re-sellers that exceed sales targets. ",

I mean the real competion means real effort not something which pops up while opening the browser by saying you won an iphone. Dont believe in such hoax.Its more better you buy from store. Because, in china there 33 Apple store out of this only 3 stores are authorised of Apple. The rest 30 stores are fake Apple stores. So, if you win a iphone you might not know if it is real or fake. Its always better to buy from authorised store and you get the best service from apple. If any hardware faults occur they just replace the complete phone its because, in INDIA authorised Apple stores dont have the appropriate machines to open the device and resolve the issue. This is applicable to all Apple devices. Considering all this, price is more as equal to customer satisfaction. ",
