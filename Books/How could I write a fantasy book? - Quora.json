            "answer_text": "We all go into writing for our own reasons. Mostly, we love storytelling \u2014 being on the receiving end of it or the telling end. If you didn\u2019t like listening to/reading stories, you probably won\u2019t like writing/telling them. Any story you write will be original \u2014 because you wrote it. Give 100 writers the same premise, the same characters and the same basic plot, and you will get 100 different stories when they finish. You write from your point of view, with all the \u201cbaggage\u201d that you have acquired over the years. Thus, the way to write an \u201coriginal\u201d fantasy story is to write a fantasy story. I understand that\u2019s not what you mean by the question, but it is the truth. Rather than trying to do something that is SO different from anyone else, making up your own characters \u2014 Pazdells and Qremuks rather than Orcs and Goblins \u2014 what you want to do is to write the book that you want to read. That\u2019s one of the things that got me into writing my own novels. I loved other people\u2019s novels, still do. However, they would be better works if only the authors did \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d, or incorporated \u201cwhatever\u201d. Now, I\u2019m not saying that following my wants would make those novels better for you, but they would have made them better for me. I eventually realized that the only way that I would get the story that I really, really wanted to read was to write it myself for myself. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. I go back and re-read my own novels quite often. Why? Because they are the kind of stories that I want to read; they \u201cspeak\u201d to me because I deliberately wrote the kind of book I wanted to read, not necessarily the kind of book that would be popular. They \u201cspeak\u201d to some other people, too. Some say that my storytelling is great and they can\u2019t wait for the next book to come out; some say that my storytelling so turned them off that that particular book is the only book of mine that they will ever read, and even that was a waste of both time and money. Readers don\u2019t want ORIGINALITY. They want \u201cthe same, but different.\u201d I don\u2019t go into a bookstore (physical or digital) and just randomly pick out a book. I go the the SF&F section. I go there because SF&F is familiar, and I know I\u2019m going to get something familiar \u2014 the same, but different. I\u2019ll open a book and look at the first few pages. Is the writing such that it pleases me? Does the author use words in a way that resonates with me? If not, I\u2019ll put the book down because I want what I want \u2014 the same as I usually get, but different. The same, but different. That\u2019s why we have television series. Each week we get presented with the same, but different. If we\u2019re watching a police procedural, we know we\u2019re not going to get slapstick comedy. We\u2019re going to get characters we know, doing the same things they always do but something will have changed \u2014 the crime won\u2019t be the same as last week; those same characters will have to do something slightly different to catch the criminal. But they will catch the criminal in the end. It\u2019s the same as last week, but different. Thus, I suggest that you write the kind of book you wish to read. If you feel that Orcs, Trolls and Goblins will make it that kind of book, then use Orcs, Trolls and Goblins. If the kind of Fantasy book you want has Pazdells and Qremuks (I just made those names up) who have the distinguishing characteristics that you would just love to read about in a novel, then use Pazdells and Qremuks. Some say there are only 7 basic plots. Some put the number higher, some lower. Some also say that \u201cthere is nothing new under the sun\u201d. If there is any truth to any of that, then you cannot write a completely original work. It\u2019s been done before. The only question is: \u201cHow \u2018different\u2019 do you wish to make \u2018the same\u2019?\u201d The more different you make it, the more likely your storytelling will turn other readers of the genre off. HOWEVER, you may be the one to to start a whole \u201cnew\u201d niche, fantastically popular, which will inspire other writers to write the same as you \u2026 but different. ",

            "answer_text": "How could I write a fantasy book? Well, just like any other book. You open you favorite text editor (there should be one in your operating system, if not, use Google Docs, since you do have Internet access), and you write words into it until you get enough for a book. Don\u2019t forget to save often, and occasionally save your old versions in different files - it\u2019s a lengthy process where something can go wrong. When you\u2019re done, read what you wrote, and see how badly it turned out. Don\u2019t despair, all you need is to rewrite it a few times until it turns out good. Don\u2019t be afraid, unlike sci-fi, you don\u2019t actually need to know anything to write fantasy. If you screw up ecology, economy, politics, swordfighting and everything else, you\u2019ll fit right in with all the other fantasy books! But it helps if you know at least something relevant and make it a strong point of your story, so don\u2019t be afraid to learn a little. You can make everything else work like in your favorite fantasy game, they wouldn\u2019t notice. What you need to start? Some characters.A relatable main character can make or break a fantasy story for the readers, so base main character on the person you want to read your story. When in doubt, write for people like yourself..A pretty girl (or boy, or five) to breast boobily through your novel, will help make your novel popular with people who don\u2019t have enough love. In the 21st century, that\u2019s most people.For children, replace romantic interest with a friendly and fluffy animal. Like a giant blue wolf.Prepare a couple of dozen of names (and possibly short descriptions) for random people your protagonists will encounter.Villains are optional, a modern person\u2019s worst enemy is a faceless crowd, like zombies, riot police or imperial stormtroopers of non-fantasy.Sufficiently ugly faces of nonhuman races are as good as not having a face at all.If you have villains, consider the possibility of your MC solving their problems and befriending them.Some geography.Many people love drawing geography for fun, so consider borrowing theirs.Alternatively, write your story first, and draw the geography around your story.Really hardcore authors can avoid making any geography at all, but you\u2019re just starting. Picture: The Only Fantasy World Map... by EotBeholder on DeviantArt A conflict. For a story to be interesting, there better be something going on in there.Best to take a conflict that you care about, like recent elections, and make a fantasy version of it, resolved with swords and magic instead of votes and politics. As a bonus, you get to portray people you hate as vampires, trolls and other ugly and hateful creatures.Alternatively, you can have some mundane conflict, like a romance between very different people, or a girl trying to earn enough money to keep her family home. And put a fantasy spin on it: trying to date an elf princess, earning money by brewing magical potions.And that\u2019s all. Don\u2019t bother with plot, you\u2019ll know what plot is when you\u2019re done writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Answering that is actually a paradox. You cannot describe how to do something original, because if you followed that advice the action would not be original, but derivative. It\u2019s a bit like asking \u201chow to be cool\u201d or \u201chow to think nothing\u201d. By trying to do it, you have automatically failed. As a certain little green man famously said, do or do not do, there is no try. So I would be very surprised if anyone can give you an answer to that question that goes beyond the obvious. That being said, my (obvious) answer would be: Write something you think is worth saying. Write something that is you. I know this sounds like a clich\u00e9, but I think it is the only way in which anyone can hope to be original. In the sense that every human being is different in some small or great way from those around her, so will the stories be that that human tells. Of course, that means you have to be original, aware of makes you different and yet the same as others. If you are original (and everybody is), and you can put that into writing, you\u2019ve won. There is of course a caveat: Originality does not mean popularity. Everyone is an original, but most people aren\u2019t necessarily popular. Literature is like a conversation at a party: In order to keep people\u2019s interest, you have to be entertaining, have something to say, or play to the right audience, or any combination of factors. What anyone will tell you though is that simply trying to be part of a conversation for the sake of it will make you stand out like a sore thumb to anyone who knows their salt. So, don\u2019t just write for the sake of it. Writers like that are a dime a dozen. Instead, ask yourself: What separates you from everyone else? What can you say that hasn\u2019t been said before? What do you feel needs to be said? What can you say that will make people want to listen and say \u201chm, I hadn\u2019t thought of it like that\u201d. If you\u2019ve got that, then\u2026 well, congratulations, I guess you\u2019re original :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Don't short-change your audience on any aspect of storytelling. You should have a good balance of external dialogue, internal dialogue, narrative, etc.  Lately I've been reading a lot of fantasy where the setting is barely described and the elements seem to come out of an RPG. Even if that's your intention, don't ignore the readers who don't play those games, and make them unique! I really do believe that there's nothing new under the sun, but do try to avoid directly borrowing directly from well-known settings like Tolkien, games, movies, etc. I've also seen a lot of dialogue that sounds like it came out of an RPG. When you write fantasy prose, you have a lot more room than writers of RPGs, which by necessity are very stylized and have to be written in a way that flavor text can be seamlessly integrated into the narrative. It's okay to have stylized speech, *but* make sure that when you read it aloud it doesn't sound flat or corny, and make it as rich as you can. One of the things I think about with dialogue is that people don't always answer each other's questions. Also, natural conversations tend to sidetrack, especially if one or more of the characters are upset about something other than the subject at hand. If you can integrate natural conversational components into your dialogue you'll be way ahead of the curve. Study dialogue! A lot of writers take it for granted. Likewise, a lot of writers take plots for granted. They may not know many of the fantasy tropes and some of the humorous (or not so humorous) terms those tropes are given, like the coupon collecting quest. If you're going to follow a familiar plot (like rescue the princess (or prince has also become more common)) then be sure you have a fresh take on it, and don't make it as simple as a gender swap. One of the fun things about Shrek was that the ogre didn't give a crud about the princess he rescued, and that was in the first act, not the final act of the story. In Brave, the princess married none of the princes, AND didn't marry and/or fall in love with the trapped prince. Bravo, Disney. :D One of the reasons GRRM's books are so popular is because anyone could get the ax at any time, and the fight for the throne is very non-linear. If you have only so many characters, and all of them are sacred except for the sacrificial female or sacrificial black character or sacrificial old character whose loss inflames the main hero's ire enough that he succeeds, and there's absolutely no other characters that the reader cares about in the running, it's a foregone conclusion who is going to win and how, and that can be very tiresome, especially if it's handled by a novice author. Novice authors can be extremely good, but they do tend to blindly fall into every pit on the way to the end due to lack of experience rather than lack of talent. My last piece of advice here is to make sure that the characters have as rich an internal life as they have an external life. They need hopes, dreams, loves, hatreds, things that make them sad, things that make them happy, and secret goals that are all completely separate from the task at hand. Don't make everything about them revolve around the plot. The more thought you put into the characters, the more interesting positive traits you give them (don't neglect the villains\u2013they need positive traits too!) and the more interesting the problems you give them aside from the main plot problem, the more fun your characters will be. Good luck! ",

So here are some suggestions you might find handy, Base your fiction world on some reality (Harry Potter had both the real and fictitious world) making it believable and logical.Balance the good and bad and beat the stereotypes. (And so the prince and the princess lived happily ever after leaves the reader wondering what was new in this)Keep the target audience in mind while writing. (While Rapunzel might sound real to toddlers it won't quiet go well with adults)Research thoroughly and be specific about the places and characters in your fantasy world, it should be detailed and not conflicting with the fantasy facts in your story.Picture your work and create images (in mind and/or on paper if it helps), it will help you keep track of \"what happens where\" and \"who looks how\".Read the works of the famous fantasy writers it will help you go about yours.Outline your work, no matter how formidable and dull it might sound, you will thank yourself later!Do something new and refreshing (paupers turning into prince and princesses are quiet a clich\u00e9 now).Believe in what you write, if you can't convince yourself, you can't convince anybody, have faith in your idea, no matter how absurd it might sound to your friends, it is plausible if you can think of it, you just need to be more convincing.Well this is not specific to fantasy, but just DON'T GIVE UP on that idea you have conceived. It is worth all the discomfort you might have to go through.I hope my answer helps! Looking forward to read that Fantasy piece some day! Happy Writing! (y) :)  ",

Most importantly: fantasy is just the setting. If you don\u2019t have a story that works on its own terms, no amount of swords and sorcery will save it. The Lord of the Rings is an extended meditation on the centrality of friendship in the face of adversity, orcs or no orcs. The Dragonriders of Pern asks about the nature of leadership and bravery - Thread is just a device for spelling out \u201cDanger.\u201d You write.

            "answer_text": "Wow, from the start! What is it you are looking for here? I haven\u2019t written any fantasy for quite a while. I only did so because I wanted to write a real swashbuckler, with no regard to history. So I took the Scottish Highlanders out of Scotland and stuck them in a different world. I made up my own political back story and it somehow turned into a fantasy novel. It was a hoot to write. Anyway, back to your question. Fantasy novels are a great way of circumnavigating convention. Ignoring the rules we are bound by, the laws of physics, politics etc. Now there are going to be a lot of people who tell you that you need to build the world first and plan it out etc. I didn\u2019t do that, I just made it all up as I went along. It turned out really well. The thing is you can turn just about any plot into a fantasy, it isn\u2019t hard; and can be an exceptionally useful tool to avoid the restrictions placed on a story by politics and history etc. So it is exactly the same as writing any other type of novel, you just take a small step to the side.

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t take the fantasy genre for granted. Fantasy works best when a surreal world is created with the real world as its spine. Keep science and other universal facts the same for the world you create, too. For instance, movies like interstellar or inception are basically fantasy movies that imagined a world and concepts that were far ahead of human comprehension and acceptance, yet they managed to strike a chord among audience because they retained the science factor. Time slowed down as they entered various levels of dream or as they reached a different planet in a very different galaxy. Such retaining of science made us believe what unfolded in front of our eyes and enjoy it as well. So, when you create your characters or your world, try not to deviate from universal concepts and facts. Visualize a world that can exist with some rules from ours. That will only increase the impact your world will leave in the minds of readers. Also, stay away from clich\u00e9s and try to explore new things.  ",

For example, the people in your story can fly. You give no reason, you mention nothing, that's it, they can fly. The more unbelievable things you have, the more unrealistic your story. Have Rules Early on, set rules for your fantasy world. Rules improve believabl-lity. ",
