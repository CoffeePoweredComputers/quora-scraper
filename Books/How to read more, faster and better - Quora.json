            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say it depends on what you\u2019re reading and why you\u2019re reading it. Is it to learn as much as possible? To feel accomplished by developing a reading habit? Either way, some general tips would be: Read books because you are actually interested in them, not because you feel obligated to by society. If a friend recommends a book to you, then by all means check it out. But if everyone says that you must read Charles Dickens for example, and you don\u2019t care at all about him or the time period he writes about, don\u2019t waste your time. If you\u2019re going to be bored and force yourself through a book, then the only benefit of doing so is to tell people you\u2019ve read it, which is frankly not worth the hours you may spend chugging through it. Focus on what you care about.As many will answer, which is true, the more you read, the faster reader you will become. You\u2019ll start clunking words and phrases together quicker, and your overall speed will increase without diminishing your comprehension.Some people will tell you to take notes for comprehension. Personally I don\u2019t go to this length, but I have no doubt it will aid in understanding the text better and especially remembering it longer after you\u2019ve finished reading. If you want to really remember the books you read, talk about them with others. Join a book club, look at reviews on Goodreads and Youtube, etc. Immerse yourself in the community and compare what you learned to others.Finally, I\u2019d say that it doesn\u2019t matter how many books you read, but what you gain from reading. Again, if you\u2019re reading books so you can tell others about how much you read, you\u2019re wasting your time.",

            "answer_text": "I know a lot of people are simply saying read at your own pace-which is a good answer- but if time really is a constraint, then there are some tips. 1: Know what you want out of the book before you start reading. Do some research, read the preface and find out what it is you are looking to get from that book. Once you\u2019ve established that, you can skip over parts you don\u2019t need and still fully comprehend the material 2: Read a lot, and think like the writer. This is a bit arbitrary, but when you are reading different books, your purpose in reading that book should be different. For example, if you are reading Hemingway, or Kafka, understand that the jewel isn\u2019t the plot, but the writing themselves. 3. Utilize the internet, but not the way you think Internet is great for general summary and outline, but if you start reading hardcore books, you need more than the plot to fully understand what is going on. When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t have the comprehension skills I have today, but was obssessed with Emerson. So what I did was, if i didnt understand a particular chapter, I looked up the summary online just for that chapter. This actually helps you in understanding the writing style of the author. Almost like decrypting, once you have an answer key to one chapter, you understand hwo the author uses words to arrive at his point. ",

            "answer_text": "As far as reading faster, the answer is read more. Read constantly. The more you read, the more patterns you will discover. You will notice repetition and organizational elements. You will learn that you do not have to read every word in order to get meaning. You may even be able to read things in a different order and focus on what is important for you. This advice works for textbooks and nonfiction. This does not work for poetry and creative fiction. As far as reading better, the key word is focus. Why are you reading the book, novel, or passage? If by \u201cbetter\u201d you mean the most benefit for time spent reading, focus is a key. However, if by \u201cbetter\u201d you mean increased comprehension, which can mean an expanded vocabulary, the answer is the same as in my first line, read constantly. There is no other way to increase vocabulary. If this is your goal, try to avoid dictionaries as much as possible. Get the meaning of words in a sentence from the previous couple of sentences or the following few sentences. In other words, from context. Good writers fashion their writing so this is possible. You will find that you like reading in certain genres. My favorites are crime and horror. I force myself to occasionally read other genres such as YA and Sci-fi. Reading only favorite stuff will become boring and leads to decreased reading. Experiment with your reading choices. Look to Indie published authors for a great range in variety of genres and prices. There is a lot of free stuff offered daily. ",

Speed reading doesn\u2019t necessarily mean reading comprehension, which is important to do. I can read very quickly, but I can\u2019t quote you specific passages from books, while I can give you the entire summary outlined in full, it\u2019s a trade off. Practice is really the only way you\u2019ll get better at reading and accelerate your pace, there is no magical solution. When you read enough you\u2019ll start flying over the words with your eyes and no longer say the words in your head as they\u2019ll skip your language center completely and just turn into thoughts. When I read I don\u2019t actually say the words in my head, I essentially play a movie in my head and the book becomes a film in my brain. I don\u2019t concentrate on the specific words and so I don\u2019t linger on them, my eyes are scanning them and turning them directly into thought. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll always read quicker than someone who reads every word and says it in their head, I\u2019m processing information differently. Now on the flip side this makes it more difficult for me to read books that don\u2019t have an entertaining narrative such as dry history books, text books, autobiographies that just list events and times that I can\u2019t turn into a story. I could never read a math text book well because my brain processed the information differently. ",
