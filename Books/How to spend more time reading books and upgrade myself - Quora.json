            "answer_text": "For me, it was managing myself. My everyday routine is scheduled. Long routine in short, household chores, office, work, studies. I do not get time to read. Still I able to read. It takes 30 minutes to travel to office in morning and home in evening. If stuck in traffic, it could take more time. I utilize this time to read book. 30 minutes in morning and evening. And 30 minutes in night before going to bed. That is how I able to read 30\u201340 pages everyday and learn from the books. Everyone gets 24 hours in a day. To get more time for an activity, manage yourself. And to upgrade, apply what you learned from the books. That is how you would be able to unlock power of knowledge.
