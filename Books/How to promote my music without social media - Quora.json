            "answer_text": "Without social media, it all goes back to actual face-to-face networking. Involve in more event gigs (that means you\u2019ll need to know a lot of event organisers within your network)Consider distributing flyers around your community. Most effective is if you can go to a nearby college and pay some students to distribute the flyers for you.Organise a pop-up mini concert or busking around the area.Sell awesomely designed merchandise featuring your band\u2019s name and do a giveaway around the area. Make sure the merchandise is so creatively designed that people start sharing about it with their friends. Hence you got a branding going on there.Make friends with journalist, A&Rs or music PRs either in the record label or music magazine. Update them with insights about the music around your area voluntarily - this is to make sure you\u2019re adding value to them - once they trust you, you can occasionally let them hear your music and ask for their personal, honest feedback. Don\u2019t make it sound like a pitch - create a moment where the pitch feels natural.You can also make friends with your local music radio station DJ. Local radio station isn\u2019t as tough as national radio station. Sometimes, they\u2019re continuously looking for new, fresh content - but it is always better if the content is localised and freshly made from that area itself - so here you have a better advantage than other musicians who are not from the area.",
