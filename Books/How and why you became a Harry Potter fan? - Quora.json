            "answer_text": "Well , before reading the books or watching the movies with understanding\u2026i remembered some short scene of the movies. Not much I didn't even knew the name just that a four eyes flies a broom or a great hall where a guy(auror) is pacing at the entrance. Untill.i was introduced to it in 9th grade. When my sister was in 12th she started reading it and after that I did too. We would both discuss the events and all. For me it was hard to cope with the philosopher's stone as it was a little bit loose but after reading the chamber of secrets of was amazed . Both with the power and the ability of the wizarding world. I became potter fan after I realised that I started using spells and charms in my real life. And I would go into my fictional world at night. I would curse someone of they made me feel bad/angry or anything good I will use the Blimey catchphrase.. And then I started looking for the merchandise\u2026i can't buy it yet but I have my own harry potter bracelet and watch!! (So less for a potterheads) (+_+) ",

            "answer_text": "I guess I was either in class 6th or 7th (12\u201313 years old) when my elder sister showed me a DVD which had the first 5 parts of Harry Potter Movies in original english. My sister was a big Harry Potter fan at that time, still she made me sit with her and she would pause after each scene and translated the whole thing to me so that I was able to understand what was going on. It was a huge thing for me at that time as before this, I had seen English movies only in hindi dub. After that I re-watched those 5 movies many times till I was able to understand things on my own! This is how I was introduced to the Potter world. After that due to some reasons, I was unable to continue on following Harry Potter. But after my 12th exams(in 2015) were over and I was done by all the competitive exams, I started reading Harry Potter novels, and I completed the whole set of 7 books in around 10\u201312 days. At that time I was able to understand the depth and the beauty of the potter-world. After that I have re-read the books many a times, watched the movies uncountable times but still I am always ready for a re-run to the whole series. So, I would say that though I was introduced to the potter-world when I was 12 years old, I became a fan when I was 18. Hence, Potterhead since 2015! ",

            "answer_text": "How: Before 2015, I knew nothing about HP world. When I was in my room staying alone, one day I have watched the HP third movie and became very interested in Ron and Hermione interaction in that movie. So I searched about them in website and came across the books. I have read all HP books within a week. I haven't slept two straight days. Then I got to know about fanfic. Afterwards my day to day life never completed without Romione stories. I have read HP stories and will read only for Romione and also for Ron. ",
