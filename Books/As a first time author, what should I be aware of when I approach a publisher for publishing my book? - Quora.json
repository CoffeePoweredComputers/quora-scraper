            "answer_text": "The 1st and the most important thing that you need to have is PASSION in your book when you speak to the publisher. Your passion for your book should be conveyed to the publisher. The quality of writing and grammar can be improved and worked upon so the publisher won\u2019t really be worried about that, BUT the passion and the flow determined by the passion is the key. Have confidence in your idea and prepare a script. You will just have 1 shot at convincing the publisher. Make the most of it. Make sure your nervousness and fumbling do not translate into the publisher doubting your work. Self-publishing is an option but it has many drawbacks. You would see that thousands of substandard books are flooding the market. Although Amazon provides the platform for publishing the book, you are stuck with editing, copyrights, ISBN registration, marketing and selling the book. You are an author and writing is your strength, to expect yourself to be an expert at all the other things might disappoint you greatly. So focus on your strength and let a new age publishing company manage publishing for you. As for the copyrights, make sure that you have all the copyrights in your name and the contract says that the publisher needs to seek your permission to publish the content of the book in part or full. This is the most important thing to discuss when you see the publisher is interested in your work. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally the publisher will appear to be the nearest form of god to a a first time author. So naturally you do not have much of a choice. Do you? But you have a choice of not showing a deep veneration to your publisher. After all he (I mean she also) does not love you or has a huge love for your work. He is there in it for money. So now you know his weakness. If you can pretend to not care and if you can keep a straight face, you can negotiate hard. The contract or the publishing agreement is the most important thing. And, as you know, you will only get what you negotiate for and never for what you deserve. So negotiate. For example, try to keep the copyright with you giving your publisher specific marketing rights only. Otherwise, if your work becomes a huge success and there is a possibility of making a movie or dramatize it, or translate it etc, the publisher will negotiate and he will take the biggest chunk of the revenue. You have no say if you do not have the copyright. So if you have to surrender your copyright, do it with limitations as to what exactly the publisher can do with it. You will know better when you are on your second work. In the mean time learn to negotiate. It is as important as writing. May be more important. ",
