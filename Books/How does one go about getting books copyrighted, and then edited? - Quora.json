            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking, Hal Warfield. If you are a citizen of a country in which there is reciprocity with the Berne Convention (for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works) then your work is covered by copyright from the moment it is created in a permanent format that can be re-viewed. Among the most common types are paper, digital files, and photographic negatives. Most of Europe; Canada, Mexico, and hundreds of other countries are signatories to the convention and all its updates since 1975, which is when big changes took place. For instance, if you put your short story on the back of a paper bag, it\u2019s covered by copyright from the second you put it there. If you write it in chalk on the sidewalk, it\u2019s impossible to re-view it after a rainstorm, so you cannot consider it covered by copyright. But if the date of the creation of your work is challenged, you\u2019ll probably need more than your word to prove when you wrote it, or took the photograph, or painted the picture or composed the music. You can register your work, in the United States, at the U.S. Copyright Office, which has an electronic registration service. U.S. Copyright Office. Editing is an entirely different animal. Editing is a service designed to improve the quality of a manuscript, photo, artwork, or musical composition. It\u2019s best performed by professional, experienced individuals with a solid track record. Editors charge for their services in a number of different ways; sometimes the writing dictates how the editor works. Generally, editing is charged by the word or by the project. There are different types of editing: line editing, developmental editing, copy editing. I do not consider \u201cproofreading\u201d to be editing. Many editors who may feel the manuscript isn\u2019t quite ready for an in-depth edit may suggest a summary review first. Some editors specialize in specific genres, and some edit only fiction or only non-fiction. First criteria for selecting an editor is to consider someone with whom you can communicate, and who has edited in the genre you\u2019re writing in. Personality is key in an author-editor relationship. I wouldn\u2019t bring a military manuscript to a romance editor, for instance. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "For editing: Hire an editor. You can search on LinkedIn for editors in your book's genre, or do a regular Google search. For copyright: In the US, copyright attached as soon as the work is fixed in a tangible medium (here, that usually means \u201cwritten down\u201d). You can register copyright through the US Copyroght Office. There are instructions online at copyright.gov. Registering isn't necessary to establish copyright, but it can put you in a stronger position if you ever have to sue someone for infringement. Typically, your publisher will register copyright for you according to the terms of your contract, so there's no reason to do it until you know they won't. To publish: You can either shop the manuscript around yourself, hire an agent, or self-publish. No matter which you choose, RESEARCH so you know which publishers/agents work with manuscripts like yours and so you avoid the many, many vanity press scams out there. Above all, remember: YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO BE PUBLISHED. The ONE exception is if you self-publish through a printer like Ingram, CreateSpace or Snowfall Press - in that case, you will pay for the cost of the paper, ink and glue that go into each actual, physical book. A publisher who tells you they need money from you for editing, marketing or whatever is a scam. Hire your own editor. Research marketing - all authors have to participate in their own marketing these days, no matter how famous they are. Read the fine print on everything, and sign nothing until you're sure you understand its terms. Good luck! ",
