They are like anyone else, they speak, they use ASL, they are writers, actors, poets, musicians, executives, counsellors, medical professionals to name a few. They use body language, facial expressions, gestures exaggerated, slow, or normal, again they are people who happen to be challenged by an inability to hearing people do. ",
