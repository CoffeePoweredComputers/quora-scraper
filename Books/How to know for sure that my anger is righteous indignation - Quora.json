            "answer_text": "\u201cHow can I know for sure that my anger is righteous indignation?\u201d A2A: It isn\u2019t at all clear what you meant to ask here. Are you trying to ask how to tell if your anger is JUSTIFIED, and or that what you do because you are angry is \u201cokay\u201d from a religious point of view? That\u2019s what it looks to me that you are asking. If that\u2019s what it is, you\u2019ve asked a more complex question than you realize. If your concern is really over whether or not your religious leaders will approve of your behavior or not, you need to figure out who amongst them you approve of as authorities, and then ask them specifically. But even that is not something that will be FACTUAL, it will only be the OPINION of the people who you ask. There CAN be no OBJECTIVE answer to this. Since you asked me, I will go further and point out that it is very important to separate what you FEEL, from what you DO about what you feel. At no time, does what a person FEELS, cause what they DO to change from correct to incorrect or the other way around. If something is wrong to do when you are calm, it is wrong to do when you are angry. Finally, your emotions are REACTIONS, they are not reasoned decisions that you have made. No one DECIDES to be angry. They might decide to put on a SHOW of being angry, and they might \u201crev themselves up\u201d by purposely thinking about things that MAKE them angry, but no one goes from calm to deciding \u201cI will now be angry\u201d and then feels anger. That means that whether your anger is justifiable or not, it exists, and you have to deal with it. An observation of mine about this: people who worry that they should not feel something that they feel, are prone to making the bigger mistakes in life. Some try to ignore their emotions, and tamp them down, and that naturally results in either high and self-destructive stress, or the loss of the ability to function emotionally altogether. Some people decide to \u201csolve\u201d the problem of unwanted emotions, by switching over to simply obeying their urges, and so they cheat on their spouses, or beat people up in the streets, or commit other crimes. I suggest that you change your goal with this. Instead of trying to figure out whether or not you are JUSTLY angry, work on figuring out more accurately what you are angry ABOUT, and even more to the point whether you are actually ANGRY at all. Many people feel what they think of as anger, but what is actually happening is that they are in a state of FEAR, and the adrenaline rush, combined with a \u201cfight or flight\u201d sensibility, chances to result in them choosing \u201cfight.\u201d Once you know all the exact details about what you feel and why, a more logical set of choices about how to respond to your emotions, in accordance with your other beliefs and dedications, will become obvious.

Someone else? Only you can answer these questions. When you have taken your notebook or journal out and have written until you are complete about this anger you feel. Decide what you are getting from it. Do you want this________? What is the cost of this? A relationship, anxiety, ulcers, Depression, isolation,\u2026. Decide is it worth it? If so keep being angry. If not. Start the process of forgiveness and let go. Health and happiness will be yours. You forgive not for others but for yourself. But both win. Blessings on your journey. ",

It seems the \u201cRighteous Indignation\u201d has a lot of vanity in it as though \u201cYou\u201d did this to \u201cMe\u201d as if simple anger wasn\u2019t sufficient enough for a call to action. Take the person out of it and focus on the act. Righteous Indignation's are what many wars get built from. Pay attention to the incremental elements of anger, those are workable and you won\u2019t find yourself at the last resort of the incompetent and ready to go to war. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, would God get angry over the same thing? Is it a violation of something pure? Something holy? If you go through God\u2019s word, what did He get angry over? Unworthy people touching sacred objects (Uzzah), people being knowingly unrepentant and drenched in sin (Noah\u2019s time), and a whole lot of others in Moses\u2019 time as well. Please, read the Bible on this one, use the internet to find cases of God getting angry over something, and read it in the Bible. A Christian can hardly be called a Christian if they don\u2019t know God at least a little bit, and that\u2019s done through the Bible. Hope this helps. ",
