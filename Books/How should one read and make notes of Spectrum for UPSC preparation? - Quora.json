            "answer_text": "One thing which holds all UPSC aspirants in good stead are the notes they make. They are good to summarise important topics and even books. Notes will help tremendously at the time when only revision is required. They should be written as the answers need to be attempted. Spectrum gives a summary of \u2018History of Modern India\u2019 by Bipan Chandra. One can refer to this book. Read all chapters carefully. The Black Box at the end of each chapter is very important and should be covered thoroughly. It incorporates important aspects of the topic under consideration. Focus more on the part which addresses the pre-1857 period in Indian history. It has been seen that this part of India\u2019s history elicits many questions in the CSE. As for making notes, we started on that note. Let us dwell a bit more on the same. Making good notes is similar to an art form if an aspirant wants to use them effectively and successfully. There are some simple tricks to good notes. Start making notes only when you have gone through Spectrum once. Starting to make notes when you begin studying might prove to be counter-productive, as it might waste your precious time. Make effective use of new-age technology to make notes. Go digital. They are easy to edit, easy to write, and you can carry them everywhere with you. But, if you prefer putting pen to paper for your notes, use loose sheets. That way it will be easy for you to incorporate any new notes for any chapter. Something that will prove difficult to do in a register or a notebook. Write them the way you should be writing your answers in the exams. In Bullet Points. Clear, precise, in good language, not very long and addressing all aspects of a chapter. In case you feel that there are events that you need to chronicle, you could try using flow-charts. That way it will be easier for you to study them and if you replicate the same in the exam, it will be immensely readable for the examiners. Update them even though they are from Spectrum. You might miss something in the first go, you can incorporate it later. Such notes will come in handy when it is time for you to revise. They also give you the required writing practice. If you have good notes, you do not need to pick up your books a day or two before the exams. Just flip through your notes. ",

            "answer_text": "You will be wasting a lot of time if you try to make notes out of Spectrum i.e. Rajiv Ahir\u2019s Modern Indian History. This book is in itself a very good summary of Bipan Chandra\u2019s \u2018India\u2019s Struggle for Independence\u2019. Besides, there are 2 to 3 page-long summaries given at the end of each chapter. They are more than enough for quick revision. A tip from my side : If you have enough time on your hand, then try and read Sekhar Bandopadhyay\u2019s \u201cFrom Plassey to Partition\u201d instead of Bipan Chandra. This book is more lucid and analytical than Bipan Chandra. ",
