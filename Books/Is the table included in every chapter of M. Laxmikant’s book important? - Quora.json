            "answer_text": "Haha No! Laxmikanth is a wide book especially for someone from non political science background! But you'll develop a knack for it gradually only and for first timers,it might seem like something unending.. but to be honest,not everything and every table for that matter needs to be studied from it(you won't remember them anyway). I have read the book multiple times and also after going through the PYQs,i can say that there are a few topics which are more important than the others like the ones covering the Executive,Parliament,Fundamental Rights etc. Do these thoroughly first and the rest will follow! Good luck! :) ",

            "answer_text": "They are the gist and moreover u will find articles and amendments there with other tables related to the topic. So they are very important and if u r well-versed with chapter it will act as a revision module. Laxmikant must be read according to the syllabus ( if u r reading it for UPSC). They are not something in addition and are the contents only and should not be avoided. Thanks Jai Hind Jai Bharat ",
