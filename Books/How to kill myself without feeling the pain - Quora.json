            "answer_text": "If you want to \u201cgo\u201d as you say, I presume you mean suicide. If you are under the age of 150, and are not suffering from any physical aliments such as cancer. I would suggest you seek counsel from a clergymen or local mental health professional. I believe depression is a well that often engulfs a person, and often gives a sense of being in a very deep well. When I was young I used to go down real hand dug wells, and clean them out. The 4 X 4 foot hole at the top was a pin hole, and I was surrounded by cold dark dirt. There have been times in my life where I had that same feeling emotionally. Usually after or during a string of unpleasant occurrences in my life. I formed a creed early in my life, never to make a decision, based on an emotion, and never use a permanent solution for a temporary problem. I used to remediate suicides, murders, and unattended deaths. The suicides bothered me the most, because after talking with loved ones, and friends, the reason the person did this, the majority of the time, was really stupid. If they wanted to hurt the ones close to them, or get even with someone, they accomplished it alright, short term. The sun continues to come up, and the world continues, and beautiful people come and go out of the front door of life. As I said, the thought crosses many people\u2019s minds, I knew a person that tried it, and failed. He was sitting by a pool a few weeks out of the hospital reading a book. on the other side of the pool a group of people were drinking, and laughing. With that group a 3 year old was playing with a beach ball. As the suicidal man read his book in the sun the group laughed and drank while listening to their favorite party music on a boom box. He then heard a splash and thought someone just dove in, and kept reading. He looked up, and saw the beach ball floating across the pool. He then scanned the area for the little boy. The boy was nowhere, and yet the group were still drinking, laughing, and carrying on. By instinct he stood up and walked to the pool. He glanced in, and saw this little figure at the bottom, 9 feet down. Without hesitation he dove in, and pulled the little guy by his shirt up and out of the pool. With a squeeze and a few short puffs, the little boy was crying, and puking. Oh my god everyone was screaming. The mother of the boy was shaking with fear and tears. She grabbed the boy and went inside. A week later she came to thank him for his heroism, and if it were not for him, three more lives would have been wrecked, and who knows what that little boy grew up to be, and accomplish in life. It was a replay of \u201cit\u2019s a wonderful life\u201d right before his very eyes. Watch the movie, and don\u2019t be a stupid person. ",

            "answer_text": "Sweetheart. You don\u2019t. Life is your chance to experience physicality: all the great and terrible sensations and feelings that can only be had with a physical body. Eckhart Tolle calls the emotional pain of life, collected, the Pain Body. I can tell you from experience, that once you\u2019ve gotten to the point where you are ready to just die, if you DON\u2019T die, you find that what does die in you is FEAR. Once you have been willing to lose this life, you get a clarity that you didn\u2019t have before, and you realize that there is nothing that can be taken from you, including your life, that makes you fear. They say that what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger. When you get to this point, and look into the abyss, and then come out the other side of your depression and step back into your life, it is never the same again, in a good way. I\u2019m sorry your pain body is so strong in this moment. But this is one moment. In the next moment, you are wiser, stronger, and you are letting go of that pain. You have been to the bottom of the well. Now climb out. There\u2019s sunshine and love up here. Your life is before you. Do the things you came here to do , and grow your soul. When it\u2019s your time, it will be less painful, because it will happen with less regret. Dare to live. ",

            "answer_text": "Roberto Rodr\u00edguez said much of what I would have said had I answered first. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, you are a true gentleman and an articulate, persuasive voice for the elongation of precious life, no matter how painful it is right now. Pain, both physical and emotional, over time, either goes away completely, or it lessens to the point where it is quietly endurable, and emotional pain usually lessens to the point that it goes away all together, either with time, with therapy or with the temporary aid of medications that are supplied by a well-trained psychiatrist. Even \"couch therapy\" works over time to tease out the reasons why we feel so bad, and teaches us ways to cope. All in all, whatever is driving this emotional juggernaut will generally go away by itself if given enough time, and if it will not, then that is where medicine, supplied by a good, caring psychiatrist, will help to ease one over the \"speed bump\" that is currently causing the problem, whatever it is. I cannot stress how \"Time, time, time...!\" (As the song says) is almost all that we truly need--that, and a kind ear to listen to one's travails and trials. Given enough time, life has a way of straightening out all of the small wrinkles, and ironing out the larger ones. Morever, many emotional ills are brought about by lonliness. Find a good group of people who have similar interests. And if drugs or alcohol are part of the problem, 12-step groups are perfect for such problems. And if you are afraid that these meetings will be lame, just remember that most of these groups are made up of people very similar to you. As with most things in life, you get out of such groups that which you put into them. If you are truly looking for camaraderie, or friendship, you will find it. Even if you are the quiet type, just listen. You will undoubtedly hear stories that sound as if they came staight out of your mouth and your life. I truly hope that you do not take the easy way out. Life is hard, but it can also be amazingly rewarding. Do not give up before you have had a chance truly to live it. You will be very happy that you chose life over death. Trust me. I was terribly suicidal at one point in my life, and very, very sad at a couple of other points. But I chose life. I now have three beautiful, precious, loving angels, aged seven, five and two. They are the loves of my life! They bring me joy in ways that I never could have imagined. I love them to the length, breadth and width of my soul, and to the extent that my life has expanded just to create a large, warm, loving, caring space only for them. And they know it and love me back just as much. We love each other unreservedly and unconditionally. It has expanded my life in ways that no one could have imagined or planned. And I would have missed it all...if I would have gone through with that impulsive, pain-wracked answer that was all that I could imagine back then. Instead, I consciously waited it out until I got back on track. I joined a 12-step group. I have now been sober for over twenty plus years--almost twenty-one. And it made all of the difference for me and for the loved ones in my life. They have all passed away now, leaving me alone with my precious angels. And though I dearly wished that they had their grandparents to spoil them and to love them, too, it is not to be. Rather, it is up to me to keep their grandparents alive with beautiful, true stories that they will appreciate at any age. So, you see, it is a situation that can be managed, overcome and even mastered in some cases. You too can do the same with enough time, help and care. And even if things don't resolve right away, keep at it until the universe lines up for you. You'll be happy that you did. And of everyone whom I personally know who came out the other side of this, not a one is sorry that they did not follow through with their most dire intentions. And if you need some idea as to how to get started in this new way of life. I too am here for you to talk to or to ask questions of at any time. I will be very glad to help. Good luck and good living. It is all within your grasp...even if you don't think so right now. Hang in there, get help, and watch your world grow. It is a beautiful world, even if life is sometimes hard. Get out there and live it! You will be very happy that you did, I promise. ",

When life seems so hard and unbearable, all I think about is ending my life. But I realized, I didn't want to die. I just wanted the pain to go away. I wanted to be numb. If you are thinking about ending your life, Let me tell you something. Right now. everything looks bleak. I mean why should you listen to somebody in Quora but the fact remains that you asked a question and that shows that you are still not ready to give up life. You are a person in the quest of ending life therefore you asking these questions. Because you are looking for answers on how to get rid of this pain, not end your life. If there is a tiny glimmer of hope somewhere in your heart, please please hold onto it, because I promise there are better days ahead. It won\u2019t be the greatest but its enough to put a smile on your face and warm your heart. I once told my 12-year old nephew that I wanted to die, end my life. He looked at me nonchalantly. Then he said, \u201cEveryone dies, why don\u2019t you try living?\u201d To this day, every time i toy around with the thought of ending my life, I remember his words. I try every day and that\u2019s what they say, Try, try, try and one day you will fly. Hang on please, you matter to me. you matter to the world. ",

Do you have a terminal illness or have something that causes so much physical pain constantly, with no hope for improvement in your quality of life? If that's the case, please speak with your doctors and your family about this decision. There are societies out there that will consider your situation. However, if this is not you or your situation, then you need to consider other options. I saw two great answers on here that took care of who to reach out too. I would just also like to add, that if life isn't bad enough for you to want to it no matter if it hurt or not, then you still have a life worth living. Think about it, if deep inside you didn't feel there was anything else to look forward to in life, you probably wouldn't be here asking for painless ways to kill yourself. Please reach out and talk to some people. Work through what's bothering you, and what has you down. You never know how happy you will be in the future, and don't rob yourself of that opportunity because of how you currently feel. Just get the help you need, and move on to other parts of life that will excite you again. All the best in your life adventure! ",

You can only change that thing no one else can, and as soon as your work is done in this world, you will be called by your creator, you can then die peacefully without any regret and guilt and without any pain. If you left this world without performing your duties, that will be a disappointment for this world and yourself, your very simple duty and work can be one of a piece of the pieces that might change the world and yourself. We were not born to just to eat sleep and work then die, our reason to come here is something very supreme and extraordinary. So to find the right path, just follow your passion in a right way and do what you were born to do, you will ultimately will reach your goal. Then death will come eventually, and then you can die peacefully without any regrets. Life would be never easy believe me, other name of life is struggle. But you will get reward after you struggle and work hard. Where ever you are in your life right now, believe me its only a chapter, not a story. So stay strong and brave until the chapter ends, in the end everything will be alright. If you think life is playing with you, then play with life itself, understand its strategies and techniques and use it against it, for example, how to manage time. Every day is a new test and challenge, and the challenges will keep increasing, now its your duty to face all of them and set a bar for yourself. Use no way as your way. Life won\u2019t be easy so don\u2019t ask for it, ask for the strength so you can face the toughest situation with ease. NOTE: There might be some grammatical mistakes so feel free to edit, Thanks!!

            "answer_text": "When I was 9 years old, I fell down from the first floor (2nd floor in US and China) of a building onto the pavement on the ground, by the road.  I'd fallen face first, torso later.  I had both my arms with fractured bones and my left eyebrow, temple area was split open.  Today I'm 26. For as long as I can remember back in time, memories from childhood and between 8-10 years old, I cant remember how the impact felt.  I remember some of the pain while I had plasters on my hands and the pain I'd sense if I pressed my eyebrows where I hadtbe stitches.  I do not remember how falling down felt. I do not remember anything from the moment I slipped over the fencing in the first floor and toppled to the ground level, about 2.5 meter high, at maximum. I do not remember feeling the pain then or later. I do not remember feeling the pain of having an open head, broken arms while a doctor at a small clinic across the road was taking a look at me and talking to me about how I felt. I remember telling him, I feel okay.  Your brain blocks the pain when it is super intense, parts of your body become numb.  When I was 13 years old, I was playing catch-me-if-you-can with friends at the break period in school. We were playing on a stadium, seating arrangement area, minus the actual seats but only the steps. In order to avoid being caught, I jumped from the top most step to the ground in an instant. This was around 4meter high. I didnt hurt myself then. But I could never attempt the jump again.  So although, in my experience, jumping off a high building could be painless on impact, being able to do it consciously is close to impossible and if you have the self control, focus and strength to bring yourself to jump off that height, I believe you have the ability to give up your suicidal thoughts and as well to work on eliminating the reasons that cause you to have these feelings of ending your life.

            "answer_text": "I apologize for being so insensitive with the way that I first answered. I don't know exactly what your situation is but I do know what it feels like to be lonely and have no friends. I know what it feels like to not only have no friends but also how it feels to have everyone that I ever know and even people that I don't know hate me for something that I had no idea about. I still don't know why they hated on me so bad but I know who I am and I know I'm not a bad person and I know that I don't ever try to hurt people intentionally. Instead of thinking about looking for the easiest and least painful way out of whatever you are trying to escape from, try thinking about how much it would hurt the people that love you if you actually did kill yourself. And if you feel like you don't have anyone that loves you then love yourself. Don't rob yourself of this life that God blessed you with. Don't be so hard on yourself about things. Don't be afraid to make mistakes but learn from the mistakes you make and keep pushing forward. Anybody can do anything. There isn't anything that you can't do. Tell yourself that until you don't have to tell yourself that anymore. Make it the way that you live your life. From my experience it has to go in this order and the first thing is the most important and it is to love the Lord. With God anything is possible. Then, always try your hardest and dont be afraid to make mistakes and never ever give up on yourself. Think about pro athletes. They weren't always good at what they do. Maybe some had a natural talent for whatever it is that they do. Having a natural talent helps but the effort you put into whatever it is that you want to accomplish in life is what will get you there. Hopefully you didn't listen to the other jerks comment telling you to jump off a bridge. It was kinda funny though but if you jumped off a bridge then who's gonna make all the new programs for whatever type of programming that you want to do. Don't rob yourself of the life that you want just because things aren't going how you want them to right now. Push past what you are going through and use whatever obstacles that get in the way as exercise. Exercise for your mind body and soul. Maybe even try reading the Bible. That helps me get through the toughest times I've ever had in my life. I love reading the Bible. Once I started reading the Bible it helped me to realize that there wasn't as much wrong with me as thought. Actually, it was the opposite. I understood most of what I read because I felt what it says. The dudes in the Bible had hard lives. Some of the hardest lives ever but they relied on God to get them through whatever it was that was getting in their way. Think about how long the Bible has been around. Think about how much longer it's gonna be around. The Bible is God's word and if God is forever then his word is forever also. The dudes names that are in the Bible are gonna be around for as long as the Bible will be around and Gods word is forever. People out here doing all kinds of crazy stuff trying to make a name for themselves that might only last a lifetime and maybe more but the good dudes in the Bible; their names are forever ",

            "answer_text": "Trying to go with my own interpretations I have viewed life as a friend. In brief,life was the first friend who introduced me to this world and accepted me when I was nothing.Life is such a dear friend that no matter how cruel others were life still is by me.Life never complains anything instead tries to help me. So,if I were hated by everyone I shouldn\u2019t care cause they weren't with me in the journey.Just because of a small incident or some other existence would I take my life. I mean would I betray my one true friend for such insignificant existences. No I shouldn't . I know everyone hates me but why should I blame my only dear friend for that. The only friend who was ever with me. The only one who was equal with me I now I wanna betray such a wonderful existence. No I must realize how important my friend is and not betray my one true friend. I would be the one hating myself the most no different from others. In short ,leave the materialistic world for once and question yourself with everything.Don't think of statements.Only think of answers then you will surely learn about this dear friend like I did. So ,if you are searching for painless death yourself then that would be the most agonizing and cruelest death one could possibly imagine. Stop thinking about death and start thinking about your friend who was always with you. ",

If you are dealing with difficult emotions, then it could help to google \u201cemotional regulation and coping skills\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s worth a try. Of all people try not to let yourself down. Every problem has a solution. I am going through struggling as well currently with no support system. But I know there is a way to get through so I started to view my struggle as a challenge like a puzzle I have to decode. Which makes me more determined to find the solution to break through this current barrier because I love a challenge of trying to find solutions. Try viewing your situation from different perspectives and angles like you are an outsider looking at someone going through your current situation, what advice would you offer this person? Explore different perspectives maybe some helpful insight can come from it? It is possible for you to overcome many things. Situations as this are offering something within it to be learned and will challenge you to reflect within and discover strengths and great things inside you that maybe you never knew you had. Hang in there the struggle will pass and is not worth the value of your life. There is always hope. ",

Clearly it requires more research and something that can be put off until tomorrow or even the day after. There are probably many people wondering the same thing. You can have a temporary purpose in life by doing serious educational research on the subject. And of course since most purposes in life are in fact temporary who knows you may stumble across another purpose while pursuing this one. So today is Monday, let's say you put off killing yourself until Thursday, Thursday you can come back and address the subject again. If you truly wish to die a few days more won't change that. Suicide is absolutely permanent and I don't know about you but I struggle with anything that has the word permanent in it. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi. Prayers for you and yours. Evidently, nobody here wants to help you pull the plug. Must be, you have more friends in your corner than you are telling yourself. We don\u2019t know you personally, but when people care, there\u2019s no such thing as being strangers. And you\u2019ve already made yourself some caring friends. Which tells me there are people around you who may act out sometimes, but who would be deeply wounded at heart if you did violence to yourself. By your every word, all of which count and weigh heavily, it sounds most like it\u2019s not a question of life but of your perspective towards both yourself and your surroundings. Every answer I read here is already solid. I like the unique take of one friend who said life itself is your loyal, loving friend. Evidently things have hurt you enough to color the rest of your perception of everything: which is what trauma and stress can do if you\u2019re not careful. I had a colleague whom I thought was my friend. Came to learn she was going behind my back to the boss complaining every time I got something she didn\u2019t. Felt knifed in the back. Now\u2026 I\u2019m telling you this because I want you to pay close attention to how the incident affected me: After it happened, I felt a strong (I mean strong) urge to look upon all humankind as a sorry, sordid lot of unloving, selfish potential stabbers. Kinda like when you say everyone hates you. But when this swept over me, I recognized this as the warning sign of allowing myself to be soured by the negative actions of others. I perceived this to be a terrible pitfall, by the Grace of GOD\u2019s discernment. And I said: \u201cNo!\u201d And indeed, we all are imperfect people. We say and do mess sometimes. So we might be gruff towards someone where we could have been gentle. (But GOD forbid something happened to that person, it would sweep the rug out from under our feet. We could be the one who takes it the hardest.) We might sin against our neighbor. And feel bad afterwards. And sometimes people are ignorant and insensitive. Other times, there are some bad apples in the bunch for real. But while we can\u2019t control everything everyone else says and does, and we can\u2019t control events when they happen like hurricanes and pandemics and wildfires, we can be in control of our own spirits. First of all, everything is not in relation to our own selves. There\u2019s a whole planetful of messed-up souls who need a little kindness. Compassion. Help. Sometimes, it\u2019s just a listening ear. It\u2019s just being there (which you can\u2019t be there if you\u2019re not there). A call on the phone, a letter. Helping an older person by mowing his lawn. So, it\u2019s about what we do. You opened your eyes for good, dear friend, not evil. And the whole idea is, when evil gets in your face, not to allow it to define you. It\u2019s just not that important, so don\u2019t assign importance to it. I love to use the example of King Hezekiah in The Bible. He came into power over Judah back when Israel and the tribe of Judah were split into 2 kingdoms. He cleaned up the mess in his own kingdom: rife idolatry, hedonistic culture, etc. He restored the tabernacle and Levitical priesthood. Hezekiah was a happy king. So, was it because he had it easy? Yikes! He once had this humongous horde of enemies under an engulfing king looming over all of Judah: who threatened to devour the whole kingdom \u2018as he devoured a whole bunch of other kingdoms already\u2019 kinda thingy. So before that, Hezekiah set up the first Passover the Jews had celebrated in a long, long time. And he sez: \u2018Look, we\u2019re at odds with the kingdom of Israel. But they\u2019re still our brothers. We should invite them to attend the Passover as well.\u2019 So he sent messengers to Israel far and wide with invitations. And some of the Israelites accepted and came. But a bunch of them attacked Hezekiah\u2019s messengers. Mocked them, derided them, pelted them with stones, humiliated them. That hurt. A lot. Picture your own flesh and blood repaying you evil for good, hostility for peace. A deep wound to the heart. But did Hezekiah look on his Judean people, and the Israelites who accepted, upon the whole lot of humanity, and say: \u201cUnderneath it all, when it comes down to it, they\u2019re all capable of the same thing. They all hate me on the inside\u201d? Did he say his life wasn\u2019t worth it? Ummm\u2026. actually, instead of celebrating the Passover week, he did do something else. He doubled the feast: two weeks. Never underestimate the spiritual feast GOD holds out to you in the gift called life. Be thankful for what you do have. Pray over what\u2019s hurting. Let it out. Ask for strength and resilience. And never abandon the good and the sweet for any reason. Peace. ",

For the lethal cocktail needed ,it comprises of 1)amitriptyline 2)cimetidine histamine H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production, which will help for the drug's first and fast phase metabolismgenerally it eliminates any possibility of survival and renders the cocktail much more lethal and hastens death . 3)you will need to take Diazepam (Valium) as a long duration powerful sedatives from the benzodiazepine class of drugs. it will cause deep sleep before amitriptyline starts to act in overdose.

Very hard to get thru\u2026 Just like getting thru a hurricane\u2026 Its. very hard, and lots of things can be destroyed\u2026 But when the \u201cshit storm\u201d is over\u2026 And it will be\u2026 just like the hurricane\u2026 Things can be sorted out and repaired. They can. I promise you\u2026 Fixing it yourself, alone, can be hard. It would be good for you to get some help. Find someone to talk to. If you don\u2019t know anyone, there are places you can call, and organizations you can get in touch with - anonymously. You say that everyone hates you\u2026 You\u2019re wrong. I don\u2019t hate you, so now there\u2019s at least one person on this earth that does NOT hate you. If that\u2019s the fact, Im 100% sure, that there\u2019s a few other people also, that does not hate you. Go find them. Go online and find likeminded people. Join a group. Maybe online first - then in person later. No matter what you think, there are other people like you out there - more than you think. Go for that solution instead\u2026 and keep me updated on your progress :-) ",

But unless you know how to make a hangmans noose and determine the proper length of rope for a drop that will snap your neck I'd not do it because you could suffocate painfully. My suggestion is to get 20 feet of rope and tie it so that you fall 30 feet. That ought to break your head off of its neck.  Gory but painless. ",

Now your question, Hanging, Drowing, Slitting, Gunshot, Overdose, etc. All have high risks of failure or extreme pain involved in them. However, jumping off a structure with sufficient height (about 8 stories or higher) would do the trick and the only pain would be from impact. Success rates are also significantly higher.

If you're hurting then you need to talk to someone not put those who care through the same hurt. It's difficult and scary to open up about intimate feelings, but if you don't it'll eat away at you. Very few people threaten suicide, they just do it, so that tells me you are looking for a reason not to. In your mind no-one cares, that's a pretty dark place to put yourself in and I understand how it may seem that way, but that just isn't so. My time is precious to me, I don't bother wasting it for no reason, and right now this minute you have my full attention. If no one cares then you wouldn't be getting a response. You need to find someone you're comfortable with, someone to trust, and you need to let it out. Not everyone is selfish, there are those that care. Put your mind at ease and talk.

Have you let anyone know what you\u2019re going through? A trusted friend or counselor maybe? There are people who care about you and will walk alongside you if you invite them too. Please know you can always reach out to me if you need to talk. I hear you and care for you. You\u2019re not alone in this and you\u2019ll be in my thoughts. ",

Your immediate family and close friends will feel it the most. First it'll feel like they were slapped on the ears and a ringing/buzzing sound will appear along with lightheadedness and dizzinesss; then they'll feel like they were punched in the stomach, maybe they'll puke, but probably not; their knees will get rubbery and when the sobs come it'll be wave after wave of uncontrolled tears, moans, and gasps for air. Later, there will be no sleeping. Confusion, exhaustion, anger, fear, disbelief, and QUESTIONS will break down whatever thread of normalcy may be left. Suicide and pain go hand-in-hand, and it's the most selfish thing a person can do because it hurts everyone else. It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Please don't do it. ",

Maybe move to a new country. Go leave at the sea. Certainly find new friends. New hobbies. There are plenty of new things you can try. Scuba diving for example. Get yourself trained up to instructor level and teach people to dive in the open water with sharks. It\u2019s not dangerous and it is super fun. Sharks are remarkable animals. Much more fun to spend time with a shark that looks like a shark than spend time with a human that behaves like a shark. So please walk out of the theatre you are in and go try a few different plays.
