            "answer_text": "When you go for the first date with your girl friend, you anticipate the pleasure of her company. How would it be with someone so special? What would it take to impress her? Can I make our first meeting to last for ever? The thought of the approaching future excites you and probably you you take deep dive into the adrenaline flow forgetting other important things. A successful date is preceded by the proper planning of words, choice of topic to start conversation and engaging communications. First chapter of your novel is always like your first date. If you are good at crafting it well, you get the next date or probably a relationship. Reverse I need not have to tell. Even first few sentences are important to make the impact. I will quote from few books. Fountainhead by Ayn Rand :Howard Roark, a stern-faced young man, stands naked at the edge of a granite cliff. The year is 1922 and Roark has just been expelled from architecture school at the Stanton Institute of Technology. Although Roark excels in engineering and mathematics, he is an individualist whose modern designs run contrary to everything his school teaches. After serenely contemplating his future, Roark returns to his room in a local boardinghouse to work on his drawings. His designs seem severe and simple, but the structures are actually complex. Roark forgets that he has a meeting with the Dean of the college until his landlady, Mrs. Keating, whose son Peter is also a student at the architecture school, reminds him. Roark goes to see the Dean.Here the author sites a lot of open ended queries for the reader. Why Howard is naked? What is conflict between dean and him? Is he planning for some suicide? Is the story on technology, architecture, conspiracy?End result: Enchanting start. The book has been selling for several decades.Anna Karenina by Leo TolstoyHappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys' house. The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him. This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it. Every person in the house felt that there was so sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not been at home for three days. The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarrelled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.A great start. So many queries in the mind of reader that reader will read for sure what is going to happen.End result : It is an epic story.Hunger Games by Suzanne CollinsWhen I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim\u2019s warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping. I prop myself up on one elbow. There\u2019s enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mother\u2019s body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim\u2019s face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was very beautiful once, too.Questions - What is going to happen? What is day of reaping? What is expected?If you are predictable and boring, you might not get second date. If you are unpredictable and can maintain suspense in your character, you are definitely up for a second coffee session with your date. This one tip I guess can work for first chapter. ",

            "answer_text": "PROLOGUE The journal\u2019s contents were hot, dangerous and riveting. Michael Colton, one of Houston\u2019s most successful criminal attorneys loosened his Tom Ford suit jacket and focused on the Fed Ex package on his desk. \u201cWhat have you done this time Lucia?\u201d November 2012 New York Dear Michael, I guess you must know that I trust you with my life, right? Well I got involved with this kid Carlos almost fifteen years ago when he came to New York from Mexico. I was new to the FBI. He was eleven at the time, hardly spoke any English and was picked up in a drug bust. Wrong place at the wrong time, at least that\u2019s what I thought then. I know better now. I arranged his adoption with Kathleen Connor who became a friend over the years. Her cell number\u2019s on the bottom of this note. I received an intriguing letter a year ago from a woman named Mia. At first I didn\u2019t connect the dots but as the correspondence and e-mails continued it all fell into place. Carlos, this boy I had rescued so many years ago, needed me again. In the end, I really stuck my neck out. I couldn\u2019t do it any other way; for his mother, for me. I wouldn\u2019t turn my back on them. I cut a few corners on this one. That\u2019s actually an understatement. Internal Affairs are on my case. No that\u2019s a little mild. They are after my ass! I won\u2019t ever tell them what really happened. And, well, you\u2019ve seen the newspapers. I received a few awards, a lot of press. But none of that really matters to me. I did it for love. And along the way, I think I learned a lot about myself. I know this is not making much sense to you but I need you to do something for me. Hide these journals somewhere safe. You can read them if you want, but I\u2019m warning you, you will be taken in by them, obsessed like I was. It\u2019s all in there. I have risked my career for Carlos and Mia. Theirs is a dangerous love story. And you know me Michael. I will always follow my heart first. And, well, life is short. I guess I should have destroyed the journals but someday I want to read them again and I don\u2019t know but I have a feeling Mia may want them back. So keep them safe. As my attorney I instruct you to release them to Kathleen Connor, Carlos\u2019 mother, or Mia, if I disappear or in the event of my death. Thanks always. Love you, Lucia Why did Lucia choose a career that constantly put her life in danger? She\u2019s bright, beautiful and sexy and Michael had always been in love with her. They\u2019d never dated but they had slept together, once. He opened his desk drawer, dug deep into a file at the back of the cabinet and pulled out a well-worn picture of Lucia. He thought back to the night of her university graduation. Her boyfriend, Tony, was being a jerk. At the last minute he had a fight with her and bailed out on her college grad. Michael came to the rescue. Sometimes he thought he was such a fool to be in love with Lucia. It\u2019s not like she had given him any encouragement, except that one time. She would probably blame it on the champagne but Michael didn\u2019t give a damn what excuse she used. He lived on the memory of that one time. Memories. He pinned a baby pink rose corsage on her silky white strapless gown, his fingers grazing her breast. She wore her laughter and innocence like a prom queen. And she took his breath away, his heart with it. Lucia danced all night until she fell willingly into the arms of her charming escort who took her to the Four Seasons Hotel in Houston and took away her virginity. Under the influence of alcohol, and maybe just a little bit of marijuana, they made love for the first and last time. Michael still felt guilty about it. He had no idea. He\u2019d assumed Tony had been there first. Lucia laughed. \u201cCool\u201d she said, \u201cIt had to happen, Michael. I\u2019m glad it was you.\u201d He picked up the well-worn journals and walked over to his wall safe. Lucia was right. Carlos\u2019 life and his story were fascinating. His relationship with Mia was indefinable. They shared a strange kind of love, the kind of love people are willing to die for. \u201cLucia, what have you gotten yourself into this time? Michael sighed and firmly secured the door on Mia\u2019s secrets. Target In The Sun (Carlos & Mia Book 1) Are you curious?Do you have questions?Have I piqued your interest?Do you want to read more?If the answer is YES, that\u2019s how you write the first chapter of a novel.
