            "answer_text": "We invite others to share openly and have a sense of trust when we talk upfront about our agreements about how we will be together. Each time I am with a group or team, I ask them to agree to let this be a place of non judgment, since we are in learning mode. I ask them to bring their part of the wisdom, share their voice, otherwise it is withheld from all of us. And I ask them to state any other agreements they want to make for the way we will operate together. This creates safety - when people know they will not be judged or ridiculed for their comments or questions. I\u2019ve seen teams add to the agreement, that they will adhere to a two minute cap on comments, or use a native American talking stick to pass to the person who has the floor. When everyone is clear about how we agree to treat each other and feels they have ownership around setting that up, trust naturally goes up. The other piece of this we have all heard, but it bears repeating: Praise in public, criticize in private. If you have, as leader, been triggered by someone on your team, take them aside and talk or agree to come together around this issue when you have cooled down, then share with the rest of the members what it was that triggered you. This is operating from confident vulnerability. \u201cI got triggered the other day by Bob\u2019s remark. It took me back to an unpleasant confrontation in college\u2026\u201d Everyone can relate to triggers, and by sharing, you are more authentic and approachable. ",

            "answer_text": "As Brenda Barlow says - you cultivate openness and trust by being open and trustworthy. Three key aspects are: You are open to bad news and do not blame people for telling you about their issues and problems - the problems are a fact, the only difference is you now know and can help with the solution.When you cannot pass on confidential information be straight.Do not sanction behaviors in anyone else that discourages openness and trust.",
