            "answer_text": "I have a real ghost story of my own experience. It is not a horror story. In fact it is a sweet memory of my 2 year relationship with \u201cher\u201d, about which I wrote a book. It is more like a fairy tale. No one else but I can confirm it actually happened; but there were witnesses who encountered or saw her, albeit without my presence. And I do not have to convince anybody either. It would be up to the person to believe or not.  To me the experience is invaluable as it taught me of our relationship with God, and how a beautiful Afterlife awaits us. And that God's kindness is available to all, He does not discriminate. You can experience what I have, you can meet a (divine) entity and learn the meaning. It all generates in me deep happiness. ",

However, there have been many, many horror stories based on reality when the bad guys were human. Stories about serial killers chopping people up, keeping the body parts in a fridge until they're eaten\u2026.there\u2019s been a few of those in real life. Horror stories about crazed cult leaders convincing a few hundred people to commit suicide, there\u2019s been a few of those too. ",
