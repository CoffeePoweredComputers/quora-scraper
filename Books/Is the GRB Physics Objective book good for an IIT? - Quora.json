            "answer_text": "First of all the question is wrongly written,instead of writing IIT u should have written JEE ADVANCE . U must be kidding I guess, coz if u are preparing for jee advance then u should go for books which makes u thorough with concepts and at the same time gives u an insight of the types of question being asked in jee advance. For that,I insist u to follow these books : 1.Concepts of Physics by HC Verna 2.Cengage,etc Finally,make sure that u understand the basic concepts enough so that u can apply them in the questions.Remember ,every tough looking question has a very fundamental concept in its core which u haven't been thorough of\u2026.;) ",
