            "answer_text": "First of all, do not use scotch tape to repair the dj. Eventually the adhesive will discolor & look pretty awful. If you want to do a good job, you have a few choices. The one I\u2019d suggest would be to order some dust jacket protectors from Brodart, a library supply company (they\u2019re on Amazon if that\u2019s what you use for mail-ordering). You slip the dustjacket gently into the clear mylar sleeve, adjusting tears as you go. The sleeve will help hold the jacket together & will look nice, too. If you really want to try repairing the tears yourself, you can use archival tape on the inside of the jacket. ",
