            "answer_text": "As per my knowledge, MHT CET exam is a little easier than other competitive exams, because you get no negative marks for any wrong answer. I believe that when any exam has a negative marking it makes that paper a little difficult because marking one wrong answer can cancel the marks of your right answers, and that can hinder your overall score. So, in this term, you are safe. Also, if needed, you can try your luck (during the last minutes of the exam) to get extra scores. Now, coming to the calculation part. How do we calculate MHT CET scores? Here\u2019s how: MHT CET Percentile Score = 100 * (Number of candidates in the exam with normalized marks \u2264 the candidate) \u00f7 Total number of candidates in the exam. Your probable rank can be: Probable Rank = (100 - percentile score) X (number of students appeared for the entrance test)/100 It was a theoretical approach that I found somewhere on Google. But there are links to calculate your predicted marks online. For that, they may ask you to mention your name, Email, city name, etc. Hope this was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. MAH MBA CET is a 200 questions paper. Candidates are given 150 minutes to answer these questions.  As there is no negative marking for this test, all the questions with correct answers are used to calculate the final score out of 200. It doesn't matter if you have got the answer after solving the question or by random marking (luck). As long as you mark it correctly, you will get a mark for it. The challenge is solving more questions genuinely instead of relying on random marking. In the last 5 minutes, you can mark questions randomly so that you will get a few extra marks.  All the best!
