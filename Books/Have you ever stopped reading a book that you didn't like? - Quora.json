People are out there claiming they cannot, for the love of everything sweet, stop reading a book however bad it is. Not the case with me, bitch I got limited time. Almost 1/4 of the participants in a Goodreads poll believe that it is our duty to read bad books .  I have a couple of books that I did not complete reading, not necessarily because they were bad. Think and Grow Rich  Bought it way back when I read exclusively self-help books and thought fiction was futile. Naive dumbfuck. Still, this book did not appeal to me in the least, I still haven't read it past page 13. Even when I lacked any new reading material, in the quarantine days, I could not muster up an iota of strength to go through this \u201cbook\u201d, Napoleon Hill came across as a fraud to me. Guess what? I'm not alone The Untold Story of Napoleon Hill, the Greatest Self-Help Scammer of All Time  A Brief History of Time  This book does not deserve to be on this list, it doesn\u2019t. Hawking tries his best to be lucid, but my last stint with science was in 8th Grade, and with black holes, when I watched Interstellar. It started pretty well, but after a point, things went past the mark of no return. I may have skipped past a concept or two and the things that followed were interconnected.  Why Stock Markets Crash.  I have no idea why, but my \u201cwell-read\u201d ass thought this book was a collection of all past market crashes, a fun read any time of the day, right? The last time someone was as wrong Columbus discovered America while looking for India. The book is supposed to be a statistical insight, or something along those lines, into all past market crashes and is filled to the brim with statistical data and tools, not in the initial pages that I sampled before I bought it. I would go through this monstrosity ( no better word would describe it) once I get a handle on all the statistical tools.  On a parting note, life\u2019s too short to complete a book that you don\u2019t find appealing. Don\u2019t read a book just so you get the ability to say, \" I've read the book\", read it cause you understand it, can feel what the author means to say. Drop a book if you don't get it, there are tons of books waiting for you out there, you just have to go exploring!  ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever stopped reading a book that you didn't like? I tried doing this many times but my pride won\u2019t let me lol. I was always taught to finish something once you started it. Of course, lots of times. A book must prove itself worthy of my time. Most tend to fall into one of two categories: Either I have trouble putting it down, or I have trouble picking it back up. In the first category, I may need to force myself to set it aside and go to sleep so that I can be alert enough to be productive at work the next day. Those are good books. I just finished Caraval, by Stephanie Garber. It\u2019s not the best book I ever read, but was good enough to make it into this former category. Filled with mystery and a what\u2019s-real-and-what\u2019s-imaginary vibe, it was an engaging read.  The second category won\u2019t last long. If I say to myself, \u201cWell, I guess I should read for a while before retiring instead of messing around on Quora.\u201d That\u2019s a good indication the book currently on my nightstand is not worth my time. If it continues to fail this test three nights in a row, I probably won\u2019t finish it. There have been some in-between books\u2014novels I finished out of a sense of duty, or like you, out of a pride, or a need to say I completed something I started. For example, many people acclaim Asimov\u2019s Foundation trilogy as one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time. I beg to differ. I read it as a young man and never saw the appeal. More recently, I thought I should give it another try. Perhaps I\u2019d misjudged it, or lacked the maturity to understand its nuances? Nope. I was right the first time. I managed to finish it so I could claim to be a \u201creal\u201d science fiction fan, not because I enjoyed it.  Another I barely managed to finish is Lev Grossman\u2019s The Magicians (now a TV series). It was a pointless sad sack wandering that I finished only because I nursed the vain hope that the characters would grow beyond their aimless, hopeless, hedonistic existence, riddled with bad decisions. They never did, and the work never rose above a frustrating, senseless read, even ending with a kind of \u201clife is meaningless so you may as well eat, drink, exploit people, and get laid as much as you can\u201d kind of vibe. That\u2019s hours of my life I\u2019ll never get back.  ",
