            "answer_text": "Montaigne\u2019s book is one of the most wonderful in existence, and can change your life, but as a starting place in philosophy, it might give you the wrong idea. I might suggest you start with one of the early Platonic dialogues: Euthyphro, Apology, Meno, or Phaedo. This will give you some idea of how philosophy began, what kind of discourse it deals in, and what purposes it was initially envisaged to serve. If you like these, read the Republic and others. It has been said that all philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato. This is an exaggeration, but not a wild one. Plato and his student Aristotle form the foundation of philosophical discourse in the West. From there, you can strike out in many directions. You might also want to read a book on the history of philosophy. Avoid Bertrand Russell\u2019s, which was a potboiler and does serious injustice to some important thinkers, particularly Hegel and Nietzsche. Avoid, too, Will Durant. Anyone who thinks Voltaire may have been the greatest philosopher ever to live should clearly have stuck to writing popular histories. Try, instead, something like Anthony Kenny\u2019s A New History of Western Philosophy \u2014 readable, clear, written by a master, and more balanced than Russell\u2019s often-cheeky, always-tendentious account.  Amazon.com: A New History of Western Philosophy (9780199656493): Anthony Kenny: Books But by all means, do read Montaigne. He is wonderful, and his Essais a book to live with, reread, and savor. Seventeen! So young. I wish you many happy hours in the study of this great discipline. The humanities are quite out of fashion now, and perhaps in irremediable eclipse, but they continue to reward those who come to them seeking illumination \u2014 not with the meaning of life, perhaps, but certainly with some enlarged sense of what life is, and what sort of creatures we are. Best wishes. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing against Montaigne, but I think you need to use a topic scanning approach first, to find out what range of things have been going on in philosophy over the ages, and do NOT take any of it seriously without also knowing the context of the lives of the people who were eventually called philosophers, andknowing that they had limitations of perception, limitations of knowledge, were typically writing to be able to manage within a certain context \u201cof the times\u201d they lived in, and that nobody is complete or perfect as a knower of the worldnone of them, if they are other people, are you, and you live your life, in your time.If you always include a wide scan of things as part of your learning, across all times and geographies and cultures, you can go into this topic of philosophy without letting any particular idea become settled or take over your thinking in any way it shouldn\u2019t. Then continue. Look at a wide variety of philosophers. Generally you\u2019d think they were all trying to be sincere, to deal with reality and situations in life with a sense of responsibility and hope for the best way forward, but again, none of them were you and aren\u2019t responsible for your life. However, philosophies of the past have become cemented in some things going on, such as in law, economics, the corporate business model and cult, the criminal world that now runs all US politics and many corporate multinationals and nation states. Some are deliberately being used for criminal purposes and some are adopted and continue to be used without being adequately reviewed and inspected over time, as times change. No matter what a philosopher says, be aware that in politics, big corporations, big law, big nation states, big media, that being honest, accountable and responsible is NOT what they\u2019re doing. Economics as taught in university always avoids the topic that is core to how economics in the real world operates: corruption in politics as it affects corporate control of politics and therefore immediately controls economics, law, media, education and business, right down to your paycheck and the behavior of people in your town/city. It\u2019s true that corruption has a huge constant influence on how things work in reality, and university puts fairyland ideas into people\u2019s heads, stories that are hardly adequate to telling you what really goes on in this world. To be a person who rises above this, has self-respect, self-control, self-discipline, who builds their own career and life, who learns with high capacity instead of being turned into a complacent sycophant chasing a place at the corporate water cooler, you have to learn outside the cage of institutions, so do so. It\u2019s highly enjoyable being free of so many shackles and rigid mindsets that typically result in career, experiential and existential stagnancy. Or worse. #1 word to remember: GROWTH. Aim to always be growing. Organically, and in many ways, not by leaps and bounds, but by realistic, networked, widely experienced knowledge, attention, interests and experiencing. Then you keep your head above the waters of habit, complacency, resignation, fatigue and being fooled. ",
