            "answer_text": "Fiction is not like real life. Real life is about people. In fiction, the characters aren\u2019t people. They\u2019re a means of telling stories that will have a meaning for people. Stories are about themes and ideas. I recently answered a question about The Hobbit. The Hobbit is a book about characters that struggle with identity and obsession (themes that continue into LOTR). It\u2019s the characters\u2019 internal struggles that define the book. That\u2019s what the book is about. So the characters are chosen to fit the needs of the book. If you begin with the characters, and try to come up with situations for them to get involved in, it will likely be a worthwhile exercise, and it might even result in an entertaining narrative. But it wont make for a very enduring, compelling, affecting or meaningful story. I\u2019m not saying you should throw out the characters and start again. The core lesson of my course, Kitless Character Creation (DM me for a coupon), is that stories and characters have to be developed together; as you create a story, that influences the nature of the characters, and as you develop characters, that influences the course of the story. So my advice to you is to set the characters aside for a while, and instead, think of the kind of situations that you like to read about. Make a note of a few of them. You can even just make a list of some of the situations that you have enjoyed reading in a few of your favorite books (and feel free to include situations you\u2019ve enjoyed watching in a few of your favorite movies/TV shows or narrative video games). Once you have your list, start thinking about what kind of story would contain several or more of those kinds of situations. As you think more about the story, start bringing the characters into the situations; at this point, see how well the characters match up to the situations, and then start tweaking both. Adapt the characters to the situations and the situations to the characters, until you have a good fit. At some point while you\u2019re doing this, a story framework will start to suggest itself to you. It may be quite early in the process or quite late. It may at first seem rather basic, simplistic or unoriginal. This, emphatically, does not matter. It rarely matters what the structure of the story is. It matters what the story is about (but you might not yet have discovered that!), and it matters how you tell the story. It\u2019s in the \u2018how\u2019 that you will find your originality, your voice, your message. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written 15 books and now I\u2019m in the middle of an Action novella and a Contemporary Romance. I find inspiration all over the place. 1. Set up a desktop file on your computer name it project A or a working title. 2. Read the news, copy and screen-save stories, ideas that appeal to you. 3. Gossip sites are ripe with plots. 4. Social commentary sites or even comments on an op-ed piece online are good. 5. Quora has tons of top writers with interesting backgrounds, profiles and subjects, use these as a help in building your character. 6. I keep an Excel spreadsheet on every book I write/fiction/non-fiction/novella because I plot and it\u2019s easy to cut/paste/insert. The top of the sheet has my characters whether they are ongoing or new to the book. 7. Flesh out your characters from personalities, politics, the arts, TMZ, anywhere and anything. 8. The romance writers I know use photos, again, a screen shot of a face/body that appeals to you, then you build your character, and eventually their habits and what they do for a living and your scenarious will begin to flow. With so much information online today, the challenge will be how to eliminate extraneous things and focus on a few key items. Good luck and have fun! ",
