            "answer_text": " I may say yes, book blogging is still profitable in 2020. Certainly, if you compare with the traffic and the people who are still interested to read are now less then what was before. The competition in the online industry has increased as well. So make sure that your content is unique and different from others, if you do so then nothing can be more profitable for you then blogging. And ya, the most important thing, don't think that you can fool Google. So no stealing and shortcuts, as most of the newcomers in the blogging industry do!!! Hope this helps you !!!\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03 ",
