            "answer_text": "Nightmares can be accredited to many different things, but they all are rooted in one thing, fear. As a follower of the Lord Jesus, I've come to realize that He has made provision for absolutely everything that a person will deal with in this life. Even nightmares. I will suggest this, which ive advised to others with similar problems; if you do not know Jesus, turn to Him now. If you do know Him ,then prayerfully dedicate your sleep to the Lord Jesus. Ask Jesus to be Lord over your subconscious as well as Lord over your conscious. Invite Him into the farthest reaches of your mind, body, and spirit. Ask Jesus to sanctify your sleep, and open that place of rest up to His kingdom purposes. You will see a dramatic difference, as perfect love casts out fear; and there is no greater, nor more perfect love than that of Christ. There is no softer pillow than a clear conscience. ",

While you do so you remind yourself that it was just a dream\u2026 an annoying dream\u2026 but just a dream \u2026. and it will only disturb you as long as you dwell on it. Often dreams are just random associations of thoughts and feelings as your brains is cleaning up and sorting out the \u201cpiles of files\u201d. Sometimes a dream or nightmare may be your brain processing unresolved thoughts and feelings. Perhaps there are some themes and feelings that you become aware of and you explore those thoughts and feelings to find resolve. And place the thought in your mind that if it returns, it is only a dream and you are bored with it. Perhaps if it does return some part of your sleeping mind with be bored with the theme and change it. ",
