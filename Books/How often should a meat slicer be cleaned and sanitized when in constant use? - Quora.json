            "answer_text": "In my experience, even in the busiest of locations, the slicer(s) were cleaned and sanitized multiple times throughout the day. I mention them as plural because it was common for us to have (for example) one slicer dedicated to hot meats (such as corned beef and pastrami) and another dedicated to cold meats (ham, turkey, roast beef, etc.). There were even places that had dedicated slicers for corned beef and one for pastrami (helped keep the small particles from the different meats from cross contamination) seeing some pastrami bits in a corned beef sandwich was both a professionalism and aesthetic point. End of day. Absolutely. It was part of the nightly clean-and-close procedures.End of shift. If there was a shift change, you cleaned and sanitized your station and equipment for the next shift. No one wants to start work with the mess left behind by the person/team that you are relieving. It\u2019s not only a good practice, it is \u201ckitchen karma\u201d.End of rush. If the lunch rush resulted in heavy use of the slicer(s), then any lull in the mayhem was a chance to catch your breath and clean up.Whenever it needs it. The question brings up \u201cconstant use\u201d which to me means that there is a cook/worker who never leaves the slicer. If/when they notice any issue with the function of the slicer or change to the meat slices, it was time to stop slicing for a moment, clean the slicer, check the blade, and remedy any/all issues found.It\u2019s a potentially dangerous bit of gear and if it is acting even the slightest bit \u201cwonky\u201d, or there are questions about cleanliness, it\u2019s better to stop, clean and check everything rather than to proceed with questionable equipment. Customers may not like waiting a few minutes for their food, but believe me, they utterly hate the idea that there may be some \u201csliced human\u201d in their order. Safety (of all kinds) first. ",
