            "answer_text": "Not a real thing. Allow me to explain myself. Writing is a trade. For a lot of writers, it's their main/only job. For any other job, you don't just call your boss and say \u201cSorry, I can't come into work today. I have office worker's block.\u201d So why should writing be any different? We say we have writer's block when we feel like our creativity has been plugged up, or dried out, or whatever. We can't get the words out like we used to, so we take a break from writing to allow our minds to refresh as we get over the block. It may feel like a block, but your brain is actually very busy. Your subconsciousness is working on that book even when you aren't actively writing. If you feel like the words just won't come, don't worry too much about it! Allow yourself to take a break and let your brain recharge itself. When you go back to writing, you'll most likely have a lot of new ideas or see problems/loopholes that you missed before. I've copy/pasted some of this email I received from NY Times Bestselling author Jerry Jenkins (I highly recommend checking out his website; there are lots of great articles with writing advice): At its core, \u201cI\u2019m stuck\u201d is just a convenient way to hide the real problem preventing us from making progress on our books. You know which problem I\u2019m talking about... The one that\u2019s scary and uncomfortable. The one we don\u2019t want to deal with. The one that little voice inside our heads likes to bring up again and again. Depending on where you are in your writing journey, that pesky problem is almost certainly one of the following five. The Top 5 Problems We Try to Hide with \u201cI\u2019m Stuck\u201d #1: You\u2019re afraid your writing isn\u2019t good enough. I put this one first because it\u2019s by far the most common translation of \u201cI\u2019m stuck.\u201d If you read my emails, you know I still struggle with this fear every time I work on a new book. But here\u2019s the truth\u2026 If every author who ever feared their writing wasn\u2019t good enough had actually been \u201cstuck,\u201d then all the finished books in history would fit on your bookshelf. In other words, fear can feel paralyzing\u2014but just about every published author who ever lived is an example that it doesn\u2019t have to actually be paralyzing. #2: You\u2019re using life\u2019s daily distractions and challenges as excuses to procrastinate. Look at the images that appear when you pop \u201cwriting\u201d into the search bar on a popular photography website:  This is what we\u2019re led to believe writing should look and feel like. Sunlight streaming onto the crisp pages of a fresh notebook. Organized desks. Steaming cups of coffee. Solitude. The truth? Writing is inconvenient. It is difficult. It rarely looks like something you would post on Instagram. When I started working on my first book, my \u201cdesk\u201d was a plank set on two kitchen chairs. I\u2019d put my kids to bed, set my typewriter on the plank, and get to work. It\u2019s always easier to dream about writing than to actually write. #3: You\u2019re afraid of sharing your writing with anyone. The other day I received an email from an aspiring author who described this exact problem. Can you relate to this? \u201cThe problem is that I'm terrified of sharing any of my work. I feel like it has to be practically perfect or it will prove a waste of my life (I'm well aware how silly that sounds, but it doesn't mean the fear isn't still there).\u201d Few non-writers understand how terrifying the stakes can feel inside your head. Even when you know you\u2019re being \u201csilly,\u201d as the writer above mentioned! No wonder this makes so many feel stuck. #4: Criticism makes you feel like giving up. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a beginner sharing your first couple of pages with your spouse or a seasoned pro reading the inevitable one-star Amazon reviews for your newest book... Criticism stings. Even if you fully understand that it\u2019s an essential ingredient for improving as a writer, criticism can still freeze you in your tracks. #5: A publisher rejected you. A rejection letter is perhaps the most devastating type of criticism. Sometimes the mere prospect of receiving one prevents writers from even attempting to pitch their manuscripts in the first place. A single \u201cno\u201d can feel like the end because it means someone who knows what they're talking about didn't like your writing. It's hard to fight off that voice that says, \u201cSee? Told you you're not cut out for this.\u201d If you\u2019re struggling with any of these challenges, I know they\u2019re not fun to think about. But I bring them up for a reason you need to hear... None of them\u2014not one\u2014mean you are actually stuck. No matter how great your fear. No matter how busy you are with work or family. No matter how much you doubt your own ability. No matter how much you\u2019ve been rejected. Here\u2019s the truth: Every successful writer I know has experienced one or more of those five problems. And they didn\u2019t overcome them through mystical writing ability. The craft of writing is only one piece of the puzzle. Understanding the nuts-and-bolts will boost your confidence and improve your skills, but it will never make you immune from the mental hurdles that plague even the most talented authors. Sometimes, you have to work on yourself to work on your book. Think about it this way... Is your car stuck when it\u2019s in park? No. It just needs its gears shifted. Writers work the same way. When any of the challenges mentioned above have you feeling stuck, the reality is you\u2019re only one or two mental shifts from putting yourself in gear and unlocking consistent, steady progress. Remind yourself you are not stuck. Remind yourself there is hope. Remind yourself that it\u2019s never too late to change.  ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cMy failure to start writing.\u201d That\u2019s all it is, and writer\u2019s block is nothing in and of itself. It\u2019s YOU. Your inability to understand what WB is, what it isn\u2019t, and how to work around it. First, writer\u2019s block is an inability to write. Second, it\u2019s not a disease or any other rationally definable state of being. Third, you can avoid it by writing. PERIOD. Writing. You know, the opposite of the inability to write? Do you see where I\u2019m coming from here? Writing is writing. Block is blocking. Of the two, which are you seeking to do, write or block? If it\u2019s \u201cwrite,\u201d get going. If it\u2019s \u201cblock,\u201d don\u2019t get going. Just sit around, looking skyward, and hoping for divine inspiration. If you find it, please let me know, because I want to start drinking what you\u2019re drinking. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019d better get busy. I think writers sometimes have trouble \u201csetting the table\u201d for what they\u2019re working on or trying to create. That probably means they haven\u2019t thought through the scenario of that specific project in as much detail as they need to. Regardless, kicking the brain in the butt will get it started thinking creatively. How do you kick a brain in the butt? By writing. Anything. Everything. And THEN going back to what it is you really wanted to write in the first place. Once you get your literary brain moving, the rest comes naturally. Trust me on this. Been there, done that. Better yet, taught that. Experience the success from my teaching that. Here\u2019s how. You can either sit back and eschew the process of writing as damnably hard, or you can pick up your shoulders, throw out your chest, and hit the road running. WHERE you\u2019re running doesn\u2019t matter. Just like in jogging, getting your mind to take those first few faltering steps is the key to finishing that half-mile leg. So, what are you waiting for? Hope this helps. ",
