            "answer_text": "First, ask yourself about why you want to suicide. And no matter what the reason is, I think you have no right to suicide. I understand that you may have problems in real life, but if everyone who faces some problems suicide, humanity would have extincted since centuries. Have you thought about what would happen to the people who know you if you suicide? Have you thought that your problems may sound meaningless to some people who still struggle to find a way out of their pronlems? I mean I know a man whose father died before he was born and his mother died when he was 6. So his grandfather took care of him until until he died two years after that. This child moved to live with his uncle. People called him mad because he was trying to convey a message to them. I think you should read his story. His name was Muhammad Ibn Abdullah. Also, I don't know which faith you're following, but either you're a christian, a Muslim, an atheist or following any other faith, I advise to go back to your house, put your head on the ground and pray for guidance and for a better life. Believe me, You may think I'm joking or a mad man, but please do that. You have nothing to lose. Even if you're an atheist, do that. Please. ",
