            "answer_text": "I believe in two ways, experiential and more formalized. When I was about 7/8 years old I signed a contract with my mother to repay her a $5 loan. My allowance was no longer covering my jonesing for comic books and action figures. The plan was simple, take $5 buy 10 Sunday papers at 50 cents each, use shopping cart as barrier in building to apartment doors, ring bell, offer paper before 9am at 75 cents. Occasionally be super cute and lack change to get full dollar. If I wanted to I might use proceeds to do a 2nd or 3rd round. I paid my loan shark back in a week and was self funding. I hired my babysitters children to replicate system two months later in their building. I fired them two months later when they pressed for a third of the total profits instead of half their supplies take. They misunderstood the difference between an employee and owner and that all employees are expendable. Without my capital they couldn't start a competitive enterprise. I would often play with my new toys in front of them while being babysat after school. By 12 I was tagging along with my mother to her job to make photocopies of comic book scenes and role playing games to resell in the school lunch room. I started doing commissioned projects, hiring artists, matching customer requests. 50 cents regular sized, $1 11x17. Color ran $2. 50% cut to artist. Role playing games , I bought module for $6, sold for $3, completing oblivious to copyright. At 13 I started an amateur national comic book business by writing to letter writers from the back of comic books and the membership list of rpg gaming associations. Annual membership fee was $25. Ran that for five years, my mother gave me a tax id number for my 14th birthday. I fired my best friend who was the VP for not pulling his weight. Formally with students first we combined two Monopoly games and altered some rules then I got my boss to buy Cashflow 101 and 202 and the electronic version for the computer labs. Then I got Chase to come in and give the young men free checking accounts. Then I got a millionaire who prepped taxes to come in and teach about that and stock investing. Then I got them slowly registered in a home buying class/program sponsored by a nonprofit. I handed out a packet on money, Roth iras, interest, etc to demystify their questions. I'd personally educated---tax preparer like my mother had done part time, financial planning classes, stock investing. My personal and the professional teaching allowed me to create a line of work, effort and entreneurship that aided me in trying out more and more ventures as the years have gone on. My initial idea before newspapers had been slushies but I couldn't get a stand toward. Ironically years later my students wanted to raise money for their program at a beach party and we did fruit lemonade and made a few hundred dollars, teaching them they could implement Rich Dad thinking. What my parents gave me was a thought of a different context of looking at the world and work. I've never felt stuck at a job because they've all been choice and I have always had a side business bringing in money. Work a job to learn (their systems), not earn. Work smarter, not harder. Teach children those two ideas as contextual disrupters and how to be entrepreneurs even as employees and they'll do great. Teach them to get good grades and a job and eventually they'll be frustrated. ",

            "answer_text": "What my parents did (which worked really well) is that they would give us some money for doing work like washing cars or chores. (chores was 25 cents per year we had been alive and washing cars was about $10 to wash the outside and clean the inside). Then they let us deposit it into what they called \u201cThe Bank of Daddy\u201d which was pretty much just a spreadsheet on my dad\u2019s computer. They also would pay us 2% interest on any money we had in that bank. This let us see that money grows exponentially and has made it so that me, and all of my siblings, are careful with our money and have savings accounts. As we got older they taught us about credit card debt and said there were only two reasons you should go into debt: shelter and education. They also started showing us their finances and how their money grew from when they were in grad school. In addition to that, they said that if we could earn a certain amount of money, they would put that amount in a retirement account for us. Now, that means that 2/3 of my siblings (I\u2019m the oldest and I\u2019m only 18) have the beginnings of retirement accounts that we add to monthly. They also made us pay for a lot ourselves. We had to buy our own phones and pay for anything they didn\u2019t think was essential, and we had a yearly budget for clothes. This made it so that we looked at quality versus price and didn\u2019t pay attention to brands (we all have android phones now) and taught us how to budget money while not being life-or-death. They have their flaws but as far as teaching us about money goes, I think they did really well and I\u2019m in a good position knowledge-wise to go into the adult world. ",
