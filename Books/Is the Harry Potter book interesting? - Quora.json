            "answer_text": "Bloody hell!! It is so freaking interesting and amazing! So much so that you'll stick to it till the end. You'll feel an uncanny remorse when you finish reading the final book . That's how much you'll miss that series\u2026.. It's the best ever. Honestly speaking, I don't think the book suits a particular age group; it can be enjoyed by anyone reading irrespective of the age. It's a magical fiction! JK Rowling cast her spell through those books and the whole world was enchanted and still is! You'll be totally engrossed in the book, like completely into the book. It might be a fiction but it revolves around real life emotions. The protagonist makes it a point to destroy evil and he does that with the love, sacrifice and support of his beloved ones. There's fall, rise, wound, heal, defeat, victory, hatred, love, sadness, joy, war and peace. There are crazy plot twists, something that you'll not be prepared for. (Okay, I should literally stop myself now before I give out any spoilers :-p) So assuming you're planning to read the legendary books, get ready for a magical journey into the world of witchcraft and wizardry!!! Always Gracias :) ",

Initially JKR was rejected by many publishers. A company called Bloomsbury, was her last hope. Bloomsbury, the off-beat company named after the 1920s London literary set, was just about the last chance for Rowling to get the original Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone into print. Her agent, Christopher Little, called at Bloomsbury Publishing's cramped offices in Soho Square and gave Newton a sample to read. He took it home but, instead of settling down with it himself, handed it to Alice, then eight years old. \"She came down from her room an hour later glowing,\" Newton recalls, \"saying, 'Dad, this is so much better than anything else.' She nagged and nagged me in the following months, wanting to see what came next.\" Newton made out a cheque to Joanne Kathleen Rowling for just \u00a32,500, which has since proved one of the wisest investments in publishing history.
