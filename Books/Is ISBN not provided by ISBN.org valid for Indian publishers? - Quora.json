            "answer_text": "ISBN dot org is owned by Bowker, who are the commercial entity providing ISBNs particularly for north american market. In India, ISBNs can be obtained for free, a ISBN obtained in any country is valid all over the world. If a publisher or self published author are from India, they should visit the Raja Rammohun Roy National Agency for ISBN, Department of Higher Education, MHRD, Government of India site to get an ISBN. But the website is very cumbersome to use, so I would recommend watching this video on How to get ISBN in India. (Note: I made this video and the link leads to my blog, but I have spent enough time to figure out what is wrong with the online ISBN application process in India, and it can save you hours of frustration.)
