            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. How do I buy an eBook copyright from a publisher? That can be tricky. It may not be the publisher\u2019s to sell. The publisher may only have permission to have published the eBook, while the writer retained the copyright. You will have to look into the individual book and find out who owns the copyright and contact them to find out what rights they have already sold/given away, and then see if they are interested in selling the copyright. Most people/entities who own a copyright are not interested in selling it. They are much more interested in selling publication/distribution/marketing rights. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s probable that you don\u2019t want the copyright, but a subsidiary right \u2014 for example, you might want to buy the print publication rights for a particular region, or the translation rights for a particular language. To do that, you contact the publisher\u2019s subsidiary rights department, and ask if the right you want is available, and how much it would cost. They will have questions for you, and there will be some negotiations, and then you sign the contract and pay them the advance against future royalties, and off you go. ",
