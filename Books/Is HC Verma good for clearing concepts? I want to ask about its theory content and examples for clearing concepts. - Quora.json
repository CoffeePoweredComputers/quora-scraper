The difference between NCERT and HC VERMA is the words used in NCERT is way to complex than in HC VERMA and also the unnecessary information provided in NCERT makes it boring. Coming to level of difficulty of problems it obviously not needed for neet but I personally recommend it for JEE and AIIMS. ",
