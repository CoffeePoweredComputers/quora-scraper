            "answer_text": "Figure out what her sense of humor is and play off of it. That's crucial. That way you can avoid sending her things that she doesn't think are funny. For example, my friends and I always quote the show SpongeBob SquarePants. We all think it's funny, so we'll send messages or memes related to it. I, however, don't think prank videos are funny, so my friends don't send me prank videos. I think some of those videos are really mean, and I hate when people are unkind. The easiest thing to do is figure out what her favorite TV show, books, and movies are. If she likes The Office, for example, send her pictures of quotes from The Office that are relevant to what you're talking about. So, I say go for it. Just do your best to figure out what she, knowing what you do about her personality, would think is funny.  But if it doesn't work and she doesn't answer\u2026  ",

For example, \u201cHere I am on my lunch break trying to eat fish and chips in the park enjoying the beautiful day and then all of a sudden ten seagulls kamikaze into lunch and I had to duck and dive across the park,eventually abandoning \u201ctheir lunch\u201d over my shoulder so they would leave me alone. So its seagulls 10, me \u201c zilch\u201d and still hungry.\u201d OK,so its a little long winded but you get my drift, play with it a little. ",
