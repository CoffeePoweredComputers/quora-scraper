The cells in your body do that and are alive, but would they be a lifeform on their own? I would say not. While it is true that many single celled life forms, especially plants, do little more than that, they still have to do more to be alive as 'an individual'. There have been artificial cells created to do specific things, some could be described as doing what your saying, but they don't qualify as alive. ",
