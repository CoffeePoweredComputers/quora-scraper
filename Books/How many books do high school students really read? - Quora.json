            "answer_text": "It depends on what you\u2019re asking. Are you asking how many books are high school students required to read, how many books do high schoolers read during their free time, or how many books high schoolers actually read despite their requirement to read a certain number of selected books? There is no correct answer. Does the student read actively for fun or does the student not care at all? If the student actively reads, they may read over 100 books over their high school career. If a student never reads, despite being instructed to, they may not read a single book during their entire high school career. During my senior year, I was required to read 6 books in AP English Language. These books included many classics, such as Wuthering Heights and The Great Gatsby. I\u2019m not going to lie, I did not read Wuthering Heights. I was short on time as it was in November and college applications were due soon. Still, it did not affect my grade much. In that same time frame, however, I was still reading other books. But these books are seen as pleasure rather than a responsibility. There were several books in high school that I could not stand, and did not finish reading them as a result. If a student only read the required texts, I would expect them to read about 25\u201330 books over their high school career. If they just didn\u2019t care to read, 0. If they read actively, 30+. ",
