            "answer_text": "Is Staten Island actually an island? (I didn't know if it was like Long Island. Yes, Staten Island actually is an island. So is Long Island. Asking whether Staten Island is \u201clike\u201d Long Island would be a more interesting question. Long Island (1401 square miles) is much larger than Staten Island (59 square miles). Long Island also has a much larger population, 7.9 million to a bit less than 500,000 for Staten Island. Staten Island, in its entirety, is one of the five \u201cboroughs\u201d of New York City. Staten Island is also called the Borough of Staten Island or Richmond County. Before 1975 it was called the Borough of Richmond. Staten Island has by far the lowest population of the five boroughs \u2014 the only borough with a population less than 1.4 million. It also has the lowest population density of the five. Parts of Staten Island are heavily forested parks. Long island includes two boroughs of New York City (Brooklyn and Queens) as well as a great deal of land east of those two boroughs. Brooklyn (Kings County) has about 2.6 million people, while Queens (Queens County) has about 2.3 million. ",

            "answer_text": "In 1623, English poet John Donne wrote, \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d He clearly had not been keeping up with the news, since almost exactly 100 years previously, Italian explorer Giovanni Verrazano discovered Staten Island when exploring New York harbor. About 100 years after that \u2014 but still before Donne wrote his famous line \u2014 English explorer Henry Hudson sailed it and confirmed that Staten Island is, indeed, an island.  Actually, if you look really closely, you can see my home. It\u2019s in the upper right corner, near that big green area, just south of the \u201c27.\u201d That thin strip of water that defines Staten Island\u2019s western edge and separates it from New Jersey is the Arthur Kill. It\u2019s a lot larger than it looks on this map, and it\u2019s a heavily-trafficked ship channel, large enough that ocean-going vessels can sail through it.  But it wasn\u2019t named after a guy named Arthur. Like a lot of places and things in New York, the name is an Anglicization of the Dutch phrase, \u201cachter kill.\u201d And the channel that runs along the top of Staten Island is the Kill van Kull. There are many \u201ckills\u201d in the New York area, including the Catskill Mountain (whose name has nothing to do with small felines going after mice); cities named Fresh Kills (the site of New York City\u2019s major garbage dump, and, believe me, the atmosphere there is the exact opposite of \u201cfresh\u201d), Fishkill (the site of a massive prison complex and hospital for the criminally insane, Peekskill, and Wallkill; and, a bit further south, the Schuylkill River, a major river that runs through Philadelphia. While the Dutch settlers at the time were a rather violent people, the Dutch word \u201ckill\u201d has nothing to do with murder. It simply means \u201cstream\u201d or \u201ccreek.\u201d ",
