            "answer_text": "No\u2026There is separate books by NCERT on physical, organic or inorganic chemistry. There is only one book each class 11 and 12. Though, they are in two volumes for both classes. If you looking for separate book each for above mentioned three disciplines then you may have to look for different publication and I\u2019m not sure about that if it is available in market for senior secondary level.
