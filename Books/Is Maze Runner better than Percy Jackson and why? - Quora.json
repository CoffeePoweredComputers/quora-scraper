            "answer_text": "Maze Runner and Percy Jackson are two completely different stories. One thing which is common to the two series is that they portray young adult\u2019s as the main characters. Maze Runner concentrates on the how a 16 year old boy, after waking up inside an underground service elevator, in the course of the series finds out that the human race is at the brink of an extinction and he is one of the few boys who might be a solution. It is dystopian science fiction. Percy Jackson is about, as the name clearly states, Percy, who finds out that he is the son of an ancient Greek God (Poseidon), and the various encounters he goes through to save himself and the world from mythical beings. In my opinion, The Percy Jackson series is far better than The Maze Runner. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer differs from person to person. Both series are equally good. Both of them are well thought and perfectly executed. However both stories have a very different concept. Percy Jackson is based on a modern twist to Greek mythology whereas Maze Runner is purely science fiction. So yeah. If I were you I won't compare them ",
