            "answer_text": "Maybe? She certainly doubles down on her transphobic views, despite public outcry, and she also expects us to take The Cursed Child as canon as if we have never read the original series. BUT, she\u2019s mostly just misguided and desperate to pander\u2026. and it is cringeworthy to watch her do it. She\u2019s randomly inserting black and gay and Jewish characters where we know they simply weren\u2019t any (except Dumbledore. He was clearly gay). I would prefer she write new stories with a more diverse cast rather than retroactively change things. She has also COMPLETELY lost control of her own canon and simply makes things up as she goes along instead of thinking about what she has already written. But is JKR arrogant? Only MAYBE. ",

She has received many accolades from all over the world, and she continues to write rather than sitting back and doing nothing. I have read that she can be very gracious with her fans and is a great philanthropist. Is there something in specific you want to know? ",
