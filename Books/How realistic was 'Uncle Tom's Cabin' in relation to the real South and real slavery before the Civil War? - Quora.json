            "answer_text": " Abolitionists believed the terrible stories they heard were typical. \u201cKind masters and mistresses among you are merely lucky accidents,\u201d wrote Lydia Maria Frances Child from her Massachusetts home to Mrs. M.J.C. Mason, a Southerner. As substitutes for witnessing slavery in action, abolitionists studied and made commentary upon the statutes and case law of the slave states, which they could obtain in Northern law libraries, together with newspaper clippings about runaway slaves. In 1853, for example, Rev. William Goodell, who in 1860 would run for president on the Liberty Party ticket, wrote The American Slave Code in Theory and Practice: Its Distinctive Features Shown by Its Statutes, Judicial Decisions, and Illustrative Facts.  American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses, compiled and written by Theodore Weld and the Grimk\u00e9 sisters, was published in 1839 by the American Anti-Slavery Association. A collection of horror stories documenting an absolute condemnation of slavery, with little verifiable \u201ctestimony,\u201d American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses sold 100,000 copies in its first year and continued to sell thereafter. American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses was a persuasive text in the sense of propaganda, the antebellum National Inquirer in book form. In accusing \u2013 and some would say libeling \u2013 slaveholders, it captured the essence of the abolitionist\u2019s own bias: \u201cWe repeat it -- when men speak of the treatment of others as being either good or bad, their declarations are not generally to be taken as testimony to matters of fact, so much as expressions of their own feelings towards those persons or classes who are the subjects of such treatment.\u201d This seminal anti-slavery treatise was an accumulation of the cruelest incidents to convince the reader that slaves were regularly tortured, shot, starved, abused, overworked and treated worse than cattle, was prefaced by a solicitation for more letters and information about slave treatment, and contained no anecdotes about any decent slaveholders or well-treated slaves. Harriet Beecher Stowe met escaped slaves in Cincinnati, her home across the Ohio River from slave territory, and slept with a copy of American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses under her pillow, but spent no time investigating actual conditions on Southern plantations. She saw one slave auction in Kentucky. Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was an 1852 novel based on hearsay from a select and biased group of slaves, slaveholders and observers, including those referenced in American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses. Publishers took note when Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin sold 300,000 copies its first year and then more copies than any novel of the nineteenth century. Modern African-Americans criticize Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin for its racist stereotypes. Southerners criticize it because it was not in any way representative of slavery. The hot topics of slavery, race, sex, money, power, politics and violence in Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, as in most slave-related publications, proved their mass appeal. The war of words was then fought on the fiction front, as Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin spawned numerous anti-Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin novels and copycats. The precedent was set for seeing the slavery issue from the Northern abolitionist perspective and in a literary and fictional \u2013 as opposed to historical or scientific \u2013 light. Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin \u201centered like an alcoholic distillation into the veins and blood of very many people in the free States.\u201d Queen Victoria may have wept when reading it. Abraham Lincoln is said to have once greeted Harriet Beecher Stowe with, \u201cSo you are the little lady who wrote the book that created this great war.\u201d The epithet \u201cUncle Tom\u201d is still used to refer to African-Americans who appear too deferential to whites. During the 2008 Democratic National Convention, an Obama delegate called a Clinton delegate by this name and provoked a heated controversy. The title of the famous book is now a racial slur.  Abolitionists did not have nearly as much contact with blacks as did Southern planters, and were therefore more susceptible to belief in erroneous racial stereotypes. Their intellectual backgrounds and typically higher social classes deprived white abolitionists of an accurate view of manual labor and slave behavior. The abolitionists were not generally businesspeople, and did not appreciate wise management practices or commercial success. Their horror stories in many or most instances contradicted the financial motives of planters. Abolitionists gave slaveholders no credit for the tough work of successfully controlling crime without incarceration, fines or transportation to another continent. The swell of Northern opinion did not appreciate the horrendous transition Southerners of both races would make after 1865. Framed as idealistic imperatives, disapproval of slavery omitted any realistic plans for the freed slaves.  Financial failures like John Brown and Hinton Helper, and those from the middle or lower classes, had more than a tinge of class resentment arising from the great wealth of the planters, and probably sexual envy when contemplating access to female slaves. \u201c[W]ickedness at home fails to exert the enchantment which belongs to other men\u2019s sins.\u201d Resolute abolitionist Rev. William Goodell, who found moral fault with Northern institutions and advocated equality for free blacks before it was popular, was rabid: \u201cThe spoiled sons of effeminacy, lawlessness and sloth, the heroes of the whip and the bowie-knife, are not merchants. The traffickers in women and babes excel not in lawful commerce.\u201d Abolitionists seethed with envy of wealth, inheritance, access to women, leisure time, lifestyle, political power and status. Rev. William Goodell, who grew up poor, said to \u201clook at the wealth earned by the slave; then look at the slave, half famished, half naked, without a bed, shivering, sleeping on the bare ground with an old blanket around him, or turned off, perhaps, in decrepit old age . . . to beg in the streets . . .\u201d The righteous indignation of the abolitionists was pure of everything except material, political and sexual envy.  Southern abolitionists, men such as James A. Thome, a Kentuckian and son of a slaveholder, who spoke at the famous Lane Seminary Debates in 1834, did not remain in the South. Mr. Thome\u2019s abolitionist speech said that slavery was more benign in his home state of Kentucky: \u201cIt is well known that in Kentucky, slavery wears its mildest features. Kentucky slaveholders are generally ignorant of the cruelties which are practiced further South, and on this score are little aware of the bearings of the system.\u201d The Southern press was accused by Mr. Thome of covering up the cruelties further south, a part of the South we have no evidence Mr. Thome ever visited prior to his speech. A common theme in discussions of slavery was that cruelties were usually worse elsewhere. Most slaves thought their own masters were better than other masters were, and that slavery practices in other locations was crueler than the slavery in their own region. The Grimk\u00e9 sisters, Sarah and Angelina, were from a wealthy and prominent South Carolina family known for high-minded and scholarly activities. At the age of five, Sarah Grimk\u00e9 saw a slave whipped and immediately sought to leave her home for a region that did not have slavery. Sarah Grimk\u00e9 tried to teach her family\u2019s slaves to read the Bible. Her parents prohibited this, and her academic interests were limited because of her gender. She left her native South Carolina for Philadelphia, left the Episcopal Church to become a Quaker, and got her sister Angelina to join her. They became prominent abolitionists and feminists in the North. The Grimk\u00e9 sisters were among the noblest and most authentic of the abolitionists and feminists, and were among the first women to address large audiences. Unlike other abolitionists, they knew first-hand about slavery, but not as slaveholding adults. Sarah Grimk\u00e9 never married nor had children. Most of the white abolitionists had fewer children than the slaves they sought to free, indicating abolitionists minimized the procreational advantages of bondage. Angelina Grimk\u00e9 married abolitionist Theodore Dwight Weld, and wrote Appeal to Christian Women of the South in 1836, which contains a good exposition of the biblical antislavery view. Southerners did not appreciate abolitionists such as L. Maria Child, who wrote the Governor of Virginia. \u201cI and thousands of others feel a natural impulse of sympathy for the brave and suffering man\u201d: John Brown. According to Southern women, John Brown was a \u201choary-headed murderer\u201d sent to \u201ccut our throats in Christ\u2019s name.\u201d Southerners perceived abolitionists as living \u201cin nice New England homes . . . shut up in libraries, writing books which ease their hearts of their bitterness to us.\u201d Abolitionists acted \u201cwith a zeal above knowledge.\u201d  A number of the white abolitionists were racists, including Dr. William Ellery Channing, 1835 author of Slavery. Dr. Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia, co-founder of the first anti-slavery society in America, thought blacks had a disease, a mild form of leprosy, curable only by becoming white. Abolitionist Hinton Rowan Helper was an avowed racist, later became unstable, and ended up committing suicide, but he was famous for his publication of The Impending Crisis of the South, a work adopted as campaign literature by the Republican Party shortly before the War. Abolitionists and Northern racists shared a common trait, namely ignorance of ordinary plantation life. The most eloquent white abolitionist, actress Fanny Kemble, only spent four months on her husband\u2019s plantations. Selections from: Prison & Slavery - A Surprising Comparison. ",

            "answer_text": "Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin as history: In January 1868, The Nation published an article by John W. De Forest entitled \"The Great American Novel,\" which began the never-ending quest of nearly every American fiction writer to follow. After dismissing the idea that a great American epic poem could be written before the country had \"agonized and conquered through centuries,\" De Forest opened the door for the possibility of a Great American Novel, \"the picture of the ordinary emotions and manners of American existence.\" Most early American writers (Irving, Cooper, Hawthorne), according to De Forest, were \"ghosts, and they wrote about ghosts, and the ghosts have vanished utterly.\" The key, he believed, was in creating realistic images of distinctly American characters and events, something he had yet to see. Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin was \u201cthe closest thus far.\u201d The book, De Forest writes, has \"a national breadth ... truthful outlining of character, natural speaking, and plenty of strong feeling.\" On the other hand an outspoken Southern woman listed a number of pro-abolitionists among the day's popular writers and politicians in the following diatribe: \"On one side Mrs. Stowe, Greeley, Thoreau, Emerson, Sumner, in nice New England Homes\u2014clean, clear, sweet-smelling\u2014shut up in libraries, writing books which ease their hearts of their bitterness to us, or editing newspapers\u2014all of which pays better than anything else in the world.\" The same woman called anti-slavery \"the cheapest philanthropy trade in the world\" and castigated the abolitionists for \"setting John Brown to come down here and cut our throats in Christ's name.\" The South considered Mrs. Stowe's work a slander and regarded it as abolitionist propaganda. A Southern woman, familiar with slavery and slaves, wrote that she could not read a book so filled with distortions as it was \"too sickening\" to think that any man would send \"his little son to beat a human being tied to a tree.\" The same woman goes on to suggest, using other literary references, that Mrs. Stowe's work portrays as much fiction as Squeers beating Smike in Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby or the gouging of Gloucester's eyes in Shakespeare's King Lear. \"How delightfully pharisaic a feeling it must be, to rise up superior and fancy [to] we [who] are so degraded as to defend and like to live with such degraded creatures around us . . . as Legree.\" Nonetheless, amicably disposed Northerners found the passages describing the murderous brutality of Simon Legree indicative of the typical behavior of Southern slaveowners. The significance of the story, as of many of the attacks on the institution of slavery, lay in its ability to dramatize and emotionalize the issue. Writing and speech making on the subject of slavery in particular\u2014and of the Southern culture in general\u2014were becoming increasingly stereotypical, and the stereotypes, even when presented in novels, were taking on a reality in the minds of the people.  Harriet Beecher Stowe photographed shortly after the release of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Author and humorist Samuel Clements (Mark Twain) once listed the novel as one of the causes of the Civil War. He was not far wrong. The works of Scott, Austen, Cooper, and Dickens were steady sellers, but not best sellers in the modern sense like Mitchell\u2019s one off wonder, Gone With the Wind, General Wallace\u2019s durable Ben Hur, or Stowe\u2019s historically significant Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. Each of the latter group has been said in their day to out-sell all others save the Bible. (A questionable statistic). Persons of the middle and upper class have long been recognized as the chief consumers of the novel in the Antebellum Period, but members of the lower classes were also widely exposed to themes and characters from popular works. So great was the popularity of the novel as a genre that it drew criticism. In sharp contrast to librarians today, who generally rail against any form of censorship, library associations in the 19th century commonly regarded censorship as an obligation. As late as 1856 the Code of Public Instruction for the State of New York recognized the \"necessity\" of excluding from all libraries \"novels, romances and other fictitious creations of the imagination, including a large proportion of the lighter literature of the day.\" The code also expressed an \"obvious\" disgust for works dealing with \"pirates, banditti and desperadoes of every description.\" Unfortunately, for those who wished to ban the novel as a literary form, these were the very characteristics that made novels popular. Notwithstanding warnings to the contrary, the potency of this form of literature to govern the mind of readers proved to have not been underestimated by its would-be censors. Fictional characters possessed a remarkable ability to influence 19th-century readers. Uncle Tom, Topsy, Ivanhoe, Hawkeye, Hester Prynne, Oliver Twist, and Ebenezer Scrooge were deeply familiar characters to a society that read as much as 19th-century Americans did. These characters often seemed to become nearly as real and as influential to the reader as actual friends and relations. Among the messages to be found in the literature of the day was a call to undertake the cause of reform and to establish a more just social order. Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was first released in America and Britain as a newspaper serialization like many other works of the period. When Harriet Beecher Stowe published Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1852, the book sold 300,000 copies in America and Britain in one year. Stowe's work was one of total fiction; it stressed the evils of slavery and presented a picture of total brutality. Stowe had no personal knowledge of slavery, but one does not need to experience evil to describe it. The factual basis for the story was Theodore D. Weld's radical abolitionist tract entitled Slavery as It Is: The Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses, which was published in 1839. Uncle Tom's Cabin was immensely more effective in preaching the antislavery message in the form of a novel than the earlier tract had ever dreamed of being. Writing and speech making on the subject of slavery in particular\u2014and of the Southern culture in general\u2014were becoming increasingly stereotypical, and the stereotypes, even when presented in novels, were taking on a reality in the minds of the people. Stowe\u2019s sister, Catherine Beecher, famous in her own right as an educator and author of American Woman\u2019s Home, was also steeped in the antislavery issue. In An Essay on Slavery and Abolitionism, With Reference to the Duty of American Females (1837) Catherine Beecher wrote that it was \u201cunwise and inexpedient for ladies of the non-slave-holding States to unite themselves in Abolition Societies \u2026 I do not suppose there is one person in a thousand, at the North, who would dissent from these principles. They would only differ in the use of terms and call this the doctrine of gradual emancipation, while Abolitionists would call it the doctrine of immediate emancipation \u2026 Most persons in the non-slave-holding States have considered the matter of Southern slavery, as one in which they were no more called to interfere, than in the abolition of the press-gang system in England, or the tithe system of Ireland.\u201d See: A Leatherstocking Companion, Novels and Narratives as History (Traditional American History Series) (Volume 13): James M Volo: 9781517282448: Amazon.com: Books  ",
