            "answer_text": "It's as close as we'll ever get.  The main thing they had to cut was the whole pirate comic subplot (Tales of the Black Freighter, which is available on DVD and streaming as a cartoon) and they abridged the flashback scenes with the original Minutemen. In the Watchmen universe, since costumed vigilantes existed in real life, super-hero comics never got popular. Instead, pirate comics did. Moore and Gibbons used Tales of the Black Freighter as juxtaposition to the main plot of the story. It's being read by a kid named Bernie at a newsstand in New York. Bernie never buys an issue. It's hard to explain why it's important to the plot because the movie never uses it. Trust me, if you read the comics, it will make sense. We do meet Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl in the comic, and we do get to see his book about his days with The Minutemen, and we get the scene where The Comedian rapes Silk Spectre, but there are great swatches from Under the Hood excerpted into the comic. Some of my friends didn't read those, and while they are not required to get through the story, they are necessary for a complete understanding of the full plot. The ending of the movie is a point of controversy with some fans. I wrestled with it for several viewings of the movie and finally decided that it was fine. In fact I now prefer it over the comic ending, as the movie deals with Doctor Manhattan's place on earth and gives him a purpose to explore the universe after the events in the film. The comic ending is really nothing more than an homage to The Outer Limits episode The Architects of Fear. In the movie, at the end, Snyder cleverly puts in Sally Jupiter watching The Outer Limits when Dan and Laurie show up at her house. The only thing I don't like; Snyder amped up the abilities of the characters. Moore and Gibbons intent was to show these people as ordinary, not meta humans. Are they trained with superior skills? Yes. Are they able to jump from 50 feet onto concrete without any damage like Comedian did in the riot scene? No. This is nitpicking, but they are not \"superheroes\" in the conventional sense. The only one in the story that qualifies is Jon Osterman aka Doctor Manhattan. ",

            "answer_text": "When Alan Moore wrote his masterpiece, he wrote it so that no one could produce it on celluloid (I know,great people and their great egos).Anyway,some crazy producers decided to do it all the same,and hired Zack Snyder to direct this project. Now,you ask,is the movie as good as the comics?No,its not.But,it is the representation that is closest to what can ever be achieved.Personally,I loved it,and Snyder was my favourite director (now 2nd favourite), for a long time.It is visually compelling,grim,excellently executed,incorporated every aspect of the novel,and felt as close to the heart as the characters we love.Also,Snyder used some great music,rearranging the old legendary songs with some fresher versions of the same. All in all,Snyder doesn't deviate from the book. He takes the book,throws in his own visualisations,and for the time being,hangs up his artistical license for his next.All this,and more,make Watchmen the movie,something you should never miss. ",
