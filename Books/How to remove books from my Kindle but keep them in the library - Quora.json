            "answer_text": "You remove them from your kindle. They will be available in the Amazon cloud which is where your library resides until you download them by tapping on the book you want to read. Only if you choose \u201cdelete from cloud\u201d will a book be completely gone. I would not do that. Keep unread books in your cloud/library to be read later. ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest I never download books because they take up to much storage depending on the tablet. I prefer paperback books and hardcover books because they give you more than a ebook. If you are looking for a cheap book, ( I would suggest 2nd & Charles in Atlanta Georgia) if you visit the state they have a selection of books and movies. I found some books for a dollar. So the question I have for you, do you want to spend money on ebooks when they take up storage space or do you want a good paperback or hardcover book to let your mind wander away? ",
