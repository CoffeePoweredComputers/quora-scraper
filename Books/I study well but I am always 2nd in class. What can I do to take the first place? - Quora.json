I have given your answer at level of class which is limited upto 60\u201370 students.Ranking is matter only in taking admissions in good university otherwise you ranked 1st or 2nd in standard upto 11th is doesn\u2019t matter.If you work with your heart and put your soul in your work then you definately can achieve your goal, ",

            "answer_text": "Great that you askes this question. First of all let me tell you one thing which should be kept in your mind . Don't compete, it's really unnecessary to compete in class. Marks do mean a lot but being class 1st or 2nd doesn't mean anything to anyone. It's not a great achievement. What's a real achievement is getting into a well reputed company or university . The only advice I can provide to you is to study hard and smart. There are various option to study,choose anyone of then which enables you to understand the topics better. Don't by heart material as they can be easily forgotten. Instead understand the concept and study the important lines or words that can be used in your wrting. Write answers in clear yet distinctive tone. Improve your answering writing skill. Try to explain thing with little words. Because the people you corrects your answer sheet need not have the time to read the entire thing you have writen. ",
