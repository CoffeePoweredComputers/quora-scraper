            "answer_text": "Back in the 7th or 8th grade, we had to write one page book reports, maybe just on index cards. A bunch of slacker boys decided to make up the books, instead of actually reading them, and settled on the name \u201cSidney Charles\u201d as the author. They figured that if they used the same author, then the teacher would believe them. I don\u2019t think they ever got caught. So if somebody cites a paper by \u201cSidney Charles\u201d and it is not available? It would seem pretty sketchy to me. \u201cHey, wait a minute, weren\u2019t you a slacker at the Atkinson School?\u201d Or more seriously, the person looking for the paper may not have the strongest digital research skills, and might want to ask the university librarian for some assistance. Unless of course, this is archival material, and in that case, it would be cited differently than a scholarly paper. ",
