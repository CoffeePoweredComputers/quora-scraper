Jim Lee\u2019s Art almost defines DC. It\u2019s a great story and Batman will always be the number one DC Character and Family. I\u2019d give this to literally anyone as first read. And then I would use what they liked / disliked as a guide to what to give them more of. ",

            "answer_text": "You should start from Rebirth to ease your way into DC, pick a character yo are interested in and research their first Rebirth issue. After you have some knowledge over different characters you can hit up Comic Book Herald and look up Reading Orders for characters you liked to immerse yourself more into their and DC\u2019s lore. Some of my personal favorites: SandmanLuciferHellblazerSuperman: Earth OneBatman: Earth OneFlash: BlitzFlash: Rogue\u2019s RevengeFlash: Fastest Man Alive",
