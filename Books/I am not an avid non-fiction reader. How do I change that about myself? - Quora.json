As my work week would go on and I would get further into the book, things would start coming out in my communication and attitude where I was asking myself, \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d I started to look forward to those moments more and more. Second, try reading non fiction slowly over a long period of time, even just two pages at a time. I now always have a non fiction book in the bathroom with me, for example. It\u2019s just enough time to \u201cpush thru\u201d a few pages (sorry for the pun but it was there). ",

There will be books that you could read to at least get started on your journey into non-fiction. Once you get started, you\u2019ll most likely find even more areas that arouse interest. Happy hunting! ",
