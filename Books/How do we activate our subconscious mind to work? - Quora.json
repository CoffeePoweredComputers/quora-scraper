            "answer_text": "There are many parts of the mind we are not conscious or aware of. These parts of the mind are working all the time. You can not \u201cactivate\u201d the subconscious if, by that, you mean become aware of it working. Once you are aware of it, it is no longer subconscious. The subconscious can only be subconscious as long as your are unaware of its workings. So you don\u2019t have to do anything to activate your subconscious mind. It\u2019s already active and doing its job \u2014 or jobs, since there are actually many different brain functions that happen without conscious awareness. We are not consciously aware of our brains managing many functions, including automatic responses to triggering events (habits)feelings and emotions (they seem to appear without thought)perceptions (use of our senses)preprocessing of perceptions (our senses only scan the environment for data; a part of the subconscious puts those data points together to make it appear to the conscious brain as if we have a full picture of what is around us)autonomic functions (heart beating and breathing; blood pressure).These are all functions I believe must be there. I\u2019m not a neuroscientist. Just an observer of myself. I infer their existence, but I am not conscious of those things happening, and I believe it is not possible to become conscious of most of these processes. However, perhaps you are asking about something else. Perhaps you are asking whether it is possible to become conscious of the subconscious workings of your mind. If that is what you are asking, then the answer is meditation. In order to become aware of subconscious thinking, you have to quiet the conscious brain enough that you can begin to observe the rest of the brain. The conscious brain is generally very noisy, what with all its thinking. All those thoughts obscure awareness of things like the appearance of emotions/feelings, awareness of heartbeat or breath, habits, or attention to whether perceptions are real or imagined. To become aware of these things, you have to still your conscious thinking and wait patiently to notice the other things happening in your awareness. This is difficult work and it takes lots and lots of practice. Meditation is one of the more traditional ways to accomplish this awareness, but there are many other ways it can be done. For example, engaging in exercise, creative work, or any other activity that involves a strong measure of focus will help us become aware of the normally subconscious thinking that happens in our minds. To reiterate, your subconscious is always active \u2014 even when you are asleep. You just aren\u2019t aware of it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the subconscious. Its activity occurs below or outside your conscious awareness. You can\u2019t activate your subconscious because it is always active. However, if you want to become a little bit more aware of what the subconscious parts of your mind are doing, meditation will help with that. ",
