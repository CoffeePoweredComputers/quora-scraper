            "answer_text": "I\u2019m trying to come to terms with my autism diagnosis and I am really starting to hate neurotypical people. What can I do? The first thing that springs to mind is this: you are the same person you were before you got your diagnosis, but now you know a bit more about yourself and perhaps you can understand yourself better. If that is the case you have the chance to judge yourself less harshly?  I don\u2019t know whether or not that can help you. I hope so. As for hating neurotypical people I suggest you ask yourself whether you are starting to hate them or if you are angry, jealous, unhappy or something else entirely. You could also ask yourself if it is all neurotypical people or only a few? If it is only a few particular people you could ask yourself why them and not everyone else? The reason for asking yourself these questions is because it might help you get a handle on what\u2019s going on and what you can or should do about it. Remember, nobody can blame you for how you feel. Your feelings are yours. You are responsible for your actions, but you can\u2019t help how you feel, and don\u2019t need to feel guilty about it. Your diagnosis doesn\u2019t change who you are, you are the same person with a bit more knowledge to help you navigate your life. That doesn\u2019t mean everything becomes easy all of a sudden, it doesn\u2019t. You still have the problems that sent you to the doctor in the first place. In other words go a bit easy on yourself.

You shouldn\u2019t hate people that sounds like you are jealous of them because you have autism and they don\u2019t. Just go with the flow. It\u2019s going to be okay, you sound like you can function. My child is autistic and he is having a rough time. Be glad you can communicate and are higher functioning. ",
