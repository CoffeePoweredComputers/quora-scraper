            "answer_text": "The whole intent of the steamy novel was FANTASY. Just google up. None of the rich CEOs out there are actually even close to being in there 20\u2019s unlike Christian Grey who is supposedly a billionaire at the age of 27 . Like all he does is stalk Ana all day or have filthy conversation with his emotional abuser who finds him new prey everyday so he can satisfy his whatever kink or some supposed emotional trauma that makes no sense whatsoever.In real life even if a hot billionaire guy even supposedly approached me (*cries in ugly) asking me to sign whatever contract in exchange for a car or first edition books of an author, any girl would straight up avoid him or report him to the cops. In real life guys with such personalities are danger and big old red flags and it means they have straight up mental health issues . They are in need of a psychologist not a girl they can abuse in the name of kinks .Fifty Shades Of Grey is a book that you can consider reading and appreciating for the fantasy element . Its a book to unwind yourself with and explore the world of sexuality but that\u2019s where the book must end. ",

            "answer_text": "So much no. Take Christian Grey. A self made billionaire at the age of 27. Who somehow has time to play with helicopters and stalk Ana. Er, no. Big business CEOs are always on, with no time to relax. From a BDSM point of view, he's a terrible Dom. Way too much messing about with the contract and not enough attention to consent. Ana, the virgin who never thinks about men? Yeah right. And who has an orgasm while giving her first blow job? ",
