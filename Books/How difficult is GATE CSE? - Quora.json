            "answer_text": "What I believe is that it is less competitive than CAT or even other major engineering branches. But that doesnot mean that it is not difficult. Reasons for this belief are 1. Growth in number of IT jobs. IT sector has grown a lot.There are plenty of jobs in IT. Take example of IT MNCs, they hire students in huge numbers. If you see the stats, the number of students appearing for Gate CS is reducing year by year. Not only that but also the number of students appearing for CS is the lowest when compared to other major branches. 2. Most of the aspirants are not from top colleges. I believe IITians of CS don't sit for the Gate, rare case may be there. There are few from other streams who developed a love for CS or are attracted towards the salary packages offered to CS students. So this the opportunity for that average considered engineer to put that consistent , determined , sincere effort to change his life for good. 3. I believe the exam papers for different branches are equally difficult but the competition is not. I saw on Quora that one guy from Mechanical got 79.31 normalised marks but his rank was 434 in 2017. With this score he would have been among top 10 or 20 in CS. Yeah i know they have a lot more of PSUs than CS thats what causing this competition but here i am just talking about the Exam competition. Check the link for stats Number of Candidates Appeared in GATE 2017 Branch Wise, Yearwise These are just my views, you may or may not agree with them. I am open to change :-) ",

            "answer_text": "hi i am FROM VANI INSTITUTE............................................................................. It would've been better if you had mentioned your stream. That would've fetched you a clearer answer. Anyways, the basic ideas for preparation are all the same:  Good  to know you already have fixed your goal in your third year. Now that  you know what path to take, it's important for you NOT to lose  motivation. Ensure you don't feel bad about preparation for even a  single day. You may have friends who are preparing for CAT, GRE or  sitting for placements. And many of them would try to lure you to get  into the path they preferred. But make sure you stay firm.Check  out the list of recommended books for each subject. There would be more  than one book, in general. Either purchase a second-hand copy of them  (if you can afford). Else, make use of college library. Note that there  will always be few friends of yours who've never used their library  cards. You can take their help to get books once your quota is used up.Get your basics strong - very strong.  You won't be tested on advanced topics that appear in your third and  fourth years, but mainly on those subjects you had studied in second  year. Make use of the Internet. There are plenty of video lectures  available, like MIT-OCW, NPTEL, Coursera etc. However, a word of  caution: Restrict yourself to watch the necessary lectures. Else you may  end up in watching irrelevant ones too.Get rid of Facebook",
