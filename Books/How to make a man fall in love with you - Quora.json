            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know you and I don\u2019t know your husband, so I can only speak in generalities. But things that will generally work for most men: Make yourself pleasant to be around. Talk to him about anything and nothing. Keep the conversation balanced: listen when he talks and at least pretend to be interested in what he has to say, and also keep up your end of the conversation. Give your husband dedicated time when you are doing nothing but spending time with him. Not talking to him while you are doing some hobby, not talking to him during the commercials while you are watching TV, but stop whatever else you\u2019re doing and talk to him.Make yourself pretty for him. Remember, for the most part, beauty is not something you are born with: it is something you do. Get yourself to a good weight, grow your hair long, dress in nice clothes, wear some jewelry and make-up. You no doubt have physical flaws: we all do. Don\u2019t obsess over them. Cover up the negative and emphasize the positive. Men like to look at pretty women, and men especially like to have a pretty wife. A man is proud to have a pretty wife, he feels like he has accomplished something by succeeding at winning such a woman. If you think this is shallow and unimportant and he should care about your intellect and your achievements and not just how you look, get over that now if you want to have a happy marriage. It is vitally important to 90% of men.Be available to him sexually. Enough said.Do recreational things together. If he likes to, whatever, go fishing let\u2019s say, then go fishing with him. Or go to concerts or museums or whatever it is he likes to do for fun. Try to find things that you both like to do and enjoy doing together. But if you can\u2019t find anything you enjoy of itself, try to enjoy it just because you are spending time together. If he agrees to do something that you think is fun but that he doesn\u2019t particularly enjoy, try to make it fun for him. See #2: most men will be happy to go to an event they consider boring with their wives if the wife dresses up pretty for the event, so while she\u2019s watching the ballet or whatever, he can be looking at her and enjoying her.Treat him with respect. He is not your child or your servant: he is your husband. Don\u2019t nag. Never, ever say to yourself, \u201cit\u2019s for his own good\u201d. Many wives make their husbands miserable by nagging them about some bad habit the husband has \u2014 or at least that the wife considers a bad habit \u2014 and they feel no guilt about being rude and annoying because \u201cif he would just LISTEN to me, he would be so much better off\u201d. Don\u2019t. A good wife can make her husband a better person by reminding him that he should take a shower or take his medicine or stop biting his finger nails or whatever. When you do it right and he does it right, he says, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, I should do that\u201d. But if he says \u201cno, I\u2019m not going to do that\u201d, just drop it.Let me add here: The questioner asked how to please her husband, so my answer was advice to a woman on how to please her husband. Before someone says, \u201cWhy is it all her responsibility, huh? Shouldn\u2019t he be trying to make her happy too?\u201d OF COURSE her husband should be trying to make her happy. If a man asked a similar question, I \u2014 or better yet a woman \u2014 could tell him what he should do. But he\u2019s not asking; she is. And if anyone is thinking, \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have to do anything. He should love her just as she is\u201d, that\u2019s absolute nonsense. If a man said, \u201cSure, I like to get drunk and gamble away all our money and patronize prostitutes, and sometimes when I get bored I beat my wife up for kicks. So what? My wife should love me just like I am\u201d, I hope you would agree that that is utter nonsense. For a more serious objection, I see several people have given answers centered on the idea, \u201cyou can\u2019t make someone love you\u201d. Absolutely true. You can\u2019t force someone to love you. And even if you do your absolute best, if you are the most perfect wife that anyone could possibly imagine, it\u2019s possible that your husband is a complete jerk and will not respond. But if you are trying to be a good wife and to make your husband happy, surely he is more likely to show you love than if you are going out of your way to be as unpleasant as possible. You can\u2019t FORCE your husband to love you, but you can ENTICE him to love you. ",

            "answer_text": "There's two type's of guy's in the world. There are the one's who love women for their bodies, and will do just about anything to get with them. Usually these are the athletic guy's who have a lot of superficial male friendships, and who project their insecurities into the world through the manipulation of other people. These guy's are easy to predict, but they usually won't settle for anything less than they think they're worth. Then there's your typical nice guy. Usually drawn more to academics and less muscular. This type of person has no outlet into world. They internalize their insecurities, or find ways later in life to attain influence through monetary gains. This type of guy usually has a lot of emotional baggage, and has learned to mask their feelings. These guy's are more attracted to the pleasures of intimacy outside of the physical domain. However, they also have problems with trusting people, and are generally slow to commit. But once they do, they also tend to be very clingy and needy. I'd say almost all guy's fall somewhere within this spectrum. If you know which type of guy you want to attract, I could think of strategies for both: For the athletic guy's, I'm going to tell you some things I've overheard just to give you an idea of what you're dealing with. Something my friend said, let's call him Brad. I've known Brad since I was 6 years old. We played on the same hockey teams, and he slept with the most girls out of anyone at my high school. Brad one day at the Lunch table. \u201cMan, look at Kelsey today, she's wearing sweatpants and a hoodie. I hate it when the hot girls don't put on makeup or even try and look good\u201d. One of the wrestling guy's I had the pleasure of getting acquainted with in university. \u201cChase only sleeps with ugly chicks. All the girls he brings home are like 3s and 4s\u201d. Chases girlfriend was sweet a person. Now you see, the problem with trying to manipulate these guy's, is that they have a clear objective standard of what they consider to be attractive. What you need to do is find the weak link in the group. The guy who appears on the surface to be a jock, but who really has the emotional sensitivity of the second type of guy mentioned. My friend Mark comes to mind. An engineer now, but one of the best athletes at our school, and also one of the most sensitive guy's I've ever met. Get this type of guy to show interest in you, and all the other guy's will take notice. So then how do you get the more emotional guy's to fall in love with you? It takes a lot more patience. You need to slowly win over their trust by doing them small favors, but more importantly, by getting them to do things for you. The longer you can keep this type of relationship up, the harder it will be for him to let you go. Last thing. There are certain body types and hairstyles almost all guys find attractive. There is nothing you can do here, it's just part of the way we're wired. ",
