If you have an idea, if you have a character - characters, a situation, if you can use a pen, a computer\u2026 begin to write. As others have stated, there are books to explain the structure (although rules are there to be broken if there is a viable reason within the characters\u2019 needs) , grammar, dictonaries of all kinds, the Thesaurus\u2026 books on novel writing\u2026John Gardner - The Art of Writing a Novel - is a classic. But there are so many. There are times however, when a workshop, class (or trusted writer friends) can listen and/or read and comment. However, not all advice or criticism is good, totally focused on your work or what you need at the moment . You must be able to filter it. You must also find this \u201chelp\u201d with a group or a person who is not going to have his or her ego ( or ideas) take over. As I said, this is yours! Often people plan their books\u2026 I could not. The characters drove me to their actions = plot. Lke life, it was unpredictable.. If you are a mystery writer, it is different\u2026 you probably know who the villain is, who the cast of characters is.. to begin with, so writing the last chapt early on is great. Otherwise, for me, as I said, who knows where the characters are going to lead? and always- who, what , when and where. When you write, it is often useful to set up a ritual before you begin\u2026that cup of coffe? Exercise did very well for one book, some people I know use meditation\u2026 but the ritual MUST lead to writing\u2026. nothing intervening. I find this very helpful. Actually I use QUORA to lead me into work lately\u2026. from here (and you) \u2014- right to the lyric I am working on . Somehow, it works. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, Jolene. You\u2019re back. That\u2019s good I like that. You know, I can visualise you already sitting opposite me. This time you have dug up a serious subject. Personally, I think most novels are written without help. When you write something, you are mostly on you own. I also think that especially with novels you want to be alone \u2013 I prefer that. When I write a novel of even just a fictional short story, my imagination does all the work. I just write it down and edit it as I go along because my imagination is not strong on grammar and spelling. That is my department. I so sometimes feel I want to second guess my imagination. It wouldn\u2019t help to discuss it with intelligence as my imagination won\u2019t go for that. To it, everything you can measure with an IQ is nonsense. The more unrealistic my story is the better. Even I enjoy the antics so much that I am sometimes tempted to go along with it. Of course, I realise that I have to sell that story, so I slow it down. I don\u2019t know how many other writers are in the same boat, but I am tempted to say: most of them, which leaves also them in a situation where there is no room for help. I suppose you can juggle some ideas or concepts over a beer or a glass (large) of wine with your friends, but I think that is more or less where it ends. In any case, besides your Mom, nobody gives a hoot whether your imagination gets the belter of you or not. Your readers like it if you win \u2013 if they wanted a story in chaos they could watch tv. So, Jolene, I think the jury, as far as I am concerned is still out on this one. I\u2019d love to hear from you what you think. There is, of course, a vast difference in culture between you and I, as I live in South Africa, which is more or less the furthest away from the other destinations than most other countries. Airfare is a definite factor. It is expensive for us to fly. Then, of course we are also stuck up with dwindling reader public because of the local diaspora. That\u2019s it. Your number is up, Jolene. Time to say g\u2019bye. Thanks very much, it was so nice to chat to you and an incisive introspection of how I feel about this topic. Go well. ",
