            "answer_text": "Religiously. You can see in prelims UPSC is asking one or two sentences directly. They are from constitution itself. But Laxmikant is simplest commentary to unfolding the mystery First reading: Do not mark anything. Just read and don't bother. Then see polity questions of past year both Prelim and Mains. You will know what is important and how much of that is important. You can highlight important part in successive readings. Revision is the key to remember it. After 4 5 readings change your way priority of reading. Rather than reading chapter 1 first, read in this order, Parliament, Panchayati Raj, Administration of Scheduled areas, state legislature. You can skip Sarkariya and Punchhi commission details for Prelim. You can skip last few chapters like foreign policy, commission on working of constitution etc for prelim. Solve past year questions, test series of coaching, questions at the back. Please do not ignore amendments given at the back. I would recommend that you read constitution bare act too. Questions like, Where is the oath of President mentioned in the Constitution can become catchy. It is not in schedules but mentioned in Article 60 of the constitution. Laxmikant can't help you there. I have read 4th edition. Forgive me if my views are not matching with 5th edition. Enjoy the journey. Only 2 questions out of 20 polity questions directly from laxmikant. (#Prelim 2017) UPSC knows what is not there in Laxmikant ! ",
