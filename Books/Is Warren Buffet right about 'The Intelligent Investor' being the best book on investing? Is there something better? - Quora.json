You discover the website you have been reading is running a pump and dump and someone else is just there to look smart and scare people. You will be an investor like no other. I rented a Netflix movie, bought 100 shares and repeated the practice a few times and it became my first 7 bagger. 700% on my first investment. The subsequent has been less but I didn\u2019t look at it as becoming a $300K position when I started. I have had many not work out as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends. If you think of investing as a hobby read everything you can and this is one of the classics. But remember it was written in 1949 and a whole lot of things have changed since then. If you think of investing as a chore and something that you want to do right but not spend a ton of time on just listen to Buffets advice and buy index funds. If I were recommending a single book I\u2019d find one by Jack Bogle. \u201cCommon Sense on Mutual Funds: New Imperatives for the Intelligent Investor\u201d comes to mind. ",
