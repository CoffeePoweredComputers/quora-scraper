I think if you create something great, such as something huge, as a college education, or career for yourself, you should enjoy that and be proud of yourself. On the other hand, if you\u2019ve flourished a dramatic situation, and it grows into a monster, if possible, it might be smart and right to own that as well. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to do, especially because you might hurt someone else while doing so. Making amends for something you\u2019ve created can be difficult, but in the end you will feel better inside. My opinion anyhow. I know it sounds good but saying and doing are completely different.

We can\u2019t just sit there and day dream about it. We got to think and execute it. We wouldn\u2019t want to stay in the puddle and embarrass ourselves more. Think with a cool and calm mind. ",
