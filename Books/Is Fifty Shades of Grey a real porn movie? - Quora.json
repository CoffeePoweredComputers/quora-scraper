            "answer_text": "It might as well be. A script that is below average and extremely porn-like, 50 Shades of Grey is the porn equivalent of the Twilight series [which, funnily enough, seems to be the case\u2014the novel purportedly originated as a fanfiction based on Stephanie Meyers\u2019 series]. The plot, characters, and dialogue could very well have been ripped from a low-budget porno. The book/movie conflates BDSM with abuse. Because it features an emotionally abusive man preying upon an insecure young woman and calls it a relationship. But somehow, emotional unavailability translates into an ineffable sexiness; lack of care turns Christian Grey into some sort of sexual demigod. This is not the basis of BDSM. While power certainly comes into play, as it does in all relationships, BDSM is not about using and abusing power over someone in order to get off. It is not about abusing someone\u2019s trust or someone\u2019s body.

            "answer_text": "No. \"50 Shades of Grey\" is \"R\" rated, and as such, is not 'porn', except in the minds of some obsessive moral prudes. The book provided more abuse to reader due to poor quality of writing... and while I have not seen the movie, I suspect that aspect has not changed for the film viewer. The book seemed to hit a market for women who would otherwise not read about 'offbeat' sexual relationships, and in langauge that would not assault their sensibilities in any significant way. As we all know, women don't like porn, and so writers have to sneak it in under the radar so to speak. ",
