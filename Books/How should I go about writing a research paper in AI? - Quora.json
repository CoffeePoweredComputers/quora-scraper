            "answer_text": "It turns out this question has been asked and answered in various guises here on Quora previously (How can one start writing a research paper on artificial intelligence? What topics and tools should one seek to use?) You might consider taking How to Write and Publish a Scientific Paper (Project-Centered Course) | Coursera as one way to have greater structure for your own development. Since you\u2019ve given a laundry list of things, I\u2019d suggest tackling them in a different order than you have listed: (1) & (3) - you should educate yourself on AI. The book my AI course used Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach can help you get started, certainly. The basic algorithms of AI have evolved over the years, but I was surprised at how little they\u2019d changed over 30 years. Pick classes at the various schools in the AI topics of interest to you - AI, ML, RL, NLP, etc. I\u2019d start with AI and ML because they provide you with a general overview. Then pick classes that build in areas where you have interests. (2) & (4) are going to go hand in hand. Start reading journals in the field. Spend time using http://scholar.google.com to search for topics that are of interest to you. Be prepared to potentially read a lot of papers before you find something that is interesting. (5) Research is pretty standard, regardless of the field. You propose a hypothesis, you describe how you will test your hypothesis and how you will evaluate your test results. It helps if you begin to sketch out your paper up front (which is what you need to do to get to step 6.) In other words, what is the key takeaway from your work? Expect to revise it (over and over again). I\u2019ve always liked this presentation when describing how to write a great paper:  Keep in mind Sturgeon's law. Your goal is to be in the 10% but getting there is hard and often you don\u2019t know if you are, or not. Be prepared to be rejected. Be prepared to revise your paper, modify your experiments, collect your data again. When you are done, you likely end up with something that is different than where you started. (6) Submit to journals, conferences, and/or workshops where your work fits. ",

            "answer_text": "To get started you need the following ingredients: An idea, which is usually made up of method, use case, data set, twist and a target venue. In order to generate an idea I suggest reading up on related work, visit conferences and/or talk to people in the field. Co-authors, you will want a bunch of people working working with you on this. Typically every co-author supplies something: experience in the field, an idea, methodologically experience, time and effort, etc. Try to figure out what you can do and offer it to others. I suggest you start with an idea, but it is actually more of a conversation opener. What you are hoping for is this: You: I have this idea, \u2026 Other person: That is really interesting. My idea is \u2026 You: That sounds cool! Other person: Wanna join? Research is a team sport. So you need to join a team. ",
