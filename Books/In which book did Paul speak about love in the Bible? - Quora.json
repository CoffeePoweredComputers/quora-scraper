            "answer_text": "Paul spoke about love in general in many books I will quote you a few but was there a specific type of love your looking for his teaching on? Some examples is encouraging our love to abound and be filled with the fruits of righteousness, in Galatians 5 Paul talks about love being one of the fruits of the spirit, and in Romans Paul talks about treating each other with brotherly love. Philippians 1:9 \u00b6 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; 10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; 11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. Galatians 5:22 \u00b6 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. Romans 12:9 \u00b6 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. 10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; 11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; 13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

            "answer_text": "I think love is mentioned in every book that the Apostle Paul wrote. Each book authored by Paul was a letter to a different church. But the famous love chapter is 1 Corinthians 13. Parts of this chapter are often quoted in weddings. Maybe that is what you are referring to? ",
