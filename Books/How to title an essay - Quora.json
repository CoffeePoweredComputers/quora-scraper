Not interested with learning to cook? But with a well decided title, even a reader that detests recipe books and how-to cook lessons might be tempted to take a look. \u2018Strange Pantry Sounds\u2019, \u2018Surreal Saucy Scents\u2019, \u2018Bouquet Of Bologna\u2019\u2026 Titles can be one of a kind, original names or words manipulated to mean more than just a same old common thing. With proper illustration to accompany an original word used as a title: the use of relatable images helps explain it [\ud83e\udd68]. \u2018Pretzelilla\u2018, \u2018Smoresville\u2019, \u2018Hungerosity\u2019\u2026 If there\u2019s a catch phrase, an emphasized quote or a key passage within the essay itself: it can be useful to clue in the title. \u2018Every Last Bite\u2019, \u2018It\u2019s A Bachelor\u2019s Breakfast\u2019, \u2018Beer Batter Me Up\u2019\u2026 \u2018Last But Not Least\u2019: a title can be fluffy (nonsensical), a unique abbreviation of popular words or a twist on a phrase, if the essay is intended as humor inspired; the point is to choose something relevant to the tone\u2014ambience, mood expressed within the essay\u2014as well for the topic. \u2018Cannit\u2019, [\u2018Evo Foo\u2019], \u2018Chow\u2019\u2026 [Chewing The Tabbouli: Forget The Fat] ",

            "answer_text": "Having written and had published 200+ articles, here is what I do: In my case, I am rarely assigned a topic, therefore, I have to generate the ideas. Sometimes, an article title will just leapt into my mind and I\u2019ll build the article around that format. A Tale of Two Installers was one such essay that outlined the sad and hilarious mistakes of two technically qualified master mechanics; one who excelled and maintained a great reputation and the other who was constantly in trouble with owners and clients. The most salient point was time management and personality not technique or experience. I gave true examples of how problems were overcome. This was about a four thousand word article. In another instance, I didn\u2019t have a title in mind, so I outlined the article using four major headings and then wrote a rough draft. Still nothing on a title. Agghhhh! After cutting and editing, I was around 2600 words. After writing the introductory paragraph and the final two sentences, I finally had my title: Win Small or Lose Big. This article dealt with how to handle conflict, winning an argument without losing clients and how to give-in on small issues to win big concessions. Of the two approaches, the easier one is to develop a theme for the essay, do the outline, write a rough draft, THEN propose a title. When publishing and/or working with an editor, be prepared for changes in your scope and certainly the title. What I thought was a great title was often a dud from the editor\u2019s perspective, so was changed. Here are some other examples of article titles: Selling Value and Style, The Job I Almost Lost, Building a Marriage with Clients, When YOU Are Not the Low Bidder, Acres of Furniture, When Disaster Strikes, Complaint Diagnosis and Solutions, Hiring the Million Dollar Star. My suggestion is this: Don\u2019t get your ego wrapped up in the title, rather, spend the time to write an appealing essay that is readable and tells a compelling story. ",
