            "answer_text": "Illustration for children\u2019s books is one of the last genres that you can actually let your creative juices flowing without fear of being behind the times, or Kitch, anything goes and in any media that you choose fit. I posses an MA and I have researched child image psychology, and child development psychology. It is scientifically proven that Children respond best to illustration that is naturalistic, and naturally coloured. Rather than exaggerated colour, and other worldly figures. If you research children's illustration you will find a mass of wholly computer generated, stark colours and weird concoctions of unnatural ideas of human beings. Those artists who remain true to fundamental drawing, and naturalistic rendering, are correct. Children deserve quality, too much illustration today is almost taking the Micky, its underestimating children, and to be frank patronising. Quality in general has waned at the expense of digitisation, it all looks the same. Illustrators has tried so hard to be different that they have missed the point. The point is we are trying to help children understand a story, and so it follows that we assist them rather than throw them weird concoctions. Ok, to answer you question children's books are made in many different ways, utilising many different techniques. However, there are industry standards, that everyone should be adhering to. The industry standard format for illustrations and book making is Adobe In Design. You can prepare the whole book with this software, and if you couple it with photoshop you are able to complete the whole book. Yes, fortunately, children's books is one of the few places where traditional techniques are still used and celebrated, used alongside, and supplemented with digital techniques (usually photoshop) they are mostly preferred. If In Design is used to formulate your book, then it is fairly easy to create a format that can be print ready, for either physical print, or for digital platforms like e books. ",
