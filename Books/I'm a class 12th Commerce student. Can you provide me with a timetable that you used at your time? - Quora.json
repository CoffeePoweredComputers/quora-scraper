            "answer_text": "First Work At Defining Your Goal - What is It? Is It to Score the highest or is it to score between 80\u201390 % ? Work Accordingly. Its always Important to focus in one direction. Just like a chariot moves when all horses run in one direction , your focus must also be towards one goal to achieve it completely. A perfect timetable cannot be made as we all have different priorities & commitments but I sure can give you some guidelines. Albert Einstein has said that COMPOUND INTEREST is the 8th Wonder Of the world. Use this principle throughly. It simply means that Working towards your goals everyday in small parts gives greater results as Compared to working towards it for hours for once in a week. ENSURE that you study everyday in every subject for atleast one chapter or set a pattern to study some part of every subject everyday. Also try Exercising even if for 15 Mins .It gives a great result in a long run. TRUST ME. Be an Early Riser. It will be difficult but it'll certainly help you to complete all your work in one day as it gives us more time compared to waking up late. Hope it Helps :) ",
