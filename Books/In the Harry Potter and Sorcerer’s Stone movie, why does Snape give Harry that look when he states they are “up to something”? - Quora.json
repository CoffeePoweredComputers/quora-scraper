            "answer_text": "He is capable of Legilimency, the art of invading people\u2019s minds and interpreting their emotions, subtly. Furthermore, he was in close proximity to the Golden Trio when they were talking about him trying to steal the Sorcerer\u2019s stone, so he wasn\u2019t just guessing, he knew they were up to something. And that \u2018something\u2019 involved him. I think he was hoping to scare them out of going after the Stone (although whoever heard of Gryffindors being scared out of rushing ahead without thinking about the consequences?), so that Quirrell wouldn\u2019t kill them. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve read all the books or seen all the movies, so I won\u2019t reveal too much in case you haven\u2019t, but what I can say is that he had a personal reason why he wanted to keep Harry alive.
