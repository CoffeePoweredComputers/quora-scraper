            "answer_text": "How does the customer reach you? By phone? on the internet via email? On your website? By mail? In person? Once you figure out the medium of interaction with your customers, you can then determine what is the best way you can get feedback from the customers in order to improve service to them. Many companies try to get the customers to answer a few questions at the end of a phone call in order to determine how the company can improve customer experience. Sometimes it works, but most of the time, the customer service reps will urge you to give four or five \u201cstars\u201d for how they took care of your issue. So the business does not really get honest feedback. The second, and probably the most effective but somewhat difficult option is to map out all the processes that affect the customer experience. They range from the order entry, processing, shipping, after-sales service, product/service maintenance, price negotiations, resolution of disputes, etc. Then, go through each process to determine where and how it can be improved to improve customer experience. Many companies have elaborate, but very complicated, time-consuming and bureaucratic processes in place to handle customer requests. They end up making the caller frustrated, mad, upset and angry instead of pacifying them. An example of it is the cable/TV/Internet providers such as AT&T, Spectrum, Frontier, Comcast, etc. Try to call their customer service department and get a better price or adjustment to the bill. In the first place, you have to go through several recorded messages before you can reach a live person, if at all if you ever reach one. Then after you explain the situation, the CSR typically tells you that the issue has to be \u201celevated\u201d to a higher level. After arguing and pleading with the person on the phone, you finally give up and hang up. Even smaller companies have people answering calls from customers who are not authorized or allowed to resolve any issues on the spot. The best way to improve customer experience is to (1) answer the call in less than 3/4 rings, (2) allow/train/authorize the CSR to take care of any issue without handing it over to someone higher up, (3) follow up if possible, with a call to the customer, later on, to see if his/her issue was handled to their satisfaction.

            "answer_text": "Well some detail about what you\u2019re doing now would help, but.. The trite and simple answer is how would you expect to be treated as a customer? Then do that. Be transparent. Make your business easy to do business with. Remove the barriers that stop your customers from reaching out to you. 99/100 most people don\u2019t actually want to talk to a customer service person they just want to find the answer to their question. Make it easy. If you\u2019re delivering things, give people the options to get it the way they want it, when they want it. The reason people use Amazon is not because of the website experience. Their online experience is actually pretty grim. It\u2019s because their fulfillment process is (mostly) high quality. 80% of ecommerce is about your supply chain. Get that right and the rest relies on your brand. Your brand is the only differentiator that you have online. Make sure that you don\u2019t look like everyone else. Copying the John Lewis website means you get \u201cbest practice\u201d but also means that you look like a subsidiary rather than your own brand. Be you. And make sure that you don\u2019t sound like everyone else. Lots of brands are doing a great job of having their own voice and personality. And care about your customers. Empower your staff and hire people that care. To paraphrase the much missed Terry Pratchett, it all goes wrong \u201cwhen you treat people like things\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot depends on the type of product and business relationship you have with customers. But if you are selling high value items, there is no alternative to listening very closely to what customers are saying to you, and immediately acting to directly addresses the customer\u2019s concerns. Ideally, this should be done in the way that the customer expects - it involves the whole organization, you have the backing of other people in the organization with the right expertise, you don\u2019t have to beg for attention for their problems, etc. It is your job as the representative to screen any back office challenges, key people on vacation, etc. if possible, and if not, you have to diplomatically explain the situation and be sure to follow up. You should always be honest. If you can\u2019t be honest, you aren\u2019t in the right job or working for the right company. If you are selling lower value items, it is still worthwhile to check in with customers, but you probably have to rely on less personal ways of getting their opinions, like surveys, etc. I do not believe that the goal should always be quantification, or that a quantified tally of customer reactions is that helpful. Especially with more complex sales, it is the degree the customer believes that you have their back that is the key metric, and it can take a long time to develop that kind of relationship. The other thing to note, is that the more often you reach out to existing customers, the more likely you are to find out about problems that have not yet been reported to the company. ",
