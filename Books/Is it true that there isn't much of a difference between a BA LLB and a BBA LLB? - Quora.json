            "answer_text": "Yes it\u2019s very much true that there isn\u2019t much of difference between BA LLB and BBA LLB. The difference is very slight. BA LL.B - Bachelor of Arts and Legum Baccalaureus. This is a five year integrated program where you get this dual degree. You study law subjects with arts subjects like political science, History, sociology etc. BBA LL.B - Bachelor of Business Administration and Legum Baccalaureus. This is also a five year integrated program where you get this dual degree. You study law subjects with management subjects like Principles of Management, computer applications financial accounting etc. When it comes to career options there is a slight difference. Students with BBA LL.B can work as corporate lawyers . While in practising ( latigation) it will not make any difference. As a legal advisory also it does not make much of difference. Campus recruitment for both are same . I personally advise if you are keen towards management and wants to work in corporate world go for BBA LL.B on the contrary if you want to prepare yourself for judiciary exams go for BA LL.B . Hope this answer will help you out. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me first speak about the LL.B. part. In any college running both the courses LL.B. part will be the same. However if the colleges are different that part may also be different. BCI has made 27 law subjects as mandatory. All BCI approved colleges have to teach those subjects at LL.B. level. However colleges may add to this post to make their course stand out. But more or less LL.B. part will be the same. Now coming to B.A. and B.B.A. both will definitely have different subjects. In case you want to practice- it doesn't make a lot of difference until you want to practice in either taxation law or Corporate law (in which cases B.B.A. students will have slight edge over B.A. students dur to their understanding of certain economic concept). In case of competitive exams conducted by government there is no difference in both the courses. In case of placement on campus too there is not much differences and even Companies hire students from both the courses without any fuss. Difference arises only in areas where the prospective employee has to work with lots of financial figures. I personally chose B.B.A. LL.B. because i had done my AISSCE in commerce and a friend who happened to join one year earlier told me that the first year will go down like a breeze in B.B.A. LL.B. for students who have done commerce.
