            "answer_text": "Other than asking the author (who may not know) an exact answer would be difficult but you can get an estimate of how many it\u2019s selling now. Look on Amazon for the \u2018Paid in books\u2019 or \u2018Paid in Kindle\u2019 rank. You\u2019ll find that in the \u2018Product details\u2019 section. Copy the number. Go to a site which estimates the number of sales from that rank such as TCK Book Sales Calculator and enter the number (without commas) and whether this is an ebook or paper book. This one is selling about 8 copies per month - hardly stellar sales but better than average. A second useful site is Kindle Nation Daily\u2019s eBook Tracker. You\u2019ll have to register for this site (free) but you can use it to track the rank of books over a period of time. If the book is already being tracked there you can find it\u2019s rank over a period of time. The book in the first example has been tracked since 2011 and has ranked between 47,786 and 771,446. Putting those numbers into the book sales calculator shows it\u2019s been selling between 80 and 3 sales per month. ",
