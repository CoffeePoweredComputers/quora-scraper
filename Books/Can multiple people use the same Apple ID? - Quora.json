            "answer_text": "Can they? Yes. Should they? Definitely not! Your contacts, photos, text messages, FaceTime calls, and anything else that uses iCloud will be all jumbled together. It\u2019s a huge mess that you\u2019ll go to the Apple Store or call Apple Support for help. There you will find that they data cannot be easily untangled. You\u2019ll need to set up a second Apple ID and manually transfer phone numbers, photos, etc. from one Apple ID to the other. It\u2019s a whole lot easier to start out with separate IDs. If your worried about a child having their own ID, Apple\u2019s got you covered: Use parental controls on your child's iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch ",
