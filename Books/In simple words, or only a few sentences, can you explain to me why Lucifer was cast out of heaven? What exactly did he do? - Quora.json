            "answer_text": "No, because a. there are numerous stages to his ongoing descent into utter depravity, and b. Lucifer wasn't cast out of heaven. Not completely. That is a prophesy of what is to come. There is still an ongoing battle and Lucifer still has dominance over our Galaxy. The Bible refers to him as the self-proclaimed \u201cgod of this world\u201d, prince of the power of the air, and principality of the (lesser) heavenly realms. God was kind enough to give him countless millennia to repent, at this stage in his unfathomable series of moral transgressions he's just beating a dead horse. Whatever he does (or rather whatever he's now capable of doing) only reflects on him. He's continually digging himself deeper, and deeper into darkness. He's even trying to drag everything else down with him. The Devil isn't going to go out in a flash of glory, he's going to go out in a humiliating shit show and all is going to be entirely 100% self-inflicted. Satan doesn't want you to know that he's still in power. That's why most people see him as this horned red dude living under ground instead of the beautiful, cold, manipulative, deadly, venomous, hateful, and sovereign interdimensional being that he is. Those who are familiar with this figure are either dumb enough to believe in the ridiculous \u201cground troll\u201d, or are smart enough to realize that it's a bunch of BS. The problem is that neither group are aware of what's really going on, and how deep the treachery and manipulation is. We are being sold like cattle by our own government, and the unseen galactic organization that puppeteers these governments is benefitting off from our ignorance. Time to wake up, Atheists and Christians alike!  Among his titles are the following: Lightbringer, Morning Star, Wearer of Long Robes, The Shining One (the Hebrew word meaning gleaming like brass), The Diviner, The Serpent, The Greatest of Deceivers, Father of Lies, The Worthless One, The Keeper, The Whisperer, The Accuser, One Who Is Hidden (ie. lurking behind The Veil) among countless others. He hasn't been cast out yet. But he will. See the compelling evidence that this planet is under the sway of fallen angels, a.k.a malevolent interdimensional entities: Strange Phenomena - YouTube All the radio communications, our media, the entertainment industry, everything that travels through our atmosphere can be manipulated and controlled by these cosmic interdimensional entities known as the fallen angels. Angels are highly advanced beings from another dimension who predate mankind itself. They are capable of transcending time and space, travelling light years in an instant, alchemical transmutation, channeling energy frequencies, and they carry boundless occult wisdom. They can also cause changes in humans subliminal mind-manipulation, inducing sleep, altering our emotional and spiritual state. Fallen angels are the same, although somewhat diminished in power and stripped of their divine authority. However, fallen angels should not be confused with possessing evil spirits. Demons/Devils: the Bible classifies common demonic entities as being the disembodied souls (or essence) of the Nephilim who were killed by the flood. As for what he did, he tried to enslave all of creation. God showed humans favour, giving us enlightenment and spiritual awareness. Lucifer and a handful of the angels weren't too happy with this so they decided to come down and be the boss of us, taking possession of everything we had and claiming ownership over our destinies. Basically they were the world's first sociopathic, far-left, Communists. God considered us his children, whereas angels are kind of classed as being servants. In order to spite God (and us) they had their own \u201cchildren\u201d. Nobody knows how this was done. I think some technological and genetic tampering was involved. But the results were extremely perverse, grotesque, diabolical, and outright terrifying. Not only do these things hate and condemn us as nothing more than earthly maggots, they jealously covet the gifts that God gave us and wish to deceive us into misusing them to give them some level of satisfaction. The reason why they are so evil is because they sought independence from the Creator, thinking that they could continue to emulate his divine attributes despite being cut off from the Source of all that is good. I believe that part of Satans plan was to become the exact opposite of God, and in doing so become God's equal, although this didn't work out quite as planned. This would explain why he renamed himself the \u201cAdversary\u201d, seeing himself as an evil version of God, and therefore a god in his own right. Way too much overconfidence on his part. Fallen Angels see us as being stupid and unworthy and wish to take everything from us that God allows them to, leading us straight to Hell, where they'll soon be. These entities have been posing as false gods from the very beginning.  Feel free to check out the answer links in my profile description, and also the comments section.

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters,\u201d(Matt 12:30) claims Jesus and that pretty well sums up what happened to both Satan, his demons and us when we sin. All sin is an act of rebellion, these angels being the first sinners. Whatever triggered the rebellion, Satan and his followers decided to put themselves at odds with their Creator. We are caught in the middle, forcing us to take sides. This is why prayer is so important: to make sure all our decisions align with the Holy Spirit. Otherwise we become/remain victims of Satan\u2019s war with God. * Satan Cast out of Heaven * Another sign appeared in the sky; it was a huge red dragon[a], with seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven diadems. Its tail swept away a third of the stars in the sky and hurled them down to the earth. Then war broke out in heaven; Michael[b] and his angels battled against the dragon. The dragon and its angels fought back, but they did not prevail and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The huge dragon, the ancient serpent,[c] who is called the Devil and Satan, who deceived the whole world, was thrown down to earth, and its angels were thrown down with it.(Rev 12:3 \u2013 4, 7 \u2013 9) [a] Huge red dragon: the Devil or Satan, symbol of the forces of evil, a mythical monster known also as Leviathan or Rahab. Seven diadems: these are symbolic of the fullness of the dragon\u2019s sovereignty over the kingdoms of this world. [b] Michael: the archangel, guardian and champion of Israel. In Hebrew, the name Michael means \u201cWho can compare with God?\u201d. [c] The ancient serpent: who seduced Eve, mother of the human race. Was thrown down: allusion to the expulsion of Satan from heaven. * Commentary on the Fall of Satan * Behind the disobedient choice of our first parents lurks a seductive voice, opposed to God, which makes them fall into death out of envy. Scripture and the Church's Tradition see in this being a fallen angel, called \"Satan\" or the \"devil\". The Church teaches that Satan was at first a good angel, made by God: \"The devil and the other demons were indeed created naturally good by God, but they became evil by their own doing.\" Scripture speaks of a sin of these angels. This \"fall\" consists in the free choice of these created spirits, who radically and irrevocably rejected God and his reign. We find a reflection of that rebellion in the tempter's words to our first parents: \"You will be like God.\" The devil \"has sinned from the beginning\"; he is \"a liar and the father of lies\". It is the irrevocable character of their choice, and not a defect in the infinite divine mercy, that makes the angels' sin unforgivable. \"There is no repentance for the angels after their fall, just as there is no repentance for men after death.\" Scripture witnesses to the disastrous influence of the one Jesus calls \"a murderer from the beginning\", who would even try to divert Jesus from the mission received from his Father. \"The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.\" In its consequences the gravest of these works was the mendacious seduction that led man to disobey God. The power of Satan is, nonetheless, not infinite. He is only a creature, powerful from the fact that he is pure spirit, but still a creature. He cannot prevent the building up of God's reign. Although Satan may act in the world out of hatred for God and his kingdom in Christ Jesus, and although his action may cause grave injuries - of a spiritual nature and, indirectly, even of a physical nature- to each man and to society, the action is permitted by divine providence which with strength and gentleness guides human and cosmic history. It is a great mystery that providence should permit diabolical activity, but \"we know that in everything God works for good with those who love him.\" Catechism of the Catholic Church, Paragraphs 391 \u2013 395.
