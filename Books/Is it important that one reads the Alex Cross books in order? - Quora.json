            "answer_text": "Should you read James Patterson\u2019s Alex Cross novels in order? Perhaps a better question would be, should you read Patterson\u2019s potboilers at all? I must have read ten or twelve of his books before I realized they were a waste of time. They are airport books, perfect light reading while waiting to board your flight. I think I read Kiss the Girls (1995) before I read Along Came a Spider (1993), and I don\u2019t think it made a difference. So I don\u2019t think you need to obsess about reading those novels in order, but what do I know? That said, Patterson\u2019s Alex Cross novels are good models to study if you\u2019re one of those writers who dream of publishing bestsellers someday. It\u2019s an approach that worked for Raymond Chandler when he started writing fiction at forty-four in 1932. He\u2019d just lost his job at the Dabney Oil Syndicate\u2014fired for alcoholism\u2014at the height of the Great Depression. Chandler needed to find a way to make a living. So he studied Erle Stanley Gardner\u2019s novels, taking the plots and characters apart to see how successful authors plan their books. People don\u2019t believe me when I tell them how respected Patterson was at J. Walter Thompson. I was at JWT when Jim Patterson was head of J. Walter Thompson USA. He was senior to me and we never met, but everyone at JWT knew who he was back then. As for who he is now, I\u2019d say he\u2019s a smart man who figured out a formula for churning out bestsellers\u2014and got rich. ",

            "answer_text": "I have only read one Alex Cross book. However I have read other series of similar books. It depends on if the author wrote them as stand alone novels or does he/she reference previous events and/or people in later books. You can read stand alone novels in any order. I would think you would enjoy the novel more if you understood why the author was referring to events/people in earlier books. Another author I read had a series of books (10 I think) about his fantasy universe. They were not written in the order they occurred in his world. After the final book (since I had them all) I arranged them in the order that they happened in his world of Mithgar. It made so much more sense reading them that way. Thanks for the A2A and I hope this helps. ",
