            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all right-or-wrong answer \u2014 but in general, I say authors should hire someone. Here\u2019s why: Narration is neither easy nor natural for most people. It\u2019s not just reading the words; it\u2019s being able to deliver them in a compelling way. If it\u2019s fiction, there will be a certain amount of voice acting involved to bring characters to life. Although these are your words, you aren\u2019t necessarily capable of speaking and delivering them well. The process is far more strenuous and energy-draining than people realize.I\u2019ve narrated a lot of audio, mainly working on a contract with an online corporate training company. Keeping your voice and energy consistent for hours and hours is difficult. You can, of course, break the time into smaller chunks, but you\u2019d be surprised how easy it is for your voice to noticeably shift if you take an extended break (like from one day to the next). Plus, if you\u2019re booking studio time (highly recommended), it\u2019s not practical \u2014 you need to book time in large multi-hours blocks. Having the equipment, recording space, and software does not make you a good narrator.As a follow-on to the point above, sure, you can do the recording yourself \u2014 but this adds even more to your cognitive load and energy drain. The studio engineer follows your script, listens, and alerts you when you\u2019ve made a mistake, skipped a sentence or word, or have diminished in energy, or any of many other problems have occurred. This is very challenging to do on your own in real time \u2014 and do it well. And authors often assume, well, I\u2019ll just fix these mistakes in clean-up. But the thing is, \u201cpunching in\u201d audio corrections is not easy to do well. First, you need to scrutinize all the audio (\u201cproof-listen\u201d as I call it), flag and log all your mistakes, and then you need to re-record those parts. The extra trick, however, is that you need to blend your new audio into the surrounding parts \u2014 and trust me, getting your voice to sound the exact same on, say, Day 5 as it did on Day 1 is not easy at all. If you\u2019ve ever heard badly punched-in audio you know exactly what I mean. Our pitch, tone, delivery pace, and more can be very noticeably different. The studio engineer works on this in real time, and helps make it professional sounding for post-production editing. Most people simply don\u2019t have ideal voices. This isn\u2019t the narration; this is the mere reality of having a voice that people want to listen to for many hours. When we listen to people in conversation, we overlook a lot of speech \u201cproblems\u201d and patterns because it\u2019s about the conversation and company more than their voices. Unless someone has an extremely grating voice, we don\u2019t think about it. But this all changes when we\u2019re listening to an audiobook. Even if you\u2019re not wearing headphones or ear buds and listening intently, the narration voice will get to you after a while if it\u2019s not pleasant. I\u2019m not even talking about needing a great \u201cnarrator\u2019s voice\u201d; I\u2019m talking about just needing a voice that doesn\u2019t wear on the listener over the course of a book. You\u2019re probably going to invest money anyhow.Authors will often say, \u201cI can\u2019t afford studio time!\u201d And to that I say, you\u2019re going to spend that money regardless \u2014 the odds are, you don\u2019t have the necessary equipment and software to do the job right. While it\u2019s not as expensive or complicated as it was just 10 years ago, it\u2019s still a few to several hundred dollars. And worse yet, some authors spend that money only to realize what I wrote above \u2014 the equipment, space, and software do not make you a good narrator. Your time is better spent on other income-generating activities.Unless your voice is absolutely necessary for your book for some reason, you are effectively throwing away your time with no return on that investment. From my experience, it\u2019s realistic to say that the time needed to the finished-audio time is about a 3-to-1 ratio. So if your audio book is projected to be eight hours of finished time, you can expect to put in about 24 hours doing it yourself. (That\u2019s total DIY, in your own space on your own equipment and editing it.) Even if you go into a studio and are a very accurate and consistent reader, you should expect an eight-hour book to take 16 hours. And that\u2019s not counting travel, prep, or rehearsal time. Whatever this amounts to, this is a 100% no-return investment. What could you \u201cearn\u201d (either literally or indirectly) if that time were put to something else? If you have a high professional income, you have to factor in that loss of time as it correlates to your earning rate. A lawyer billing at $275 per hour would be foolish to narrate her own book instead of paying a professional $75 per hour to do it. And beyond the money, what could you do to promote your book if you invested 16\u201324 hours into it, instead of putting this into narration? Again, there\u2019s no single answer for all authors and books. But as I think I\u2019ve spelled out above, it\u2019s far more likely than not that an author should hire a professional to do the work. And for the authors who say, \u201cI don\u2019t have that money!\u201d\u2026 then save up until you do. Unless you\u2019re an author as a hobby, then it\u2019s a business. You wouldn\u2019t open a restaurant and try to be the manager, bookkeeper, cook, server, cleaner, and host all by yourself, would you? Thanks for the A2A!

            "answer_text": "Hi Amy, The general rule of thumb is that an author should hire a professional narrator to \u201cperform\u201d their work. It really is much, much, more than just sitting down in front of a microphone and repeating the author\u2019s words. The narrator is acting, and keep in mind, all of the nuances, (usually helped by on-stage actors by eyebrow raises, hand gestures, body language) have to be conveyed using only the narrator\u2019s voice. This is why many of the best narrators are professionally trained actors. Additionally, when you hire a narrator, they are responsible for producing a quality audio version. The majority of professional narrator\u2019s today have a home study which either is representative of a professional studio, or very closely simulates one. Unless you are setup for all of this, you have to: learn new software for recording; purchase quality equipment (microphone with an analog to digital converter (a USB microphone, while good, isn\u2019t what pros use); purchase a recording booth or setup a small closet properly to record in; learn microphone technique, breathing, how to edit audio files; etc., etc. I could go on for quite awhile. Of of this, or rent a professional studio by the hour, which is quite expensive. (For a new narrator, the time required to produce 1 hour of listenable audio is not 1:1. It\u2019s much, much greater.) However, that\u2019s not to saw that an author cannot read their own work. There are a few authors who are exceptional narrators of their own work, and I can't imagine anyone else performing their books. More importantly to this point, if the work is an autobiography, sometimes it is better to have the person who wrote their life story, tell their life story. (Keep in mind, just about author who has gone into the booth to record their own audiobook has come away with a greater appreciation of how much acting goes into producing their work, and would prefer to stick to writing.) As for asking the publisher to get a narrator, it is my general understanding that, when a publisher purchases the rights to your work, they are also purchasing the rights to the audiobook version as well. This may not always be the case, but usually it is. So, in that case, they may take your suggestion of a particular narrator under consideration, but more than likely, they will have the audiobook production staff cast the appropriate narrator for your audiobook. If you have sold your rights to an audiobook company to produce the audiobook, then they will definitely hire a professional to read your work. If you have kept those rights, then you have full control over who produces your audiobook and you can hire whomever you wish. ",
