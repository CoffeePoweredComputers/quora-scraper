            "answer_text": "First, congratulations on your book, and welcome to the headache of publishing. It is not an easy feat to write something coherent and engaging enough for people to find interesting. I\u2019ll assume all the great things are done like editing, rewriting, critiquing, artwork, and layout design. All you\u2019re interested in is getting your book into bookstores and generating sales. This is the highlight of an author\u2019s career, getting into bookstores. It is also the hardest thing to do unless you get traditionally published, and even then it is difficult. A publisher will, with your help, promote your book and make it available for bookstores. This is the first step in getting you known. Some steps YOU need to do are self-promotion. A website, social media accounts, and public speaking will help put your name out there. If you have a good following on social media, and your followers start to ask for your book through bookstores, then the ball starts to roll. The more books ordered through a bookstore the more other bookstores will start to think about carrying it as well. Let\u2019s consider that you are not traditionally published, but did the self-publishing route. You still need to have that presence in the online world and do the talks. Start small and work your way up. Be ready for rejection, not everyone wants to hear about a \u201cself-published\u201d author wanting to sell their book. In fact, with more and more people self-publishing, it is getting harder for those who take the time to polish their work to be noticed. Some tips, get listed on Goodreads and have book bloggers review your work. If you get positive reviews, people will notice you. The more followers the book reviewer has, the more you are noticed. Once that happens, try to engage with your followers. Hopefully, they will see value in your work and order it. Try to direct them into bookstores to order. From there, you need to keep the social media machine running. It does take a little time, maybe one posting a week if not more, and you\u2019ll find people getting attracted, especially if your writing has some meaning to them. Since you are looking at a recipe book, post part or all of a few of the recipes. Using video will help (see the \u201cTasty\u201d videos on Facebook and other media for examples of well-done videos). Finances This will depend on how you are published. Most publishers either pay you a flat royalty per book (boo!) or a percentage of the profit the work creates (yeah!). I remember presenting a contract to a writer with a 30% royalty on all funds generated by their manuscript and they said they wanted $1.25 per copy sold. My response was, \u201cYou want less than what I offer?\u201d In fact, her figures would have delivered $0.60 less for books sold through bookstores and $3.65 if sold through our shows (we actively participate in multiple sales events including Cons and such). If you self-publish, the sale price of the work is set by you. There are a number of distribution networks available to you, but most use the same calculations. Here is the breakdown for you: Book Income = Sale Price \u2013 (Bookstore Discount) \u2013 (Distributor Fee) \u2013 (Production Cost) Bookstore Income = Sale Price \u2013 40% Distributor Fee = Sale Price * 15% Production Cost = Price to print the book You\u2019ll notice right away the cost of distribution leave only 45% of the book price for you to pay for printing. This does not cover returns (books not sold and returned through your distributor). Say a bookstore orders 100 books, sells 50, and returns 50. You get the income from 50 books, but pay for the printing of 100. This can become costly if you don\u2019t have a good printer. POD (print on demand) usually costs $2.00 + $0.03/page on non-colour pages (depending on the company, but that is a good guideline). The distribution company will also charge you a small fee per book returned (usually around $2/book). Still want to self-publish? Remember, if you self-publish all the costs are born on your shoulders for all of these costs. Bookstores have three months to sell the book before they must either pay for it or return. And your distributor will then pay you one month after they receive the funds. If your book sells well, you have to wait four months before seeing any money. You can opt to have the books destroyed rather than returned, but that will only save you the return costs of the book through the distributor, you will still need to pay for the printing of the books. In conclusion, you can tell the cost of getting your book into a bookstore is better born by the publisher. They will have all the skills and knowledge in getting it distributed with less cost to you. ",

            "answer_text": "The conventional way is to submit a book to a publisher. You\u2019ll want to research publishers, see who publishes things like what you\u2019re writing, and find their writer\u2019s guidelines, which they\u2019ll almost certainly have available on their corporate web sites. Those are basically their rules or instructions for how to approach them with a proposal for a book. Follow them to the letter [1]. If the publisher wants to publish your book, they\u2019ll offer you a contract specifying the work to be done, deadlines, and royalties. Basically, you\u2019ll get a modest percentage of the sale price of the book for each copy sold. In return for the substantial portion of the sale price which you don\u2019t get (the publisher, retailer, and distribution network split the remainder), other people handle the work of getting the book edited, laid out, printed, warehoused, shipped, and sold. You are not burdened with the substantial tasks of negotiating with bookstores and distribution networks, hiring people to do the editing and production, financing, and so on. They also take a substantial amount of the risk involved. If you write a book and nobody buys it, you\u2019re out the time you spent on it but none of the money. In fact, you should get an advance against royalties, which you keep even if the book fails. The publisher, though, ends up out their investment on your work. Publishers exist to do all of the not-writing stuff so the author can just write. It\u2019s theoretically possible to self-publish, but that\u2019s vastly more work and vastly more difficult. In addition to writing the book, you have to find an editor (like a lawyer who represents himself, the author who edits his own book has a fool for a client), someone to do layout and production, and a cover artist, pay a printer for printing and binding the book, arrange for shipping, pay everyone involved for their work (which, unless you\u2019re sitting on a fat stack of cash, means negotiating some sort of small business loan with a bank), and convince book sellers that people will want to buy your book at whatever price point you figure out is the right one [2]. These are all somewhat specialized tasks, so it\u2019s a stunningly bad idea for a beginner to attempt all of that. Some publishers will only work through agents. Finding an agent is a vaguely similar process. Again, if they give instructions on how they want to be contacted, follow those instructions.Figuring out how much to sell a product for is a black art. You\u2019ll want a price point in the range of comparable product and I get the impression that it should also be something in the range of five to ten times your production cost, but if you\u2019re inexperienced, it\u2019s entirely possible that you\u2019ll get things horribly wrong so that you won\u2019t be able to meet those to criteria simultaneously, and even if you get it right there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll actually sell enough to make back the money you\u2019ve already spent.",

            "answer_text": "I actually work for a small publisher, and can give you the lo-down on the steps you\u2019d need to take to make this a reality! You\u2019re correct about needing to take baby steps- if everyone could get their books sold in large, mass market bookstores overnight, they would. Unfortunately, the bad news is that it is literally impossible to have your book sold in bookstores without knowing any editors or publishers. Having a connection, more specifically, a contract, with a publishing company is a necessity. To get a trade book noticed by a publisher, you need to have an agent- a literary agent. I\u2019m unsure of the specifics of what they do, but they have close relationships with publishers and can solicit your books to them. Maybe a publisher signs it, maybe they don\u2019t. But this is a huge step to getting your foot in the door, and have someone else do the dirty work of taking your book around to people who will actually read what you have written. Without an agent, publishers will just throw your manuscript in the trash. The downside of this is that it costs money, and there\u2019s no guarantee. How much money? Maybe take a look at this [1] to get a better idea of how much it will cost you. The other downside is that agents are not created equal, meaning, some are better than others, and some may not even take a second look at you if you don\u2019t have a solid reputation already as a writer. So, let\u2019s say your agent takes your book to Random House and they want to sign your book. Hooray! Great news. You\u2019ll sign a contract, figure out how much royalties you\u2019ll make off each single item sold. THEN and only then will your book be sold in bookstores and on Amazon and wherever else you can think of. You won\u2019t be involved in the pricing of the book itself- that\u2019s something the company figures out based on the market and competitors and all that. I hope this helps and feel free to contact me with any other questions you may have about book publishing. :) Footnotes[1] How Literary Agents Get Paid: Standard Commission Practices And Payments For Literary Agents  - Writer's Relief, Inc.",
