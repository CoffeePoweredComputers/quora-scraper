            "answer_text": "I just wrote a historical fiction novel and got a book deal with HarperCollins, here\u2019s my take: Historical fiction novels are set in decades or centuries past, but the same rules apply regarding storytelling, including the importance of character, conflict, plot, etc. You must make your novel exciting. It should be as involving, or at least almost as involving, as good fiction. You\u2019re writing drama, not documentary, journalism or a history book.  A crucial decision regarding historical drama is: How truthful and accurate should historical drama be? How much dramatic license may I take? The answer is: It all depends. An excellent example is \u201c300\u201d. The film portrayed the Spartans as heroes \u201cfighting for freedom against tyranny and mysticism.\u201d This, of course, is not the whole truth. Sparta was a militaristic dictatorship/ But militarist Spartans wouldn\u2019t have made for heroic drama. So the screenplay outrageously falsified history, and got away with it because comparatively few people in the audience knew the historic truth and even fewer gave a damn. They wanted to see rivers of blood and gore, and the movie delivered. On the other hand, you couldn\u2019t get away with similar dramatic license in a WW 2 drama or something more recent. An example of this is Indian movie \u2018Kesari\u2019 that failed to mention/stress on the fact that the Afghans were the actual repressed population and that it was their land. It wouldn\u2019t have taken away anything from Sikh bravery.  Here, then, is the basic rule: remember you\u2019re writing historical \u2018fiction\u2019. Getting the \u2018history\u2019 right in varying degree is important but in the end you are telling a story about individuals. In the words of Stalin - A million deaths is a statistic, a single death is a tragedy. Research history but write the story of that single person. ",

            "answer_text": "10 RULES FOR WRITING HISTORICAL FICTION 1] Write about a known character OR Write about a known event:  Now, there are two ways to go about writing historical fiction. You could either write about a historical figure that the masses already know and let your imagination flow with him. Or, you could create totally new characters, fictional characters, and put them into an event of which people still talk about.2] create a strong set of supporting characters::In both of the above cases, you shall need strong supporting characters. A story can\u2019t run on one character alone, never! You will need a good Villain [oxymoron unintended], a love interest and a sidekick. That\u2019s the very basic formula though now, the trend is towards creating more grey characters and to avoid clich\u00e9s such as above.3] Keep the world stronger than the characters:The world you create in a historical fiction was already present before your story occurs, and will continue to exist long after your story is over.4] Be sensitive with sensitive history::  Some periods of the past are very sensitive to sensitive people. And yes, there are a lot of sensitive people in this world. So respect their sensitiveness and handle those parts of history, if you must, with sensitivity.5] The facts must support the fiction:Whatever history you choose to write about, some parts of it will always be documented by historians of modern periods and writers of those periods. Do read it! What you write must not conflict with what is already known about that time. Like if Henry V won the battle of Agincourt, then he won it! He can\u2019t lose it, No, not even in your book!6] Don\u2019t make it a history lesson::Most people are bored of history lessons. They don\u2019t want a history lesson from a book. They want to be entertained. So don\u2019t go about explaining history. Let it flow out of conversations and events.7] Do your research:There are many things that we take for granted today that may or MAY NOT have existed in the time period of your story. So do your researches about the time period of your story thoroughly before you begin to write it.  Otherwise, your 3rd century BC character might end up wielding a gun powdered rifle to his enemies. And yes, there are not-so-obvious things too. Like if your story is set in 4th century BC India,  then your characters can\u2019t write letters on paper because paper didn\u2019t exist in India then.8] Surprise the readerDon\u2019t get me wrong, but what is the point of writing Historical fiction! The history has already happened. Everyone knows what is going to happen in the book. Still they read it because good historical fiction will make the reader forget what he already knows about the history and give him a sense of interest.9] Don\u2019t confuse the dates:Dates are confusing, yes! They have been confusing ever since we started learning them in history lessons at school. We have AD\u2019s (Anno Domini\u2019s) for eg. We live in 2015 AD. Two years ago, it was 2013 AD. But when we venture into ancient history before Christ, [B.C.\u2019s] the whole counting changes. Like one year before Christ, it was 1 B.C. and three years before that, it was 4 B.C.! Confusing, isn\u2019t it! So, if there are more than one time periods in your story, then it is better to stick to one time period as the main time period. And then, use it as reference when writing about the other time periods. For example, if some part of your story happens in 1600AD and the other part in 1700AD, then writing about the 1700AD part as \u2018100 years later.\u2019 Saves the reader from having to figure out the AD\u201ds and the BC\u2019s and he\u2019ll sure be grateful to you for it.10] Make it a compelling read: And in the end, this is a general rule for all kinds of fictions.Here are some  links about this topicTen best historical novels100 All-Time Best Historical Fiction BooksHistorical Fictionistas50 Essential Historical Fiction BooksDefining the Genre: What are the rules for historical fiction? by Sarah JohnsonHave a good day y\u2019all.
