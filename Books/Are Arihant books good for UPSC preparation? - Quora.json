            "answer_text": "Arihant Publications Books are good for reference but they should not be the only books that you study. Try NCERT books primarily and solve a lot of MCQ questions. They will be the best books for preparation for UPSC. Also try to read newspapers daily and get the Manorama Yearbook for the past two years. You can also get a lot of books for UPSC preparation from MyPustak which delivers free previously used books for a minimal delivery fee. ",
