            "answer_text": "You already have your answers here, which I agree with, so I\u2019ll just add: Be sure to search for any pen name you plan to use. First, you don\u2019t want confusion with another author of the same name, especially if you don\u2019t want to be associated with their books. Second, it\u2019s disrespectful to intentionally take on a pen name that happens to be the name of another author. Doing a Google and Amazon search of whatever names you consider (and going 10 pages deep into the results) should be enough to reasonably confirm your desired pen name is original. Oh, and don\u2019t make it weird or funny \u2014 like I.P. Daily \u2014 unless that fits the nature of your book. The point isn\u2019t to call attention to your name.

I personally hate to put annon on the cover, it is always better the classic approach, invent a name to use as the author. That is what our predecessors, writers used to do! ",
