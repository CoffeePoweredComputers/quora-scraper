            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s truly self-published, they don\u2019t get royalties. Royalties are a payment a publisher makes to the author. But if the author is the publisher, there\u2019s no additional step. Sales go directly to the author/publisher. That said, the author/publisher likely doesn\u2019t own their own storefront. In those rare cases where it\u2019s the author actually handling the money from the buyer, the money from a sale goes straight into their pocket. More often, though, there\u2019s a retailer in the way, whether it\u2019s the corner bookstore or Amazon. In that case, there are a couple of models. For physical books, the retailer (or a distributor) pays up front for product and keeps the sale price (with various complicated exceptions). For many electronic platforms, the retailer pays the author/publisher a cut of sales on a contractually agreed-upon schedule. I gather that monthly is pretty common. But those are sales, not royalties. ",

            "answer_text": "Amazon pays my royalties monthly for all sales earned in the previous month (ie, I get paid royalties in early February for sales earned in January). And of course, I get paid immediately for sales earned through my own shop front. My commission contracts with brick-and-mortar bookshops for print sales vary by commission contract (40% royalty with Net 60 terms is most common; YMMV), but my return from those sales is negligible after shipping costs (which I have to pay myself to maintain a physical inventory). I write these copies off as promotional costs rather than account them as unit sales. You may (and probably should) handle similar circumstances differently than I do. I should have set my cover price for print higher if I wanted to see a profit from these arrangements; I simply didn\u2019t think of it at the time, and now that I know better, I don\u2019t want to change my online print pricing (deliberately low to facilitate impulse purchases), and I don\u2019t want to pay extra or burn another ISBN just to run separate inventory copies with different pricing for commission sales purposes.
