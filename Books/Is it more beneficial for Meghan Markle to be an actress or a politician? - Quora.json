IMO she will not be an actress as she is getting too old to play any age appropriate part and she certainly doesn\u2019t have the talent to be another Meryl Streep, Judi Dench etc. As for being a Politician, ummmm, she can certainly lie and twist the truth to suit her own narrative, but I don\u2019t think she is able to handle confrontations, she runs in the opposite direction, sooo a politician, bit dicey. It is going to be interesting indeed to see what the future holds for Meghan ! ",
