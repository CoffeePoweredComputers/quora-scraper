            "answer_text": "In simple words if you want to know what is India, you must read this book. The book is written by Nehru while he was in Yerwada Jail. It is the most scientific book written for the India's history. The book gives account of Harappan civ and aryan civ with the scientific explanation based on the evidences found in excavation, also it provides the references from Vedas, Ramayana, Mahabharata and Battle of ten clans (dasharajan war). Book is written in the period when India was enslaved by foreign rule but it nowhere potrays the one sided look of European power. Nehru said in his book that Great Britain was one country having two nations in itself. When one England was promoting racism and tyranny all over the world at the same time other England was developing it's taste for liberty, fraternity and equality. When one nation was sentensing capital punishment people of any age from 5yr old to 90yr who criticize government, other nation was producing literates like Shakespeare. According to Nehru India came in hands of the nation which was tyrant and oxymoron to its own values. Indian history was devided by European historians as Hindu history and Muslim history, Nehru explained it how it was possible to have Shivaji in the reign of Aurangzeb and Maharana in the reign of Akbar, but why it was not possible to have any opposition in British Rule. Nehru discarded the History of India as Hindu ruled India or Muslim ruled India. The book also provides some accounts on the relationship of Nehru with that of Gandhiji , Patel and subhas Chandra Bose, which is debated in our parliament till today for blame game. Nehru received personal note from Albert Einstein about the glory and knowledge abot India provided by the book. Nehru has also discussed the impact of Russian Revolution on his personality and it's impact on India's freedom struggle, how it inspired many revolutionaries in India. No matter which ideology you believe in Left, Right or center, everyone must read this book. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely worth it, especially in our times,because: a. Albert Einstein to write to Nehru: \u201cI have read with extreme interest your marvellous book(The discovery of India)\u2026It gives an understanding of the glorious intellectual and spiritual tradition of \u2026India.\u201d b. It is a very scientific, balanced, considerate, critical account of Indian history, by someone who was very well read, well experienced, with rational outlook and staggering command of the subject. c. It was once part of the syllabus for UPSC examinations and thus was a must read. Which goes to show that the book is academic in orientation and highly informative. d. It is authored by a great Indian, deeply devoted to his motherland. He subjects some of the Indian traditions to critical examination and yet doggedly justifies our ancient wisdom and knowledge. e.And in times like this when it's insinuated that being Indian means belonging to a particular religion or belonging to a religion means anti-Indian , this spectacular work by a true statesman who fought uncompromisingly for a secular India.
