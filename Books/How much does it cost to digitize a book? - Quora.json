            "answer_text": "I made a book shooter for less than $20. With my smart phone and ScanTailor open source software, a 300 page book can be digitized in about 60 hours of boring frustrating mind-numbing work. There are automatic scanners that can cost tens of thousands of dollars (such as used by Google Books) that bring the cost way down per book. If you wrote your own book and need it digitized by a service, you might pay a few hundred dollars for a good job with some proof reading. If you have equations, special characters, and photos, do not expect anything more than images of your pages. Reproducing your equations in LaTex is probably unaffordable. If you have the loose sheets, you can run it through a document feeder on a good office copier. Some of these are so fast, I digitized about 50,000 pages of my old technical reports, course materials, and briefings in about 3 days. I got 5 drawers of a file cabinet reduced to pdfs. I had no assignment for those three days and it was better than just surfing the web. Or about anything else I could do. Rid my office of a lot of clutter. I can't remember what brand it was, but it was blazingly fast. ",
