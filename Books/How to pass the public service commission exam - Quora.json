            "answer_text": "Everybody wants Gov jobs, even if there are more opportunities in the private sector. But very few are ready to work for that. You should need regular practice to win exams like PSC. If you ask to a winner they may suggest any coaching centers .But I feel coaching centers are too bore to afford persons like us, we should need enough patients to sit on coaching centers. I suggest three steps to win any exams like PSC1) News paper reading - You can't ignore to read news papers. Don't forget to note important points in a book. 2) Practice PSC questions. I suggest an android app for this.().This app makes you efficient in time management. You can use your free time for training. 3) Third and important step is attended as much as exams you can.If  you follow this method you will win any PSC exams within six month. ",
