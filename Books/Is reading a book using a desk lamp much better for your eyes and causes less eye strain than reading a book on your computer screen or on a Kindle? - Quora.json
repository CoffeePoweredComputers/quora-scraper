I like to read in the dark so the light the Paperwhite gives off is perfect for my needs. I am a longtime book collector and as such, never thought I would want an ereader. I was hooked immediately the first time I turned it on, however. The small size is perfect as it allows me to carry well over 300++ books in the palm of my hand. ",
