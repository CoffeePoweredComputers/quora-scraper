            "answer_text": "When St John speaks about the churches in The Book of Revelation he's talking about groups of people, parishes, who live in a certain area of the near east. There is only one church but in the church there's different churches. This is the same as the Catholic Church today. We are all part of one church but in that one church there are different churches such as the New York or Chicago archdiocese. Each part of the Catholic Church however each having their own character which is what St John speaks to. The different churches are their locations. Churches aren't buildings in this context but gatherings of people united in the faith of Jesus Christ. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes of course. Church means assembly or community. Such communities clearly existed and in the writings of St Paul, these communities were not loose gatherings of frightened followers of Jesus but were already showing signs of organisation and had bishops, priests and deacons. It is a mistake to hold that these were random gatherings of people with no clear structure. If you read Acts of the Apostles you get a clear picture of early church communities with lines of communication between individual churches as you can see in the pastoral epistles. ",

After the first church became established quite a few years later, which is today the Eastern Orthodox Church, Roman wasn\u2019t to exist for several hundred years after one bishop who happened to be In Rome claimed he was the real leader and broke away from the others, declaring himself pope. That\u2019s the simple version. I\u2019m sure others will write details at great length but at my age I don\u2019t have that much time\u2026 ",
