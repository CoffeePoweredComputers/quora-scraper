Kindle Unlimited is a PAID membership which gives you lots of free books (these are mainly popular titles and some lower value books, I have not used KU yet but I don't think you will find many really good books for free; it's just a promotional scheme) Kindle is still a good option to save money on books as Kindle copies are in .mobi format and are much cheaper than paperbacks ",
