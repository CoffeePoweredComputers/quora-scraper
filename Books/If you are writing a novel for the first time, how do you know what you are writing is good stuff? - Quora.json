            "answer_text": "You won\u2019t know. In fact, you\u2019d be constantly feeling low and depressed as you read and re-read your work. At this point I am assuming that you\u2019ve done quite a lot of reading yourself before embarking on writing a novel. If you haven\u2019t, then it would be a good idea to read and re-read the best books available (not the most recent crop of Indian writers like Chetan Bhagat and Durjoy Datta) - first read it to enjoy it as a reader, then read it once again to see the craft of the writer. But the point is to keep writing, and get it read by different people. Those who believe in you as well as those who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to criticize you. Try to get it read by people who are even otherwise, well-read- for example, you could approach a professor of literature in the nearest university for feedback. (This of course depends- if you\u2019re writing young adult fiction, you might as well get it read by your teenage niece or nephew, and leave only the language/grammar judgement to the experienced people) Lastly, read your entire work as an outsider (after you\u2019ve taken a long enough break) and see how you feel about your own writing. \u201cWould you read this book if someone else had written it? \u201c is the question you should ask yourself. The final judgement of your book will anyway come through when you go to reputed publishers . (Please\u2014 no self publishing- atleast not until your work can be judged as quality work. Self publishing companies do not care about your quality of work , and they\u2019ll publish it as you give them, mistakes and all) So\u2026 that\u2019s how it is. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Writing a novel can be tiresome, so you would need constant motivation to move on especially when it's your first. Firstly, a layout will help you in knowing that you have a clear vision about your work. Don't start penning down without having a plan. A plan would include the narrative technique you and use to tell your story, what impact do you want your story to create, the characters, the plot development, and the like. Secondly, when you have a blueprint of what you want your work to look like, you will develop confidence. Every idea is ambiguous until it's organized. This will help you gather internal confidence. Lastly, the most important is to have an honest critic in your life. It's not necessary for this person to be from a literary background, but it's really important for the person to be absolutely and brutally honest with you. No matter what, the person should tell you the truth, even when he/she thinks you aren't doing well. And you should also take the suggestions from this person very seriously and positively. Choosing this person can be very tricky, but take your time with this because he/she is going to be your first reader as well as reviewer. ",
