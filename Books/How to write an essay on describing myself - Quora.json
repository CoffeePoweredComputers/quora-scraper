            "answer_text": "I think the task to write about yourself is quite difficult. It doesn\u2019t matter if you write a personal essay, cover letter or any other project \u2013 each goes with some specific tricks that make the writing tough. When I think about writing an essay describing myself, I consider the following: \u2022 Introducing to a strangerImagine talking to someone you\u2019ve never met before, but don\u2019t make up a story. Remain as sincere as you can when describing the challenges you faced as a cardiologist\u2019s assistant. Tell what personal struggles you\u2019ve handled during your internship as a TV editor. Stay specific from line one.\u2022 Picking one specific topicDon\u2019t write about a general issue. Your essay may well be about feminism, but you have to discuss it based on a defining incident that is personal to you. What does your experience mean to you? Did it teach you anything about feminism? \u2022 Providing some good detailsRemember that you describe yourself, so ensure to bring positive light on your personality: o Bad: I like animals. o Better: I like the studying animal behavior.o The best: When I was a teenager, I would attend local vet clinic to help providing basic veterinary care to the animals. That\u2019s what influenced my decision to become a vet. \u2022 Getting help from family members It\u2019s not that you have to ask your family to write an essay for you. I mean collecting some stories from your childhood is a nice way to reach your readers. If it\u2019s OK, share a story of you of anyone from your family battling a serious disease or volunteering in a refugee camp. No matter what you decide to share, be honest. Don\u2019t sound fake. It\u2019s up to you to decide what information to include, but I\u2019d recommend you stay away from religion, politics, gender, nationality/race, and income issues. ",

            "answer_text": "Personal essay? Cool! Let\u2019s do this\u2026 So, start with outlining what you need for your essay - you usually have your five basic paragraphs. The introduction, the three body paragraphs, and the conclusion. What reaallyyyyy helps in writing an essay and I have found highly useful over years of writing is starting with an outline, which looks like this\u2026 Thesis: (your introductory sentence) 1.(your first body paragraph\u2019s topic) a. supporting detail b. supporting detail c. supporting detail 2. (your second body paragraph\u2019s topic) a. supporting detail b. supporting detail c. supporting detail 3. (your third body paragraph\u2019s topic) a. supporting detail b. supporting detail c. supporting detail Conclusion: (wrapping your essay up) And now we get to the good stuff - writing the actual essay. In the introduction, tell your reader what you\u2019re going to be talking about. Make sure to start off hooking the reader\u2019s attention - I won\u2019t tell you what to write because this is your own personal essay here! :-) In the first body paragraph, start with the basics about yourself. Maybe talk about what you look like, where you live, and how old you are. In the second paragraph, go a little deeper. Maybe you can talk about your hobbies and interests and what extracurricular activities you\u2019re currently taking. In the third, go even deeper - the reader feels they know you well now, so perhaps share your hopes and dreams for the future, such as what you want to be, where you want to live, etc. Finally, in the conclusion, give a quick summary of what you just said - not so descriptive that it feels repetitive, but a nice wrap-up of your paper. End with a strong, final sentence. After you\u2019re done, EDIT!!! I cannot stress how important this is. Read your essay a couple times over, smoothing out sentences and catching typos. Make sure your essay is 12 pt. Times New Roman with 1\u2033 margins - this is the typical format for an essay and teachers will like to see this. Also, maybe add in MLA format - you know, your name, teacher\u2019s name, class name, date\u2026 Note that this is only the basics, and you can expand on what I said. Since this is a personal essay, make it personal! The body paragraphs could really be about anything. This is just a general idea of what to do. Best of luck, and hope this helps! :-) ",
