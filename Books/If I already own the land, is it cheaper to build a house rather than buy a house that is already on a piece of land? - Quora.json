            "answer_text": "Construction costs per sq.ft. can vary by several hundred percent depending on the building codes and the tastes of the owner. 8\u2019 ceilings? 10\u2019? Basement? Hardwood floors? Just about everyone these days wants stone countertops in their kitchens. Let\u2019s assume 25 linear feet of countertop. For a long time, plastic laminate (e.g. Formica) was the standard. For our purposes, the cost of plastic laminate is zero. Porcelain tile is a step up costing maybe $30\u201340/sq.ft. including installation. Our 25\u2019 of countertop will require ~60 sq.ft. of tile. $1800-$2400. Several 6\u2019 x 10\u2019 stone slabs will be needed for stone countertops and full or partial backsplashes. Let\u2019s assume 4 slabs (there\u2019s a lot of leftover remnants on these jobs. Figure 30\u201340%). Lower-priced stone slabs start around $1000/slab. The most common choices are the natural minerals granite and quartzite as well as the semi-synthetic \u201cQuartz.\u201d More exotic choices can cost $2000\u20134000/slab or more. Fabrication and installation can run $5000-$10,000 depending on the complexity of the job. Our 25\u2019 of countertop and backsplash can range from $9000 to $26,000. Without a stone backsplash, a budget stone countertop can be had for $5000. More exotic stones, smaller slabs (leading to more wastage), complex fabrication such as bookmatching or unusual shapes can run the price up even more. The least expensive flooring option is carpet or synthetic \u201cwood-look\u201d plastics laid over plywood sub-flooring - a few dollars/sq.ft. \u201cManufactured wood\u201d (I.e. a genuine wood veneer over a particle board or plywood base) will give the appearance and feel of hardwood at lower cost than actual hardwood. Actual hardwood or Porcelain or ceramic tile will cost the most. At the low end, $20/sq.ft. depending on the amount of surface preparation needed and the choice of material. Installation alone can run over $30/sq.ft. - more in tight labor markets. Material cost can be as little as a few dollars/sq.ft. to ~$25/sq.ft. For a 2000sq.ft. house, flooring can range from, say, $8000 to $100,000. Every aspect of home construction or remodeling has a huge selection of options. Before deciding whether to build new or remodel old, the owner needs a realistic assessment of costs, available budget, tolerance (for dust, delay and overruns), as well as resale potential. ",

            "answer_text": "If I already own the land, is it cheaper to build a house rather than buy a house that is already on a piece of land? 1) The cheapest, is to find an older home in needing to be fixed condition, you should be able to buy it well below market value. 2) Next should an older home in decent shape, but could use some updating. 3) Then it should be new homes in a development 4) Build it yourself. And the reason that the build it yourself is the most expensive, is because any little thing that you want can be incorporated into the house, from the number of bedrooms & bathrooms, to layout, to pre-wiring the house with Ethernet cables in every room for both Internet and Cable TV. Pool or no pool. Patio large or small, covered or open. In your kitchen, do you have a separate ice maker or wine cooler. In the master bath, Whirlpool bath tub or huge shower or both. Does it open to the pool? Bidet or no bidet? How big is that walk-in closet? Those and many, many more decisions are yours to make before you start building, so that the house is exactly what you want. ",
