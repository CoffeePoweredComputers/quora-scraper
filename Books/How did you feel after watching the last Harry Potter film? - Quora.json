            "answer_text": "*SHOCKED* To see the ending unfold in front of my eyes was like a miracle being unleashed. shock 1 : when harry couldnt cast a patronus but aberforth saved him again. This was something unheard of in the books. shock 2 : when harry had the might to challenge voldemort. It was made perfectly clear that in terms of magical might, Harry was nowhere near the knowledge that Voldemort had, while Voldemort was nowhere as brave as Harry was. shock 3 : harry managed to kill voldemort with a disarming spell. no explanation given. so the boy who lived can kill people with disarming spells? shock 4 : bellatrix died and this has no effect on voldemort, nor is she anywhere near him. In the books, she is dueling 3 alongside her master who too was dueling 3 at the moment. shock 5 : elder wand is snapped into two at the end of the battle. in the books, harry had never used the elder wand, but then again he did not break it either. shock 6 : harry never repaired his original wand. if so , he asked ollivander to make a new wand for him ? in the books he loved his original phoenix wand. I dont say there are a lot of mistakes, nor do I wish that the producers made truly grave errors. They did their part amazingly, and made subtle changes to appeal more to the audience than be simply consistent with the boooks (only potterheads would understand the significance then). ",
