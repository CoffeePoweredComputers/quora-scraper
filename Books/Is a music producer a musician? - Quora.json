            "answer_text": "The term producer has different connotations in different industries. Let\u2019s explore a few. In theatre, the producer is responsible for ensuring all aspects of the show come up to a required standard. The producer is in on discussions about scenery, lighting, costume, props, promotion, budgeting, the lot. However, there\u2019s a Director who is responsible for ensuring performers do justice to the script, maybe a Choreographer who looks after movement, a Musical Director who rehearses the musicians and singers, and so on. The producer is one step back. Doesn\u2019t need to act, sing, dance, build scenery, etc., but needs to be an excellent judge of quality. In film, it\u2019s similar but there may be multiple producers with various roles. The budget is critical - and that\u2019s all their domain. The Director controls the action, the editing, everything you see. There\u2019s a Musical Director sometimes, but with these others in control the producer is a consultant, not a creative force.  Now we come to an audio recording. Composers and Musicians write and perform and arrange some material, and enter the studio to record. The engineer facilitates getting the sound stored on tape or disk. Now comes the part where they listen to it and judge whether it\u2019s good enough to release. During that process, there might be thoughts about what\u2019s missing, what\u2019s excessive, what sounds right or wrong, how this or that line was sung and whether a different harmony might work. In the studio, who will be the Musical Director? Who will make the final MUSICAL decisions? It could be the composer - and that\u2019s a musician.It could be a performer that all the others trust - and that\u2019s a musician.It could be the engineer - but the band will only subscribe to that if the engineer has some technical understanding of the music. It\u2019s no good the engineer trying to explain that there\u2019s something wrong with a part without knowing some musical terminology\u2026 which means they need some musical training, and to be valid their opinion needs to carry at least as much weight as the performers. Yes, again a musician.It could be someone else brought in to advise and judge the quality of the final product\u2026 just like a theatre producer. They\u2019d better have the same level of ability anyone else in the room has to understand the limitations and opportunities of the music, the performers, and the mixing process. Yep, they need to have some musical training.In the end, anyone who wants to claim a production credit in a recording studio is probably going to have to make some real contribution to the final performance, sound, structure, and mix. They might suggest a part being on a different instrument, or an extra harmony line, or taking out an instrument to create space, or adding a new part for texture, even adding or omitting a verse or chorus of a song, and they often contribute a performance of their own to add to the mix. They also end up making decisions about EQ, effects, stereo positioning and levels - which is why often the producer is heavily involved or even in sole control of the final mix. A non-musician would struggle with all that, and would probably make some decisions that jar with musicians. So I vote a big YES. A music producer SHOULD be a musician, but I\u2019m well aware that when it comes to mixing together \u201cbeats\u201d and samples and loops, there are some non-musicians doing that very well, and they call themselves producers - which is fine. It\u2019s a term in a certain genre though, not a general term. They could not walk into a studio with an unfamiliar genre being recorded and make a sensible contribution. That\u2019s what a fully qualified producer can do. I can record, arrange, mix, and produce ANYTHING from hard rock to folk, from jazz to madrigals. I can write parts for everything from Pedal Harp to Funk Clavinet or from a Brass Quintet to a Progressive Rock band. That\u2019s what my training as a producer gave me. I know my way around every instrument and what they can do. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve run a recording studio and engineered sessions. Back in the day, a music producer was god. He called the shots, said try it this way, decided (and often wrote) additional parts he thought should be recorded, maybe buying in an orchestra to do so, and would usually give himself a small playing role, like tambourine, to ensure he got a share of the performance royalties along with everything else. If he said re-take, the engineer did a re-take, without wasting valuable studio time having a discussion about it. If he said the AKG mic is not doing it for me, let\u2019s try a (Neumann) U87, you did it. He probably knew what he was talking about, and the sound he wanted, and how it fitted into his vision of the final master, at a time when half of it had not even been tracked yet. He held the budget, usually as the appointee of the record label commissioning the work. I\u2019ve seen a producer of classical music, reading a copy of the conductor\u2019s score, stop a take and tell Leonard Bernstein, conducting his own work, say \u201cwe need to go back and restart at bar 178\u201d and Bernstein just nods and does it, trusting the producer heard something off that he himself missed. The producer gets away with this outrageous chutzpah because he is himself respected and a consummately good musician. At the other end of the spectrum I\u2019ve seen amateur bands buy a bit of studio time and introduce some best mate as producer because he can\u2019t play any instruments or sing but they want him to have a title. And I have deferentially gone along with the traditional \u201che\u2019s the producer, he\u2019s god\u201d routine for as long as I could bear it, or until he was in imminent danger of seriously breaking something valuable. And then I\u2019ve told the band either the fuckwit goes or they all go but I don\u2019t have any more time to waste on this crap, and I\u2019m saving them money by saying so. Call me old fashioned, but you cannot produce music without being a musician. ",
