            "answer_text": "Okay, so most of the new writers often ask these questions from the more experienced writers or who have become authors\u2014 what should I write, how should I start, which genre should I pick, etc. Trust me, when I say, that writers often find their inspiration around them, close to them or inside them. Sometimes, a heartbreak leads a person to create a marvellous love-story. Sometimes, a failure at work turns the person into a writer who comes up with an exquisite book about business plans and ideas. Sometimes, a person who has recently lost 50 kgs would want to share his/her story with world and hence, a fitness book. So, basically, writers find their inspiration around themselves, in the experiences they have had, the loss they have suffered or the love they have felt. Back to your question\u2014 you want to write, but you don't know where you can start off from. Allow me to give you a few suggestions: Start Reading (if you haven't been doing that already)Begin with writing your daily routine or a routine you wish you followed.Write letters to yourself, to your siblings, to your friends.Pick up a newspaper, read a news, do some further research on it, form your own opinion and write it.Write about a book you read recently.Pick up a topic that you think you have knowledge about. Do some more research on the choice of words, and write.Join some Facebook groups for Writers and Readers, and any genre that interests you. Join communities online, follow writing bloggers and coaches on YouTube.These short simple steps can help you begin. More about writing and how to write can be found and explored here.[1] Starting to write is fairly easy, sticking to it can be difficult.

            "answer_text": "Gentle answer would be that you should not. And here's Charles Bukowski's infinite wisdom compressed into a poem to tell you that same thing. So You Want To Be A Writer if it doesn't come bursting out of youin spite of everything,don't do it.unless it comes unasked out of yourheart and your mind and your mouthand your gut,don't do it.if you have to sit for hoursstaring at your computer screenor hunched over yourtypewritersearching for words,don't do it.if you're doing it for money orfame,don't do it.if you're doing it because you wantwomen in your bed,don't do it.if you have to sit there andrewrite it again and again,don't do it.if it's hard work just thinking about doing it,don't do it.if you're trying to write like somebodyelse,forget about it.if you have to wait for it to roar out ofyou,then wait patiently.if it never does roar out of you,do something else. if you first have to read it to your wifeor your girlfriend or your boyfriendor your parents or to anybody at all,you're not ready. don't be like so many writers,don't be like so many thousands ofpeople who call themselves writers,don't be dull and boring andpretentious, don't be consumed with self-love.the libraries of the world haveyawned themselves tosleepover your kind.don't add to that.don't do it.unless it comes out ofyour soul like a rocket,unless being still woulddrive you to madness orsuicide or murder,don't do it.unless the sun inside you isburning your gut,don't do it. when it is truly time,and if you have been chosen,it will do it byitself and it will keep on doing ituntil you die or it dies in you. there is no other way. and there never was.
