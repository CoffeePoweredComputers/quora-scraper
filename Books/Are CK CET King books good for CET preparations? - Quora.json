            "answer_text": "You'll get many biased opinions as answers to your question. As someone who has studied the CET exam pattern for years, I don't think it requires coaching of any sort. There's so much material available online (YouTube videos for tips and tricks) and books you can order from e-commerce websites, that self preparation is the way to go. You can pick up books online from authors like Nishit K Sinha, R.S Agarwal, and Arun Sharma which will be more than enough to prepare for MBA entrance exams like CET and CAT. Most classes are not sitting every year and revising books to suit the changing exam pattern. Claims are mostly bogus. You can surely invest in some good mock series to strengthen your preparation. My suggestion will be to pick at least 2\u20133 mock series, so that you get to practice a variety of questions. You can choose from reputed brands and also from a small portal like mine (MockSpace), to be well prepared as far as taking fresh Mocks is concerned. You can leave a comment or direct message me for more details. All the best! ",
