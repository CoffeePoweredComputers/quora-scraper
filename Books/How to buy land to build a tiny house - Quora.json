            "answer_text": "Heads up: I build things. I don\u2019t apply for, process or have any actual legal advice regarding permits in my own area, never mind yours. Take what I say as a layman\u2019s advice, not legal counsel. In short: Very carefully and with a long, detailed paper trail from the proper authorities. The long answer: With any building, you will have to do a lot of work before you get to do a lot of work. There\u2019s permits, approvals and then of course neighbors. You see, a lot of areas will have a number of requirements regarding infill lots or new developments. Things from a minimum/maximum square-footage, building envelope choices and distance from the curb (simple things) to other, less clear cut rules about keeping to a particular atmosphere in the neighborhood. You will want to consult with the appropriate authorities on acquiring a piece of land, ensuring that they will run service lines to such a small building and all of the basics like with any dwelling. You will also need to ensure that your proposed blueprint is compliant with any requirements for building/renovating in the area. This will be a tricky one as many things about a \u201ctiny house\u201d will be brought into question at this point: Legal sized windows, entrances (where I live, a house must include at least two exterior doors on the ground floor or access the ground via permanent stairs) and minimum sized rooms (What legally constitutes a bedroom here is defined in square footage, window and closet space) may limit your choices or force you to make changes to your plans. Once all of the regulatory red-tape is cleared with the appropriate municipal authorities, you will want to check with 2 other groups as well. The first is finding an insurance broker who would insure the building. Given that it is not a typical dwelling that they have a clear-set policy on insuring, some places may not want to insure the building based on not having a precedent to follow. Others may be worried about the size being a factor in the event of an emergency. A tree branch crashing into the roof of a 1200 sq ft bungalow is a much different amount of damage relevant to the size of the building than to a tiny house. Home insurance is incredibly important, and oftentimes a necessity depending on the locale and how you finance the build. Last, before any purchase is made or a design is committed to, talk to the Homeowners Associate, nearby Condo Boards, the Community Association etc. These people will be your friends and neighbors should you build in their community. You want to start off on the right foot. Meet with them, consult with them on whether this style of building would fit in the neighborhood. Your house directly affects the property value of nearby homes. Some areas may actively contest the approval of the permit if this is the case. This can result in a delay in the build or the denial of a permit, which best cause sours neighborly relations and worst case, stops your plans dead. Basically, the steps to acquiring land would be the exact same as if you were building a regular dwelling with the added caveat of compliance to building code, zoning and public opinion of it on top. If you take one sentence from this essay of an answer, make it this: Get everything in writing from someone with the authority to back their signature up on the matter and don\u2019t ruffle feathers along the way as pissing off the neighborhood by building an out of place dwelling is a poor way to start living there whether you get approved or not.

            "answer_text": "Contrary to what others say you cannot just buy a piece of land and drop a tiny home on it. There are rules, regulations and zoning bylaws amongst other things. Much of the confusion from one municipality to another relates to the following four items (at a high level) Concern of decreased property value in the area (decreasing property tax revenue)Confused about how to classify them (Are they RVs, mobile homes, backyard cottages, or something completely different?)Mobility - if built on a foundation they would adhere to local building and zoning regulations however, if moved regularly, it can be hard to determine what set of zoning and regulations requirements they have to follow.The size makes it difficult to adhere to common building standards and regulationsThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has a unique term called temporary urbanism. The basic idea is that there are several downtrodden urban properties that are abandoned and in disuse. These areas generally have a higher economic cost of tearing down or renovating. City officials often lease out these areas for community gardens, pop-up stores, restaurants, wheels, and farmers markets. You could potentially sub-lease a small area in an urban area for your tiny home on wheels and get a free place to stay while also participating in improving downtrodden urban areas. Another option you have is building at ADU (accessory dwelling units) on a friends property. These are common extensions on properties today that could commonly include \u201cGranny Suites\u201d, guest houses, etc. Helpful Links Tiny House Zoning and Regulations: What You Need to Know What it's like to build and live in a $24,000 Tiny Home How to Finance a Tiny Home 5 Prefab Tiny Homes under $75,000         ",
