            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t, you sit down and ask yourself what movie or sitcom you watched that made you think of doing that and then crunch the numbers on that hypothetical bookstore coffee shop. You\u2019ll see quite quickly that it\u2019s usually a non starter If you insist I\u2019d suggest finding some place with reasonable rent\u2026put an ad in the paper looking for free books. I\u2019m sure we can find you some coffee makers and maybe your friends can bake some snacks. That seems to be what most of the vogue quaint coffee shops are now. Make sure you find some old stop signs and weird weathered fence posts and stuff to hang on the walls. Definitely need some chalk boards so you can draw bright colorful pictures describing your various specials. Toughest part will be getting your first shipment of over priced coffee (make sure it\u2019s fair trade or the hippies and pretentious people won\u2019t drink it, and they\u2019ll be 99% of your customer base). You\u2019ll have to have at least 5 different kinds. Make sure one is recognizable and the rest HAVE to be strange. No one is going to buy your books but they\u2019ll expect to read them. Make sure you have a million tables because you\u2019re going to be swamped with all the people that watched that show you watched but didn\u2019t actually open a bookstore coffee shop. They\u2019re going to bring their laptops and wireless over the ear headphones and take up an entire table for about 4 hours every morning/afternoon. They\u2019ll only buy a cup of coffee and then just water. Make sure your wi-fi doesn\u2019t suck, they\u2019re always bitching about that in the movies/tv coffee shops. Make sure you have a bunch of couches and stuff. Make sure you hire one spacey but cute girl who dresses like Harley Quinn and Martha Stewart had a love child. She\u2019s the one that keeps the awkward guys with the long hair, trench coats and gloves with the fingers cut off them coming in every day for the most expensive cool coffee you sell. This is the only dependable income you\u2019ll have but it will be steady and hopefully enough to keep the lights on. Oh yeah\u2026make sure you have honey and stevia as options for sweeteners. ",
