            "answer_text": "There are hundreds of Hindu holy books. You need to read a low level introductory book that nevertheless gives a decent overview of Hinduism. Otherwise you will have difficulty in understanding Hindu scriptures. Books like 'The Hindu mind' by Bansi Pandit and 'The complete Idiot's guide to Hinduism' by Linda Johnsen would help.  Another introductory text is 'A primer of Hinduism' by D. S. Sharma. A good text is 'Essentials of Hinduism' by Swami Bhaskarananda. A good survey of Hindu scriptures is 'Windows into the Infinite A guide to the Hindu scriptures' by Barbara Powell. You can then read some of the seminal texts of Hinduism like the Gita, the Upanishads and if you are really interested in the Brahma Sutra. You can read the Gita translated by Swami Tapasyananda. If you want to go really deep into it then commentaries of Sankara on the Gita, the Upanishads and the Brahma Sutra are a must. You can read Srimad Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of Sri Sankaracharya translated by Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier. You can also read BrahmaSutra Bhasya of Sri Sankaracharya translated by Swami Gambhirananda. Reading the translations of Upanishads by Swami Nikhilananda and Swami Gambhirananda will also be helpful. You will find many Hindu seminal texts on this online site:  \nt.co\nhttp://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/   You can then read the 9 volume Vivekananda's complete works if you have the time for it.  If not, then I recommend 'What religion is in the words of Swami Vivekananda' edited by Swami Vidyatmananda. You can also read Patanjali's Yoga Sutra. If you have the time for it then go through the entire Mahabharata which is full of gems. You can try  reading K. M. Ganguli's translation of the Mahabharata. You can also read the translation of the most popular Purana  'Srimad Bhagavataam' by Swami Tapasyananda. Till now you have gained theoretical knowledge. If you have the time then go through the Ramakrishna Kathamrita (translated as the 'The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna) to read about an exemplar of the Hindu tradition. You will get most of these books from Books on Vedanta Philosophy or from Amazon. ",
