            "answer_text": "With each page turn as you read on any Kindle device or app, the Kindle uploads per-book location information to your account, including the FPR (Furthest Page Read), and the MRPR (Most Recent Page Read). (Note that these are not literal pages, but Kindle positions, which are related to Kindle locations. Your e-book doesn\u2019t need real page numbers for this to work.) When you are reading a novel from beginning to end, these end up being the same location, but if you skip back to review a previous chapter, or are using a reference book, then the MRPR is often what you intend when you consider the \u201clast\u201d page read. When you close the book on one device and open it on another, this new device will likely not be at the same location in the book. But the Kindle consults Amazon for this per-book information in your account, and then prompts you to go to your MRPR. In some cases, you don\u2019t care about where you skipped back to, and you truly want the FPR. In that case, choose \u201cSync to Furthest Page Read\u201d from the Kindle\u2019s menu. This consults the FPR from your account, moves your reading location to that point, and (incidentally) updates your MRPR as well. ",
