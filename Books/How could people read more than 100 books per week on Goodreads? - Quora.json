            "answer_text": "It would depend on how you categorize books, now wouldn't it? For the sake of argument, lets say that books are of three size groups, a normal bell curve. Small ones (<50,000 words) Medium books (50k<x<100k) and large books (100k<x). Now, remember that large books can go huge: The longest english novel, Clarissa is 900k words. Since you're talking about goodreads, I assume you refer only to novels and other forms of light reading, and not something scholarly or scientific. a hundred books can be classified approximately as 35, 50, 15 of these for good measure, I guess. It could be 100, 0 ,0, in which case you have your answer already. But lets keep going with this line of thought. For small books, let's average the length of books at 30k words. For medium, at 80k, the length of a full novel, and finally for long books, around 240k words. That's long. That's also why I gave it only 15%. So calculate the number of words: 30,000*35+50*80,000+15*240,000,which comes to 8650000 words. 8650k words. That's pretty long.Now, I assume for this goal, people are willing to read for fifteen hours a day. Therefore, the total number of minutes of reading comes to:15*7*60 = 6300 minutes. So what's the reading speed we need to accomplish this goal? speed= 8650000/6300= 1373 words per minute. Now I'd like to point out that though this is an insanely difficult speed to keep up for hours together, especially with good comprehension, its not impossible. There have been people with reading speeds upto 5000 words per minute and more. So, that's how you read a hundred books in a week. ",

The answer does not depend \u201con how you categorize books,\u201d because there are actual books that are selected as read by the readers in question. Are they all selecting short stories (sometimes listed separately)? No. They are mostly listing novels. These people simply go on good reads and mark as read basically everything. I\u2019d say a such person wants to appear smart and accomplished, but claiming to have read thousands of books, ranging from the extremely difficult and obscure to borderline smut, is too ridiculous to be worth lying about. So I\u2019m guessing these people are really bored at work. ",

I can only postulate from my own personal experiences with someone that made high reading claims because I can't pretend to know actualities of people on Goodreads. My late brother, who was a literal genius with a few degrees, counted everything he read as a book. Pamphlets, owner manuals, everything\u2026 That could be the case for others making seemingly impossible claims. It could also be imaginative braggadocio seeking praise. ",

I know many will add books when they start using Goodreads and I use Goodreads to pick books, review and track what I\u2019ve read. However, I suspect some people are using the tool to manage their inventory in stores (online or otherwise), to influence buyers and sellers, or get some kind of award or recognition. I just asked the top user \u2018why\u2019 and was virtually shouted down (for over a paragraph) that it wasn\u2019t my business. I am still curious. If it was just one user I\u2019d chalk it off to someone who has some kind of inferiority complex. I\u2019m not looking to get anyone in trouble, knocked off or otherwise; sincerely just curious. ",

However for many people, you are trying to put a lifetime of reading in one place over a short time.

I still have 500 to 600 books on my shelves that aren\u2019t posted because I haven\u2019t reread them. If I were to count the library and borrowed books I have read over 50 years I would have thousands more to post. ",
