            "answer_text": "No! Superman powers or the powers of any kryptonian are linked to a unknown factor. Initially it was said it was because the kryptonian race had genetically engineered themselves to be superhuman in all aspects. Then it was said that Kryptonians possessed a far more complex DNA than human DNA. The last explanation was that Kryptonians possess certain unique exotic elements in their bodies atomic composition. And that it's this that in proximity to our star that gives them their powers. This as been shown many times. Most recently in the Earth-2 comic, their new Earth orbited two stars. Red and Yellow. And although the Earth received sunlight from both stars, when the red star was closest kryptonians would lose all of their powers, but when the yellow sun was closest then they would regain their powers. So it isn't as much sunlight but more the star closest to them. It's like kryptonians physiology allows them to draw energy directly from the stars. Another example of this was in the Justice League, Suicide Squad, crossover. General Zod that was being kept imprisoned and depowered because his cell had red solar energy emitters. But the moment the facility started losing power to some levels, including Zod's cell. Then they started to freak out because Zod was regaining his powers, although he was several feet underground and with no sunlight available. We humans wouldn't gain any powers no matter the star. We could go to solar system with a Blue Star and that would still not give humans any sort of powers. I guess in order for humans to gain something resembling powers because of the star would have to be because of these two scenarios: We used genetic engineering to upgrade our genetic code. Make it more efficient. But of course in order to do that we'd need to decode it first.We would send humans to let's say a colony on Mercury or one of Jupiter's moons. That colony would have a full radiation shielding in some areas and a weak shielding in others. We'd then use a kind of genetic accelerante. And humans expose themselves to what would be lethal doses of radiation. On Mercury we'd get that radiation directly from the Sun. On Jupiter, its immense magnetosphere would be enough to basically have the same effect as being on Mercury.These are the only reasonable but still dangerous ways to maybe gain something superhuman out of it. And I say dangerous because in both cases (more the radiation plus accelerante scenario than the genetic engineering) the effects could be unforeseeable. Humans might gain something but lose something else. It's almost like the movie The Fly. One small mistake, one that got a human DNA combined with that of a fly, produced a monster that in end had nothing human in him. ",

            "answer_text": "If Superman gets his powers from a yellow sun, would humans get powers from a red sun? If I recall properly, in the 60\u2019s when Superman stories were throwing anything and everything at the wall to see what would stick, there was a story of humans going to a planet with lower gravity than Earth under a blue sun where they gained Superman\u2019s powers. The idea was that a red sun, being red due to being cooler than a yellow star, put out less of whatever energy gives Supes his abilities, so a blue star, being higher on the energy output scale would work the same way for humans from Earth. I have no idea if this was ever picked up in any of the later revisions and retcons. ",
