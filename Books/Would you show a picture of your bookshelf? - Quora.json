Some books stand for years, some come and go in days. Some books are in their original covers-some I have bound myself. Some are protected with plastic wrappers- these contain some nice pictures/paintings. Where the covers are plain, I paste a nice picture. But friend- don\u2019t ask how they look. Hear what they say! Some hold dreams, some hope; some contain ideas, some inspiration. They tell you that it takes all sorts to make the world. The world is a B-I-G place. The universe of books is endless. My shelf is a tiny window! They are our dear friends- never let you down. They always teach you to strive to seek to find and not to yield. Life of study and reflection- that is the world of man. Scorn delights and live laborious days- this is what the book shelf teaches you- no matter how it looks! ",
