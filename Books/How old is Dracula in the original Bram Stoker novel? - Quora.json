            "answer_text": "We are never told exactly how old Dracula is, but we can make an educated guess. If Dracula is in fact Vlad Dracul \u201cthe Impaler\u201d, as is suggested by references he makes to his past, then he was born between 1428 and 1431. The book takes place in the 1890s. Let\u2019s go with the publication date of 1897 as when it actually happens. That makes Dracula between 469 and 466 years old. If you mean how long has he been a vampire, if we assume his actual death date is when he became a vampire, then Vlad the Impaler died in 1476/77. He was in his late 40s at that point, somewhere between 45 and 49 depending on which dates you use. He has been a vampire for about 420 years when the book starts. ",

            "answer_text": "I read the book recently and there was a passage saying that Dracula \u201ctalked about the history of his land like he was there!\u201d which is what Jonathan Harker wrote in his journal when he was at Castle Dracula. The oldest of the time periods that Dracula talked about was Attila the Hun which was all the way back in late Roman Empire time period. This makes it quite possible that Dracula had in fact lived much longer than Vlad impaler himself and only took the name Dracula later on in his life. Dracula could in fact have lived from 434ad - 1897ad, this could make him 1463 years old. ",
