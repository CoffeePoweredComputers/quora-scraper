            "answer_text": "A2A. You must know that Devi (Maa Durga) is the Supreme Adi Shakti,i.e.,Nirguna Parabrahman. She\u2019s Parameshwari, Bhuvaneshwari, Maheshwari, Mahadevi and the One Who is the primordial Creatrix of the entire universe. As Shaguna, She manifests Herself in Her 3 main Gunas:- Rajasik - MahalakshmiSattvik - MahasawaraswatiTamasik- Mahakali. From Srimad Devi Bhagavatam, Book 3, Ch.6 :- 14-27. O Brahm\u00e2! I am Gaur\u00ee, Br\u00e2hm\u00ee, Raudr\u00ee, V\u00e2r\u00e2h\u00ee, Vaisnav\u00ee, S\u2019iva, V\u00e2runi, Kauver\u00ee, N\u00e2ra Sinh\u00ee, and V\u00e2sav\u00ee S'aktis. I enter in every substance, in everything of the nature of effect. Making that Purusa the instrument, I do all the actions (rather Purusa is the efficient cause, the immediate agent). a) Devi to Lord Bahma O Brahm\u00e2! Now you better go to your respective places, and after creating the Universe, remain there and perform your respective functions ordained by Pr\u00e2rabdha. Take this beautiful great S\u2019akti Mah\u00e2 Sarasvat\u00ee, full of Rajoguna, and of a smiling nature. This S'akti, wearing white clothes, adorned with divine ornaments and sitting on Var\u00e2sana, will always be your playmate. This beautiful woman will always be your boon companion; consider Her as My bibhuti (manifestation of power), and so most worshipful. Never show any sort of disrespect towards Her. Take Her and go immediately to Satyaloka; and from the seed of Mahattattva, create the fourfold beings from these. b) Devi to Lord Vishnu Thus saying to me, Bhagavat\u00ee smiled and began to say to Visnu :-- O Visnu! Take this beautiful Mah\u00e2 Laks'm\u00ee and go. She will always reside within your breast; there is no doubt in this. This all auspicious giving S\u2019akti I give to you for your enjoyment. You should always showed respect to Her; never show hatred or contempt. For the good of the world, I unite thus Laks'm\u00ee and N\u00e2r\u00e2yan. For your sustenance I create Yaj\u00f1a. You three will act together in harmony unanimously. You, Brahm\u00e2 and S\u2019iva are my three Devas, born of my Gunas. You three will undoubtedly be respected and worshipped by the world. c) Devi to Lord Shiva Brahm\u00e2 said :-- Saying thus to V\u00e2sudeva, that Higher Prakriti Dev\u00ee who is all of the three Gunas and yet transcending them, began to address Mah\u00e2 Deva, the Deva of the Devas, in sweet words, thus :-- O Sankara! Accept this beautiful Mah\u00e2 K\u00e2l\u00ee Gaur\u00ee, build a new Kail\u00e0s'a city and live there happily. Your primary Gunas will be Tamas; Sattva and Rajas will be your secondary Gunas. Have recourse to Rajo and Tamo Gunas while you slay the Asuras and thus wander. Brahm\u00e2 said :-- Bhagavat\u00ee Durg\u00e2 gave us S\u2019aktis, full of Divine beauty and lustre; She gave Mah\u00e2 Laksm\u00ee to Visnu, Mah\u00e2 K\u00e2li to S\u2019iva, and Mah\u00e2 Sarasvat\u00ee to me and bade good bye to us.  So since all the devas and devis are but the manifestations of the Supreme Mother Bhagavati Durga, technically they are all Her children. If She withdraws Her Shakti from Hara, Shiva becomes Shava (corpse). If She leaves Vishnu, Hari falls in Yoga Nidra from which He cannot wake up. According to the first 84 names of the first 34 slokas of Lalitha Sahasra Nama from Brahmanda Puran, when the evil Bhandasura, born out of the ashes of Manmatha, made the world impotent, he devas sought the advice of Sage Narada and Trimurti, who advised them to seek the help of Nirguna Brahman, Sat-Chit-Ananada (Truth-Consciousness-Bliss). Nirguna Brahman took the shape of Maha Sambhu and Adi Parasakthi and appeared before them. Maha Sambhu and Adi Parasakthi then took the the form of Maha Kameswara and Lalita Tripura Sundari for the benefit of the universe. For this a maha yajna is made where the entire creation i.e. manifest universe is offered as the oblation and from the fire rose Maha Sambhu and Adi Parasakthi as Lalitha Tripura Sundari (Chid-Agnikunda-Sambhuta - She who arose from the great Yajna) ) and Kameswara. Lalitha Tripura Sundari and Kameswara re-created the entire universe as it was before. Lalitha Tripura Sundari then created Brahma and Lakshmi, Vishnu and Parvati, Shiva and Sarswati. Saraswati and Lakshmi can be seen fanning Tripura Sundari Devi seated on Panchapretasan.  Shrichakra Raja nilaya, Shri Lalitha Devi, the divine mother Sachaamara Rama Vaani Savya Dakshina sevitha.Rama (Lakshmi) and Vaani (Saraswathi) are said to do her seva with chamara (fans). sashara chaapa paasha ankushaamThe two weapons in her upper right and left hands are to cut the worldly desires in out heart and bring us to her feet. The weapon in the lower right hand is the ankusha which is used to poke us and remind us to come back to her feet, like a mahout pokes the elephant and teaches it discipline. The sugarcane in her lower left hand is not exactly a sugar can but is a bow made of sugar cane. This was manmadha's bow before he died. The bow is made of sugarcane, its string from bees and the arrows made from flowers (pushpa baana) used to shoot at people to make them fall in love to continue the population. After manmadha's death, mother took it into her hands and became Shri Kameshwari. Pancha Brahma asana sthitha/ Pancha Prethasanaseena Pancha Brahma SwaroopiniThe 5 brahmas sitting at her feet are actually the legs of her throne and these 5 brahmas are Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Ishwara and Sadashiva. These five become inert and corpse like without Devi\u2019s Shakti. Kumara Gana naadha AmbaThe two sitting at her feet in the front are her sons Kumara and Ganesha. Lalitha Tripura Sundari = The Ultimate Divine Mother Durga. So you see, everything falls in place. Jai Maa Durga. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. since you are confused, let's proceed logically. I think either of the logics is incorrect. Brahma was unable to create the world, because he was trying asexual reproduction. Then, he started worshipping bhagwan ardhnaarishwar (shiva). This made shiva happy and for the welfare of the shrishtii, he divided himself into nar & naari (shiva and prakriti). Prakriti became formless and spread everywhere. And then came mata saraswati. She is a part of prakriti. Prakriti divided herself into 3 parts. Shakti, laxmi and saraswati.Now, when people read these things, some of them conclude that saraswati is brahma's creation, some say that she is the daughter of shiva and shakti, and again, our culture gives us freedom to worship and believe the God in the way we want. So, since she was a part of prakriti, she can be considered the daughter of shiva\u2026 And since brahma meditated for her creation, brahma can be thought of as her creator. It is whole up to you.Another thing: the three goddesses are the part of trinity (tridevi). So, it is little awkward to say that one of them is the daughter of the other. Thank you. ",
