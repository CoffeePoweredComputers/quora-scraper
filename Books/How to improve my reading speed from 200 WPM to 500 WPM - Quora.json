            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A @Jitesh Chaudhary . Improving your reading speed just takes some practice. These tips could help. Don't bother yourself with comprehension. Comprehensive reading takes longer and you need to focus on the meaning of the words. If you're aiming for just speed, understanding is secondary.Start with books that have easier content and shorter, more common words. Don't dive into stuff on philosophy, because those words there? They're long. Very long. Not to mention tongue-twisty. Whew.You can listen to rap before you begin reading. Hah. Just kidding. But I'm pretty sure that won't hurt. It might motivate you better than an ancient opera.Practise, Practise, Practise.An improvement to 500 WPM from 200 WPM is a big deal. Don't worry if you can't achieve it immediately. It will take time. ",

When your vocabulary will increase and your ability to see more words in a glance increase, you'll read faster than you do now. 500 wpm is not impossible but it will take a lot of reading to achieve that. Be determined. Hope you'll succeed. Good luck ",
