            "answer_text": "Definiteness of vision. When you have a clear and unshakable vision for something articulation becomes inevitable. The longer you think about the SAME subject year after year, the more analogies you come up with, the more conversations you have on that ONE subject. If you are talking to your friends about politics, computers, science, Greenpeace and global warming, you are not going to be articulate. If you focus on one very specific topic, the philosophy of Hegel, the literature of Hugo, civil rights for blacks, eventually you will become the world's greatest articulator of that thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Malcolm did not have a formal education. In his earlier years he ran the streets, got himself in some big trouble and was sent to prison. He had a half sister who he was close with, and she had enough influence to have him sent to a coosh, minimum security prison that had a library that was in his own words, better than any library he had ever been in on the outside. He read from the time the lights went on till lights out. Every day. For years. He used his time in prison to forge the man he would become when he walked out. He went in a broken down street hustler, and came out a deeply articulate man with enough knowledge and intelligence to accomplish the things he did in his tragically short life ",
