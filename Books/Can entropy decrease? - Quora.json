            "answer_text": "Yes entropy can decrease. But it is only true when we talk about system. Entropy of universe is continuously increasing and can never decrease. If entropy of a system decrease, than entropy of surrounding must increase and magnitude of increase in entropy of surrounding must be greater than magnitude of decrease in entropy of system, so that net entropy of universe increases.

But the total entropy of the universe can never decrease. This is stated by the Entropy Principle. If the entropy of the system decreases, the entropy of the surrounding always increases by a greater value, thus making the entropy of the universe positive. ",

It's always increasing.A better example is: If anything is brought in solid state from liquid or gaseous state, the randomness of it's particles decreases resulting in the decrease of entropy. It simple means that if you can decrease the randomness of particles of a SYSTEM, the entropy of the SYSTEM may decrease. ",
