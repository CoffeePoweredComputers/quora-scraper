            "answer_text": "Well no, of course not, by definition. \u201cThe spectrum\u201d is entirely off the \u201cNeurotypical\u201d portion of the map. However, you could be on the spectrum and not be neurotypical\u2026 you could be mistaken about being NT. Being drawn to people on the spectrum, however, is a trait found in many NT people. Possibly more so than among ASD people. Understanding people, even ones quite different from yourself, is a trait found in many NT people. Certainly more so than among ASD people. It is very common for people on the spectrum to have a \u201cpoor theory of mind\u201d which makes it very difficult to understand what people are thinking and how they think. It is very common for NT people to have a good theory of mind, in fact, \u201cPTOM\u201d is quite rare among them\u2026 if someone has it, they many not be on the Spectrum but are probably non-NT in some other way. What prevents most NT from understanding ASD folks is a lack of familiarity and a tendency to generalize and make stereotypes. If you\u2019re drawn to people on the spectrum and have become close to several (something unusual since only about 1 in 20 people ARE on the spectrum) then you\u2019ve probably overcome those barriers. But it is possible that instead you\u2019re someone who is drawn to people who are more like themselves, and who better understand people who happen to think more like they do themselves. So this doesn\u2019t rule your hypothesis out. But the items listed in your question are by no means sufficient to do anything more than suggest this as one possible explanation, and not a high probability one.  If you want to take the word of someone with PTOM that is. ",

            "answer_text": "If you actually understand us? Definitely. While historically autistic minds have had a fairly decent understanding of neurotypical ones, vice versa isn\u2019t true. The neurotypical mindset is absurdly hyperfocused upon only surface level features with no depth beyond that to speak of, this is why neurotypicals can get on the nerves of actually autistic people. I\u2019ll explain. Autistic Person: \u201cThese neurotypicals are so loud and they gesticulate like rappers in heat, so I can\u2019t talk to them as being overloaded makes me nonverbal.\u201d Neurotypical: \u201cSo you see, ALL autistic people are COMPLETELY lacking in social skills and the desire to socialise. None of them CAN socialise even, with anyine\u2026 EVER! How horrible! Let\u2019s cure them with deadly fecal transplants so they\u2019ll be more like us! After all, we\u2019re HEALTHY!\u201d Autistic Person: \u201cI\u2019m feeling too much. I need to get out of here so I can introspectively process my emotions. Stupid empathy. Neurotypicals have it easy, they slap their hand over their mouth then they\u2019ve forgotten about anything sad within ten minutes unless you remind them of it. They don\u2019t have to process or deal with the hell of extreme empathy. The feelings can be so overwhelming sometimes that they\u2019re painful and debilitating. Especially guilt.\u201d Neurotypical: \u201cHey! That person didn\u2019t slap their hand over their mouth to gesticulate their face! Now they\u2019re just leaving! Because they aren\u2019t like me this must mean they\u2019re autistic, and that they lack Theory of Mind and empathy!\u201d Autistic Person: \u201cThe \u2018cure\u2019 for autism is for neurotypicals to get their heads out of their very shallow bums and try to understand that we just function differently than they do, and that we have different needs. It would be nice if neurotypicals could tone down their volume and gesticulate less when interacting with us.\u201d Neurotypical: \u201cThe best \u2018CURE\u2019 for autism is electric shock treatment more PAINFUL than what they allow to be used on prisoners of war in Guantanamo Bay! Ship them ALL off to the Judge Rotenberg Center! That\u2019ll FIX them! It would be so NICE if autistic people could be assimilated to be JUST like us instead of\u2026 being so DIFFERENT and weird.\u201d And so on\u2026 I mean, just look at the studies of Simon Baron-Cohen to realise how true this all is. Neurotypicals are genetically predisposed to fetishise and obsessively seek out verisimilitude. In general, autistic people can be far more accepting of differences. It might be the combination of empathy and open-mindedness but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a bigoted actually autistic person. If you do, you\u2019ve found a misdiagnosed sociopath. This is depressingly common despite how they\u2019re essentially our polar opposites. An autistic person will be quiet, introspective, empathetic, observant, and strangely wise beyond their years. Having known a lot of autistic people I know how true this is. But for neurotypicals we\u2019ll always be \u201clower-functioning,\u201d antisocial troglodytes because we can\u2019t deal with how they overload us and they don\u2019t understand why we shut down. A neurotypical that really understands autistic people is a highly improbable factor, were that true then we\u2019d have seen one in the relevant scientific fields by now. I\u2019m happy to tell you that if you do indeed truly understand actually autistic people then you have some measure of autism yourself. ",
