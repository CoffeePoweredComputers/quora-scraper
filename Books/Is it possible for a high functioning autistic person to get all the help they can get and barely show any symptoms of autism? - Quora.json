            "answer_text": "Yes. Autism is a spectrum condition. Everyone is affected differently. We all struggle in some area or another, but some of us struggle more than others. One reason for this is that some of us are more capable of masking than others so our autism looks less intense to others. However, we are having to work extremely hard to mask and it is exhausting for us. Just because it appears less problematic to others, does not mean it is easier for us. Another reason is that we are highly sensitive and tend to have specific needs that others might not because of this increased sensitivity. This means we may require very precise environments to thrive in. If we are exposed to the right environments, we're less likely to feel sensory discomfort that contributes to some of the outward behaviours of autism. So we have to be careful when talking about \u2018high functioning\u2019 autism, because it can be very demoralising for the person and dismiss the effort required to be able to function at that level. \u2018High functioning\u2019 can be more disabled than what people might think, just as \u2018low functioning\u2019 are more capable than what people might think. We're very quick to make assumptions as humans. Autism itself relates to how the brain processes information differently from the majority. The outward behaviours are just expressions and coping mechanisms. We use these behaviours to measure and diagnose autism, but they are in fact separate from autism. We can mask how we respond to a particular neurological function, but we cannot mask the function itself and nobody else can see that function because we cannot climb inside another person's brain.

            "answer_text": "There is by far better! There is only a small overlap between DSM-5 HF Autism (has an upper limit, no lower limit)andAsperger\u2019s! (has no upper limit, LF lower limit of selfsufficient)The research team of the pedagogic kinder clinic founded 1910 at the university clinic in Vienna stretched the definition of Asperger\u2019s as deep as they could into LF to protect as many kids as possible from the NAZI dictate of Eugenics. Before that Aspies were \u201cLittle Professors!\u201d much loved at the clinic \ud83d\udc97 To put a spanner in the NAZI-works they went out on a risky limb by stating something like: \u201cIt is predictable for \u2018Asperger\u2019s\u2019 cases that they will be fully self-relying even very valuable members of society after the end of puberty, given specific support they need until then!\u201d NAZIs could not kill potentially valuable members of German society ! The Name \u2018Asperger\u2019s\u2019 was only attached to the condition of the kids sometime after 1980. During the war a long name consisting of big science words was still in place. The trick was to rely upon the war to be over, the NAZIs gone by the time their prediction can be proven wrong. They were right!The war was over soon! But critical in answer to your question: The prediction reaching often well over a decade into the future that \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u2019 cases will be fully self-relying even very valuable members of society after the end of puberty, given specific support they need until then!\u201d Turned out to be true too! The researchers were not surprised - but the rest of the world still is. At the time finding proper scientific proof for example for: \u201cstrict stress reduction will improve the condition!\u201d Is even today still elusive. That better didactic methods are critical to all kids is considered as proven fact all around continental Europe since the amazing efforts of Pestalozzi around 1800. When it comes to nutrition, microbes and the genes in metabolic processes as well as brain structure and more synapses in Autistic brains a flood of perfectly solid scientific proof happend since the mid 1940s. The concept of \u2018neurodiversity\u2019 was born and put into a descriptive German phrase already at the time. That is turning more and more what was borderline \u2018Science Fiction\u2019 at the time into truly helpful knowledge and very applicable means today. To achieve to show barely any symptoms at all you have to build your own Temple of Wisdom. Autism / Asperger\u2019s vast diversity and all the pertinent science since ~ 1900 are by far too complex. For one or a few cases the \u2018need to know well\u2019 is much reduced but one always gains enough of a helpful insight reaching from just Asperger\u2019s via comorbidities to being very helpful to all NeuroTypical too. With enough of both and well applied barely showing any symptoms gets more into reach day by day. Get started with building a foundation at Neurodivergent. First columns and links as well as emotional armor is at Asperger's Space, it\u2019s built to be a launch-pad. From there you have to venture out into stress reduction, nutrition, toxins, dysbiosis, microbiome and biofilms as needed. Too vast - too unpredictable, its DIY! To get a mind & body building plan look at any pertinent Spaces here on Quora including quite a number of Autism related ones. You will find that there is plenty of good work at hand but no clue whatsoever on all of Quora is possible too sometimes. IT CAN BE DONE! PLEASE TAKE OFF SOON!The sky is NOT the limits. \ud83d\udc97 W  ",
