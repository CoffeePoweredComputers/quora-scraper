            "answer_text": "Thanks to Aurel Kurtula for the A2A. Like the dyes in the colour camera film, memory is fugitive (propensity to fade over time). The fading rate, of course, varies between people. One thing to avoid doing is to be anxious about it. Like most things in life, the more anxious or obsessed we are over something, the more we bungle things up. In short, relax first. The age-old act of making notes generally works and has withstood the test of time for generations. This is why schools make us take notes. Highlighting and annotating also work, depending on the person. Ultimately, good information retention in the mind comes from a relaxed state of mind while reading the material more than any other routines or hacks. The relaxed mind is receptive to stimuli, and the information travelling from the mind's eye into the mind itself is arguably another form of stimulus. One method to help retain maximum practicable amount of information is to recite the material into a voice recorder. This is a favourite for my generation (those who grew up in the 1960s and '70s).

            "answer_text": "Making notes is a good way. But making an \"idea index\" would be even better.Here is how Maria Popova (who is said to read fifteen books per week) does it: As she reads, she creates an index at the front of the book that lists its most interesting ideas.Every time she encounters a passage relevant to one of these ideas she adds the page to the relevant line in the index. If its a new idea, she creates a new line for it.As she reads more, the index grows.This can help you keep track of ideas in different books. Also you will know exactly what to reread if you can't remember the idea. You can read the full article here : Deep Habits: Create an Idea Index ",

I use a kindle and so all the notes and highlights are then located in a text file within the kindle. I then structure the notes in different text files adding them to Devonthink.  All these notes can be tagged.  The more notes you add the better the application gets. The you just search for what note you want to find and you get it. But of course it visually joins notes together. Basically a very very clever search engine for your notes.  Here you can also add electronic books, and so you can search them also. ",
