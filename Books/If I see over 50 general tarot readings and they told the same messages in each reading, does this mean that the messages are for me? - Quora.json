            "answer_text": "General readings are \u201cgeneric\u201d and mostly play with human psychology. Firstly its not advisable to consult or check with 50 tarot readers. Please understand tarots are energy based, and you pick on the same vibrations. The instored subconscious mind gets manipulated and you start manifesting what might not be true to your situation often leading to false hopes, and heartbreak and what looks like you are connecting to the reader might actually mislead you. Rather than going to 50, kindly consult 1 and take a personal reading as deemed fit. ",
