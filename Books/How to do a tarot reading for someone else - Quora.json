            "answer_text": "By simple guesswork! Believe it or not: The result of one question is always 100% correct or wrong, the more questions the more the percentage security decreases or increases because: As a clever person once said: It's hard to predict anything, especially about the future! The fortune teller, the medium, the psychic, the Tarot reader, etc, etc, is very skilled people, who catch instinctively and with great skill the client's signals, through all the small-talk that occurs within the actual seance, where the \"reader\" with special words and phrases has enticed the client to say what \"the reader\" \"need to know about what the client wants for the seance. Think above this: If anyone was able to predict anything at all, the psycics, the fortune tellers, etc.. would of course bet on betting, and get very rich, instead of living on the relatively small amounts from the clients. If the client ask to money or death: Is the explanation generally: The spirits we contacts, always refuses to accept that I/we ask questions about money and death. - - - But note: The somewhat strange result of a prediction said by a clairvoyant, or an astrologer, is incredible often, that a client, now more or less subconsciously, focuses all her/his energy on the prediction to come true. - - - The above as well as coincidences are the main reasons why people believe in predictions!

            "answer_text": "First you must develop a relationship with the Tarot and its archetypal language by reading for yourself. I recommend dong a daily card reading with journaling to build a relationship with the practice and the Tarot itself. Once you feel some confidence in your understanding of each card, you can venture into 3 card spreads for yourself and from there to more complex spreads. Somewhere in your journey with doing spreads for yourself, you will probably feel able to do readings as a gift for close friends and family. This is one way of getting practice reading for others. Eventually, if you have an honest relationship with the practice of Tarot, i.e. you continue to develop your understanding of each card, how the cards relate with one another and the archetypal journey the cards can reveal for a person asking questions, you will be able to read for people you don\u2019t know personally. This process will take years and dedicated study. If you are serious about developing your Tarot reading skills you can study with me privately or you can join a reputable Tarot online community. I recommend Biddy Tarot. PM me if you are interested in private study. ",
