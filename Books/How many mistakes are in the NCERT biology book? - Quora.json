            "answer_text": "You wouldn't call them mistakes but actually a little inaccurate content since they have to make the readers understand with minimal words. For example, in the chapter of Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants (in 12 standard NCERT Biology), NCERT says that in a tetrasporangiate anther, there are 2 thecae(lobes) and each theca contains one microsporangium. So, a tetrasporangiate anther contains 2 microsparangia in total. But actually, in a tetrasporangiate anther, there are 2 thecae and each contains two microsparangia. So, actually, a tetrasporangiate anther contains 4 microsparangia in total. Hope you understood.  Cheers !! ",
