            "answer_text": "Work hard and play hard. Firstly millionaires are not made over night, it takes years if not decades, but you must have that drive and passion to want to work hard to become a millionaire. Secondly education is key, if you want to work your way to the millionaire status you need a job that can get you there, and for this you need a college degree. Lastly seriously work hard, and make the right decisions, money doesn't stick to people who waste it, you will never see self made rich people throwing money because they can, because they have seen the life without money. Good luck! ",

People who promise you that you will become rich when you follow their directions (which includes buying their books, worksheets, programs, and so on), are generally speaking not really thinking you are going to be a millionaire (but they sure will be).
