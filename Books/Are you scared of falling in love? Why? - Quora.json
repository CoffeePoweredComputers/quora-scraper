I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019ve ever been truly in love. Sure, I had weak knees and my heart raced before, but to me it looked a lot like fear, and as it turned out, I was right to be afraid. I had a couple of relationships with people I \u201cjust loved\u201d, but wasn\u2019t in love with, some of them went terribly south. I never lied about my feelings but I learned people are very willing to say they can accept your feelings (or lack thereof) just to be close to you, this doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t behave horribly once they feel safe. I was seriously infatuated two, maybe three times. I never told them. They claimed they love me, but I knew this can\u2019t be true: people like them don\u2019t love, not very deep anyway. Or at least that\u2019s what I got from their behavior. I can get easily interested in nice, goodhearted people, and I\u2019m open to relationships with them, but chances are, when my heart starts jumping you\u2019re probably fucked up and dangerous in one way or another. I think I have detected the pattern, and it\u2019s always been like this, so far: I \u201cfell in love\u201d with people who were abused and hadn\u2019t learned to go from survivor to transformer. I stole this from Andrew Vachss with whom I agree on that it isn\u2019t enough to survive. Well it\u2019s a lot better than dying, but there has to be more. It feels like \u201chome\u201d with these people. It feels like we know eachother since a long time. It\u2019s scary, not only because we remember what home was like. And we know we\u2019ll never be safe. Whatever I do, I know there is a monster behind the corner. I won\u2019t let that monster into my bed deliberately. Not until it dresses up in a tutu and sings \u201cYou are so beautiful to me\u201d anyway.  ",

Not in the Hallmark movie way (although, I wouldn\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019ve never watched one) and not in a Disney way. I am a romantic with little patience for schmaltz. I want to be an Arthur Rackham illustration. This one was always one of my favorites\u2026I have a thing for exotic raven-haired beauties. Prophetically, it\u2019s from Bluebeard. Google Image Result for https://www.honeyandwaxbooks.com/pictures/1002135.jpg?v=1534745542 You know the story of Bluebeard,right? The young wife marries a rich man and she is given a set of keys to the house. There is one key she is warned not to use. It is the key to the room in the cellar. She is nearly blinded by curiosity and when her husband leaves, she sneaks down to the cellar and opens the door. The room in the cellar is filled with all of the corpses of the women that came before. Horrified, she slams the door and locks the room. Somehow, magically, there is a bloodstain on the key she can\u2019t rub off. She can\u2019t unsee the horror. The story is not about the villain. It\u2019s about that moment when curiosity becomes a burden. The story is, of course, about more than that. It\u2019s about loss of innocence. We start out so open and free, then life happens. We collect wounds and scars. It can go a few different ways\u2026we can become bitter and wounded, or we get frightened of ugliness. Arthur Rackham illustrations never become bitter. They are noble and good - arcane, fierce, wild and free. They are beautiful. I am a modern person. I live in modern times and modern places that are uglier than I like to imagine. I translate some of that ugliness into my personal mythos. I have experiences I can\u2019t un-live. I think I\u2019ve fallen one time too many. It\u2019s too hard\u2026or maybe it\u2019s not. This last time threw me down, hard. I\u2019m having a hard time getting back up. I want to be that open, lovable ingenue I was. I am the heroine in my own story. We are all heroes and heroines, slightly tragic, in our own imaginations. I try\u2026just not very hard. I\u2019m not an ingenue anymore. That\u2019s why I\u2019m afraid. ",

If one has to learn how to love in the most truthful and beautiful way just see your parents .How they love you and how they sacrifice their happiness for you. All I learned from them is that another word for love is sacrifice .Just to put a smile on your face they can do anything. Most beautiful and pure feeling. When it comes to having someone special in your life after your parents then i would say that we all are having emotional and physical needs .We will definitely need someone at some point in life .But who will be that person. Of course everyone will say that they want to be with someone who they love .But the question is whom do they love . The girl who looks beautiful or the handsome hunk .You know the problem with people now a days is that they love a person on the basis of his/ her looks.I usually ask people why are thay in a relationship with someone\u2026. that is the so called gf and bf relation and are they going to be with that person for the rest their life .Most people don't agree on that and say the reason why they are with person is that their other friends are also in a relationship and they don't want to be single.Just because it has beacome a fashion and show off. This thing scares me , it scares me a lot.Because I believe in love that is not based on someone's appearance. I will definitely fall for a person for what he is and not how he appears .This means i will fall for someone who I know very well may be he will be a friend or a colleague. But the thing that scares me is ,how that person believes love to be .If he doesn't believe love to be my way and fall for me just because I look good ,then this thing scares me . It may seems like I am bragging. But what to do I am an old soul in this new world . Not scared of love \u2026\u2026love is love \u2026..but only if understood properly. Be you\u2764 ",

The heart always wants what it wants. If you truly love someone that true love will never go. You will try to learn to live with that pain, time will lessen the pain though it may never heal completely. You may never be foolish again in love. Second time being in love requires courage. It requires being able to trust again and being vulnerable again. It requires strength to break that wall that you would have built around yourself, your heart. But it is more mature. It is not to replace the true first love. This time around it will be more mature and more understanding. It may or may not happen again, but your heart will learn to live with that pain. First time, it took me a second, to love my mom. Second time, it took me a few seconds, to have a crush. Third time, it took me a few minutes, my crush during third grade of school. Fourth time, it took me few hours, my crush at college. Fifth time, it took me months, My first true love. Got heart broken because it was unrequited, but still loving unconditionally, got my self-respect bruised, lost some so called mutual \u201cfriends\u201d, misunderstood by many, hurt myself, and so on. So finally, it takes forever, to fall in love again. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not about the end but the journey itself. Since there have been so many answers from adults already, I will answer this from my own perspective, a 17 years old teenager. Am I affraid of falling in love? Absolutely not. As a teenager, I believe the best thing that can happen to me is getting into a relationship. I feel wonderful to fall in love with someone. I don\u2019t know why so many people afraid of their end of a relationship but never thought about the journey they got together. I had a girl friend once and you know what, that was the most valuable memory I\u2019ve got. Falling in love taught me many things from that one relationship and whenever I look back, there is not a single place for regret. It will eventually end someday? Screw it. The experiences that a relationship can endure you are far more worthy than the pain you feel when your relationship ends. Yes, it may feel extremely suck for a week or two (maybe a month or even more), by the time you get over it, you will see significant changes in you and your mindset. I\u2019m not afraid of how falling in love can desperate me, I respect every moments that I fall in love. ",

No point in inviting a guest and refusing to open the door, so to speak. Why, because we have doubts and fears from our past because we refuse to leave past behind and recycling the garbage of our past, now allowing the universe to write us a new story. We are also stopping love because of our ego, anger, hurt and who said what, like I was. At the of the day, Love has no room for what said what, pointing fingers, all it is asking for remove all those who this person is and what I am doesn\u2019t matter, stop blocking the heart with pride and arrogance, and the need to be right. All love wants is to love you without the armour and the swords, all stripped bared and vulnerable, so are you prepared to be naked (TW James). ",

            "answer_text": "Because it's terrifying. You are basically handing someone a huge carving knife and asking them not to use it to carve out your heart. Trust is difficult especially if you've been hurt or played before. These days trust is almost impossible the way people have become. As we get older we have all sustained so much damage and hurt at the hands of others that it's almost impossible to trust anyone. When a genuinely nice person treats us properly and with respect, we don't even know how to react or respond. Yeah, it's THAT bad. Plus with this \u201cinstant intimacy\u201d (for lack of a better term because it's NOT intimacy) of unsolicited dick pics (like these fools would do that in real life ha!) and demands for nudes and sex on the first encounter or there's something wrong with you or your a prude if you don't, it's almost impossible to have a normal relationship (let alone courtship) with anyone. I'm not sure what the hell has happened to people but it's not good or conducive to having healthy or normal relationships. It's really sad and grotesque and not sure how we would ever get things turned around again. Truly pathetic. Peace. ",

This is part of what love is like. You think and plan the future with that significant other, life is great until\u2026 Your SO breaks up with you for whatever reason. All your intense happiness immediately transforms into intense sadness. You could feel this way for weeks, months, or years into the foreseeable future. This is some of the effects of love. Love is to be respected Edit: the answer to your question is based on the individuals willingness to risk vulnerability for that amazing experience. I am not scared as the reward is worth the risk. Hopefully this gives insight as to why some people are scared ",

Love is indeed a beautiful feeling . live in today, fall in love, make your present beautiful. No one knows what the future holds for them. And one thing that i firmly believe is \u201cwhat\u2019s meant to be, is bound to happen no matter what\u201d so don't be scared,take a leap of faith and experience the most beautiful emotion of this world .

Reasons why I'm scared of falling in love- Making someone a reason to live.Exposing your vulnerable side- giving someone immense power to make you or to break you.Giving someone more priority than yourself - keeping their dreams, desires and aspirations above yours.Making someone a source of happiness.Identity crisis- you might end up losing /merging your identity with someone who might leave you anyday.P. S = Even after all this, love in any form surely gives you the most wonderful and memorable moments of life, though very short lived! ",

Still when I was falling in love and felt that it only exist us two for long periods of time in a room, or a restaurant, or a walk. Damn. I miss that. What scares does me, is if my heartbreaks have made me so wise and perhaps hardened that I might not feel that feeling again. That is what worries me. Each woman further enforces my intuition on this. Each new one not being the one. Is it me just preventing myself for making a stupid mistake? Or am I looking for things that may not really be there.

Which if not kept under check may reach disasterous levels. That is what makes me scared of falling in love. However at this point before i conclude i would just like to state something that i have found after taking the abovementioned risks again and again.
