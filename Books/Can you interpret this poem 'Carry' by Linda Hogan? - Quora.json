            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very interesting poem, full of opportunity for the imaginative interpreter. Just like with any art, the meaning of a poem is not necessarily what the artist intends, but it is what happens when someone experiences the art and sees something in it, often a reflection of themselves, their own lives or emotions. We might all interpret it differently, and no interpretation would be wrong. I don\u2019t want to be too specific about how I interpret it myself as I think it\u2019s important that you try to find your own answers without being too coloured by what others think. I\u2019ll form some questions that you might try to answer in your own journey to open your own intellectual and emotional dialogue with the words of Linda Hogan: Which poetic devices do the poem use?The poem starts with \u201cWe\u201d, not \u201cI\u201d. Who are the poem\u2019s protagonists?The fish cannot breathe air, we cannot breathe water. What can this difference symbolise? How does it tie in with the poem\u2019s description of the water as a mirror?The poem speaks of the mirror of the water as broken. What connotations do broken mirrors have? How could this be significant to how you interpret the poem?Is the dead hawk a symbol of a person, a feeling, or a thing? Could it be all three? What is the significance of the predator being a creature specifically of the air as opposed to the water?The hawk is just bones, dead for a long time, while the fish, its intended pray has lived on with the hawk\u2019s skeleton riding its back. What could this mean?We drink the water, the water drinks us. Is the water life, or death, or both? And how does it relate to the air above?What is this older and deeper that the poem talks of at the end? Is it death? Is death the end; simply nothing? Or does the poem imply there is there more to dying?What does it mean that water is never lonely?At line 15, It was beautiful, that water the poem appears to shift in time, back to before the hawk attacked the fish. What is the significance of this? What other shift in the poem coincides with it?What is the effect of the way these two lines are split? like a silver coin stretched thin enough to feed us allIs this a Modernist or a Postmodernist poem? Is it something else? Why?I could have written a few more, but that should be enough to get you started. ",

            "answer_text": "Loss often plays a part in Linda Hogan's writing. Here, the speaker is pulling a fish from the water, but discovers that a hawk is attached to the fish, possibly caught in the undertow and pulled under with the fish. Hawk and fish, predator and prey are locked together as if one. In a larger sense, predator and prey cannot be separated since they depend on each other. Throughout the poem is the image of the water, a reflective source that contains so much and is a part of everything around it. Despite its hidden menace or life within, it is endowed with strength and history, able to transport us or feed us or reveal treasures within. Taken as a whole, the poem speaks of how water connects us and supports us. ",

On a more helpful note: you might want to think on what the water could be representing, since it\u2019s obviously important. What properties is it described as having? Are those properties shared with something else? Also dwell a bit on the title: What is carrying? Where is it carrying? ",
