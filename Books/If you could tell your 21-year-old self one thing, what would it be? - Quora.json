The carefree you are, the life you are enjoying and the memories you are making are what is keeping me pushing today. Enjoy every moment , before somebody starts telling you, you can do this and you cannot do this. I know life will change very drastically for you, but remember I will never blame you for anything , because you were the best version of me. Instead I would be thankful for making me who I\u2019m. For teaching me how to be confident and to stand for what's right and to say \u201cNo\u201d to things that I don't agree upon. The world opens to new relationships, new experiences and adventures, but what remains constant is our attitude towards it. This is what I have adapted from you. So enjoy life king size and always keep smiling :) Yours loving, 24 year old self Thank You for Reading..!! ",
