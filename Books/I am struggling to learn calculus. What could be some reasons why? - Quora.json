            "answer_text": "How are you learning calculus?  If you're trying to use rote memorization to cram down all the formulas, then good luck. You won't be understanding the subject, and you're not going to benefit from it either. If you're trying to understand the concepts and grasp the theory behind all the mechanics, then you are on the right track! This won't be an easy track though, and it may be tempting to cram down formulas, but don't do that. You will struggle, but that's normal. If you persist, then will understand the subject and succeed in it. Calculus is one of the things that most everyone struggles a bit in; don't be discouraged, as there's a whole new world waiting to be unveiled! :D ",
