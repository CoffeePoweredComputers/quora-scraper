            "answer_text": "(All times are your country\u2019s time) DAY 1 - 0900 You walk into work for the last time at the nuclear missile maintenance facility. Today, your country is testing out some new launch technology and it is perfect for you\u2014if you can somehow manage to get at least 7\u20138 of the 25 test dummies switched out with real ones, you would effectively wipe out everyone on the planet. You show your ID to security, scan your irises, and get patted down before you enter. Not many people are inside the building right now, because everyone is prepping for the launch. You manage to pickpocket a high ranking official\u2019s ID and you go to the control room where security is busy preparing to upright the test rockets, so no one notices your entry. You speak into a secure microphone on a blue panel at the back of the room where your official usually sits. You command a robot to, \u201cunder maintenance protocol,\u201d check and replace the warheads on the test dummies to see if any are damaged and authorize it with your stolen ID. Still no one has noticed your breach so you advance to the main official\u2019s box in the control room. The maintenance bot sends in its\u2019 reports here. You see that it is making its\u2019 way to the rockets which you have already \u201cdamaged.\u201d Knowing that there is very little time left you grab an earpiece to listen to its\u2019 reports ans sprint to the warhead maintenance room to which you have full access to. You show your personal ID and unlock the doors. Inside, there is no one. You spot a security cam and say, \u201cThis is for the better,\u201d and run off. Examining the shelves inside, you replace the first three rows of dummy warheads with real nuclear ones. Then you lock off the rest of the rows with the stolen ID; reason: \u201csecurity.\u201d Someone has finally noticed the robot scanning all the warheads and asks if anyone authorized it. Without speaking you digitally signal that you (high ranking official) have. Suspicions recede. The robot finishes scanning and reports that all of the warheads suffered significant interior damage and that replacement is neccessary. You approve and the robot zooms back, grabs 25 warheads, and zooms back to replace them. The robot finishes replacing the 25 warheads just as the warheads go upright. No one notices the slight alteration to the missiles. DAY 1 - 1300 (T-Minus 0100 to launch) While most everyone is on lunch break you sneak back into the control room, which is empty but all the terminals are locked down. You can still access some terminals so you make some slight changes to flight path that need a password. You leave it at that screen because it looks exactly like the one where you log in after lockdown. With that, your job is done. DAY 1 - 1330 (T-Minus 0030 to launch) Changes authorized. DAY 1 - 0200 (launch time) You watch in anticipation as the missiles are all launched. Someone finally notices the changes to flight path and warheads and freaks out. Everyone is locked down and questioned except you because you have already left. DAY 2 - 0900 Missiles land at the exact same time, causing 25 nuclear explosions across the globe and everyone dies. The End. (Sorry I don\u2019t know much about the physical means of nuclear warheads and stuff like that. I tried my best. Thank you!) EDIT: I\u2019d like to add that no one saw this coming and this is very advanced, stealthy technology and no one saw it coming. Bunkers were empty and as such, everyone died. Also, your country was still in lockdown mode so no one thought to warn the world. (Look, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not good with people stuff, okay!) ",

            "answer_text": "The only fairly feasible way of accomplishing this, is to create some form of deadly, rapidly spreading virus, with a 100 % kill ratio. The person would die himself, along the way, but I guess that\u2019s no big deal. A few people living at isolated places, like the Andamanese, would probably survive. If we\u2019re counting indirect ways, then there suddenly are numerous variants of doing this. Like firing off the arsenal of nuclear arms. This would be a more secure way as even the most isolated tribes would go down in the aftermath of this apocalypse. ",

There are several reasons to do so but they come down to the four big motives: Money Ideology Conscience and Ego. Money is not a big motivator as there is no need for it after the apocalypse and of course the death of the idiot. Ideology - Tom Clancy wrote a good book about a weaponised version of Ebola. Some green nutters decided the world would be better off without humans (except for them) he should also be credited with introducing me to the MICE acronym (in that case for treason, but what is genocide if not treason writ large) Conscience - feeling bad about the harm done by humanity - similar in this case to Ideology Ego - this is the big one. \u201cI\u2019ll show them\u2026\u201d I\u2019ve got a sneaking suspicion that that will be the last thought of the person who ends humanity.
