            "answer_text": "Yeah I believe so. I had to read one of his essays during a non-fiction lit class in college. It led me to reading through his whole collection. Some of them are entertaining, some are serious, some are simple, and some are complex. He isn\u2019t up there with some of the greatest thinkers in history, but I personally believe he at least has an interesting take on life. Even as a wealthy man, he did seem to relate well to the common folk. He led an interesting life for sure. I would not put his essays on a list of must reads, but it is definitely worth a peruse through at the very lest. The great thing about any collection of essays is that you do not have to read through the whole thing. You can always just pick and choose what interests you or is relatable to you. ",
