            "answer_text": "Talk to the booksellers. Don\u2019t pay too much attention to the bestseller list; that comes from the publishers and reflects mostly pre-sales to retailers. Example: all of the Harry Potter books. They had strict-on-sale dates, but magically were already national bestsellers. And I recall an instance where our store received a shipment of a brand new bestseller, just released, for $29.95. In the same shipment was a box of the same book with $5.97 bargain stickers. Guess which one sold the most copies? ",
