            "answer_text": "\"To find your purpose first learn about yourself.\" Finding the real you is an enlightening experience. You become self-sufficient and do things for yourself, for once. It's a hard feeling to put into words, but when you don't know who you are, it's hard to ignore. Finding yourself is not easy, but it's worth it. Ready? Let's begin. Create your own life timeline : Write down all of your major goals that you feel you have achieved and want to achieve. In turn, write down the events in your life that have already happened and that have shaped or affected you.Start relying on yourself : Confidence and reliance are at the heart of finding yourself. If you don't have a solid sense of solid worth, you'll listen to what others have to say all the time and to be swayed by their insistence on what is appropriate. Learn to believe in yourself and trust your own feelings. Then, you'll come up with a structure to base your new sense of self on. Remember, be patient with yourself and confident in your abilities. Everything will come with time.Immerse yourself in solitude : Give yourself some time and space to get away from the expectations, the conversations, the noise, the media, and the pressure. Take some time each day to go for a long walk and think. Plant yourself on a park bench and look. Take a long, thoughtful road trip. Whatever you do, move away from anything that distracts you from contemplating your life and where you want it to go. In solitude, you should feel independent and self-sufficient, not lonely, needy or afraid.Seek out a passion : When you believe in something or see beauty in something, you should do it no matter what anyone else thinks. If you have found something that is worthy of your best efforts, sacrifice, and tears, then you have found the most important pursuit of your life. Often, that pursuit can lead you to something ultimately fulfillingMost Imp for you : Hit it -> How to Find Your PassionGood Luck Dear. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for requesting my answer. The simple answer is: you look for what wakes you up inside, what energizes you, and what makes you feel most alive. If it benefits the world in some way, then you have found your purpose in life. But more complicated is this: you first have to figure out how to get out of your own way. My belief is that everyone is enlightened. We only have to overcome what prevents that enlightened view. A part of that enlightened view is purpose. But there\u2019s a lot to discover before you can get there. Cultivate peace. A lot of people talk about \u201cinner peace\u201d as something of a goal. But to me, this isn\u2019t the ultimate goal. It\u2019s the first step on the path. How do we cultivate peace? We have to find experiences that show us that whatever people do, they do out of a sense of compassion. And once we see the truth of that, we can understand the nature of violence is either incompetence or compassionate defense against the incompetent violence. But then we realize after a while that there is no violence possible. Violence is nothing more than a perception. And realizing this, many people burst into tears at the beautiful nature of the world, because there\u2019s no longer violence in any kind of conflict. Then cultivate compassion. Compassion is vital to inner growth, and brings us to be able to comprehend what others see. And since there\u2019s no violence, no offense is possible. Since no offense is possible, there is nothing to forgive. There\u2019s a whole lot more along that path, but it follows the same kind of progression. It\u2019s not necessarily linear, but each puzzle piece you discover brings you closer to the whole picture. And when you finally reach your purpose, it feels like coming home after a long trip. Some people cry. Some people take a nap. Some breathe a sigh of relief. But all agree that the process of self-discovery in the process was worthwhile. Hope this helps in some small way. ",
