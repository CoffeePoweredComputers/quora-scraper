            "answer_text": "I managed to have this habit before the internet existed as a popular resource. It isn\u2019t very difficult. 200 books per year is only 4 per week. At a page per minute, a sub-200 page book (think Agatha Christie) takes about 3 hours to read; 300 pages perhaps five hours. Take a mix of those, and extend it over a whole week, and it is only about 2 hours per day, on average. Time for a very nice long bath, or a couple of medium commutes on weekdays and some shorter baths. And I read when I sunbathed, too. You don\u2019t have to get wet. And I mean the commuting which inevitably involves some wetness if you are able to read while doing so. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A Jaimin Mistry Many people have asked this question many times. I have a daily reading habit. When I was in college, I went to the library to prepare for the exam. But by looking at all other books except the exam textbook in the library, I started reading it. This is how I started reading. And when you start reading a book, you get curious that what will happen next with that situation and/or character in the story. My reading habits are very systematic and orderly, which I know will not work for everyone. I read at least 30\u201340 pages before sleeping on even any busy day. I\u2019m not really a mood reader, so if I pick up my Kindle or paper book and check review on goodread and it says that this book is next, then I\u2019ll tuck in for a few hours and read! When you read a book, you come into a different world, gives faces to the characters, constructs every scene, hears the voices, smells the smells. The best moments in reading are when you come across something \u2013 a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things \u2013 which you had thought special and particular to you. Now here it is, set down by someone else, a person you have never met, someone even who is long dead. That's why I prefer to read the book instead of the movie. because once i go to see a film based on a novel that I likes, I leave feeling disappointed. ",
