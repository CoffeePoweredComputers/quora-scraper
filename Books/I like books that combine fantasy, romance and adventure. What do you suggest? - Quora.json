            "answer_text": "I have been reading science fiction/fantasy (they always used to be in the same aisle in Barnes and Noble and I never knew what the difference was) for about 15 years. My current favorites that you might enjoy: The Black Jewels Trilogy by Anne Bishop. A Black Widow witch saw an ancient prophecy come to life in her dazzling web of dreams and visions. Now the Dark Kingdom readies itself for the arrival of its Queen, a Witch who will wield more power than even the High Lord of Hell himself. But she is still young, still open to influence--and corruption. What isn\u2019t there to love? A strong female and male characters, magic, romance, sex, adventure, death! It is wonderfulThe Name of the Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss. So begins the tale of Kvothe\u2014from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you will come to know Kvothe as a notorious magician, an accomplished thief, a masterful musician, and an infamous assassin. But The Name of the Wind is so much more\u2014for the story it tells reveals the truth behind Kvothe's legend.This book is fraught with danger, magic (again!), and a clever male protagonist. Less romance but still a very thrilling read, and if you liked the Inheritence which isn\u2019t too romantic, then you will probably like this one (there is still a love interest in the book, the plot just isn\u2019t based on it)Kushiel\u2019s Dart, by Jacqueline Carey. The book follows Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay's life from birth. She's born with a mote in her eye, which makes her appear inappropriate for service as a religious courtesan, but it is revealed that this is actually a sign that she is an 'anguissette' or sexual masochist, deriving sexual pleasure from pain. Her bond is purchased by a nobleman who does train her as a courtesan, and discovers a plot against her homeland which she has a chance to interrupt.This book involves lots of sex, mystery, spies, assassins, and saving her country from the invading barbaric horde! Very fun, a must read.",

            "answer_text": "Check out Tamora Pierce\u2019s Tortall books Tamora Pierce - Wikipedia There are a bunch of 4 book series that interlock with connecting characters that tells an on going story. For the most part you can start with any of them and just jump in where you feel comfortable. The books scale very well the first series is easy to get into and the books typical increase in complexity with in the 4 books of the series and progressively across the whole collection. They have great adventure, the protagonists are all strong and capable youngsters who grow, Lots of romance, but tackled in a way that is real and education. N.B. Something I want to clearly point out to any parents considering this for their kids. While these books are written for teens, the author makes sex and sexual awareness a real part of the stories. Not in a graphic way, more in a practical way i.e. being aware of issues like pregnancy and birth control. Here\u2019s the basic run down Song of the Lioness Alanna wants to be a knight, girls are forbidden so she swaps places with her twin brother (who doesn't want to be a knight) and enters the training in secret. The Immortals Diana is a young girl who has lost her family and is alone in the world, she has a strange wild magic power that lets her communicate with animals\u2026 but some times she loses control. She finds a home in Tortall, good friends and learns the full potential of her powers. Lots of animals, wolf lore, later gods and dinosaurs. This is where I started years ago and I still love it. Protector of the Small Kel is the first girl since Alanna to try for Knighthood, (this time openly as the first female). Unlike Alanna she doesn\u2019t have magic to aide her and does everything on raw strength and talent competing head to head with the boys. As she rises to knighthood she finds a special calling against evil. Trickster\u2019s Choice Alianne is the daughter of Totall\u2019s champion knight and it\u2019s secret spymaster, due to foolish rebellion she is captured by pirates and sold into slavery in a foreign land. Can she use her skills and training to escape or is there a large task for her here? Beka Cooper Set chronological years before the other books. This one is a lot more complex and mature then some of previous books. Beka is a hound, basically a beat cop for the largest city in Tortall. This series is so good, it\u2019s basically a police procedural inside a fantasy world. ",
