            "answer_text": "yes we are the same people. And mark my words Tigray will be part of Eritrea. Why? Simple Eritrea has a demographic problem and Tigray has a geographic problem the only way they can solve this problem is by uniting. 20 or 30 years from now the Tigrayans in Ethiopia will have to choose to either be a periphery Region with insignificant population of 10 million in a country of 300 million ( Ethiopia population 2050) With limited political power or be the core of a country where they will be the absolute majority. And in 20 or 30 years from now the Tigrayans in Eritrea will have to choose to either be a people that will tolerate a dictator to save them from islamic domination or make a country in which they are the absolute majority. At this time there is a silly not calculated hatred between those people but once the population gets educated they will realise their fate is intertwined. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they are. not only the tigre\u2019s but also the people of afar in ethiopia and eritrea are the same. The ethiopian,kenyan and Somalia's somali are also the same. The oromo in Ethiopia are also found in kenya. There are many ethnicities like this in africa there are mainly two reasons. 1,colonialism 2, not finished nation building For your question we should delve into how Eritrea was formed so any short answer given by any one is wrong and misleading I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT SHORT. At the time of Emperor tekle giyorgis(\u134d\u1343\u121c \u1218\u1295\u130d\u1235\u1275) an Italian shipping agent opened its branch on \u1218\u1345\u12cb. but the emperor didnt even managed to stay in power for long. by the time his successor atse yohannes(\u12a0\u1344 \u12ee\u1210\u1295\u1235 ) came to power the shipping agent had already transfered its stake to the government of Italy. Italy started taking chunk of lands from \u121d\u1345\u12cb the then regional ruler alula aba nega fought the italians many times.battle of dogale is the well known. Emperor yohannes didnt like what the Italians were doing so he marched to northern ethiopia to asmara to fight them but by that time the mahdists were burning churches and cities in gondar . so he changed his plan went to \u1218\u1270\u121b with alula leaving asmara and died fighting the mahdists.in that time there was a power vaccum since asmara's ruler alula also went with yohannes so the Italians occupied asmara and named the region ERITREA but the Italians didnt stop there, they went further till they reach mereb river. Emperor menilik came after yohannes. His first years in power were marred by famine and conspiracies . with the wuchale treaty menilik agreed with the Italians that they will not pass the mereb river but the italians occupied the now tigray region. Minilik fought them at battle of adwa, won .but didnt go beyond mereb. The reason was mass casualty and the famine ravaging the country. So when ERITREA became a country ethnicities that were once the same people had to be splitted.this was the case with tigre and afar people. ",
