            "answer_text": "Absolutely. There are a dozen or more schools of literary criticism that look at literature from different approaches and will interpret literature accordingly. Think of it as different lenses that are focused on specific things that speak to those schools. Then there\u2019s the ordinary reader who brings to the work their own reading of what the author provides. One of the joys of teaching was the sometimes spirited interpretations of literature with students. As part of a poetry unit, each student had to interpret a poem and present it to the class. And sometimes the interpretations were wild and crazy and some were thoughtful and mind-blowing and others were middle-of-the-road safe. I\u2019d always ask students to back up their interpretations\u2014 some of my students called this \u201cthe grilling\u201d\u2014 and that would sometimes lead to amazing discussions. Everyone comes to literature with different expectations as well as different experiences, so the lens they use to see the literature may differ. I had one student who had been homeless and had interpreted a poem as a story of a homeless child looking for a place to stay for the night. Another saw the same poem as a piece about how we were all wandering in this world looking for our home, our place in the universe. Another student saw it as a person who had been lost because of a break with their family and needed to find a different family. If I were to read Animal Farm in the political climate of the US today, I know that I would continually make comparisons between the various critters and the current crop of people running Washington now. I don\u2019t think I could help it despite knowing that Orwell was taking aim at communism. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d find it very odd if literary works weren\u2019t interpreted differently, you know? Of course I\u2019m not saying someone can look at a novel like \u2018Animal Farm\u2019 and say it\u2019s about agriculture, but good literature resonates differently among different people and that\u2019s the beauty of it. One of my favorite contemporary authors is Haruki Murakami. Now, if you ask me what he writes about I wouldn\u2019t be able to give you a single solid answer. One moment things are fine, and the next moment a cat is talking. However, his writing resonates with me and I keep turning the page until there\u2019s none left and I\u2019m left wanting more. Even with great literary work in dramas, the motivations, the ambitions, the fates of characters can be interpreted differently, and it\u2019s always interesting to see how a friend or a colleague sees a certain character or development in comparison to how I see it.

            "answer_text": "Answer: Yes. It\u2019s a safe bet that the more finely wrought a piece of literature (or art in general), the more complex interpretations can be. On the other hand, a simplistic piece of art will usually present you with a ready-made interpretation. A couple of classic examples: Moby Dick vs. Atlas Shrugged Watership Down vs. Twilight Don Quixote vs. Valley of the Dolls ",
