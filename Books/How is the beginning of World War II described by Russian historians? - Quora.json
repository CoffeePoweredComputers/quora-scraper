            "answer_text": "Having read a Soviet textbook on ww2. It is interesting that using the same facts, the USSR had different conclusions. Factually their textbook was as accurate as my college textbook. To answer the question, they basically depict themselves as peaceful and neutral, who were surprised by the German blitzkrieg. The enormous sacrifices of the population to enact the scorched earth policy, and the amazing siege of Leningrad were depicted heroically. In very similar tones as the US texts discuss pearl harbor and the Philippines. Interestingly the NAZI atrocities against the Jewish population by the einsatzgruppen was not mentioned. FYI, the end war period was fascinating as the text blamed Churchill for not opening a second front earlier. The fact that Churchill had proposed invading the Balkans instead of Italy was brought up as a betrayal of the USSR by the UK. The slowness of montgomery was also mentioned as indirectly extending the war and increasing Russian casualties. The conclusion was increasing Russian casualties was intentional and directed by Churchill ",

            "answer_text": "From the horse\u2019s mouth: In my schoolbook (it still is kept on my book shelves) Stalin depicted as a dictator who had made a tons of bad things and killed a lot of people. We have studied the help from western allies as well but main line was concentrated on Soviet battles. There are some anti-american sentiments but mostly due to recent events, nobody cares about Cold War times as it was in past. Also there are some jerks who like Stalin but it is far from to be popular. I had a class last semester on Soviet Russia, and my professor had grown up in the Soviet Union. He said that WWII is something that is still firmly in the mind of almost every Russian. EVERYBODY is directly related to someone who was in the war. It's not a case of \"My friend's grandfather was in WWII,\" it's more like \"My grandfather, two of his brothers, and my friend's grandfather died in WWII.\" My professor's opinion of Stalin is that he was ruthless and paranoid, but there was a method to his madness. He says that during the war, Stalin proved to be a strong leader, and relied heavily on the input of his generals, unlike Hitler. The popular view is that the Allies took far too long to become involved in the war, and their delays in starting an eastern front caused millions of Soviet casualties. How do modern Russians view WW2? \u2022 r/history As someone who has had Russian history and currently still posesses a book called 'The Book for Future Admirals' (aimed at 10-14 year old kids, part of the school history 'recommended reading list' as per 1994), I can only answer what was said in the book and my limited personal experience with the history lessons. The book covers the period from before WW2 to the end of 1970, and mostly focuses on the military aspects. Stalin is being portrayed as a good leader and a very powerful authority figure, and his government as a strong leadership who helped bring the war to a succesful end. The massacres and gulag sendoffs are not explicitly mentioned but often inferred during the book. There are stories of how the war commanders like Zhukov had to fight Stalin to get what they wanted, or how his negative decisions affected them and the war. By accounts of many generals in the war, he often asked the impossible from his people, but was not completely unreasonable when given mass rebuttal(the infamous and very short lived order to shoot retreating soldiers in the back is an excellent example. Very few commanders actually did it and forced him to back down from it.) Overall, he is posed as someone who did a lot of good for the country and brought a measure of stability to it. But there is certainly a hanging sidenote of 'horrible person' permeating every good deed he did. There is praise for his accomplishments in bringing the country together, but always with an undertone that he was a horrible person. Maybe not on the same level as Hitler, but a good second. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on the influence of politics on current pedagogical practices in Russian high schools, specifically as it relates to teaching history. My primary source was the book \"A Modern History of Russia, 1945-2006: Manual For Teachers.\" by A.V. Filippov et. all. Here is an article that appeared in the Economist in 2007 that contains some interesting information about this textbook, especially the controversy surrounding its writing and subsequent release. The book is used nationally as the cannon for teaching history to Russian high school students, and obviously includes vast information about Stalin. In general, Stalin's actions are not excused but justified to students. Unlike previous textbooks that tended to gloss over the Kremlin's purges, Filippov's book rationalizes the destruction of millions of Soviet citizens as a sort of \"just\" retribution. In The History of Russia textbook, the authors instruct Russian educators on how to approach Stalin in the classroom: \"It is important to show that Stalin acted in a concrete historical situation\u2026entirely rationally\u2014as the guardian of a system, as a consistent supporter of reshaping the country into an industrialized state.\" The authors of the book seem to realize that the purges of the 1930's cannot be categorized as entirely \"rational,\" so they take their description one step further by redefining what constitutes a victim of repression: \"We believe it would be correct to use a formula here that would include only persons condemned to death and executed. This will enable us to move away from the kind of exploitation of this issue in which everyone was counted as a victim of repression\u2026\" So who does not count as a victim of repression under this formula? Anyone who lost his job for political reasons; anyone who was expelled from the Young Communist League or the party; anyone who died in a labor camp; and anyone who died after being deported or as the result of deportation does not count. Stalin's management of the Ukrainian hunger crisis is also grossly misrepresented, with the authors saying, \"According to updated figures, the number in Ukraine [who died of hunger] was not 10 million, as Ukrainian historians write today, but no more than 1 or 2 million.\" That's just a small sample of the information contained in the textbook, but it illustrates in general the approach that Russia is currently taking toward Stalin in the classroom. Another important factor to keep in mind in this discussion is the nationalized Russian school system. Unlike the U.S. where states have differing \"core\" requirements for the information students should receive in school Russian students receive the same instruction in history whether they live in St. Petersburg or Vladivostok. Thus I can say with some certainty that the ideas expressed in \"A Modern History of Russia\" are taught on a national scale. I'll leave you with this quote, directly from the textbook itself: \"We must make every school-child aware of the grandeur of our struggle and our victories; we must show him the cost of these great successes in labor and blood; we must tell him how great the people of our epoch\u2014Lenin, Stalin, and their companions in arms\u2014organized the workers in the struggle for a new and happy life. Our youth must be trained in militant readiness for the defense of their socialist fatherland.\u201d What is taught about Stalin in Russia? \u2022 r/AskHistorians Russian textbooks have treaded a careful line when describing the Pact. But the 2016 edition of Russia\u2019s most popular history textbook puts less emphasis on its secret protocols, in which the Soviets and Nazis carved up Eastern Europe among themselves, than ever before. \u201cIt has a more justifying tone,\u201d says Katsva. In fact, there is no word \u2018aggression\u2019 in the text. Instead, the book portrays the invasion of Eastern Europe by Soviet troops as a \u201cliberation\u201d from Poland and the impending Nazi invasion. \u201cOn September 17, part of the Red Army was given orders to cross the Western border and liberate western Ukraine and western Belarus,\u201d the text says. The textbook gives a similar explanation for Russia\u2019s military presence in the Baltic states. According to the authors, Russia\u2019s invasion and annexation of the three northern European countries was the result of democratic parliamentary elections in the countries in which the communists in the Baltic States won. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say anything about the fact that [the Baltics had] no choice,\u201d says Katvsa, referring to the Soviet-installed governments in Baltic nations in June 1940.
