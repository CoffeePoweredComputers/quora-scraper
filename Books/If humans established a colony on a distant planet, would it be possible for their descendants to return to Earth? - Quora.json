            "answer_text": "Space is a big place. We know at present of no means by which mass can travel faster than the speed of light\u2014or close to it\u2014about 300,000 km a second. Even at such speeds, it takes 9 minutes just to reach our own sun. It takes years to reach even nearby stars. Your question really is one associated with the value of making visits. If visits are hard and expensive (e.g. like ship voyages were in the 18th century) people will make relatively few of them. It seems terribly unlikely that a long space voyage will ever feel fulfilling and \u201cworth it\u201d when measured in large chunks of available time to live. If these constraints are relaxed, who knows? For now, given what it means to be human and to have human life, it seems very unlikely people would \u201cgo home.\u201d Communications might be an entirely different question. Again, for now, we are bound by the speed of light. It is the speed limit of all things except our imagination. Overcome that, and many things can change\u2014as science fiction regularly speculates. Can it be overcome? It seems\u2026 unlikely. ",
