            "answer_text": "What\u2019s so great about python is that it\u2019s super far away from CPU instruction sets and quite close to English language. So you don\u2019t have to know a lot about computers themselves to write programs. People who know a lot about computers have built a great construction underneath you so you don\u2019t have to worry about how zeros and ones are located in memory. That makes python a great language to start programming for those who come more from speaking English rather than from designing CPUs world. But how do you actually start? I assume you have some python environment installed. If not, google how to set it up. Generally speaking googling stuff solves like 99% of programming problems. The best way to learn a programming language is to write programs in it. Being a chemical engineer you could easily write a program that calculates the mass of water in grams formed from burning x moles of hydrogen in excess of oxygen and print the result out. Here is it: # this is a comment (python ignores all stuff in line after \u201c#\u201d character) # x is two moles of hydrogen x = 2 # y is for moles of water after burning # y should contain the same amount as x since 2 H2 + O2 -> 2 H2O y = x # mass is y times molar mass of water mass = y * 18.01528 # print is a function that prints what\u2019s inside parentheses. print(mass) Now that\u2019s a stupid program. But it demonstrates how you actually can use python to compute simple stuff. That\u2019s actually exactly how I started using it. Then you use it. And you want it to maybe plot a graph but don\u2019t know how. And so you google how. And turns out python can plot graphs, integrate, do linear algebra, edit images, plot Mandelbrot set on the complex plain, send messages in Telegram, execute silly stuff from internet on IBM\u2019s quantum computer, buy shares of Apple stock, download and analyze the sentiment of YouTube comments and a lot more. This is some of the stuff I\u2019ve done with python using it for 2 years as my first programming language. But I started with a program that prints a number multiplied by a constant. And then I wanted to plot a graph. And so I googled it. My advice is try to use it for things you need. Even if for those specific things a calculator would do just fine. And as you use it and don\u2019t know how to do stuff you google it. It will not be an easy journey. People with phds in computer science don\u2019t know how all things work. It\u2019s a thing you can spend a life on. Computers are terribly messy but they also are very beautiful. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cbest way\u201d, just the way that works best for you. I can offer some guidance, but most of it is up to you. First: First, learn Python 3; don\u2019t bother with Python 2. Python 2 and 3 are not completely compatible, but Python 3 is the way forward. Python 2 will soon be deprecated, if it hasn\u2019t already been. Second: Python is not cross-platform. There\u2019s a misconception that that Python is a \u201cwrite-once, run anywhere\u201d language. It\u2019s not. That\u2019s Java (and sometimes C#). It\u2019s easy to write Python programs that run on PC, but barf on Linux or MacOS. If cross-platform is important to you, make sure you write your code in a cross-platform manner. Or learn Java instead. Third: The REPL is great to screw around in to get used to Python. Do some experiments there before trying to write a full program. Fourth: I don\u2019t know why you want to learn Python, but know that it\u2019s slow. It\u2019s damn slow. Often, this won\u2019t matter, but it depends on what you want to use it for. Fifth: Find out which way to learn works best for you. If one course isn\u2019t working, ditch it and try something else. Here are some resources for learning, but remember, Google is your friend: EbookFoundation/free-programming-books81 Best Places to Learn to Code For Free | Learn to Code With Me | Coding for BeginnersGood luck!

If you don't want a certificate then you can also audit the specialization for free. If the term \u201cspecialization\u201d scares you then let me tell you that specialization is just a collection of 4 to 6 courses ordered properly. There is a dedicated website for these courses also. The website is Python for Everybody. Currently I don't have the full information of the website. You can get the information from the first course easily. It is never a affiliated answer. I am currently taking the course 2 of the specialization and I am loving it. ",

Telusko (for english) after this (it should take around 4 months) you can have any intermediate or advanced level programming course. That is how i learned python Hope it helps you! please upvote ",
