            "answer_text": "I agree with Mr. Nathan: it doesn\u2019t have any effect. Yes, every one of the major characters is a member of the elite, and they\u2019re all at Leonato\u2019s estate for the entire play. But this is a play of character (like most of Shakespeare\u2019s plays)\u2014 it could as easily be set in England, or in Egypt, or in Venice, or Paris\u2014 or nowhere specified. Remember that there was no such thing as a \u201cset\u201d in the way we understand that term in today\u2019s theatre, so the setting really exists in the audience\u2019s minds. ",

            "answer_text": "Who says the setting affects the plot of \u201cMuch Ado About Nothing\u201d? Are you referring to the fact that most of the play is set in and around the home of the LEONATA, the governor of Messina? That has very little to do with the plot of the play. Most of Shakespeare\u2019s plays can be set in any time and in any location. See Joss Whedon\u2019s film version of \u201cMuch Ado About Nothing.\u201d ",
