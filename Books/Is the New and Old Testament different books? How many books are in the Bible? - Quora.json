            "answer_text": "Firstly, the term 'Bible' is a relatively modern word. It simply means collection or compendium of writings (we call books) that are designated 'Scripture' or sacred writings. The word Testament means 'Covenant' and is all about the covenant God made with mankind. Someone once said 'The new is in the Old contained and the old is in the new explained' The Old Testament is about God's relationship with mankind through the Nation of Israel and is made up several bodies of writings, usually classified as; the law; the prophets; history and poetic writings, however there is one single overarching theme, 'Redemption from sin'. God's final solution was for him, through the person of Jesus Christ ( the messiah' to be the one who would take away the sins of humankind on the cross. Hence the 'New' covenant. In the New Testament it's all about Jesus, and his redemptive power and work. When it came to what books were included (called canon) in the final compilation there was a strict measurement of validity. Within the process of determining which writings to include and which to reject, they were split into 3 piles know as; (1) 'homologoumena' meaning those books that were synchronised around the main theme (2) Antilegomena meaning not synchronised with the main body (3) Notha, meaning false Not only did the early church look at the New Testament writings but also the Old Testament when seeking synergy. It's worth noting that these writings didn't come printed in codex (book) form, but scrolls, parchments, velum even scratched on pottery. Neither did they have chapters & verses we see today and when you consider the persecution the church was under when they were written and distributed, it's a miracle we got what we got. Even the Old Testament, which was compiled by scribes during the nation's captivity in Babylon. It's a wonder we have any Bible at all. ",

            "answer_text": "The Old Testament and the New Testament are categories of the Bible based on the old covenant and the new covenant. The old covenant was given at Mount Sinai to Moses and the new covenant was prophesied by Ezekiel and Jeremiah, and fulfilled at the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Depending on which Bible you use, you will get different numbers for how many books are in the Bible. The standard Protestant number is 66, 39 in the Old Testament and 27 in the New Testament. The Catholic Bible contains extra books in the middle, usually 14. The Old Testament contains five subcategories of books. It begins with the Torah or Pentateuch, 5 books, continues with the Historical Books, 12, Wisdom Literature, 5, Major Prophets, 5, and the Minor Prophets, 12. The New Testament can be arranged in different ways, but usually it has five subcategories, the Gospels, 4, Church History, 1, Paul\u2019s Letters, 13, General Epistles, 8, and Apocalypse, 1. The Old Testament and the New Testament speak of two different eras, but the same God with the same attributes interacts with humanity in the same ways. Despite the diversity of cultures, languages, authors, eras, and approaches, the Bible has a singular message that God \u201cWill be their God, and they will be my people.\u201d It is a cohesive collection of books from the Old Testament to the New Testament. It must be seen as one complete work inspired by the Holy Spirit as human beings wrote his words. ",
