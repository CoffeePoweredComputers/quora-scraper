            "answer_text": "Jane Eyre is the quintessential Victorian novel. It literally has everything that was typical of the period, but, unlike other novels, it has all the elements in one story. When I read it for the first time as a young and opinionated teen, I thought Jane Eyre was a boring and meek protagonist, too clingy to her 'outdated' morals but last year when I reread the book my perspective changed. Jane Eyre has a good idea of her self-worth. And she has a good idea about her own morals. And, unlike many in her situation, she sticks to her morals and her idea of what is wrong or right regardless of what outcome is in it for her. Here is the example: \"Gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marry their governesses.\" For a woman to be recognised as having equal intellect to that of a man was sadly a rare thing. Women could actually attend university, but the downside was they could never get the full degree. They could spend months studying, though never be recognised as actually having gained the qualification. It was just another attempt to keep women under the thumb, so for Bronte to portray the truth of Jane\u2019s equal intellect is a great step for the recognition of women, and women writers. Hope y\u2019all will like it :) Feel free to contact me and connect with me on Instagram: \ud83c\udf3b (@shivani_101998) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos \u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte were rare geniuses who lifted each other to heights most authors never reach. Far from being \u201coverrated\u201d they are all, if anything, overlooked in this day and age. Having said that it\u2019s possible Anne Bronte may finally be arriving as a truly great writer. Charlotte\u2019s book Jane Eyre is so close to perfection it beggars belief given her youth when she wrote it. She died at 37 so she was only in her twenties when she penned this classic. ",
