            "answer_text": "Noisy environments are sometimes difficult to concentrate in, but absolutely quiet ones can be tough too. The trick is to make a ritual out of your concentration, you can practice too. The chatter becomes near absent when you really focus. To start out, try and eliminate visual distractions and use white noise or music with noise either physical or electronic noise blocking capabilities. Classical music has been shown to increase mental abilities. Likely the problem is that there's something going on that's not constant, eliminating distractions and creating a ritual can help a lot. A sand filled hourglass or 1/2 hour, even 15 minutes can allow you to really focus if you train yourself. There's a product that creates white noise by An example of drowning things out, people who live by loud noises ignore them over time. Even intermittent noises can be ignored. If there's chatter or city noise it's usually constant and if the noise isn't try to use something that is. People who live near a train or airport they \"learn\" to tune it out and and are rarely bothered by it. Depending on your environment and situation you can hang sound absorbing panels or tapestries. They help to keep sounds from coming in or out. There's a product Supress by Du Pont and others that looks just like drywall but is like having a sound treatment built into your walls. This could help if you have control. Often distractions happen when you're not interested in what you're doing. A conversation you hear is more fun to listen to than getting to work. You can try noise cancelling headphones which drown out background noise, add some light \"white noise\" or classical music and that might help a lot. With practice and some time, and by using these techniques and products you should learn to concentrate anywhere.

            "answer_text": "  Prepare a few things ahead of time so that you can concentrate better, be more productive and even less annoyed by a noisy environment. These tips should get you started: Invest in noise-cancelling headphones or regular earbuds for your phone if you want to listen to music.Get silicone ear plugs if you prefer working in silence.Listen to music to help you relax and improve your focus: Prepare a playlist of classical music, blues, lounge or chillout tunes, or even sounds of nature. You can play music straight from apps such as 8tracks or Pandora.Set your phone to Airplane mode. This tip will ensure that you don\u2019t get distracted by incoming calls, text messages, and emails that you may be tempted to check frequently. If it\u2019s difficult to switch off completely, then turn off the volume on your phone and turn the screen away from you so you don\u2019t see any alerts from your apps.Turn your back to doors, hallways, and areas where there\u2019s a lot of motion. Not having any commotion in your line of vision helps a great deal.Sit facing a wall or preferably facing a window overlooking trees or a park. Looking at a busy street flooded with traffic and pedestrians won\u2019t be helpful, so having just a blank wall right in front of you is a better option.Set expectations with others: Let others know you need to focus uninterrupted for a couple of hours so they don\u2019t come to your desk with questions. Tell coworkers, your study group, or friends you\u2019ll respond to emails and catch up with them later (for example, in two hours).Have your essentials ready so you don\u2019t interrupt your workflow: If you have everything you need to work, you\u2019re less likely to step away from your desk and become aware of commotion or noise. Prepare all your notes and notebooks, reference materials (for example, you can bookmark websites you\u2019ll need in your browser or keep handwritten notes on your desk), and a checklist of all items you need to complete. Always have a bottle of water, a thermos with coffee or tea (if you prefer something warm to drink) , and a snack to give you energy when you\u2019re feeling tired.",
