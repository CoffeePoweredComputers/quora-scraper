            "answer_text": "This article helped me a lot I'm going to be honest - The first five academic weeks here were not a pleasant experience. You all smile about this whole firehose analogy, thinking that it sounds fantastic and you'd love it and you can't wait to try it. But actually, the transition can be pretty painful. I'm here to tell you it doesn't have to be. That's right. You don't have to be an academic masochist. Wait, what's that? You like doing all that work for classes you'll never need and don't even like instead of spending your time doing things you love? No you don't. Admission officers and bloggers have spent a lot of time and effort preaching to you about your high school activities and life: Spend your time with things you're passionate about. Don't join twenty extra-curriculars because you think you have to in order to have a chance a college. In the end, it's what you did for the love of the game that'll shine through anyway. We're not kidding. I got pretty good at this in high school (doing what I love, not working for The Man), and this mentality is what landed me in Taiwan instead of MIT three months after I graduated. So when that fateful time came to register for classes, I tried really hard to keep this in mind. But the pressure to take those pesky - I mean really fun - GIRs your freshman year is pretty strong, and ultimately, I broke a little. I ended up with two classes I wanted and two GIRs. Most people do not call this breaking. This is because most people are taking pretty much all GIRs and one HASS-D/CW class they may or may not convince themselves they like. With that, I'd like to devote an entire entry to a class I'm not even in anymore: Physics. [Insert collective gasp from the audience here] That's right. I dropped physics. If you're wondering why I would do such a thing, and you're expecting a really interesting answer like an elephant eating my homework, you're going to be dissapointed. Because the reason I dropped physics is... I didn't like the class. A little about Introductory Physics, henceforth called 8.01, at MIT: 8.01 is your standard introductory physics class taught with your non-standard teaching style: TEAL. (Have you noticed that people here seem to have an overwhelming desire to give everything an acronym?) TEAL, in its extended form, is \"Technology-Enabled Active Learning,\" and in its true form probably resembles Satan, or whatever evil being it is you believe in (and if you don't believe in one, you will soon). Wait, did I just say that? Pretend I didn't. Let me be a bit more politically correct. Completely unofficial studies (read: asking Everyone I Know) have resulted in a heavily-supported hypothesis that No One Likes Teal. In true MIT fashion, we will call this theory NOOLT. I strongly suspect the NOOLT phenomenon occured because TEAL, as I overheard someone whose name I can't remember say, \"is the perfect example of when too much technology can be a bad thing.\" We sit in tables of nine in groups of three. Each group has a computer to enable the learning process. Most of the time, though, it's used to watch the power point that's already projected in four (or more) different places around the room. (Sometimes these computers are used for Facebook. We're going to ignore that data.) In the beginning of the year, we took a diagnostic test and we were assigned to tables in a fashion that would keep an even distribution of physics background at the tables (meaning that all the people who took AP Physics in high school wouldn't sit in the same place). This is all geared towards collaborative learning, which is nice in theory, but what happened in my experience is that the people at the table who knew what they're doing would work through the problem, and I would be left in the dark in terms of where this equation came from and what that one means. The idea was to learn from eachother, except that I feel that we do plenty of this while working on p-sets. Personally, I'd like classtime to be geared more towards learning from the teacher. The point is, even though it's supposedly part of the \"freshman experience,\" (I don't like that phrase, but that's another entry for another day) to be in the same sinking boat and eventually coming out on top by figuring out how to, I don't know, fix the boat, I'm not entirely convinced that it'd be smooth sailing from then on. What I mean by that perfectly awful metaphor is that I'm not that great at classical mechanics, and even if I somehow figured out how to get around my feelings towards TEAL, I'd still struggle a lot in the class. I wasn't looking forward to letting physics continue to feed on my soul for the entire year - it was really cutting into my other classes and my happiness. Luckily, there are answers for people in this situation! MIT very rarely leaves you with no choice. Many NOOLT-sympathizers have switched from 8.01 to 8.01L, which is another introductory physics class. It's geared towards people with little-to-no physics or calculus background and I've heard great things about it. For example, there's a lot more support available for it. They have lecture and recitation. In recitation they can ask their TAs questions and even though the class runs an extra month (through IAP), they can take the time to actually learn and understand the material. I didn't switch into 8.01L for several reasons. The main one was that there was a scheduling conflict with my Favorite Class (ooh, a mystery). But looking back, I'm glad that scheduling conflict was there. Now I'm taking three classes I like and one GIR, and I'm perfectly happy. Now, Before bringing this insanely long entry to a close, I'd like to note a few things. The first is that even though I have yet to meet anyone that likes TEAL, that doesn't mean that everyone hates it. First of all, I haven't met Everyone. And even if someone doesn't like TEAL, it doesn't mean that they dislike it as much as I do. They may not care either way. It works for some people (I don't know who, but I'm trying to be optomistic); it didn't work for me. This is in no way trying to convince you that TEAL is bad - you may have no problem - I wrote about it mostly to show you all that if something is making you terribly unhappy, there are very often ways to change that. The second thing is that I spent a lot of time complaining that I hated physics my first month here. But after listening to a lot of people's points of view, I've decided that I do not, in fact, hate physics. I mean, there are hundreds of people here that love physics. There must be something good about it. And I hope that one day, when I finally take a class that's not 8.01 TEAL, I'll appreciate the subject matter more. The point is, if you ever find yourself in a class you hate, consider the fact that it may be the environment and not the subject matter that you are discontent with. Your life will be significantly happier if you give everything a second thought and chance instead of dwelling on how much you hate or can't do something. The THIRD (and last, I promise) thing is that even though I plan on spreading my GIRs out instead of taking them all at once, there are a couple arguments that go the other way. First of all, your first semester is Pass/No Record, so it's nice to be able to take classes you may not particularly enjoy with that safety net. Also, I know a few people who are taking as many GIRs as possible their freshman year so they can focus more on what they enjoy in the coming years. Finally, you have to remember that I am fairly certain about what I want to do with my life. Many people do not know what they're interested in, and that's okay, and in this case, the GIRs can be a nice way to explore subjects before committing to a major your sophomore year. In conclusion, be rational and do what's best for you. I hope those of you working through your senior year can keep this and your own happiness in mind.

And yet you can see them. Yeah, it's physics (simple conclusion on the basis of how light works). If you take a cat and a radioactive atom and put them both in box and close the box and do not make any observations of the system then there will exist a stage when the cat is both alive and dead at the very same time (like a zombie cat). That's physics too (quantum mechanics). If you travel at a high enough speed for a long enough duration, then when you come back to earth, you'll be younger than your son (or younger brother or twin or whatever you get the idea). That's physics again (theory of relativity. Search for the twin paradox.).  If quantum mechanics is true, and there are endless number of parallel universes with all sorts of possibilities, then there exists a universe where you are possibly dating Emma Watson (or Daniel Radcliffe if you are a female). Physics strikes yet again. Trying finding the reason behind all these and then read this amazingly beautiful book called Fundamentals Of Physics by Resnick-Halliday-Walker. If all the above facts and this book fail to make you love physics, then physics isn't for you. ",

            "answer_text": "To learn to love Physics, first you need to have an interest in and a sense of wonder about the subject. As one of my greatest \"teachers\" in mastering information, information architect Richard Saul  Wurman, once said, in his fine book, 'Information Anxiety': \"Learning can be seen as the acquisition  of information, but before it can take place, there must be interest;  interest permeates all endeavors and precedes learning.  In order to  acquire and remember new knowledge, it must stimulate your curiosity in  some way... \" Interest can generally start from understanding the significance of the subject in the larger scheme of things around us: - Physics teaches us to think logically and analyse rationally, on top of bringing in a lot of perspectives to any problem; - Physics is crucial to understanding the world around us, the world inside us, and even the larger world beyond us; - Physics is the most basic and fundamental science, as it encompasses the study of our larger universe; - Physics is also the basis of many other sciences: chemistry, oceanography,  seismography, astronomy, biological and even medical sciences; - Physics is the basis of our most modern technology, as it made a lot of things possible, without which we would not be able to enjoy modern  technological conveniences and advances, like our smart phones and the  Internet; Further interest can garner from understanding the significance of the subject in relation to other subjects we already know, as well as its significant contribution to our future employability and career tracking.

            "answer_text": "The thing about any physics class is that it deals with physics but it isn\u2019t exactly physics. Physics is this ancient human tradition of following our curiosity to know our world. It\u2019s a field of study where our very own humanness is the main drive. Sure, we call it a \u201cscience\u201d because it is done logically and methodically, but it only moves forward when driven by human imagination and strong emotional sentiments. Physics requires us to have a balanced mastery of our logical and illogical aspects \u2014 in other words, it requires us to be truly in-tune with our humanity. More scientists should be more comfortable with calling themselves artists because that's what the field is mostly about. It's about taking fragments of our natural world and reconstructing it in such a way that any human being would be able to appreciate that aspect of the natural world. That's why I get uncomfortable when people think that I may be talented or smart just because I do physics. At that point, they are not complimenting me, rather, they are buying into this false narrative that only special people have the unique powers to probe into the nature of reality. But as humans, we come with innate curiosity, imagination, emotions, and a sense of aesthetics that allow us to pose profound questions. And really, that is all you need to do science -- all you have to be is to be truly human. Make mistakes, have regrets, be frustrated, run around, rest when tired, then keep searching, and learn something. It's a messy and difficult process, but at the end of it, you will not only have a description of the natural world, but also a description of how we relate to it as human beings. Good science should reassure us that the world is messy but beautiful, complicated but understandable, uncaring but profound, and amidst everything that is going on right now, that the possibility of a better future, does exist. Tap in to those spaces within you that makes you who you are. From there, you\u2019ll realize that just by being human, you are already involved in this beautiful tradition of trying to understand the universe and our place within it. ",

As I was in class X , I wrote about 15 formulas(later realised that they are complex notations of simpler formulas)to calculate many physical quantities. First one I wrote in class 7 and the dimensional analysis we study in class XI, I actually figured it out in class 7 when I was introduced to force, Newton equations of motion and energy as formula seems to be quite illegal. For eg. When my teacher wrote accidentally wrote in class \u201c Speed of water flow into the pipe = volume of water \u201d I questioned and he corrected it but he asked how I found it and I replied that unit of speed is m/s and unit of volume is m^3. How they can be equal. Sir told me that this is the basic idea of dimensional analysis of class 11. I used to watch documentaries of great scientists and got fascinated by those SR equations and dreamt that one day I could understand them and create my own formulas. I never joined any coaching or tution till 9th I used to study and spend free time in creating new formulas just by putting values and algebraic identities. I love nuclear physics since class X. But also at class X , My parents insisted me to join coaching. Every body was only focused for boards and didn't know a single thing about class 11 syllabus, even the names of chapters or how many physics books are there in 11th. So started skipping coaching and studying at home doing some researches also. I searched for mathematical areas required for quantum mechanics and founded that 1st I have to make a firm grip over calculus, vectors etc. So I started studying them at class X. When our boards started I choose some selected questions and did them and continued my calculus. I was lucky that that year boards were quite easy so I scored 95+ in science and mathematics but just drowned other subjects and got 88%. But when I entered in class XI all things were in my control. I completed vectors , calculus, sets , relations and functions and after that I was aiming modern physics ( key to quantum mechanics) but I started to study basic kinematics. I didn't joined any coaching just completed ncert and resnick halliday and university physics. I was now the master of class 12 physics in the starting session of 12th and decided to further study multi variable calculus and then tensors. At the end of my 12th boards scored 90% overall because I messed up English and Ped. Then I got pressure from my mother to teach tutions to class X students. I taught 5 tutions a day and advised them to study few glimpse of class 11 also. Rest of my time was devoted to physics. Then I opted Bsc and prepared for kvpy sb. I cleared it and now I am in IISER doing masters\u2026. ",

You can watch The Royal Institution lectures, which gives a simplistic approach to understand various aspects and application of physics and challenges. Their lectures are wonderfully inspiring and can bring intrest in fundamental science. You can have a jump start understanding fundamentals of physics from the book Amazon.in: David Halliday, Robert Resnick Jearl Walker: Books You have to love maths, without which, you cannot move forward in physics. Maths is something you need to learn, by solving ton of problems, Differential and Integral Calculus vol 1 and 2 by Piskinov can be a good start to learn advanced mathematics. Problems in general physics by IE Irodov could be a good starting point, sharpening your skills to apply mathematics to physics in problems of real word. Amazon.in: I E Irodov: Books You do this much with full heart, and your mind is in seeking answers to questions, I should say you will be looking for higher studies in physics by now. At this point, you have to get out of India and enroll in a university in US, UK, France, Germany or Russia. Good Luck. ",
