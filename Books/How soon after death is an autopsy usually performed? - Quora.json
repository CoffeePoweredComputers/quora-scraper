            "answer_text": "This is a question I get at death scenes when I\u2019m working with the police department. Families want to know, and I have to tell them something! If an autopsy is ordered by the county attorney, then the county pays for it. If the family requests one, then they pay for it. If the cause of death is not under questionable circumstances (if there was an underlying health issue), and the family doctor is willing to sign off on it, then no autopsy is usually performed. With this back story, here\u2019s what happens when an autopsy has been ordered in our city (it may differ elsewhere). A professional removal company, whose job is just transporting bodies, comes on the scene after the police investigation is done, and removes the body. It is zipped up in a body bag, secured with a zip tie and an ID tag, placed on a gurney, and transported in a plain white van with no markings to the morgue, where the body is kept in refrigeration until such time as the autopsy is performed. Depending upon the backlog, it may take somewhere between 24 and 48 hours to be completed. In my 18 years doing this job, I\u2019ve never experienced an autopsy to take much longer than 24 hours; but consider that holidays and weekends can factor into this. The forensic pathologists and assistants on duty are sufficient enough to do things in an expedient manner. Once the autopsy is done, the body is transported to the mortuary; sometimes the removal company does it, and sometimes the mortuary does it themselves, depending upon the mortuary itself. What happens once the body is at the mortuary is on their schedule and according to the various contributing factors (direct cremation, embalming, restorative work, cosmetizing, casketing, etc.). The mortician/funeral director will be able to give you a timetable. Just be patient! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the type of autopsy and the circumstances. Many natural hospital deaths get autopsies. I am not familiar with the policies and practices of hospitals, and I image it would vary with staffing and need. I have worked with 2 medium size Medical Examiner\u2019s Offices- and both work the same. Autopsies and postmortem exams are done in the mornings on Monday through Saturdays. No exams are done on Sundays- although the office is staffed and we accept decedents. Therefore Mondays are the busiest. On Saturdays there is usually only one pathologist and one or two autopsy technicians. Occasionally on this day if it is extremely busy or if there is a complex case- there will be some cases held for Monday. But typically, on Monday-Friday, there are up to 4 pathologists working- more if we have fellows in training. There is usually one autopsy technician for each pathologist, and if we are fully staffed a floater or two. It the offices I have worked at - 95 % of the time the autopsy (or external exam) was done by the afternoon the next day. If the death occurred early in the morning, and they were close to the office, it may be done the same day. Most days start t with a morning meeting at 0830am. Present are pathologists, autopsy techs, investigators, toxicologist, and a secretary. The Medicolegal Death Investigator will present each case and the circumstances. The the pathologists will divvy them up between them- with the path who was on call the night before getting the worst and /or the most complex cases. Depending on how busy were are each pathologist has between 1\u20135 cases. Not all of these will be autopsies- some will be external exams with toxicology. A non-complex autopsy takes about an hour- but there are several more hours of paperwork and testing involved that are done after the decedent has been released to the funeral home. Usually the autopsy suite is empty and cleaned by noon or 2pm; but we have had much longer days on occasion. Now in very large cities they usually have a backlog and the exams are not done by the next day. But an autopsy can be done much later. We have exhumed bodies and autopsied years after their death. We also autopsy decomposed decedents and skeletal remains. Obviously crucial evidence may no longer be available and the death manner may bet \u2018undetermined\u2019. ",
