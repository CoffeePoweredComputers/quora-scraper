            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. Let's assume Russia's opinion of Napoleon is derived from Napoleon's relation with the Russian Czar, Alexander.  They first met on a giant raft floating in the middle of the Niamen river. On the North bank were the crushed armies of Prussia and Russia, 70,000 soldiers. On the other side was the  French army, 170,000 soldiers who looked on as their leader, Napoleon, sailed to meet the Czar of Russia and discuss peace.    Alexander's first words to him were, \"I hate the English as much as you do. I am ready to second you in all your enterprises against them.\"  Alexander, then thirty years old, was fascinated by Napoleon. Their two-hour interview created a great impression, and the two became great allies. \"Never,\" said Alexander afterward, \"did I love any man as I loved that man.\" With Russia's alignment with France, Napoleon and Alexander spent weeks together in Tilsit, discussing the politics of the world.  In 1807, Alexander said of Napoleon, \"the great man! Tell him that I am devoted to him for life. My empire, my armies, are all at his disposal.\"   Unfortunately, despite Alexander's best wishes, their alliance could only hold for so long. Alexander was under constant and increasing pressure from Russian nobles and diplomats to repeal the alliance. The ideas of republican equality in France were at odds with any noble, and every monarchy. When war with England damaged Russian commerce, the pressure got worse. As the weight of his cabinet turned against him, Alexander struggled in vain. In 1812, he could no longer hold out, and again the two countries were at war.  Napoleon thought of Alexander as a man with rare grace and honor. While exiled in St. Helena, Napoleon reflected,  \"I would most willingly have maintained peace, being surrounded and overwhelmed by unfavorable circumstances; and all I have since learned convinced me that Alexander was even less desirous of war than myself.\"  ",

            "answer_text": "General population doesn't think a lot about Napoleon, maybe only during large celebrations. \"Napoleon\" is a name of very popular creme cake in Russia. Brandy \"Napoleon\" is not that popular. As for state funded propaganda, Napoleon cult in France, supprisingly, is presented as an analogue to Stalin cult in Russia thus presenting both of those cults as something classy, \"European\" and fun to have. As for historical perspective, Russians fought extremely hard wars against Anathema and Buonaparte (as he was called), but due to victory over Napoleon military genius Alexander I became World monarch #2 - highest position Russia ever got. So there are mixed feelings. Funny thing is that, Napoleon was an idol for Russian intellectuals during first half of XIX century due to his astonishing career progress. He was even mentioned for that in best Russian poem ever (or novel in verses) \"Eugene Onegin\" by A.Pushkin (but satirically of course). ",
