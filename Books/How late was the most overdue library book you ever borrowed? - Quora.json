            "answer_text": "Several months. I moved to a new home and lost the book in the course of moving. My new home was in the same library\u2019s service area. I got a notice in the mail forwarded from my old address. I took the notice to the library along with a utility bill for proof of my new address. I explained the situation, paid for the value of the book and got my address updated in the library\u2019s records. I felt awful about it, but it was probably one of the better interactions that library worker had with a patron that day. Somebody owning up to a mistake, accepting the penalty without complaint and thinking ahead to bring along proof of a new address doesn\u2019t happen all that often. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I found the book, but I did make things right with the library when I paid for its value, so I would count that as being months late, not years. Thanks for asking me to answer. ",
