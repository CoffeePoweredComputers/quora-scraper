            "answer_text": "I kind of thought dust was like air, or water, or gravity. It was just\u2026. there. You can\u2019t really be pro- or anti- it because it just existed. You can\u2019t really be pro-air or anti-air because it just exists whether you like it or not. Ditto with water. And ditto with gravity. I haven\u2019t read the books in a while, so I might have misremembered some key parts of the stories. I do remember Mrs Coulter and her Army of Goblers doing some experiments to discover the source of dust and possibly how to manipulate it (and he appeared to be against that) but as for dust itself, I am not sure he had a position one way or the other because it wasn\u2019t really possible to HAVE a position on it.

            "answer_text": "Lord Asriel was ultimately anti-church, and therefore, pro- whatever the church was against. Now, the church hated Dust. Dust, to them, was the physical manifestation of original sin, and they strived to destroy it. Once Lord Asriel discovered this, he decided that if the church thought it was evil, it must really be good, and that it was of paramount importance to save it from those seeking to eliminate it. So therefore, he made it one of his goals to protect Dust and destroy the church. ",
