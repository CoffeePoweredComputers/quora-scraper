            "answer_text": "Have you written a book? Trying to get a publisher that can take care of editing, formatting, cover design, listing on Amazon and Kindle, distribute paperback copies to customers when they buy from online sites. Well, in that case, you need to find a publisher in India, most of them are self-publishing companies. There are scores of companies in India but they charge good amount of money and do not market your book. So, in this case I would suggest you to pick up a company that is professional yet budget friendly. One such good one is BookMedia, it has offices all across India, and give over 50 percent royalty. The good thing is that they are honest with their clients. Hope this helps you! ",
