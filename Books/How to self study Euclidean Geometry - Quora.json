            "answer_text": "Yes. YOU CAN Also be more clear on your intent.  How deep would you like to go?  Are you trying to understand High school level geometry, or are you trying to construct a 17 side equilateral polygon on a circle? (I think Euler did that already anyways) If your goal is \"High School Level Geometry\" you can actually learn quite a lot in 20 days, if you spend about 6 hours a day. Also do remember that the basic useful complex figure that will help you walk a long way is actually \"TRIANGLE\".  If you get really good with triangles then you can solve almost any question reducing the complex questions into \"triangles\" ... Surprising enough you could even solve Circle related questions based on triangle properties or comparisons.   Good Luck  * A quality mentor would totally \"NOT HURT\" too. ",

Go to the Internet Archive eBooks and Texts and enter \u201cplane geometry\u201d. You\u2019ll find quite a variety. For example, Plane geometry by J.W.A. Young & L.L. Jackson. (Incidentally, J.W.A. Young got his Ph.D. at Clark University under William Story, and William Story was later the advisor of Solomon Lefshetz, advisor of Norman Steenrod, advisor of Peter Freyd, advisor of David Joyce.)
