            "answer_text": "Once you\u2019ve made your book available on Amazon at the lowest possible price, offer it for free on your own website. Have a friend alert Amazon that the book is available at a lower price, and their automatic system will set your price to zero to match that price. Naturally, there are some caveats: Amazon does not allow publishers to sell books for free via their website. Amazon exists to make money and 65% of $0 is $0. They will delist your book.Amazon is more likely to look the other way when you offer a book for free if you have other books that are part of the same series as that first book. If people like the first free book, they will spend money to find out how the rest of the story goes. So far, Amazon has tolerated this particular situation because it does generate more sales which translates into more money.Offering a first book as a freemium (industry slang for offering the first book in a series for free as a loss leader) works when you have a bunch more books that follow it. If you only have one other book, don\u2019t bother trying it.Amazon can change their mind at any time and either allow or disallow this kind of price manipulation.You are pretty much at Amazon\u2019s mercy. If Amazon thinks your book will sell at a different price, they can unilaterally change the price without your permission (you\u2019d better read the contract you signed when you opened your account). They\u2019ve never done this to me, but they have done it to a few others in the past.There is very much a phenomenon called Perceived Value. Wherein, the customer rates the quality the object sold based on its price. Offer your book for free or at the lowest possible price, and it will harvest the worst reviews you can imagine. Offer the exact same book for a few dollars more, and you harvest nothing but praise from reviewers. So think twice before you undercut the value of your work.",

            "answer_text": "| Can you publish a book on KDP for no price? Technically no, you can\u2019t, as KDP does not have the $0.00 price point. However, many publishers (independent or otherwise) simply use Amazon\u2019s price match service. They publish and sell the book elsewhere (I do so on Smashwords, as well as Draft2Digital, which distributes my titles to B&N, Apple and Kobo), set the price to $0.00 and then go to their book page on Amazon and use the \u201creport lower price\u201d button. It may take some time, and Amazon does have their own discretion as to which particular product or item they will price match, but usually this is how you get to sell an ebook for free on Amazon.  Another way to give away your book for free on Amazon is to enroll your title into the KDP Select program. This means you give Amazon the exclusive right to distribute your book (enrollment lasts 90 days, automatically renewable unless you opt out) and you must not have it distributed elsewhere. If your title is on Select, you get a 5 days Free window in which you can set the price to $0.00 and promote your book the way you see fit. Select also offers another promotional tool called Countdown sales where you can set a countdown window and the range of prices with which you want to promote the book. (For example, you set the countdown to 3 days and the sales start at $0.99. You can set it so Day 2 will sell your book at $1.99, and Day 3 at $2.99 - and when the Countdown ends, the price goes back to normal.)  Price match is a bit difficult to reverse, while Free from Select only gives you 5 days, so consider which one is more suitable to your overall campaign. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the best way to self-publish your book for free on Amazon KDP? You can\u2019t publish the book on Amazon KDP for free - however, if you choose the 35% royalty option, you can sell the book as a Kindle (e-book) edition for 99 cents. That\u2019s almost free. However, you also have to remember that if you try to sell the book too cheap that it\u2019s almost as bad as selling it for too much: people may not think that it is a good book as it\u2019s selling for too little. Plus, you put time and effort into writing the book so you deserve some money. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Amazon KDP makes no charges for publishing but pays the author royalties on ebooks sold. That doesn\u2019t mean there are no costs involved. You might pay someone to edit your book, format it and produce a cover. If you want to sell it you will need to promote it also and that can cost a lot of money. Despite that it\u2019s still possible to do the entire process for nothing if you have the skills. ",

            "answer_text": "No. KDP requires a standard minimum price of $0.99. The ways to discount to free are 1.) sign up for KDP select, accrue free/discount days, and use them. Or 2.) publish via KDP, and then publish your book with a $0.00 retail price via another platform such as Kobo. Eventually Amazon will discover the lower price and lower your title to match it. This is how to achieve \"perma-free\" titles on Amazon. Happy Writing! ",

The trick was to put the book on another website for free, then wait for Amazon to match the price - having a few friends contact them sped this along. However, Amazon has wised up to this practice, and they now frown on it. If you try to use this trick, you\u2019ll likely just get a message telling you to remove your book from any and all free sites, under pain of being dropped from KDP. I wouldn\u2019t recommend trying it. ",
