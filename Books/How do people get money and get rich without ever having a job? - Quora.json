            "answer_text": "Some of the richest people in the world have managed to get rich without every having a job. Most are entrepreneurs. This may or may not qualify as a job from your point of view. There is only one investor in the Fortune 500 and that's Warren Buffet. Still this is possible or might be possible. The Fortune 500 isn't a huge list and easily a few disproportionate individuals can really skew results. As others have pointed out, inheritance is another option as well. On average having a job will not make you rich. The reason is that most of the value you generate will not go to you but to someone else (ie: owner/shareholders/paying for overhead/managers/etc.) Having a job can get you into the middle class but won't make you rich. Rich Dad does recommend starting your own business. Many others have advocated real estate. The truth is that you need to find something that works for you. At the end of the day you have to find a way to capture the value you generate and scale.The better and more cheaply you can scale, the better. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "If you really enjoy what you do, then its not a job. Its more like a hobby. Creating a solution or a startup as its your passion, enables you to keep going when others fall. This is a huge advantage. You could argue that a large number of Entrepreneurs fall in this category. Have a clear understanding in your head that allows you to differentiate between jobs and hobbies. They may take the same amount of work, time and effort, but one you pay to perform and the other you get paid to perform. Which camp do you want to be in? Being paid for what you love to do is at the pinnacle of life's acheivements. Why would you do anything else, or even consider it?  Keep this in mind when your kids choose a career and you try to steer them away to something \"more sensible\". Doing something solely for monetary reward has inherent limitations and allows you to be easily distracted by other opportunities. Its like a guy constantly chasing hot young girls at the bar, theres always going to be something new to catch his eye and a enduring relationship will never form. ",
