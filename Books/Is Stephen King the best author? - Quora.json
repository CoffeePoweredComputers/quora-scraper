            "answer_text": "The way he writes his stories create a realistic world, with realistic characters and realistic settings and once you start reading you\u2019re finding yourself immersed into his story. Everything he writes is normal until he plunges them into a situation where everything they know cannot happen, happens. And normal people suddenly have to deal with something that is completely an utterly not normal. Many claim in horror things are farfetched and deal with zombies, demons and whatever that\u2019s far from what we know and belief. King does rarely touch any of those \u2018classic\u2019 horror aspects and goes for a much simpler direction: the \u2018What if\u2019. Look at a completely normal situation in life and wonder what would happen if \u2026 A great example is his story The Sun Dog. It\u2019s about a kid who gets a nice camera that ejects a photo once it\u2019s taken. Normal stuff. But King did a what if and all of a sudden the camera only takes pictures on a single object, regardless of what he tries to capture. And that single object progresses through time, so the kid sees what happens to the object every time he takes a new picture. It\u2019s a very normal situation, having a camera. Chances are you have one too. But King came up with an idea to make that normal situation have an odd twist and giving the reader a feeling that it could happen to them as well, if they were unfortunate enough to get their hands on that particular camera. He doesn\u2019t need to explain the how and why, because in the real world we wouldn\u2019t be able to do so either. But he only describes the fact that it is \u2026 and that we have to deal with it. And that\u2019s something he\u2019s great at, because his storytelling allows us to imagine that it\u2019s as real as it could be, because his characters, situations and settings are so relatable and realistic. Does that mean he\u2019s a great writer? Not everyone believes so. Foremost, people think because he writes fiction and not literature, he\u2019ll never be considered one of the classic writers. But then again, Lovecraft managed to do so as well. His prose is not always great either, but it does fit the story and the characters he uses, so I\u2019m not surprised if he would do it intentionally. It could just as well be because he\u2019s writing like that because he likes writing like that. He always said he was writing to appeal to a wide audience, which included people with only a basic reading education. So his prose might just as well be \u2018toned down\u2019 so everyone able to read a book will be able to read his. But despite his flaws, intentionally or not, he managed to write a lot of stories which focus entirely on storytelling. Whether he\u2019s writing horror, thriller, drama, crime, everything oozes the same atmosphere that screams his name. It\u2019s no wonder that even when he wrote under his pen name \u2018Richard Bachman\u2019, people started buying those books as well and someone eventually figured out it was King behind that name. And you might wonder, thriller, drama and crime? Isn\u2019t he a horror writer? Oh, he is. But he has displayed his skills at writing different genres as well. Short stories like The Shawshank Redemption or The Body (made into a movie \u2018Stand by me\u2019) are his as well and when they made movies out of them, many people who didn\u2019t like his horror novels enjoyed those too. So he is a lot more versatile than many people think he is. He\u2019s not restricted to horror, he can come up with his \u2018what if\u2019 even without going the horror way. Hope that gives you a bit more insight in the \u2018why\u2019 part. ",

            "answer_text": "He is my absolute favorite author so how long do you have? Kidding aside, my favorite thing is how he takes something relatively safe, or safe at one time, and turns it\u2019s into a psychological thriller. Like with the book Cell. Everyone has a cellphone now but what if someone found away to turn those phones into a weapon that could control humans? (SK doesn\u2019t have a cellphone.) He seems to be able to do that with anything. Who hasn\u2019t found something in their backyard and wanted to dig it up (The Tommyknockers)?Who hasn\u2019t thought about what would happen in 95% of the world got sick and died\u2026maybe that\u2019s a stretch (The Stand). Who hasn\u2019t thought about the crazy lengths they\u2019d go in order to save a dying family member (The Talisman)? Who hasn\u2019t thought about a parallel universe (The Talisman, The Gunslinger/Dark Tower series)? I could go on and on. Sure there\u2019s some gore, and more in some books than others, but the ability to step back and ask the hypothetical and then stitch together a wild ride of a story. He also includes pop culture references, thinks about his readers, and really cares about what he writes and the content he delivers to the fans. If you\u2019re not big on reading try The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon or Gwendy\u2019s Button Box. They\u2019re shorter than his usual stories but not short stories. Both grabbed my attention right away and were hard to put down, but I am a \u201cConstant Reader\u201d. ",
