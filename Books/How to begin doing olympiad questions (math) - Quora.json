            "answer_text": "There isn't a specific way to start doing Olympiad problems. The more you know, the more you should be able to apply. Grab some Olympiad questions and see how many you can do. Find out what you need to know to do the ones you couldn't do. By doing this you may be able to discover new stuff on your own by experimenting. That's how you learn and develop. One day you'll find yourself solving maximum number of math Olympiad problems from any specific year and from any question paper. This will take time, because its a power that comes with hard work, and determination. It's a power like none other, because the way you see the world will change dramatically. ",
