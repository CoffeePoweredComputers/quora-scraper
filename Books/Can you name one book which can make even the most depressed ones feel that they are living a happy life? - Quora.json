Krishna, the supreme personality of godhead guarantees in 18.54- brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101 na \u015bocati na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati sama\u1e25 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u mad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m Translation- One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me. But remember that this verse is from last chapter of the whole Bhagvad Gita. So, make sure to apply all the previous shlokas to claim the guarantee given by God. ",
