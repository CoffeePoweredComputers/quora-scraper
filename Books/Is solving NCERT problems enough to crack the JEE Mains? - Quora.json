            "answer_text": "No. Although solving NCERT problems is highly recommended but merely solving NCERT will not be sufficient. You must also solve last 15 years of JEE Main papers. This will give you fair practice and idea of what is being asked in JEE. Moreover, NCERT questions are mainly subjective that will help building your concepts but past papers of JEE Main will give you actual JEE level time bound practice. ",
