            "answer_text": " You\u2019ve heard of people who laugh when you tell them a joke, laugh when you explain it to them, and laugh again when they finally get it. There are times when I find myself wondering if I\u2019m one of those people. I remember feeling that way after reading Norman Mailer\u2019s Why Are We in Vietnam? The narrator is a young Texan named Randy (D.J.) Jethroe. D.J. and his dad Rusty Jethroe, and D.J.\u2019s best friend Tex Hyde go big game hunting in Alaska\u2019s Brooks Mountain Range with a guide named Big Luke Fellinka. D.J.\u2019s daddy is gunning for a grizzly bear. Rusty and his son do some bonding in the wilderness. Here\u2019s the part where Rusty shows D.J. a little white flower he identifies as saxifrage: \u201cKnow what saxifrage means, kid?\u201d \u201cYou tell me.\u201d \u201cRock buster. That little white flower is a rock buster. Any saxifrage is strong enough to grow and split a rock.\u201d And D.J. reels with that, cause he thinks of the little green shoot (or is it white? underground, just nipple tit out of the seed) getting its white nose into the smallest crack of the rock and pushing and the rock pushing back, and it swelling to crack the rock and the rock not cracking, how can a soft shoot move rock? Yeah, well it sends out the word to the root and the root pulls into the basic ass power of the earth and draws a force, a subterranean thunder, Wanda, and womb, woom woom woom, one little blast of swell, that shoot is harder than rock for one micromillionth of a second, it got a hard on, Herbert, and the rock stone pussy cracks, and up comes boykinia the local saxifrage. Just rock buster. D.J. is humper-ding with sweet pores of thought. Damn. \u2014 Norman Mailer, Why Are We in Vietnam? (New York: G.P. Putnam\u2019s Sons, 1967), p. 114 I hadn\u2019t heard of rockfoils before, so I guess the time I spent reading Why Are We in Vietnam? wasn\u2019t a total waste. Mailer finally brings up the subject of Vietnam on the last page of his novel, where he mentions it twice. D.J. is at a party in Dallas given in his honor, \u201cbecause tomorrow Tex and me, we\u2019re off to see the wizard in Vietnam.\u201d Then more stream-of-consciousness ravings, followed by the book\u2019s last two sentences: This is D.J., disc jockey to America, turning off. Vietnam, hot damn. \u2014 Why Are We in Vietnam?, p. 183 According to the literati, Mailer\u2019s novel itself is the implicit answer to the question its title poses. In other words, America wound up fighting a war in Vietnam because of our toxic masculinity\u2014swinging dicks with a penchant for violence. Somehow I think the conceit would have worked better had Norman Mailer called his novel Why We Are in Vietnam instead. Knowhutimean? Just so idiots like myself would get it. Have you ever read a book that has a great title, but the title has nothing to do with the book\u2019s content? ",
