            "answer_text": "No. Narcissism exists on a spectrum. Having none is unhealthy. Having lots is boorish for others. Having an appropriate self-confidence requires a healthy amount of narcissism. Some people have Narcissistic Personality Disorder. This actually derives from having nigh-on zero levels of narcissism. Sufferers with such low-self-esteem are so ashamed that they adopt a \u201cfalse self\u201d - a seemingly confident and charming persona. This, however, is nothing more than a facade to mask their \u201creal self\u201d. So whilst narcissism per se doesn\u2019t involve a Jekyll & Hyde character, pathological narcissism, or NPD, most certainly does. It is famously difficult for bystanders to see the \u201cfalse self\u201d - even psychologists and psychiatrists can be fooled. This very toxic \u201creal self\u201d, the Mr Hyde, is saved for their nearest and dearest who are subtly, and often not very subtly, psychologically abused behind closed doors. Narcopaths will stop at nothing to protect their dark little secret. Building and maintaining the con trick is their life\u2019s work - literally. It requires constant feeding with what is called narcissistic supply. Hence the pathological lies, the manipulation, and the mission to destroy anyone who threatens to uncover them. Beware. Please follow me for further insight into NPD. ",
