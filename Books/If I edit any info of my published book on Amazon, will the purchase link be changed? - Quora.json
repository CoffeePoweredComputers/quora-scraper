            "answer_text": "No. The link will not change. The purchase links of all products on Amazon are associated with an ASIN - Amazon Standard Identification Number, a ten-digit alphanumeric unique identifier to distinguish it from other products on Amazon. You can find it listed in the Product Details section:  Further, the purchase link will either appear in the below formats: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/ASIN123456or https://www.amazon.com/dp/ASIN123456 where ASIN123456 is the unique ASIN tied to that product. I have changed titles, changed covers as well as changed story elements within the book, but the book link remained the same. Amazon gives you a lot of flexibility with your book. So you can freely edit with no worries about the book link changing. All the best with your book, and I hope it turns out to be a best seller. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "No. A changed existing book has the same URL. I\u2019ve made plenty of changes to my ebooks. I\u2019ve even changed the cover and the book kept the same link. If you make dramatic changes to a book, such as adding or deleting a few thousand words, it should be sold as a different book. If you\u2019re applying ISBNs, it will need a new one. Generally, I don\u2019t bother with an ISBN for Amazon editions. I just use the ASIN. Same idea, though. Change a lot and you should re-issue the book rather than updating the existing files. ",
