            "answer_text": "Almost entire show is scripted only some of the moments are improvised. The writers, directors, cameramen, producers, BBC all play a vital role in planning an episode. Just look at the awesome camera angles they capture at the right time, that's not possible if it wasn't planned. And many times on the show Jeremy jokes about receiving an award for the best non scripted program on television, that should give you a good understanding. ",

            "answer_text": "It seems sometimes that it isn't scripted.  There would probably be parts of a script,  e.g. keywords, topics.  These would act as hints,  but the presenters just make up what they say.  Either this or they have scripts but make it sound like there isn't any.Top Gear probably is scripted, just only in a  minor way. ",
