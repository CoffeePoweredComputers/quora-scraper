            "answer_text": "Dr. Ambedkar is one of the founding fathers of Modern India and his ideas may eventually impact the world too(However there is very much to do in India itself ).He is inspiring in two ways - firstly, through his invaluable contribution as a considerable scholar as well as a person of great actions. Another way is the virtually insurmountable obstacles that he overcame to reach there. Let us review him on both fronts - Achievements and Contributions- 1.Scholar - As a scholar he was a top class Economist, Sociologist,an authority on Law and Constitution,Philosopher,Democrat and has contributed much in other fields like in History, Religious studies,etc. In all these areas he was an original thinker. Uniquely among his contemporaries, he used his ideas by creatively adating and applying them in Indian context while also keeping in mind the world phenomena at large. 2. Activism- Foremost contribution as an activist is that he shook the exploitative and dehumanising ( much like Slavery) caste/Varna hierarchies ideologically as well as through actions. Simultaneously he struggled to emancipate the Dalit classes(or Untouchable classes),who bear the direct brunt of disgusting inhuman Caste/Varna system( much like slaves).Dr. Ambedkar contributed significantly in the democratisation of India by being the cheif architect of the Indian constitution as well as through his insighful thoughts on Democracy. He also contributed much towards gender justice in his various capacities as scholar, Law Minister,etc. Another contribution is the revival of socially engaged Buddhism in India(in a unique form to promote democracy and social morality).Apart from that he worked for poors through spreading education among them,by being Lawyer and journalist promoting human rights and democracy,framing labours laws protective of labourers, promoting economic development( particularly in the power and water sector). Overcoming Difficulties- All his contribution becomes more significant by empathetically feeling the difficulties of being an untouchable.Even though Dalits or Untouchables remained the most exploited class after tribals in India,their conditions before Ambedkar was no better than slaves.Before Ambedkar they formed the lowest class in Indian society who were forced to do only menial jobs (like manual scavenging) which they couldn't change throughout life. They were forced to avoid touching other classes,never given any education,always forced to be dependent on others as agricultural labourers or bonded labourers and without any security of their lives,their women were sexually exploited by landlords and they were denied access to public ponds, temples and other amenities. Their life was very much like slaves whose labour was exploited forcefully and were denied even dignity. In this Dalit/untouchable class the disgusting features of exploitative caste/Varna hierarchies were found ugly manifestation in the form of rape, murder, mutilation,etc of them..Worse still, this system was forced by religion and superstitions of people as well as the force of landlords or state. However Buddhism in ancient India, Bhakti Movement and sufism during Medieval India, and the modernity of the British empire and works of some christian missionaries challenged this order ,especially against its ugly manifestation in lower classes, in varied degrees. Dr. B.R.Ambedkar was born into this class in 14th April 1891. His father was in British military, he was born in Bombay presidency of British India with its modern institutions and many christian missionaries and this area had a rich tradition of Bhakti Movement (Ambedkar's family was Kabirpanthi i.e. those who follow Saint Kabir, a great Bhakti Saint in Medieval India). All these factors broke many limitations faced by the masses of untouchables in India. Hence Dr.Ambedkar didn't face much problems faced by an ordinary untouchable in his childhood. Also Bombay presidency had many progressive princely states who financially supported Dr.Ambedkar. Nevertheless Dr.Ambedkar faced and overcame many difficulties in his life. He was forced to sit outside classroom on the ground in his school days while other students sat inside class in benches. This is just because he was born an untouchable. He faced the burnt of caste throughout his life even when he was professor and lawyer. His companions used to practice untouchability against him. When he was a Labour Minister,the priests of Jagannath Temple in Puri denied access to him in the temple while they allowed the then Viceroy, a British.Hence he was treated inhumanly due to caste system. Secondly people never gave due recognition to him in his lifetime even though he worked for the country. When he first met Gandhi, he thought that Ambedkar was a guilt ridden Brahmin working for the untouchables. This is an excellent example of how peope in India think of other's achievements based on their caste. Even after his death, scholarly community and government hegemonised by upper caste forgot his scholarly works and contribution.Only after 1990s his ideas started getting attention and political class started recognising him. It is another matter that political class only give lip service to him and most scholars read about him very little and that too superficially. Most scholars either idolize him or give less preference to his ideas in comparison to other founding fathers(Gandhi ,Nehru,etc.).They write and form opinion about him as if they are authority on Dr. Ambedkar's works.However upon reading them they seems to be flawed on account of being either prejudiced or idolizing, clearly showing lack of serious engagement with his ideas even today. Another thing was about the sacrifices he gave for his mission .Dr. Ambedkar was a brilliant student of Columbia University ,New York ;London School of Economics and Gray's Inn ,London. Had he thought of living and working in US or Europe he could have enjoyed a luxurious life with his family. However, he choose to work for the Dalits and the nation. Due to this he had to live much of his life in poverty and his four out of five children died and later his beloved wife also died ,for whom he couldn't do much. He felt pain about this throughout his life .The casteist people always hurled abuses against him and made his mission difficult as his effort to give rights to the plebians of India was opposed to their privileges. Very often letters were sent to him to threaten him and sometimes he to face even the physical violence of casteist goons. Moreover,Dr.Ambedkar had a great strength of character. He was ready to sacrifice many things for his mission. He even resigned from the post of Law Minister when he was unable to pass the Hindu Code Bill in parliament which sought to enhance the rights of Hindu women significantly. Conclusions:- Dr.Ambedkar is a source of inspiration in many ways.One can get inspiration from his scholarly work and activism or his own difficulties, sacrifices and strength of character in face of such things. At the same time, we mustn't make him God or infallible or perfect because it will be a great disservice to him. He was a rationalist who courageously fought against superstitions and hero worship. We can find that he couldn't accomplished most of the things that he set out to do. On the other hand, what he achieved and fought for is very important.He gave the oppressed dignity and a sense of purpose. He gave hope and inspiration to many to fight for justice.And most importantly he made their path much easier.We must work to accomplish his ideals as it will make ourselves better human , our society a better society and our world a better world. Anyone can follow him irrespective of caste as caste system makes its beneficiaries more inhuman than those who are oppresed. It makes them unsympathetic to the woes of others and narrow in their thinking. It also makes them unable to recognise the importance of labour.In the same way , any person irrespective of religion can learn from him as his own contribution cut across religious boundaries ,and caste is paracticed by all major religious communities in India and it is a blot on their society too.

            "answer_text": "Babasaheb uplifted an entire section of oppressed class . He gave them their backbone , he brought them to a level which they hadn't even thought of in their dreams. He gave them goals and opportunities to achieve them. Till date there has been no other leader who did so much for his or her community, his people. As a matter of fact,he brought in rights for women from all sections of society and worked for laborers too. ",
