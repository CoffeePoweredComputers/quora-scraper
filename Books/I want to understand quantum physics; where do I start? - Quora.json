            "answer_text": "What made it for me is this book: A Beginner's Guide (Beginner's Guides) eBook: Alistair Rae: Amazon.ca: Kindle Store I read it when I was at the young age of 22. A late start since apparently 9 year olds are doing quantum mechanics nowadays and watching a few youtube videos makes you the master of this subject. I had zero interest in quantum mechanics - never heard of it, still doesn't understand the connection between \"quantum\" and \"mechanics\". But I knew that under the branch of physics there existed something called quantum physics. I wanted to know what \"quantum\" meant, it sounded fancy. I went to the library and borrowed this extraordinarily thin book. Purely out of curiosity. And I read it almost from front to back in a week. I gained a comprehensive perspective on quantum physics with absolutely zero bra-ket, manipulation of Schrodinger's equation, knowledge of hermitian, adjoint, unbounded operators what so ever. It was the starting point for me. Then I started to tackle more difficult areas in quantum physics but it took many years of schooling. You need to at least know linear algebra, ODE and Fourier transform to gain some perspective - but those subjects alone will take many years to \"master\". Griffith's quantum mechanics is a very light book but even lighter is the text by Robert Scherrer.  There is a huge competition in the quantum mechanics field by authors who either wants to create complete encyclopedia of all possible quantum phenomenons recorded ever or authors who want an encyclopedia of all possible questions involving quantum mechanics or authors who want text on quantum mechanics so mathematically involved and sophisticated that it will literally be 100% computation/manipulation of out of this world symbols and 0% interpretation. Beat them at this game by choosing something easy to enter the field, you have a life time to tackle those hard books. Know this, quantum mechanics will take a very long time to learn and appreciate completely. Even if you take a full year worth of quantum mechanic, there would still be much left for investigation. Suppose you finished the very very last topic of a huge quantum mechanics text - what's next? There are quantum computing, application of quantum mechanics in semiconductors (which will take a seriously long time to master and we are not even talking about employment opportunities), quantum algorithms, application to chemistry, biology, electrodynamics, optics...endless many related subjects and more investigation into deeper branches of mathematics.  Take it easy. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, this can be a great opportunity for you to start learning physics! Quantum mechanics can be really counter-intuitive and confusing, so for this reason I would suggest you to approach it through a systematic method. To start with you need some basic understanding of classical mechanics (momentum, energy, etc), especially wave theory (like solving coupled oscillator and later solving wave equation). Then you can get into quantum mechanics, starting from Planck's law, De Broglie law & uncertainty principle. These laws can be really confusing for beginners of quantum mechanics so please fully understand these laws before getting into Schrodinger's equation, which is the fun part of QM. As for the learning materials, there are many great lecture videos online, specifically MIT OCW, Coursera and edX. If you prefer reading I would suggest to use Feynman's Lectures (1 and 3, book 2 is on E&M) or Griffiths (one of the best textbook series although it might be too technical for non-physics majors). For math you would need to know basic differentiation and integration, but everything else can be picked up along the way. There's also a book called Dream of A Final Theory by Weinberg which covers a lot of the history and unsolved problems of QM, and it's a fun book to read. Last (but not least), do NOT read any material that claims QM has any relation with soul or any mystical, supernatural or metaphysical concept. QM is just what we use to describe nature, and those stupid claims are complete nonsense. ",
