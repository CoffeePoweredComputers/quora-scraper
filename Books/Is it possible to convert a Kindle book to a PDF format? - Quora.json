            "answer_text": "Is it possible to convert your kindle book to PDF format? The answer is, Yes! You can always convert your kindle books (and Kobo, google books etc) to PDF, mobi and ePub formats to read on other devices. (Important)Before converting them Kindle books are DRM protected (Digital Rights Management or DRM is a scheme that controls access to copyrighted material using technological means.) and use .mobi format. To convert them to PDF, you need a software which can first remove DRM protection and then convert it to pdf. If your publisher doesn\u2019t allow you to do so, it might be illegal to remove DRM. You can use it for personal use if you are not sharing it with others in some cases. Free tools to convert Kindle to pdf Free websites are there, but not good enough to use. You will see many missing characters in output and other possible errors as mentioned in some comments in the answers below. I found many missing pages while I was doing the same. Best software! I use Epubor Ultimate. It is a great software to switch your books from one format to another and it is frequently updated. It is a budget-friendly software and really fast in what it does. But don\u2019t do it for commercial reasons. It is wrong to do so legally and ethically. I use it to read my PDF books on Kindle and saving Kindle books in PDF formats. Hope it helps! ",

I\u2019ve detailed all instructions nicely here for you. Don\u2019t be dissuaded by the title if you\u2019re not a Linux user. Despite the title I did it all in Windows. Where are Amazon Kindle ebooks on my Linux PC after I download them for offline reading w/\"Kindle Cloud Reader\" Chrome app, & how to convert to PDF?
