I don\u2019t want to sound rude but Delirium, Pandemonium, and Requiem by Lauren Oliver were good books but Delirium the only one that made sense to me. I am finding the Matched series by Allie Condie to be similar with both characters having a person the society chooses for them, only for them to fall in love with someone else who is an exile/rebel from the wilderness and then they are taken away and they go on an adventure into the wilderness to go find them and end up either leading or being a key part in the rebellion against the similarly formed societies. I found the system to be quite similar with the one in The Giver by Lois Lowery as well. The Giver made complete sense until the end and I didn\u2019t have understand it at all. ",

            "answer_text": "I not only read one, I stole the Library Copy so I could read it again. I liked some parts so much I can recite them, and I used to threaten my kids with yet another recitation if they didn\u2019t behave:) The book was Edward Leer\u2019s Complete Book of Nonsense. I still have it, and sometimes I have to check out Gosky Patties to find out if I have to visit the pig, or beat the Dog, if they haven\u2019t turned into Gosky Patties in a timely fashion. I recite that one to my dogs, and they, like my children, think I\u2019m Nuts. Most of my Children flinch if I get started on The Dong with a Luminous Nose. They do enjoy The Jumblies, and the Owl and the Pussy Cat, tho. The Complete Book of Nonsense is especially pertinent in years like 2020. Election Years like this one, are filled with Nonsense - Most of which is nothing but lies, as they are no where to be found in Leer\u2019s book, which is \u2018Complete - It says so right on the cover!
