            "answer_text": "135 is very high, but it\u2019s not genius. Imagine a set of points, like a constellation. A person with an IQ of 70\u201390 can recognize that set of points and give it a label. A person with an IQ of 90\u2013110 can take that set of points and use it for something (data sets, used for simple analysis. Actual constellation, used for storytelling). A person with an IQ of 110\u2013130 can analyze each individual point, and the connections between them. A person with an IQ of 130\u2013150 can analyze the pattern the points make, and compare that pattern to other patterns of points. A person with an IQ of 150\u2013170 can imagine the points as other things, and notice similarities to other completely unrelated sets of points. This is genius level, and this is why geniuses are geniuses: they can take a skill or bit of knowledge and apply it to a completely unrelated situation. This is why you don\u2019t feel as smart as a genius. A person with an IQ of 170\u2013190 can take the set of points, and imagine the possibilities of all kinds of related sets of points, and apply those new imagined sets to unrelated situations. Imagine someone saying \u201cA car is like a bowl except different in every way\u201d, and they know exactly what they mean, and they\u2019re right. A person with an IQ of 190\u2013210 can determine that the set of patterns that can be imagined based on the set of points is a part of a greater set of all patterns made by all points, Imagine someone saying \u201ca car is like a bowl except different in every way, which is why \u2018Freinds\u2019 is a popular TV show\u201d. It\u2019s like realizing that all you need to do to fit the square peg into the circle hole is change the rules of reality. You don\u2019t feel as smart as people think you are because you\u2019re not a genius. You just have a very high IQ. Other people also gave some good answers, like maybe you haven\u2019t learned how to actually use your high IQ, so you feel unintelligent because you subconsciously know you\u2019re not using your brain in an optimal way.

            "answer_text": "IQ 135 is high but it is not genius. It is just on the top level of the so-called \u201csweet spot\u201d of 120 to 135. Your IQ implies that you are 1 in 100 on Caucasian population and that you are likely to succeed in any career you choose with possible exceptions of a Nobel laureate scientist or chess professional. 1 in 100 isn\u2019t really that rare when the population is large enough. You feel incompetent and lonely for three reasons: The communication range - which is two standard deviations (+/- 2 sigmas) in either direction. Yours is 103 to 167. The concept of the communication range was first found by Leta Hollingworth and later popularized by Grady M. Towers. All the meaningful human relations, including friendships and finding a spouse, occur on that range. You are basically restricted to 40% of the population and you are likely to feel lonely.The maturity issue - the more intelligent you are, the slower you mature but also the further you mature. Your lesser endowed peers are at this point likely to be much more mature and \u201cadult\u201d than you. But you will bypass them at 25 or so and at 30 you see them as juvenile, silly and immature. The different levels of maturity will make you uneasy and feeling not fitting in.The Dunning-Kruger effect. In the field of psychology, the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence. And in your case it is the inverse - those who really master something and have merit, assess their own ability much lower than it really is. In their case (and I presume yours too) it is a question of illusory inferiority.Youth is like a disease which is cured with age. If you have it hard, I can tell you those with 140+ have it even harder. Your IQ is just on the upper limit of the sweet spot where your cognitive capability is high enough to master any tasks, but also your communication range is wide enough to cover the majority of populace and enable you to do well socially. And finally: if you feel you are the smartest person in the room, you most likely are. In this case you are in a wrong room. Seek a room where people are even smarter than you are - you both will benefit from it. ",
