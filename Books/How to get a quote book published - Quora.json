            "answer_text": "There are a few basic parts of the overall work here. First, of course, is getting together the quotes you want to have to make up the book. I'll return to this in a minute. Then there is finding a way of getting the product published. This can be done in a few ways. A number of famous authors were true self-published authors, when that used to mean that they went around getting subscription payments from people for a book to be published. When there was enough capital to handle that, a printer (and book-binder) was contacted who did that work. Then the books were passed out to those who had subscribed. (T.E. Lawrence is a case in point, with complications.) Nowadays, people can go to various online companies who will print whatever is sent to them, for a minimum fee. Or you might write to actual publishing houses giving them a brief resume of your book, its focus, its strengths, etc. Some publishers want to hear only from agents, some from agents or from authors, and some from authors directly only. So, back to the gathering of the quotes. A first issue is the question of copyright infringement, which is, yes, something to try to avoid, as opposed to having to defend yourself in court against charges of such infringement. There are copyright laws governing this. Often recent publications (if that is the source of your quotes) will retain rights, and you are on non-probematic ground only by getting formal written (I stress that last word here) authorization or permission to quote something that is explicitly mentioned in that authorization/permission.  Good luck.  ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you mean historical quotes in the public domain, a quote book would be published the same way as any other book.  You can probably skip editing,  other than deciding which quotes to include in the book and how they might be grouped. Then work with a designer for the cover and page layout, and a proofreader to check the final version.  Upload the files to IngramSpark.com or CreateSpace.com using an ISBN that you purchase at http://myidentifiers.com. (Never use an ISBN provided for free by anyone as this means they are the publisher of your book.) That's how you publish it. Whether you should do so is another question.  How will you sell this book? How can you make a book of quotes unique enough to attract buyers who can access quotes on the Internet for free? A hard cover with a jacket would make a nice gift, but it's always the publisher's job  to drive buyers to the retailer. ",
