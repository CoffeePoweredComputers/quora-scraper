            "answer_text": "For Physical Chemistry, yes I would say it\u2019s the best book. However, the same can\u2019t be said for inorganic and organic books. The Physical chemistry book by O.P. Tandon contains a plethora of solved examples and unsolved MCQ\u2019s. All of which are graded as per their difficulty levels. You can completely rely on this book for all your needs. The theory given is also impressive. The Organic Chemistry book is worst of all I\u2019d say. The problems asked are very different from the ones that come in JEE Mains and Advanced. I am not really impressed with reaction mechanisms either. It\u2019s better to go with Paula Bruice for understanding concepts behind mechanisms. Also, from practice point of view, a book by M.S. Chauhan is 1000 times better than O.P. Tandon. I am knowingly not providing buying links for Organic chemistry book by O.P. Tandon. The Inorganic chemistry book is alright, but I won\u2019t regard it as THE BEST BOOK. Everything in this subject comes only and only from NCERT books. Just remember everything written in NCERT\u2019s and you\u2019re good to go. To memorize things easily, you\u2019ll need to practice a lot of questions. Practicing does both the things, you get used to examination pattern as well as you won\u2019t forget things easily i.e. \u201cEK TEER SE DOO NISHANE\u201d. I generally recommend JD Lee\u2019s book for inorganic chemistry as it helps in quick revision too along with providing ample amount of questions to practice. I hope you have liked this answer. If not, do let me know your suggestions in the comments section. ",

            "answer_text": "On a true note, I never solved any book of O.P.Tandon.. For inorganic chemistry , ncert does 95% of the work.. During my jee time i never found a single question out of it ..So mug up each and every words of ncert..Coming to organic , M.S.Chauhan is the best book for practice.. For theory you can refer to your coaching notes and o.p.tandon..Physical chemistry needs major care.. For this ncert won't do.. R.k.gupta is one of the good books I have come across.. Though I strongly recommend you to go through your coaching material , you can also have a look at O.P.Tandon .. ( I am not sure of o.p.tandon having phy. Chem ) but they will surely serve the best (coaching material)... Thanks for A2A :) ",
