            "answer_text": "First of all.Jee and Neet exams are both of national level.So some people have these misconceptions that Neet when compared to JEE looks easier but the both exams are tougher and tricky on the either http://side.As physics and chemistry have same portion in both exams then one might have thought of buying the Neet book and study for JEE and some people might people might obstract them to do http://so.To understand these see the following points: 1.For physics: Physics in Neet is GENERALLY not twisted much.It is very straight forward and sometimes it can be solved with some formulas or we can sometimes get answers by seeing options(hit and trial method).As time is not much Physics for JEE is ALWAYS twisted so much so that you r forced to think so much.They need so much conceptual minds and great patience to solve questions.But some questions are really easy that one who has practiced such questions are comfortable to get 4 on such. 2.For chemistry: For chemistry,talking together for both exams.Chemistry is assumed to be the most easiest section of the entire paper in JEE and Neet(after bio).Questions are of almost same level and sometimes the Neet chemistry is tougher the JEE chemistry.The inorganic section boost ur marks.Their are twisted questions in both papers especially in organic chemistry.So it's not that easy. Now coming to conclusions, Physics-Please try that you use different books for JEE and for Neet as level difference is there and sometimes like these year students were saying that Physics was tough. Chemistry-For chemistry,choice is yours as the level is almost same.But I recommend you JEE guys to use Neet books as JEE books like cengage and all has less questions but Neet cengage has many more questions for practice. So hope u got something useful. Thank you for reading. All the best!!!!! ",
