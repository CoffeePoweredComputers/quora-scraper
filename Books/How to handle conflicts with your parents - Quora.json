            "answer_text": "Oh, man, these were among the most difficult arguments I have ever had with my husband. Because we both really cared about doing right by the kids, and we both thought we came from reasonably good, though different, models. So the first thing we tried to do was recognize and respect the very good place our feelings and thoughts were coming from. This is not the moment to think about, much less mention, the ways in which we think our in-laws sometimes miss the boat. It\u2019s the moment to consider that they raised the wonderful person who is our partner and the parent to our kids, and that it\u2019s possible their way might have had some benefits we have not considered. Often, we decided on the basis of who would feel the effect of the decision more. Once, my kids were complaining about my insisting we do something my way. Hubby observed that he thought it was fairly arbitrary and that there were multiple ways it could be done. I said, that while this is theoretically true, we were talking about something that happened frequently in my workplace (I was home full time with the kids at this point) and my way worked for me, just as there were things that could be done multiple ways in his workplace, which he preferred to do HIS way. With that, he told the kids that mom was in charge of this, and they needed to do it my way. In the end, if we could not agree, our approach tended to be to let the person who felt most passionately about the issue win the day. The kids wanted to discontinue attendance at religious ed. My spouse was permitted to stop after 8th grade. I felt strongly that this was inadvisable \u2014 it is in high school when a more nuanced, adult way of thinking about things is introduced, and I know too many people whose religious formation stopped in elementary school, who later found that the things they were taught as children were, unsurprisingly, inadequately helpful in dealing with adult life. I believed that it while a faith journey was ultimately up to each of them to choose as adults, it was my job to make sure that they were well-versed in the faith into which they were born, so at least they KNEW what they were rejecting. He told the kids \u201cMom feels more strongly about this than I do, so we\u2019re going to do it her way.\u201d I know I\u2019m giving only examples of where I won, but that\u2019s because I really let go of the ones that went his way. I didn\u2019t look for reasons for his approach to fail. I trusted that if he felt that strongly, there were good reasons, and things would probably work out. The truth is that there ARE multiple ways to go on all kinds of things, and because our marriage and our children are made of different personalities and needs than our families of origin, and living in different times, we really do have to cook up new approaches to things. Being respectful of the role of the other parent allows us to see stuff we might not otherwise see. It\u2019s one reason child rearing is such an adventure! ",

            "answer_text": "4 steps To resolve Conflict: CARE Looking for ways to resolve a conflict that meets the needs of both parties is challenging, but something youth should learn to strive towards. As participants of The First Tee proceed through the program, they learn CARE: 1. Communicate Open communication is key in a dispute. Expressing how you feel about the situation and sticking to the facts will let the other person know you\u2019re genuine in your actions. Focusing on the problem at hand and not what the other person did will avoid unnecessary conflict. 2. Actively Listen Listen to what the other person has to say, without interrupting. Try to be objective. Then, ask open-ended questions to make sure each side understands what the other person thinks and how he/she feels. 3. Review Options Talk over the options, looking for solutions that benefit everyone. Do not feel pressured to come up with one answer immediately. Bring in objective third party for ideas, if necessary. 4. End with a Win-Win Solution This is the ultimate goal\u2014to agree on an option that benefits both sides to some extent. When one party wins by aggressive behavior or one party simply gives in, someone is losing. And that means you get outcomes that do not resolve the underlying causes of the conflict. ",
