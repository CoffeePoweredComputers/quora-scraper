            "answer_text": "He is still very much funny, it's just that he is not regularly seen as used to be through the famous sitcom. You can still see him via Comedians in cars getting coffee (CiCgC). That show is more natural and spontaneously generated situational interactions unlike \u201dSeinfeld\u201d which was a properly scripted Show. He doesn't do any specific material on CiCgC. He lets his guest do most of the work (building funny interaction). Also he had said in one of the interviews that he is only interested in funny people and he likes to be surrounded by 'em. ",

I think people are accustomed to seeing Jerry in a sit-com and so when they see him on youtube or doing stand-up, he seems very different to the average viewer. In a sit com, Jerry had a whole cast around him, adding to the laughs. On stage, it\u2019s just him, still funny, but different. ",
