            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve written your book: months of sweat and tears and sleepless nights, and now you want to polish it so it can shine. You\u2019re looking for a partner to help you do this, to make your baby the best it can be. To find the right editor for your manuscript, you must evaluate not just their capabilities. There\u2019s also the question of their compatibility with you: you need someone who would not just fit your budget, but give you feedback you\u2019ll be excited to work on. So, besides being thorough and knowledgeable, they must be good at working with you at your writing level, without changing your voice Here are a five steps to land a good editor for your work as a first-time author: Decide what sort of edit your work needs: Do you need a structural/ developmental edit, or a copyedit?Are you sure your material is organized in the most effective way, in case you\u2019re writing non-fiction, or in case you\u2019re writing fiction, is the cause-and-effect chain of plot in place, does it have rising tension, is the pacing right? If not, you need a development editor. (Most first-time writers, unless they have had excellent beta-readers, and managed to self-edit a book to a high level, will need a developmental edit.) If yes, you need a line edit, which might include a copy edit. You might need an additional proofread round on top of this. Even if you know what these terms mean, make sure you do a quick revision, so you\u2019re on the same page while discussing the scope of editing. Quite a few editors offer a few of these services, but you need to be able to define the scope of your edits in order to research the right editor for your manuscript. Decide what edits you need in your manuscript, based on the evaluations of your beta reader. 2. Do Your Research : Most editors these days have an active internet presence. A thorough google search should tell you a few names, and maybe even give you an idea of what an editor charges. If an editor has a website with poorly-edited content, you can count them out. On the other hand, some editors have made their name in the industry, and charge higher rates. This is the time, after you\u2019ve decided your scope of edits, and done a bit of research, to ask for recommendations. Ask other authors who they have used, what the experience was like\u2014you can do this both online and offline. After a while, a few names will begin to emerge. You can let on in author-support or critique groups that you\u2019re looking for an editor. 3. Ask for sample edits and prices: Once you have a few likely candidates, check if they provide sample edits. Most professional editors offer free edits of a chapter, or a few pages. This lets you see the sort of work they do, and lets them understand the scope of work. Most editors decide how much they will charge you depending on the amount of work they think will be needed on your manuscript. In case you\u2019re looking for a developmental editor, you can ask for recommendations from authors who have worked with them. 4. Once you shortlist a few names that match your genre, scope of edit needed, and feedback quality requirements, compare prices. Some editors may charge higher, but not do such a great job, but this will be rare: word-of-mouth is strong in the writing community, and sub-standard editors are easy to spot. In most cases it is true that you will get what you pay for. In case of a line edit, ensure that you agree with most of their changes. If it seems like their edits are eliminating your voice, it is wise to keep looking on. In case of developmental edit, ensure that you agree with the direction they want to take your novel. Consider paying for a reader report, which costs less, is helpful in fixing your book, gives you the editor\u2019s vision of your manuscript, and tells you whether they are able to give you constructive criticism that you\u2019ll be keen to implement. This will show you if they\u2019re the right fit for your manuscript. 5. Sign a contract: A professional editor will sign a contract with you: they usually have a template that they modify in order to mention the scope of work, deadlines, and payment terms. If this is your first time hiring an editor, get a more experienced writer friend to take a look at it for you. Hope this helps in your search for an editor as a first-time author. All the best with your writing, and finding an editor who is right for you!  ",

            "answer_text": "For first time authors its quite possible that they might try and self-edit, or pass off prose to a family member or friend for free feedback. But either way fails to give you the kind of objective view you need to make the biggest impact. You should find a reliable editor.That reliability depends on when consider below mentioned points. \u25cf\tAsk for referrals and references Asking your network for referrals to help you find an editor for your book is a good way to find someone who\u2019s already proven they\u2019ve got the skills to edit your book. If that doesn\u2019t work, you could ask potential editors for references. If you\u2019re going to vet an editor by talking to references, you might ask: 1.\tWhat type of project did you work on together? 2.\tWas there anything you were unhappy with? 3.\tDid the editor meet agreed-upon deadlines? 4.\tDid the final cost match the initial quote? 5.\tWould you hire this editor again? \u25cf\tAsk the editor if they will do a sample edit Asking to edit a sample of your actual novel for you is a mandatory step before you hire an editor.Or if possible ask from more than one editor for a sample . This will help to find the right editor whose style matches with yours. However in such scenarios you can choose more than one editor for your job. Ask for price the editor will be charging from you. \u25cf\tDo proper research about the editors of your interested genres. Take note of editor\u2019s credentials. Has that Editor worked on and own experience in books of your genre? Go ahead with the editor who will not take any job thrown at him. Quality professional editors look for projects they are sure about they can make a difference in a meaningful way. \u25cf\tSign a contract with the editor. You can also ask for a free sample editing from companies like Reedsy or Edioak. ",
