            "answer_text": "You should cite the original material. \"Self-plagiarism\" is actually taken quite seriously in the real world of publishing since you give up the copyright of your work to the journal when your papers get accepted. I think it's silly*, but it's good practice to avoid this kind of drama in the future. Now how to go about doing it is tricky if your previous work wasn't published. You can just footnote it and say \"a paper as part of a previous class titled X\" should suffice for classroom paper purposes. Here's a promiment case of self-plagiarism involving a very respected chemist: Eminent chemist denies self-plagiarism in \u2018space dinosaurs\u2019 paper * To quote Mike Eisen, a quite prominent biologist regarding self-plagiarism:  Could some of the people who are so outraged by his reuse of some explanatory turns of phrase explain exactly what is wrong with this? I, and virtually all other scientists, express the same ideas in multiple contexts in multiple papers. Nobody has a problem with this. So what\u2019s wrong with using the same language? Maybe it\u2019s a little bit lazy. But warranting a retraction? COME ON! The reuse of text in this manner does nothing to compromise the content or integrity of the piece.The only possible argument against self-plagiarism is that it might be illegal, in as much as Dr. Breslow had assigned his copyright to his previous works to some other publisher, and may not have the right to reuse it. But if this is peoples\u2019 objection, they should leave Dr. Breslow alone and direct their moral outrage at the publishers who have no legitimate claim to own the scientific literature. ",
