            "answer_text": "Character descriptions are turning something like this:  Into something like this : Stacy, a petite brunette with dark eyes and hair swished into the office. Dressed in a maroon Kashmir sweater and black slacks her fashion flair was a step above business casual. She fingered her rimless black glasses and put pen to pad.\u201cSir,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wanted to dictate something?\u201dHow you arrive at this end product is really beyond the scope of Quora answer as there are so many considerations. I cover a lot of it here : Will Greenway's post in Auth-mentors The short version is there are MANY ways to describe a character, but it boils down to using visual tags and vocabulary to paint a picture. Descriptions don\u2019t need to be long or elaborate to effectively convey a character\u2019s general appearance. One of the ones I like to use as an example is this one: Hugh was a knuckle dragging ape of man shaped like a fireplug. He had a square face with the lifeless eyes of a shark, and the sallow gray skin of a vampire.It\u2019s stylized but sure paints the picture of someone you wouldn\u2019t want to meet in a dark alley.

            "answer_text": "In my experience as a consumer of many novels, I found the best writers build their characters as the novel progresses. They give them idiosyncrasies that surface when faced with certain situations, or when relating to other character. For example, an attractive character is not directly described as attractive, but is constantly being targeted by the opposite sex or use their looks and charm in specific ways. A character might exhibit narcissistic qualities throughout the novel, or consistently lie. In this way the character is \u201crevealed\u201d to the reader rather than described. If I was writing a novel, I would write myself a profile of all the characters on a separate sheet of paper listing their dominant qualities and their shortcomings to ensure they are consistent to the nature of that character throughout the novel and allow the reader to \u201cdiscover\u201d the nature of the character as the novel progresses.
