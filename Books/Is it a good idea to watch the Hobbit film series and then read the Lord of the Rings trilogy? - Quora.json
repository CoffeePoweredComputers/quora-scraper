            "answer_text": "Well, if you just want to watch a movie trilogy before diving into a rather dense book series, sure, go for it. If you\u2019re doing it to gain a better understanding of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it\u2019s unnecessary, and you can just read the books first. Failing that (if you realllyyy want to have context), you could read the Hobbit book\u2014which goes by far quicker than the trilogy, considering it originally was a book for children. I can admit The Hobbit movies were fun, but they weren\u2019t a faithful adaptation of the book by any stretch of the imagination. They did try very hard to tie things in with the LOTR trilogy, however, so if you wanted to watch the hobbit film series and then the LOTR film series, that\u2019s more practical, even if it\u2019s still not necessary. But considering that you\u2019re reading the books, I\u2019d say you really don\u2019t have to. ",

            "answer_text": "Read the books. Read unfinished tales. Read Silmarillion. Then watch the Lord of the Rings movies. And maybe the third Hobbit film bearing in mind the differences from the published works. Or if struggling sleeping watch the first Hobbit movie. Which thankfully was not released before the Fellowship or it would have killed the movie franchise. ",
