            "answer_text": "Ok, so this answer is probably going to come down, but my answer? Heck yeah! Of course Harry Potter is awesome! What 11 year old and his 11 year old friends defeat a magical obstacle course and defeat an experienced dark wizard? What 12 year old defeats the heir of Slytherin? What 13 year old saves his falsely convicted godfather and a mythical creature too, and performs a NEWT level spell? What 14 year old and underage wizard successfully completes and wins the Triwizard Tournament, and escapes the dark Lord alive? What 15 year old illegally creates a DADA club and doesn\u2019t get caught until he\u2019s tipped off by an untrustworthy member (well, probably a lot, but it\u2019s not a magical club, is it?)? What 16 year old goes and defeats a bunch of horcruxes? And what 17 year old goes on the run when there\u2019s a bounty on his head, is captured by his worst enemies, escapes alive, and still manages to defeat the biggest terrorist of his age? And, I almost forgot, what one year old defeats the dark lord himself? (No, I\u2019m not a Death Eater just for calling Voldemort the Dark Lord, I just didn\u2019t want to type a lot) ",

            "answer_text": "As a book and movie series, yes, very awesome. If you're asking about Harry himself as a character, then no, he is one of the most boring and bland protagonists you could find. Fans will argue with me and try to say he's meant to be bland so you can project your self into him but the fact of the matter is Harry potter is just a boring everyman cliche without the charisma or personality of other everyman characters like Luke Skywalker or frodo baggins. It's the wonderful characters around him that give his world colour and personality. ",
