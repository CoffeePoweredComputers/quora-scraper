            "answer_text": "Hi. Living science and S Chand are really good for science. And for maths, if you have a lot of time, and patience, use RD Sharma. That\u2019s the best reference book for math till class 10. If you don\u2019t have enough time, go with RS Agarwal. It's good too, but a little less tough. But if you have really less time and lot to revise, I suggest you look into Exemplar questions and past papers, because class 8 exams would have exam questions in a similar pattern ",
