            "answer_text": "No. She\u2019s married to Chris Wood. Though, she possibly could, but I doubt it. In this day and age, coming out for actors, musicians, etc, is now valued in society. So\u2026 if she truly is bisexual, she might as well just come out, but she\u2019d never said she was, and she\u2019s only dated men. So, therefore, she\u2019s straight. ",
