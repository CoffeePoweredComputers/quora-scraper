            "answer_text": "How to Get Rich (without getting lucky): Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.You\u2019re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.When specific knowledge is taught, it\u2019s through apprenticeships, not schools.Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.\u201cGive me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.\u201d - ArchimedesFortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don\u2019t waste your life chasing it.Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.There is no skill called \u201cbusiness.\u201d Avoid business magazines and business classes.Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.You should be too busy to \u201cdo coffee,\" while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you.Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day.Getting rich and staying rich are two different things. Hard work is the key to getting rich, but FINANCIAL LITERACY is the key to staying rich.Source for no. 1 - 39 => Naval How to Get Rich (without getting lucky):\u2014 Naval (@naval) May 31, 2018\n Source for no. 40 => Akinfenwa Abolade \"Getting rich and staying rich are two different things.Hard work is the key to getting rich, but financial literacy is the key to staying rich.\"I said this \ud83e\udd20 https://t.co/x9z4vJUwWO\u2014 Bollydee (@boladeakinfenwa) February 25, 2020\n ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not rich at this time. So, I won\u2019t say I know everything about how to get rich. I\u2019m going off personal experience, though because I have a business. A lot of people here will say focus on assets. Keep your liabilities down. This is great advice, but I want to add onto that. Kiyosaki even mentions this in his book \u201cRich Dad, Poor Dad\u201d. One thing that gets many into trouble is that they try to chase money. They spend thousands of dollars on business seminars, but they never put what they learned from them into action. They attend real estate seminars, and then spend thousands on seminars, special programs, and so forth but they never start in real estate. They throw tons of money at the stock market, then sell like crazy when news headlines predict gloom and doom and the Dow Jones plummets. They play the lottery everyday. They join multi level marketing and spend tons on products that no one wants, while the MLM business itself gets rich from \u201cconsultants\u201d, \u201cinvestors\u201d or whatever they call them to buy their business packages and all that. The mistake they\u2019re often making is that they don\u2019t invest in themselves. Invest in developing new skills that you can charge for. Skills that are rare and desirable can be potentially lucrative for you. For example, learn FB ads and start a FB advertising agency or a FB ads course. Learn how to play the piano; sell record labels or piano courses. Learn how to paint; sell prints, commissions, art courses, or whatnot. Even better, lots of creatives don\u2019t know how to market. You could get good at marketing artwork, then sell a course on how to market someone\u2019s art. Learn how to make bow ties; sell them. Figure out how to do options trading; start a course on how to do options trading. Learn how to create e-commerce platforms; sell e-commerce platforms to those who want to launch an online business. Learn how to manage money; sell a course on personal finance. You get my point, I\u2019m sure. Oh yeah. This is REALLY important. You absolutely need this if you want to build a multi-million or billion dollar fortune. Develop a system for getting your products and services out to people. It isn\u2019t sufficient to just be good at something. After all, your two legs alone can\u2019t travel around the world; you can\u2019t be everywhere 24/7 peddling your stuff. That means you need to develop a distribution channel that introduces your product or service to your target audience, then sends your products and services out to buyers. And, it must do so profitably. That distribution channel could be a large email list, large groups of salespeople, a high-traffic website or physical store like Amazon or Wal-Mart, television, social media, a content subscription service like Hulu or Netflix, an automated webinar, and/or a physical store. That way, you can earn money whether you\u2019re working, sleeping, or on vacation. This is easily most the challenging part of financial success, and it may require a lot of trial and error. But, once you figure it out, you\u2019ll find that buying a Ferrari or Mercedes Benz isn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility. As you see good returns from investing in yourself, you can then invest in other assets. Real estate, stocks, bonds, and so forth. Hell, once you\u2019ve gotten good at those, you can launch courses, seminars, and CDs on how to invest in those assets, too. Then, you can distribute those products and services to buyers. You\u2019ll be among a coveted group of people that millions worship and give money to everyday, whether they\u2019ve personally met you or not. Point is, you are your greatest asset. Invest in your own skill set. Build valuable skills2. Create a product/service based on those skills, 3. Create distribution channels to distribute those skills to people for a fee so that you can have your persoa freedom. 4. Use your hard earned money to invest onkther assets. Good luck! ",
