            "answer_text": "If you want to read an unabridged version in English I suggest reading Bibek Debroy's The Mahabharata. It is very extensive. The Author has split the whole of it into 10 volumes and he has completed writing 8 volumes. [I completed reading volumes 1 & 2 currently reading volume 3] If you are looking for abridged version, you can get many in local language. In English, Jaya by Devdutt Patnaik is one of the good books [I havent read the book but read reviews about this] ",
