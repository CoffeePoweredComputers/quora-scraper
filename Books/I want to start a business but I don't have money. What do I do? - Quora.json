            "answer_text": "Someone once told me that the probability of an entrepreneur getting venture capital is the same as getting struck by lightning while standing at the bottom of a swimming pool on a sunny day. This may be too optimistic. Let\u2019s say that you can\u2019t raise money for whatever reason: You\u2019re not a \u201cproven\u201d team with \u201cproven\u201d technology in a \u201cproven\u201d market. Or, your company may simply not be a \u201cVC deal\u201d Focus on cash flow, not profitability: The reality is that you pay bills with cash, so focus on cash flow. If you know you are going to bootstrap, you should start a business with a small up-front capital requirement, short sales cycles, short payment terms, and recurring revenue. It means passing up the big sale that take twelve months to close, deliver, and collect. Forecast from the bottom up: The bottom-up forecast goes like this: \u201cWe can open up ten installation facilities in the first year. On an average day, they can install ten systems. So our first year sales will be 10 facilities x 10 systems x 240 days = 24,000 satellite radio systems. 24,000 is a long way from the conservative 1.5 million systems in the top-down approach. Guess which number is more likely to happen. Sell the Concept to prospective customer against a heavy future discount: If you are really solving a pain point for your customers you will find at few couple of customers willing to fund your developed against some future discounting like exclusivity, Advisory equity or anything else. Don't spend assuming the best Case: While its important to be optimistic, it is deadly to assume and spend assuming that the best things will happen to you in the future, Debt and Interest that were to be Paid yesterday is a volcano that can erupt anytime resulting in loss of credibility and business Ship, then test. \u201dPerfect\u201c is the enemy of \u201dgood enough.\u201c When your product or service is \u201dgood enough,\u201c get it out because cash flows when you start shipping. Besides perfection doesn\u2019t necessarily come with time\u2013more unwanted features do. Forget the \u201dproven\u201c team. Proven teams are over-rated\u2013especially when most people define proven teams as people who worked for a billion dollar company for the past ten years. These folks are accustomed to a certain lifestyle, and it\u2019s not the bootstrapping lifestyle. Hire young, cheap, and hungry people. Go direct. The optimal number of mouths (or hands) between a bootstrapper and her customer is zero. ",

            "answer_text": "What? No Money\u2026! Hey, then it\u2019s Good for YOU :) - According to Dymond John (who wrote the book \u2018THE POWER OF BROKE\u2019)  Daymond John who is a judge in Shark Tank Show and Daymond also started a business from just $40 and now Daymond John net-worth is about $250 Million. Daymond and other researches and many surveys upon businesses prove that a low-cost business tends to be more successful than others in the competition because: MONEY MAKES A MAN LAZY! : Those people who have money began to use money as their weapon and become LAZY but those people who didn\u2019t have enough money started to create new creative ways, they use their MIND as a weapon and believe me your MIND is worthless and money is nothing against to a human brain.  For example, There are 2 people and their name is John and Bill and they both wanted to create a business of Hats but John has so much and Bill didn\u2019t have enough money. John began by opening a store in Rich people colony and started to spend money on campaigns, ADS, Radio, Social Media and many more\u2026 but in the end, he found not making any type of profit and later his business got bankrupt because of lack of profit but on the other hand Bill didn\u2019t have enough money so he started to find free marketing methods and research upon his audience and then he knew that Teenagers and adults are more interested in buying his hats not the rich people, so he began to target them and market his product by finding free marketing methods and end up generating a huge amount of PROFIT! MONEY REDUCES LEADERSHIP QUALITY :  To start a business you will need a leadership quality but money reduces it because money is an enemy for your creativity and because you will get lazy because of it which slowly ends your curiosity to learn something and then you will slowly start to gain EGO which could harm your leadership quality. Money can be used for creation, not for consumption which is a good thing. A HUNGER FOR SUCCESS :  \u201cWhen you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe Then you\u2019ll be SUCCESSFUL\u201d- Eric Thomas. Well if you really have that dedication, Will, Desire, Focus, and hunger for success then you\u2019ll definitely become successful, then money and any other obstacle will won\u2019t be able to defeat you. If you take a look at some most successful businessman like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg you\u2019ll see that these people have an extreme desire to do something in LIFE. Bill Gates used to work 18 hours a day because he is so hungry for hungry and that\u2019s the reason why Bill Gates been the world\u2019s richest person for 14 years and got replaced by Jeff Bezos in 2018. DO RESEARCH :  By doing the research you\u2019ll able to see the market\u2019s adoption curve and then you can innovate new products within time and can create a successful business. With the help of research, you can make better decisions at the right time which could benefit you a lot and it would increase your knowledge about business and would make you an expert in it. I think you can do most of the research without money. CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR :  Capture the behaviour and feedback of your customer and then convert into feedforward. Take your product as a project and involve costumer which could benefit you at a huge because you will be starting to retain a customer and if you would hold up to costumer to themselves then your costumers will able to create loyal customers which would do anything for you. That is the power of consumer behaviour. Now, don\u2019t make any excuses just give a start to your business and if you follow all the then one day you\u2019ll definitely create a successful business empire.
