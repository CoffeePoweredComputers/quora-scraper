            "answer_text": "There are many ways to take notes from books.  Some note-taking formulas include the Cornell Method, or just trying to be more visual.  When taking notes from books, it is best to first, read the whole page or section, and summarize it into your own words.  Visualize what is happening, and try to write it down.  After doing that, go back and see what you missed; skim it over since you read the section already.  Ask yourself what the author is saying and what is happening.  Using these questions, jot them down in the Cornell Method. Cornell Method Divide your page into two columns, the question and the answer column.  This will basically organize your notes and you will be able to keep track of the events in the book.  After one chapter, close your eyes and summarize what has happened.  When you are done, go back to your notes and refresh your memory.  Repeat the process until you have finished reading the book.Visualization Another way of taking notes is adding visuals with the events that happened.  For a new word, you can add a picture to depict the significance of the word in the whole book.  In this case, you can draw \u201ca person scratching their head\u201d for the word \u201cambivalent.\u201d  This will help you understand the book better, along with the theme.Indeed, there are always new ways of taking notes from a book.  But for me, I find these two methods to be the most helpful.  It depends on what type of learner you are.  For auditory learners, you can probably record your summary of the book, and go back to review your notes.  While for kinesthetic learners, you can try to put yourself in the book and see what you will do. Hopefully this helpedTake care and good luck with note taking! ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose you mean a physical book, not any electronic version. The simplest way is to underline (old method) or highlight (new method) the important points/words in each passage..Run them over in your mind to establish some connectivity.This is often not enough-this is only the beginning. You must internalise whatever you have underlined. It is more than just committing to memory. It is deeper than that.This step is reached only or mostly with writing the whole thing in your own hand. The underlining /highlighting is only the process of creating the first draft of the notes. The real notes are what you write down in your own hand.You must understand your strong ( and weak) points. Some people have photographic memory. They can recall where something occurs- on the left or right side of a page. But some people can remember sounds better. If you are a person who is strong on sound, you must read your notes loud when you are alone! This sound will linger in your mind!If your lecturer keeps the text book open while lecturing, you too may keep your book open- and jot down any special/particular word or idea that he mentions on that page or against that passage. In all cases, you must read and revise , later on the same day, the portion the lecturer covered on that day. This will greatly aid you in making notes on the book.It depends on the quality of the textbook. If it is tightly written, it is itself like the notes! Most technical books are like this. They have no filler stuff, which is a characteristic of humanities and social science subjects.Remember: notes on the book are only the first draft. You must rewrite it subsequently to make it your own-if you need notes at all.",
