            "answer_text": "In my country, 3rd year MBBS is the Anatomy, Physiology and Biochemistry class. I just want to be sure that is what you are referring to. Well, choosing PLAB or USMLE depends on: the country you wish to be in. PLAB is for the doctors who want to practice in the UK. In 2022, the GMC ( General Medical Council UK) will introduce UKMLA which is like a unified exam for both the IMG doctors and the UK-schooled doctors. USMLE is for doctors who wish to practice in the US of America.the monetary budget: don\u2019t get me wrong, both exams are capital intensive. PLAB is divided into PLAB 1 and 2, PLAB 1 costs about 460 pounds, while PLAB 2 costs about 860 pounds. USMLE has 4 steps (1, 2CK, 2CS,3), i think you can get a residency slot without step 3. Step 1 $630, Step 2 CK $630, Step 2 CS $1290. Before you start PLAB, you will need to write the IELTS (except your country is recognized as an English speaking country and you can prove that you studied in English).Time: PLAB takes less time to achieve compared to USMLE. USMLE is rigorous and time-intensive.Residency: some people like the idea of going straight into residency and USMLE offers you that (of course you need to score high). With PLAB, you may have to work as a medical officer or in a non-training post and then apply for residency training. In both countries, getting residency into specialties like surgery and neurosurgery can be very hard (you will need to work very hard).Money: UK pays lesser than the US. The good side is that with your PLAB and GMC registration + years of experience in the UK, you can work in Australia or Canada. So you are not at a loss.finally, i will say it is up to you. I hope i have been able to help you.ps: For books to refer to: PLAB 1: Mostly clinical medicine (medicine, psychiatry especially) Oxford handbook of medicine will help, then use NICE guidelines to know best practices for most clinical cases.PLAB 2: GMC video on plab 2 will guide you on what to expect. There are also academies that can help you prepare for the courses (Samson, Hamed, Swammy).USMLE: I don\u2019t know much about the books to use but visit kaplan website and get the info you need.all the best.
