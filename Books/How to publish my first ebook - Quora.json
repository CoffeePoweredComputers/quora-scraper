            "answer_text": "The answer depends on your level of technical competence and understanding of grammar. Whether you choose to use trade publishers or self publish you must first get your book to an acceptable standard. Put it away for a while and start work on your next book. After a suitable break from it go back to it and have it read aloud to you. MS Word will do this or you can use an application such as Text to Speech. A machine will read exactly what is there rather than what you expect to be there. Does your book have a snappy start? Does the first page contain a hook that would entice a reader to keep reading? Decide on trade publishing or self publishing. Did you notice that \u2018competence\u2019, \u2018machine\u2019, the missing hyphens and commas?If you select trade, then you\u2019ll need to start looking for literary agents to act on your behalf. Few publishers still accept work directly from authors. Perhaps 1 in 16 books will be accepted by a literary agent. Some accepted books are not accepted by publishers too. Assuming you are eventually accepted by a trade publisher you may be looking at 2 years before your book is available to buy.If you decide to self-publish you must choose between print-on-demand or ebook formats. Avoid like the plague any \u2018vanity publishing\u2019 service which wants to charge you a fee to print your books. Best advice is to publish in both formats. Timescale is MUCH shorter (I\u2019ve written and published a book in a week).Decide if you want to pay to have your book edited. Editing is harder than writing a book.Decide if you want to pay to have a cover produced. Any cover made must attract the buyer when displayed in thumbnail size. You need an eye for this to be successful.Decide where you want to publish. Since Amazon sell 60%+ of ebooks sold that shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. There are others though.Consider if you wish to publish exclusively at Amazon using Kindle Select or publish through several retailers. If you choose the latter you may want to investigate the services of Draft2Digital (particularly easy to use) or Smashwords (Not quite as easy but this is also a retailer and has great marketing tools). If you choose to publish directly to Amazon it\u2019s a little more tricky, but you\u2019ll get a greater royalty rate.Whatever your choice of 2 or 3, start work NOW on promoting your book - even before it is published. Book marketing is by far the hardest task.",

            "answer_text": "Your first choice is whether to seek a publisher or publish yourself. If you decide to look for a publisher, I have a paper (free to download) at ElaineOrrWritingClasses The paper offers suggestions to consider when you are evaluating whether to use a publisher. You can also go to the library reference section and look at a copy of Writer\u2019s Market. It mentions potential publishers and often has articles on writing query letters. When you look at publisher options, pay attention to the kinds of books they publish. For example, if you have written a mystery, don\u2019t submit information to a publisher who largely produces science fiction. I chose to self-publish most of my books. My strong suggestion would be that you truly do this yourself rather than work with a company that offers to help with formatting and distribution. Sites such as Amazon and Smashwords have good instructions. If you do decide to self-publish, you\u2019ll want to do an ebook and a paperback. You don\u2019t have to do everything at once. Finally, the index on my blog has a lot of specific ideas for publishing an ebook, including some on formatting. Go to Index Stay positive. You can do this. Elaine L. Orr www.elaineorr.com ",
