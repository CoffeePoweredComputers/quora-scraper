            "answer_text": "The basis of architecture are not architecture itself. Architecture comes from a lot of diferent fields. The most important one is probably, the aesthetics. But also society, materials, structures, and some other specific things like air conditioning... From here you will understand how to manage the lights of your buildings, what material to use, what dimensions are better, or how to improve ecologically your facade. What I mean is that you can learn architecture by yourself. A lot of important architects did not study architecture. But they always likes arts, to draw, and are very conscious about how to resolve the joint of the materials. So try to understand the arts (specially painting and photography), and visit the architecture of the most known architects and try to understand it. Try to go to some architecture talks. It is very eye-opening!! ",
