            "answer_text": "That depends on the specific Anglican church you mean. The Anglican Communion is made up of national (and in some cases transnational) autonomous churches, each with its own liturgy and hymnals. Most are based at least in part on the granddaddy of them all, the 1662 Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England,[1] but some have their own unique liturgies, usually for historical reasons. In most cases, there will be only one local version of the Book of Common Prayer. But some, like the Church of England, have two or even three for historical reasons. Officially, the 1662 Book of Common Prayer is still \u201cthe\u201d prayer book of the Church of England. For various reasons, the C of E has been unable to replace it (an attempt in 1928 failed because of interference by Parliament). To get around the legal restrictions, the C of E introduced an \u201calternative\u201d prayer book, called Common Worship, in 2000.[2] The irony is that the \u201calternative\u201d Common Worship has become so popular and widespread that it is now practically the de facto standard. Meanwhile in the USA, the Episcopal Church has just one prayer book, the 1979 US Book of Common Prayer.[3][4] (That said, the 1979 BCP was intended to accommodate both traditionalists and progressives and has multiple versions of the liturgy to pick from.) Still, alternative liturgies are being actively tested all the time and IIRC a new version is in the works. There is an alternative, the Anglican Service Book, which is essentially a \u201ctranslation\u201d of the modern texts of the 1979 version into more traditional King James-style English, but it\u2019s technically not an official standard prayer book. It is preferred mostly by Anglo-Catholic parishes.[5] In the Anglican Church of Canada, the 1962 Canadian BCP is the \u201cofficial\u201d standard, but the Book of Alternative Services[6] is their rough counterpart to Common Worship and also has become very widespread and popular. The situation is similar in various other Anglican churches. But the basic assumption is always that there is, or should be, a single edition of the BCP in any given Anglican church. The thing that is unique to Anglicanism is its emphasis on the doctrine of lex orandi lex credendi[7] \u2014 more or less \u201cwe believe what we pray\u201d \u2014 and the thing that truly unites Anglicans above all else is its liturgy. One church, one prayer book.

            "answer_text": "the anglican communion is composed of a large number of independent, mostly national churches, and each one has one or more authorized prayer books. in the US the Episcopal Church uses the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, but other texts are authorized as well, in particular Enriching Our Worship, which uses language which is less patriarchal (eg, the Reign of God, instead of the KINGdom of God) and employs a number of images of God as female (eg, gathering people under protecting wings). other texts may be approved for use by the local bishop\u2026 for example, a text from the 1662 BCP might be used for a service that commemorates a historical event, or the bishop might approve occasional use of a text from a different national church (eg, one from the New Zealand BCP) ",
