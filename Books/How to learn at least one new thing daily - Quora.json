Every day, Wikipedia posts an article selected from its vast repository of entries to it\u2019s Daily-article-l subscribers. If you were a subscriber today, you would have recently discovered that Daylight Saving Time was first proposed by William Willett in 1907 and adopted during World War I as a way to conserve coal. You might have also been interested to find out that Kazakhstan discontinued Daylight Saving Time in 2005 because of alleged health risks associated with changed sleep patterns.Read The Free Dictionary\u2019s homepage or subscribe to its feeds. The Free Dictionary has several daily features on its front page, including Article of the Day (RSS), In the News (RSS), This Day in History (RSS), and Today\u2019s Birthday (RSS). One recent day\u2019s stories told the history of the Hell\u2019s Angels, the identity of the new \u201c7 Wonders of the World\u201d, the origin of the first cultured pearl, and the life story of one of the world\u2019s most prominent tenors.Subscribe to the feed at Your Daily Art (RSS). Every day you\u2019ll be confronted with a classic work of art to contemplate, along with a few notes about the piece. If you were subscribed right now, you might have recently seen Man Ray\u2019s intriguing and playful \u201cLe Violin d\u2019Ingres\u201d and Frank Weston Benson\u2019s luminous \u201cRed and Gold\u201d.Subscribe to the feeds at Did You Know? and Tell Me Why?. These sites are both run by an R. Edmondson, who certainly knows a lot of stuff about a lot of stuff. Updates are slightly less than daily, but I like the two sites so much I couldn\u2019t leave them off this list. If you were a subscriber to these sites, you\u2019d have recently learned why clouds are white, what the European Union is, the French terms for the days of the week and the months of the year, and the history of the development of public health efforts in response to the hazards of the Industrial Revolution.Listen to podcasts like In Our Time and Radio Open Source. Radio Open Source is a daily interview/panel show covering everything from politics to science to art and literature to the greatness of the movie Groundhog Day. (At the moment, Radio Open Source is on summer hiatus, but subscribe anyway \u2014 they\u2019ll be back!) For a history of the events and ideas that shaped the present, In Our Time is ideal: a weekly gathering of scholars discussing subjects as diverse as the life of Joan of Arc, theories of gravity, and what we know about the Permian-Triassic boundary.

            "answer_text": "Learning every day is an idea that sounds good, but is difficult to pull off, and I say this from experience. However, I found ways for myself to move towards this ideal, and so far they seem to be working for me. There are many ways to learn something new, but doing so everyday is where we get stuck, as we never actively take out time to do so. Another place where we fail is retaining whatever we have learnt today. I live my life guided by my daily checklists, and learning every day is a task that appears there. But keeping it vague in the checklist means it's never going to get crossed off. So I give myself a lot of options to accomplish it. A sample check list looks like this: ReadExerciseLearn viaNewspaperMagazine articleResearch article / White papersMOOCTed talkYouTube tutorialsNetworkingSo on and so forthThe idea is that if I learn something from any of the options mentioned in the checklist, I have achieved something. But this is partial learning, because it's not complete till you retain it for long. For retention, one can keep a learning journal. The learning journal need not have the entire description of what you've learnt, but can have the essentials. For example, Date - 10 Feb 2017Topic - cooking butter chickenSource - Sanjeev Kapoor's YouTube channelSummary - have noted down the recipe, or offlined the video.How I felt - the dish looked amazing, and have to try it out in the next party. (I feel this section should be there because it will tell you what kind of things you actually enjoyed learning about - an important step in self discovery)Of course, the contents of the journal, which will eventually become an amazing repository of all things you know, and options in the checklist can vary from person to person, but having it as a to-do item will help one actually actively learn something new everyday.

            "answer_text": "1. Understand Yourself If you don't understand yourself, start today. Find a mirror, and start a conversation with yourself. That's all you need to meet yourself. You'll see exactly what a stranger might see in you, and from that point, you can start to recognize your own behaviors and exercise some control over them. With a little bit of care -- like clipping the hedges -- you will take a new, more defined shape as an individual. 2. Become a Cultivator. Nothing happens overnight. All skills start with a seed, and you cultivate that seed over time. This is that seed: Become a cultivator. Remember that your job is to take care of your skills over time.It is impossible to LEARN all the skills you will need in a single week, month or even ye\u200bar. Learning new skills is the process of a lifetime. The cultivator understands that. 3. Learn to Pace Yourself Properly There is a reason you don't try to sprint through a marathon. You'll get tired, exhaust yourself early and the people that paced themselves will pass you. Few understand that this translates to work and self-work, but once you recognize that controlling your pace will affect your long-term, you'll soon understand that this is a skill worth learning a hundred times over. 4. Simplify With all things, seek simplification. In order to simplify, you must recognize and eliminate the unnecessary parts and leave only what is necessary. Does this explanation seem simple to you? 5. Become Visionary Instead of desiring or thinking about things, envision them. Figure out what it would take to get from point A to point B with visual, intense recognition of what it is that you want to create. You cannot be a visionary if you can't see what you want in your mind.The difference between someone that imagines and someone that envisions is simple: One is attempting to marry their vision with reality, while the other is trying to imagine something that they think is separate from reality. There are some tips to learn something new everyday I hope this is very useful to you. ",

            "answer_text": "learn this\u2026. I am currently trying to find a way to build a human memory erasing machine, that uses a modified gamma knife machine, to ionize micron cubic sized groups of neurons in the brain. Could this technique be safer to use than electroconvulsive therapy, at erasing specific memories from people with PTSD. The next step in Andre Fenton's work is to erase spatial memories specifically in a mouses brain using a modified gamma knife machine The steps to doing this technique is below.The yet to be built INUMAC MRI machine (for imaging Neuro disease Using high-field MR, And Contrastophores) can image a area of about 0.1mm, or 1000 neurons, and see changes occuring as fast as one-tenth of a second.It would allow much more precise functional imaging of the brain at work, than is currently available. You cannot really discriminate what is happening in the brain at the level of a few hundred neurons.Combine the INUMAC with the latest CT scanners.With the latest CT scanners, the final picture is far more detailed than an X-ray image.Inside the CT scanner is a X-ray detector which can see hundreds of different levels of density.Combine the INUMAC, and latest CT scanners with Magnetoencephalography (MEG), and Electroencephalogram (EEG) to see the electro signals, happening in real Magnetoencephalography, the SERF (spin exchange relaxation free) magnetometer in being investigated for future machines.This will help increase the accuracy of the electro signal in the brain.Now you have both BOLD, and electro and chemical signals to deduce what neurons hold which specific spatial memory.Modify a Gamma Knife machine, currently the ball lenses need to be worked on to ionize micron sized groups of neurons, in cubic areas in the brain.Remember a gamma wave can pass through something as small as an gamma knife surgery they ionize tumors in the brain the size of a pea, so ionizing a cubic area in the brain of around 20 microns would be way safer than gamma knife surgery.The diagram for this modified gamma knife is in the download below at the bottom of this page. The way the modified gamma knife machine works is it just uses two to twenty five beams.But two beams will make the smallest meet are in the center where the gamma waves beams intensity is the strongest to ionize the cells. The two gamma knife beams are adjusted in width by the collimater, to ionize groups of neurons in cubic sized area in the brain.Two gamma knife beams are best to use to make a smaller meet area in the center, but more than two beams can be used if it helps better with ionization of a cubic area of a group of neurons. How long the groups of neurons need to be ionized is also a factor in ionization.A neuroscientist may say \" you need to find very group of neurons associated with a specific memory, and then you would need to ionize every group of neurons associated with that memory to erase that specific memory.\" You do not need to find EVERY group of neurons in the brain that holds a specific memory. Ionizing SOME of the groups of neurons is enough to disrupt a specific memory. And here is how you do it.You look for the groups of neurons that hold the bad memory on the INUMAC MRI, and FMRI, CT EEG, and MEG technology. You find the bad memories, by asking the person to recollect the bad memory. When you have identified which groups of neurons could hold the bad memories.You ask the person to recollect the bad memory, as you ionize the neurons associated with the bad memory, you keep asking the person to recollect the bad memory, the more you ionize, the more hazy the bad memory becomes to the person, as you ask him to recollect it. So gradually the bad memory should be erased, but the point is you did not need to find, and ionize EVERY group of neurons in the brain to erase the bad memory. Which would be like finding a needle in a forest. So what you have done here is you have stopped the neurons from communication with each other to make a complete working bad memory to the person. By ionizing SOME of the neurons you have disrupted the neurons communication process with each other that forms the bad memory to the person. Is it better the person leaves confused, and things in his mind not making a little sense, or the person being severely depressed with PTSD. Of all the neurons that hold the bad memory just ionizing less than 10% of the groups of neurons, could be enough to disrupt the communication process between these neurons to successfully erase a memory. This is a lot more safer than electroconvulsive therapy it can cause confusion, and memory loss, of either good memories, or memories of important this you should know. and this technique with INUMAC,and FMRI, and a modified gamma knife is more specific, at erasing the bad memories, and leaving the good memories, and memories of things you need to know.ZIP (Zeta Inhibitory Peptide), and Optogenetics is never going to work in a human.In Gamma Knife surgery they ionize a area in the brain the size of a pea, I want to ionize a cubic area a few microns in size, so this would be way less dangerous than gamma knife surgery.Also gamma waves may not need to be used, X-rays could be used to ionize the groups of neurons, which would be more safer. Safety is the most important priority in this idea. This idea to erase specific memories, is a option that is a safer, more specific technique better than electroconvulsive therapy. Stanford scientists have demonstrated a technique for observing hundreds of neurons firing in the brain of a live mouse, in real time, and have linked that activity to long-term information storage. The unprecedented work could provide a useful tool for studying new therapies for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. The researchers first used a gene therapy approach to cause the mouse's neurons to express a green fluorescent protein that was engineered to be sensitive to the presence of calcium ions. When a neuron fires, the cell naturally floods with calcium ions. Calcium stimulates the protein, causing the entire cell to fluoresce bright green. A tiny microscope implanted just above the mouse's hippocampus \u2013 a part of the brain that is critical for spatial and episodic memory \u2013 captures the light of roughly 700 neurons. The microscope is connected to a camera chip, which sends a digital version of the image to a computer screen. The computer then displays near real-time video of the mouse's brain activity as a mouse runs around a small enclosure, which the researchers call an arena. The neuronal firings look like tiny green fireworks, randomly bursting against a black background, but the scientists have deciphered clear patterns in the chaos. \"We can literally figure out where the mouse is in the arena by looking at these lights,\" said Mark Schnizer, an associate professor of biology and of applied physics. When a mouse is scratching at the wall in a certain area of the arena, a specific neuron will fire and flash green. When the mouse scampers to a different area, the light from the first neuron fades and a new cell sparks up. \"The hippocampus is very sensitive to where the animal is in its environment, and different cells respond to different parts of the arena,\" Schnitzer said. \"Imagine walking around your office. Some of the neurons in your hippocampus light up when you're near your desk, and others fire when you're near your chair. This is how your brain makes a representative map of a space.\" The group has found that a mouse's neurons fire in the same patterns even when a month has passed between experiments. \"The ability to come back and observe the same cells is very important for studying progressive brain diseases,\" Schnitzer said. For example, if a particular neuron in a test mouse stops functioning, as a result of normal neuronal death or a neurodegenerative disease, researchers could apply an experimental therapeutic agent and then expose the mouse to the same stimuli to see if the neuron's function returns. Although the technology can't be used on humans, mouse models are a common starting point for new therapies for human neurodegenerative diseases, and Schnitzer believes the system could be a very useful tool in evaluating pre-clinical research. If you combined my modified gamma knife machine idea, to ionize neurons in the mouses brain, in this experiment you could prove my 10% theory that you do not need to find, and ionize EVERY neuron associated with a spatial memory. You just need to ionize 10% of the neurons associated with a specific spatial memory, to erase the memory. Proving this theory that you do not need to find, and ionize every neuron in the brain to erase a bad memory, ids the next step in the experiment done by Andre Fenton Andre Fenton erased spatial memories in mice using ZIP (Zeta Inhibitory Peptide) but it cannot erase memories specifically, it would be more a more advanced experiment based on his experiment with the mouse in the placement avoidance task. Memories appear to be created as changes of a few molecules made in selected synapses dispersed throughout many brain regions, and not in whole neurons, nor in sets of neurons located next to each other. You might be able to deduce by ionizing neurons at micron scales, how memories are consolidated in this technique. I am requesting a grant for this modified gamma knife to be built, as well as a internship to start building this prototype gamma knife, and start doing this experiment. ",

Just like your eyes are watching many things but you don\u2019t notice all the thinks your eyes see. Similarly your brain is processing tons of information daily but you can\u2019t memorize them all.  Since we all use social media, right? Some use it for entertainment, some for staying up to date with news related to celebrities, industry they work in, etc. My point is, we do know too much but can not organize it to make it use-able. How should one start? These are the steps that if you follow, can help you learn at least 10 new things that you will be able to store and retrieve from your database (I mean mind). Cut the Bullshit: Un-follow or unsubscribe to all channels, people, topics, interests, etc, that you are mildly interested in and only keep those that match your best interest. For example, if I am a student I would follow only education sites pages like SolutionInn, Chegg, Coursehero, etc to stay up to date with any of the latest scholarships, tutoring opportunity, study materials, promotional offers, etc.Only one use for each: To use social media more effectively, I fixed each of six including Quora for different purposes. Like Facebook for entertainment, Twitter for politics, Pinterest for blogs, Quora for writing, Instagram for hanging around with friends, etc.10 minutes for each: To reduce information overload you have already done the first two steps. The final step is to get organized a little bit. I use 6 social media so in one hour I can spend 10 minutes on each to use only what I have organized in first two steps.I feel way too light and organized with this and I am always ready to speak on anything with my friends, colleagues and family members. I hope this helps you too. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": " (Image source- Mobile) Yesterday night at around 2 AM my cooler got stopped automatically. I tried to on/off it but it didn\u2019t start. Today in the afternoon I opened it to check what the problem is. When I look closely the power wire connecting to the motor was burnt from inside. So, I took another piece of wire and replaced it with the damaged one. I did connections and tried to check it is working or not before taping. When I switched ON the power supply, cooler didn\u2019t start. It grew my tension because I thought the problem is in Motor itself and the main fear was where I will find an electrician in the lockdown. So, I thought to give it another try. I controlled my tension thoughts and tried to focus more on the problem. I checked the winding and connection again closely. As I focused more I found that the connection was loose. I mean I just connected wires loosely (but not much loosely). This time I did the connection again and bind wires tightly. I applied tape also before checking. And then I switched ON. The cooler start working properly. What I learned today and how you can learn something daily? A little loose connection, be it in a relationship, parenting, marketing, planning or in a career can destroy everything. A less focused mind never gives satisfying results. So, whatever stuff you do there is always a life lesson to learn. You just have to clear your thoughts and learn from the silly mistakes. Make this a habit that whenever you will find a problem next time, you will not leave anything loose. Be Happy My Friend. Bheem Lambora ",

Amazon is a great source of finding books and the reviews are nice to read to see if the book is right for you want to learn. Taking classes is another way. Not necessarily formal classes at a university but there are tons of places to find free or low cost courses on just about anything. Online Courses - Learn Anything, On Your Schedule | Udemy and Coursera | Online Courses From Top Universities. Join for Free are fantastic sites to find courses, often taught by the top universities of the world. I am also a huge fan of documentaries. If you have cable television, there are tons of documentaries everyday. There are also great videos on YouTube that are posted by different universities, publishing companies, and journalists about a vast array of topics. Lastly, and I feel most importantly, keep an open mind in anything you do. You don\u2019t always have to agree with someone to be able to see where they are coming from. Talk with people you wouldn\u2019t normally talk with about topics you are set in your mind about. Don\u2019t try to prove anyone that your view is right and see why that person views something the way they do. In almost any issue, there are many ways to view it. That doesn\u2019t me you have to adopt it, but learning other view points on the same issue can really enlighten you. Hope this helps! ",

This is something I did personally several years back and have really made it part of my daily routine. My goal was to read one book per month. I now read through books at a pace of 2\u20133 per month. Having a goal to finish a book a week or a book a month sounds very daunting. However, if I tell you to read 10 pages per day, would that sound reasonable? Most self-help/non-fiction books in this genre are in the 250 page range. That means with a simple 10 page/day plan, you finish one book per month. Once you have this mindset, tie the daily goal to something you already do. Start to read while you drink your coffee or for 10\u201315 minutes before you go to bed. Once this 10 page/day habit gets ties to something you are already doing, then you will find that you\u2019ll plow straight through these books. It is because of this simple 10 page/day mindset that I don\u2019t believe people when they tell me they don\u2019t have time to read. It really isn\u2019t that hard to find some time and make some real progress. I actually wrote an article about this on my Quora Blog - Reading just 10 min/day can boost your engineering career.

Make habits that automate this process, and it will seem effortless. Learn to cook two new dishes every week.Often watch movies that are of a new language that you're trying to learn. Play a new sport every six months till you get decently good at it. Also, ask a lot of questions. You could ask your mechanic questions about your car when you're getting something fixed. You could ask a bartender interesting questions about the night club business. The most important thing - Binge on Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "By challenging yourself everyday,  Let me elaborate. Whenever you choose to do anything, always think about the obstacles that can put a halt in achieving it, this is the best way to prepare yourself for the upcoming challenges and then you must challenge yourself. I will now give my example to make it simple, i hope that may be useful for you, From class 9th to 10th i was so much studious, not bragging here but i wanted to solve each and every question that came before me, now this was possible only because i was determined enough to challenge myself everyday, i used to solve class 11th questions nearly at the end of class 10th, thereafter i got 10 cgpa in class 9th and 10th. Now what happened to me in class 11th and 12th was, i don\u2019t know due to distractions or something else i became lazy, depressed, anxious and fearful on tiny things, etc. Why? Because i did so much overthinking leading me to depression, i became overconfident just that deteriorated my studies, in one woed, i never thought about the problems that may occur in my life which i could challenge and win through. We think that we need to think a lot in order to achieve success perfectly but rather i got to know that thinking (smartly)is just 5%, we need to work hard as well to achieve that 95%.  Again i have started challenging myself everyday no matter whether i am dealing with headache, stomache, depression, anxiety or fears i just concentrate on present and keep myself conscious all the time, no day off at gym, no 1 minute extra break in studies, no time wasting stuffs. Keep working harder and your time will come as they say(apna time aayega). Thus, challenge yourself every fucking day, keep burning the midnight oil Why? 1-to put smile on your parents faces, 2-to become confident about your abilities, 3-to achieve what you want out of this life, 4-to achieve the highest possibiliy of yourself and become limitless. 5-to not let others suppress you in any stances.

With this information you can create a spreadsheet and a calendar. Schedule your daily learning time and pick a thing from your list and learn about it. Some topics may last for days or weeks. You can use the internet, books, magazines, video or other media in your learning. It would be best if you didn't just consume the information but took notes too. I'd also take time, maybe once a week to go back over what you learned to write summaries and look for gaps in your knowledge. When you find a gap, go back over the material. You could add columns to the spreadsheet to track your learning. This is a basic learning plan. That should work! ",

Lets say if you go to your offc on bike, go in a simple format like maintain required speed, maintain minimum balance of bike and have a controll on throttle, njoy the way to office by observing trees, architectures. Shops,,, etc. Stop freaking out to reach offc, start your journey on time. Lets say you are having conversation with your stupid friends, mean while keep the conversation in a simple way no anger, abusing, insulting, misleading\u2026. Etc. Any way your friends can\u2019t be simple and keep making mess out of conversation. In this way you can learn many things on a daily basis. Simple means doing only what is necessary. Hope it is usefull, share your experience in the comment session if worked. ",

However, what matters is your interest or curiosity towards certain information or experience. They are your driving factors to dwell more into it. Information can be collected as: Follow current affairs: Take hold of certain news sources daily basis. Their editorial sections will help to develop a better perspective on the subject.Books & Internet: Reading creates awareness. As stated by J.K Rowling - \u2018 I do believe something magical can happen when you read a good book\u2019. Make it a habit of reading a book of your choice every day. The Internet can make or break things. You may end up wasting the entire day doing nothing or can get a handful of information enough for the day in a mere few hours.Experiences: Be more observative of your experiences with the activities you are doing or while socializing with people. For example, going to karaoke first time with your friends may develop your interest in music and you may end up learning an instrument. The most important thing is whatever you learn, it should help to achieve wellbeing & happiness for yourself. I\u2019ve not listed the subscriptions or feeds or lists or activities that need to be followed because that\u2019s more up to your explorations & interests. ",

You just got to know that your friend is allergic to corn, you did learn something [about him], right? So don\u2019t limit yourself to learning only about subjects or facts from history. You never know when can you learn a different way to tie a tie just by observing someone or anything else for that matter. Let me tell you a small bit of story from Chanakya's life. He was the person who changed history by crowning Chandragupta Maurya as the king of a kingdom called Maghad( present-day Bihar). Whenever they tried to attack the existing king, they lost. Chanakya was disappointed to know that his tactics weren\u2019t working. He went out to stroll when he saw a little boy with a plate full of rice. That boy took a bite and started crying. When his mother came to check on him, she said \u201cHOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO EAT FROM THE MIDDLE. ITS THE HOTTEST IN THE MIDDLE. START FROM THE SIDES.\u201d You must be wondering, what did Chanakya do with this information or what's so special about it?? But this taught him the biggest lesson of the war. They always attacked the central Maghad, where the forces were the strongest. Thats when he realized where he was going wrong and changes his ways. The started attacking the villages of the boundaries of Maghad and slowly conquered the kingdom and THAT IS WHEN THE MIGHTY MAURYAN KINGDOM WAS ESTABLISHED. So observation matters! :) ",

I think that you will learn new things in life even if you don't try so deliberately. All you need is a bit flare to keep you curiosity alive.Whenever you see something..anything for that matter \u2026ask why\u2026how\u2026when\u2026and you will end up getting some new information everyday\u2026.never see the source of your answer(although make sure it's reliable)\u2026but never stop asking \u2026you'll end up learning something everyday. Hope this helps !! !!Cheers!! ",

The intention to do well there is possibly the best way to disseminate knowledge to many people and interact with like-minded individuals in the same field. Still, you can learn anywhere you go. The ability to learn is not limited to classroom walls or books, but an intention to life itself. This means that all you learn is separable based upon formal education, self-learning, public places, and social groups. You learn across all these experiences, and the ability to cohere them makes for better lifestyle. ",

The better is, completion of a day's work that day itself. \u2022 Attend the classes regularly. Don't miss the classes unnecessarily. Listen to what your lecturers say, most of the time it is more than enough for the examinations. \u2022 Make use of your free time. Do something what's constructive. Don't waste your time, by enjoy. Enjoy to the fullest when you enjoy, but study even harder when you study. Don't take enjoyment while studying. ",
