            "answer_text": "Technically you can. But with conversion from pdf to kindle format, the layout become haphazard. Further NCERTs have rich illustrations in the form of photographs, maps, graphs etc which may not be presented well by Kindle. You may have to mark comments heavily in the book (assuming you are preparing for UPSC) which is not possible with Kindle. As I have explained in my another answer here Kindle is best suited for novels. Even if you attempt editing Kindle format with eCalibre (which I have attempted unsuccessfully) you ll have to do that for tens of PDFs. I ll not recommend buying Kindle for reading NCERTs. This answer is based totally on my personal experience with NCERTs and the Kindle. ",
