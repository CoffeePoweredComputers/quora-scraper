            "answer_text": "I assume you mean sapient. There is always confusion between those terms. Sentient means the ability to feel, and we know a lot of animals have that ability, so we were not the first. Sapience means the ability for higher reasoning and understanding. But yes, I think it\u2019s entirely possible. The fact that we are here, and we see no signs at all of intelligent life elsewhere, means that it is, at least, pretty damn rare. What I mean by that, is we have had billions of years of existing in the goldilocks zone without being colonised by an extraterrestrial space-faring civilisation. There are 4 major hurdles to cross, and we have no idea how easy each one is: AbiogenesisMulticellularitySapienceSurviving technological maturityAll we can do is look at our own evolutionary history and try to make guesses about the likelihood of those three events happening. In my opinion, abiogenesis is the easiest of the list. It happened on earth fairly soon after the planet had cooled enough to allow for life. Multicellularity took billions of years to happen. Clearly it is not easy for life to come up with that solution. Sexual reproduction was important for that step, and it evolved about a billion years ago. Sapience in our species occurred less than a billion years after multicellularity evolved, but I personally think we are a complete fluke. I think our species had just the right mix of being a K-selected, social, omnivorous species, with a lucky period of sexual selection (selecting for intelligence), and transition from niches that demanded advanced adaptation. I\u2019m not saying a similar mix of happenstance couldn\u2019t evolve elsewhere, or that there aren\u2019t other paths to sapience, but I will take a lot of convincing to believe that it is not ridiculously rare. Great Filter is the idea that, since we see no evidence of other civilisations, at least one step on the path from chemical soup to interplanetary colonising force must be improbable, if not impossible. It goes into more detail than I have here, but the concept is the same. The Fermi paradox asks the question, why don\u2019t we see evidence of other intelligent species? It just may be that we are the first to break through the great filter, or maybe the filter lies ahead of us, and we won\u2019t survive an oncoming armageddon caused by biotechnology, nanotechnology, nuclear technology, AI singularity, interplanetary war, or something else. If we detect signs of other intelligent life, I won\u2019t be too surprised, since we know intelligent life can evolve. But if it turns out that we are totally alone, then that will be sad but also not too surprising. I personally think life is fairly common, but intelligent, macroscopic life is very, or even, extremely rare. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. We have no evidence of anything else. What we know about the timeline of the Universe supports the idea that it\u2019s possible. In human terms we know the Universe is incredibly ancient but in relative terms it\u2019s not. The Universe is about 13.7 billion years old. The earth is 4.54 billion years old. Earliest life 3.5\u20134.5 billion years. The earth\u2019s age and Life on earth is therefore a significant fraction of the age of the Universe. It took life on earth most of that time to produce Us. The Universe was clearly inhospitable to any life early in it\u2019s history. It took awhile to even produce generations of stars that were needed to cook up elements heavier than helium needed for life. This supports the possibility that we could be the first. The Universe will still be around in 100X it\u2019s current age. If we had discovered that our whole planet\u2019s history was only a fraction of 1% of the age of the Universe - which could just as easily have been the case, it would have seemed much less likely that we could be the first anything. We happen to live pretty near the beginning of the Universe In relative terms. Maybe about as near to the beginning as any being that could have that thought could be. ",
