But if you have recently started or have not gone through many self help books then you will find this book very helpful. I\u2019ll give you some insights from the book - When you think of a monk do you think of a boring bald guy who has no taste of life? In fact Monks are the happiest people alive till date. Not Really, from a monk you can learn a lot including: -How to overcome negativity -How to stop overthinking -Why comparison kills love -How to use your fear -Why you can\u2019t find happiness by looking for it -How to learn from everyone you meet -Why you are not your thoughts -How to find your purpose -Why kindness is crucial to success -And much more... The Author grew up in a family where you could become one of three things\u2014a doctor, a lawyer, or a failure. His family was convinced he had chosen option three: instead of attending his college graduation ceremony, he headed to India to become a monk, to meditate every day for four to eight hours, and devote his life to helping others. After three years, one of his teachers told him that he would have more impact on the world if he left the monk\u2019s path to share his experience and wisdom with others. Heavily in debt, and with no recognizable skills on his re\u0301sume\u0301, he moved back home in north London with his parents. In this inspiring, empowering book, Author draws on his time as a monk to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and power. Combining ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the ashram, Think Like a Monk reveals how to overcome negative thoughts and habits, and access the calm and purpose that lie within all of us. He transforms abstract lessons into advice and exercises we can all apply to reduce stress, improve relationships, and give the gifts we find in ourselves to the world. Author proves that everyone can\u2014and should\u2014think like a monk. I\u2019ve explained it in much detailed manner in this video on my channel -  Thanks, Pls upvote if found useful. ",

            "answer_text": " Think Like a Monk is a bomb book dude! I finished it a few days back! Probably this will be last self help book you'll ever need to read in your life. He has explained Macros like Identity, Negatively, Fear, Intention, Purpose, etc. Here are some of my favorite lines from the book: \u201cThe more we define ourselves in relation to the people around us, the more lost we are.\u201d\u201cWhen we accept the temporary nature of everything in our lives, we can feel gratitude for the good fortune of getting to borrow them for a time.\u201d\u201cOur identity is wrapped up in what others think of us\u2014or, more accurately, what we think others think of us\u201d\u201cWhen you try to live your most authentic life, some of your relationships will be put in jeopardy. Losing them is a risk worth bearing; finding a way to keep them in your life is a challenge worth taking on.\u201d\u201cRemember, saying whatever we want, whenever we want, however we want, is not freedom. Real freedom is not feeling the need to say these things\u201d\u201cFear motivates us. Sometimes it motivates us toward what we want, but sometimes, if we aren\u2019t careful, it limits us with what we think will keep us safe.\u201d\u201cWhen we tune out the opinions, expectations, and obligations of the world around us, we begin to hear ourselves\u201d\u201cA layperson who is consciously aiming to be continuously alive in the Now is a monk.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t be anything you want. But you can be everything you are.\u201d\u201cLiving intentionally means stepping back from external goals, letting go of outward definitions of success, and looking within.\u201d\u201cI am not who you think I am; I am not who I think I am; I am who I think you think I am\u201d a quote by Cooley he has mentioned in his book.Awesome Book. It is worth giving a shot for sure. ",
