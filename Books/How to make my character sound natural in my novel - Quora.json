            "answer_text": "Figure out who your character is ahead of time. EVERYTHING about them- even if the information will never end up in your book. There are questionnaires out there that you can answer about your character. But the basics: What are their likes? Dislikes? Are they a morning person or a night person? How do they handle tough situations? How do they feel about politics? What\u2019s their history? Are they an only child? Did they do well in school? Are they a type A personality or a type B? Knowing your character inside and out makes it easy to put them in any situation and know how they would act/react in it. Once you have the traits of your character, you can do a fun exercise to dive a little deeper. Find someone who has one the qualities of your character and observe how they speak, act, and how they express themselves. I tend to go into detail about things when I talk. I like specifics so I use them when I speak. I assumed everyone was like that and, therefore, talked that way too. Then I met my husband. Who can tell me an entire story in three sentences without once mentioning how everyone in the room felt about what was going on. And when I ask how everyone in the room felt about what was going on, he never knows. Apparently. that\u2019s kind of a guy thing. So, when I\u2019m writing a character who\u2019s not me (and it never is), I have to make sure I\u2019m only giving as many details as my character would. Another observation I\u2019ve had: People who are confident tend not to use certain words or phrases as often as less confident people. So instead of saying, \u201cCan I talk to you for a second? I just have a quick question?\u201d someone more confident might say, \u201cI have a question.\u201d They don\u2019t feel the need to diminish what they want. It\u2019s cool to really listen to how people talk, to pay attention to how fast or slow they speak, or whether or not they use their hands. Once you get a really good idea how your character thinks, acts and behaves, writing in their voice will be easy. Just try to avoid cliches about how you think people would talk/ act because then you\u2019re missing out on an opportunity to create a rich multi-textured character. (And sometimes cliches are wrong!) Happy writing! ",
