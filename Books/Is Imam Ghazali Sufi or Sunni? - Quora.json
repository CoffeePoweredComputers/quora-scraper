            "answer_text": "He was a Sunni Sufi. The fact that the question was asked in such a manner, reveals that the seeker has some misunderstandings about Sufis and Sufism. Islam can be seen as composed of 2 aspects: Tasawuf (Sufism) and Jurisprudence. Jurisprudence provides a framework for society as well as personal development. It lays out rules on what should constitute Islamic behaviour. Sunni Jurisprudence is covered under four main madhabs: Hanafi, Shafee, Maaliki, and Hanbali. Shia Jurisprudence is much more diverse. The main one today is the Jafari madhab, but there are numerous others which have small groups following.  Tasawuf concerns spiritual matters of the heart, and provides you with the innate drive for a personal relationship with Allah SWT through a total giving up of the ego, a surrender of ego, a pure submission to Allah SWT and His will.  Both aspects, Tasawuf and Jurisprudence are absolutely necessary to attain success as a Muslim and reach great potential. Let's think about what happens when a person shuns one of these aspects (and we see many of these characters around)  There are those who embrace jurisprudence and shun Tasawuf. These people believe in following rules. The reason why they follow rules however, can differ greatly. Some may follow out of love for heaven or fear of hell. Or they follow simply to fit into the crowd. They don't think of the wisdom behind the laws and rituals. To them the law is just there and has to be followed.   It is well understood that law is no guarantee of kind and progressive society. Even a countries laws may be wonderful yet it's society could be quite sick. And we see this anomaly of people who perform all the Islamic rituals, and yet are no better than non Muslims or people who don't do any rituals. Many are in in fact worse, since their observance makes them arrogant. This is because they have misplaced intentions behind following the rules and performing rituals. Some can be completely rotten filthy people yet reading all their salaah and performing everything well.   Then there are people who embrace Tasawuf and yet neglect Islamic jurisprudence. These people are often filled with flowery poetry and philosophical one liners. Although they claim to embrace Tasawuf, they never truly do so, because they end up following their ego. They neglect the way of the Prophet SAW and try to seek and have a relationship with Allah on their own terms, not on Allah SWT's terms. They make up their own whirling and dancing rituals in total neglect of the way of the Prophet SAW. They claim to embrace a creed of love, but end up embracing a creed of neo liberalism and populist ideas. What we see is that many try to justify a hermit life. They end up being of no productive use to society. Their constant philosophising of everything becomes a cover for their running from responsibilities and lack of prudence and foresight.  Some of these alleged sufi cults can be so far from Islam, that they gain a following even among non Muslims since establishing a relationship with Allah SWT is a universal endeavour.   Those who embrace Islamic Jurisprudence and Sufism are the true seekers of the way of the Prophet SAW and the true seekers of a relationship with Allah SWT on His terms. They use Islamic jurisprudence as a vehicle to further their tasawuf. In turn their tasawuf makes them realise meaning and reflect on the various Islamic rituals that Islamic jurisprudence dictates, so they become truly transformed individuals who are distinctly different, distinctly ahead of the rest of society and greatly beneficial to all.  These people are the ones who truly submit to Allah SWT. They fear and serve Allah SWT purely for His pleasure, not out of greed for heaven or fear of hell. They do not run from their responsibilities, be it huququllah or huququl ibad. They manage their ego, keeping alive simply to fulfil purposes higher than themselves, purposes of serving Allah SWT and humanity through kindness, gentleness, strength, determination, commitment, wisdom and prudence. Now back to the question. Imam Ghazali was one of many scholars who laid emphasis on finding a balance between jurisprudence and Tasawuf. If you read some of his work, at times you would think he is against sufis, yet at other times you would think he is a sufi. This is because he was most concerned with navigating and finding a balance between the two aspects. ",

            "answer_text": "Imam Ghazali was a Sunni Muslim who live an ascetic life for a brief period to experience Sufism. Sufism is not alien to teachings in Islam as these were the lives of some of the Companions of the Prophet. There is no such thing as either or as one can lead an ascetic or leave it at one\u2019s convenience. ",
