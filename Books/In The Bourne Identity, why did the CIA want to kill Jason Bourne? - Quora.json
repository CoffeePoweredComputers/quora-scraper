            "answer_text": "As a Treadstone operative, Jason was assigned to assassinate Nykwana Wombosi. Wombosi was an exiled African warlord who\u2019d been blackmailing the CIA. He was threatening to reveal damaging CIA secrets unless they re-installed him as head of his former government. After doing a lot of preliminary research, Jason managed to sneak onto Wombosi\u2019s yacht and hide out for five days until the ship was well away from dry land. He made his way to the room where he knew the man would be sleeping, prepared to put a bullet in his head. However, when he saw that Wombosi was surrounded by his children, he didn\u2019t have the heart to murder him. Instead, he backed away, but was soon discovered and shot just before he tumbled into the sea. At that moment, Jason lost his identity and had no idea who he was when he was pulled out of the water by a fishing boat. Treadstone didn\u2019t know what had happened and instead, believed he\u2019d gone rogue. Whenever that happened with an agent, they moved quickly to eliminate the threat and that\u2019s what they attempted to do with Jason. ",
