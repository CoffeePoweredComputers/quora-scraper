            "answer_text": "See my book list is a bit different from the conventional sources so one might find them irrelevant but since you asked For coaching that is something that some might find essential other don't it's a individuals opinion My personal view one should only opt for coaching when one has ample time to prepare for ex immediately after graduation or in between graduation if possible. With coaching there are few things one should consider Faculty (really important)Distance from your home, pg, hostel etcDurationFee (GS+CSAT+ optional)Popularity doesn't matter it has nothing to do with selectionAlso i believe if one is sincere enough and has determination to fight he/she won't need any coaching for him/her selection is only thing that matters and believe me there are all kind of notes (written) and study material available in the market or online, remember time is very precious Now for preparation you can do few things Syllabus learn it by heartAnalyse previous years (pre + mains) simultaneouslyGive a good amount of thought for your optional selection (very crucial for selection). Look for previous year papers of optional which you have chosen and then decide, also look for sources, material etcNCERT old or new (6\u201312) read, write, revise (RWR) VERY CONCISE NOTES NO PHDMODERN INDIA : SONALI BANSAL ( i find it one stop solution )Ancient India ( RS SHARMA +PREVIOUS YEARS make notes on questions itself)Medieval india ( Satish Chandra + previous years) for both ancient and medieval focus more on art and culture, social, economic, political, architecture, aspectsPolity trio (subash Kashyap tailor made for upsc pakka sarkari material)Geography (NCERT 6\u201312 + previous years+ indian current affairs on park, sanctuary, reserve, minerals, acts, wildlife etc) follow pib or its gistIndian economy (NCERT 11, 12 (macro + some topics of micro ex demand and supply))A very good source for Economy which i found recently is Indian economy by Jayant ParikshitEnvironment & ecology for this subject i think vajiram has a great faculty and her notes (both written and handouts) play very crucial role (faculty : VAISHALI ANAND)science & technology ( again vajiram has great faculty no denying so i you want go for thier notes (written and handouts)) especially Rahul shankar, vinoy krishna, Hema binduArt and culture (11 NCERT Book ) + plus wherever you find art and culture aspect while reading history make notes out of itCurrent affairs ( June to may ) entire one year + pibFollow any national newspaper be it the Hindu or indian expressPre + mains go hand in handCover your optional before prelims atleast 2 revisionsDo lot of answer writing from previous yearsAlways make notes syllabus wise and your static + dynamic notes should supplement each otherAtlast revise revise and again revise opt for test series only after completing syllabusThere are many books which i didn't reveal intentionally as they be might confusing so just follow these first and give it a thought before buying as there might be chances that some very intellectual mind will tell a different story (if you know what i mean) Best of luck Views are personal Hope to be of help Peace ",
