            "answer_text": "Getting rich is something of a Holy Grail for many Americans, who have been warned that their retirement will look like a scene out of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" if they fail to save up at least $1 million before they're old. Although many, perhaps most, people doubt they can save and invest that much, in reality building up a $1 million nest-egg is pretty easy. In fact, if you start young and follow these six steps, you can do it without really trying. Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all theseCryptocurrencies are heading to, DON'T GIVE UP!!! I almost gave up too until i came across Multicoinbank Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.multicoinbank,com) where i get double of my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency.Contribute to a 401(k): When you get your first job, there's a good chance that somebody in the human resources department will try to talk you into investing in the company's 401(k) savings plan. You may want to play poor and say no, or contribute the absolute minimum. Do the opposite. Even though you think you're too poor to save every week, these plans make saving cheap and easy. You should use them to save as much as you can from the first moment they allow you to contribute. It gets you into the good habit of paying yourself first and it can make you rich with practically no effort at all. Here's why: Contributions come out of your paycheck before state and federal income taxes are computed. Assuming that you pay, say, 25 percent of your income in tax, that means that each $100 you contribute costs you just $75 in spendable income. Even better, the vast majority of employers practically bribe you to save by matching your contributions to set levels. The matching contributions are often generous. According to the 401(k) Help Center, half of employers kick in between $1 and 50 cents for each $1 the employee contributes on their first 6 percent of wages. What does that mean? Let's say you get a job earning $40,000 annually, or $3,333 per month. If you contributed 6 percent of that amount, or $200 each month, your employer would kick in another $200. You'd end up with $400 in savings after the first month and $4,800 after the first year, without taking investment returns into account. Yet because your contributions were deducted before income taxes were taken out of your wages, the $200 you contributed cost you just $150 per month, or $1,800 per year, in spendable cash. ",
