Perhaps that is all you can read, but it seems like you don't have the motivation, perhaps not; but for me when I am motivated to read and am in the middle of an amazing book I read for a half an hour and finish 1/3 to 1/2 of a 400 page book. I am a extremely fast reader though. (I finished Les Miserables in one week.) it could be that your mind cant read the pages of the website as fast as others, as your brain doesn't actually read the whole word but the design of them in general\u2026so that could be it. For example, can you read this?\u2026 7H15 M3554G3 53RV35 7O PR0V3 H0W 0UR M1ND5 C4N D0 4M4Z1NG 7H1NG5! 1MPR3551V3 7H1NG5! 1N 7H3 B3G1NN1NG 17 WA5 H4RD BU7 N0W, 0N 7H15 LIN3 Y0UR M1ND 1S R34D1NG 17 4U70M471C4LLY W17H 0U7 3V3N 7H1NK1NG 4B0U7 17, B3 PROUD! 0NLY C3R741N P30PL3 C4N R3AD 7H15. and then this one: I cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdanieg.

            "answer_text": "What you're looking for is called Speed Reading. A first step is to learn how to overcome your likes and dislikes and be able to read in any media, be they books, screens or whatever. As my older brother once said to me: \u201cWe never know where the truth might be\u201d. For celerity in your reading skill, you need to stop subvocalization, if that's a habit you have. It's better to gain a photographic ability to register the text in your mind. Understanding eye movements is also a way to improve the way you read, coming to use less movement, directing energy to understanding. It is also good to comprehend that it's not exactly the quantity, but mainly the quality of what you read that matters. This will help you to recognize how to skip parts of the text where you can just overlook. Many times, long texts are just a way the author utilizes to hide his confusion and ignorance. Especially with business, which is a pragmatic area of life, it's better to put into practice what you learn, because theory is never ideally applicable. Reality is much more than reading. Talk to enterpreneurs so you can lear by their mistakes too. Always have a project for your life, so you can prioritize what to know and do next. Don't ever believe what you read or hear, no matter who's saying. Critical thinking is an ability that will help you to recognize the quality of what your facing. In terms of reading, this helps you to immediately go away from poorer texts and spend more time in richer ones. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d suggest 2 best ways to achieve this reading goal: Alter your daily schedule and make time for reading - in this time your only task is to read 100 pages. You can do this either in the Morning before you begin your day or in the Evening before you go to bed. If you\u2019re a busy person, split your reading time and read 10 pages once every 2 hours. This way, you are forcing yourself to do nothing but, read 100 pages. It can be a bit hard at first but eventually, you will get used to it.Start small and work your way up - You can start reading 5\u201310 pages a day and work your way up to 100 pages. This way, it becomes a habit and it\u2019s much easier to read 100 pages.Besides everything, it\u2019s really a mental task. If you want it so much, have the grit to pursue it and just go for it. Wishing you all green lights! ",

Ok all joking aside don\u2019t give yourself such an unattainable goal to reach for. It would be one thing if you were talking about a book but when you are reading articles online you first have to do the research and that could take sometimes 90% of the time. Anything you get from on line you have to make sure it is real there is so much fake stuff. But what you might want to do is choose one or two days just to do the research and then read on the other days from what you found on your research days. I can\u2019t guarantee you will get to 100 pages but it would certain be better then 15. Not everyone reads at the same speed don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone else just do the best you can do for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Chris, Why fight your nature? Perhaps there are some 80/20 solutions out there. Audio books? And if you like reading the web, why not podcasts, audio/video interviews or like NPR has, the audio segments of their stories? Instead of reading the book, reading a web article, reading an ebook, or reading the transcript of an interview, listen while you drive or exercise? That\u2019s one way to be efficient. A 2nd way I might recommend is to learn the study habits of successful students. Read Cal Newport\u2019s books. He studied how successful students performed so well. They DON\u2019T pull all nighters for one. That should tell you right there they process information more efficiently than the average student does. Cal\u2019s article archive: Blog Archive - Cal Newport Cal\u2019s books: Books - Deep Work, So Good They Can't Ignore You - Cal Newport (focus on the good student ones if you like) Hope this helps. Note: personally, I enjoy reading and can devour 100 pages a day if I had the time. I do have personalized speed reading strategy that helps me. Maybe you can come up with one for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Reading 100 pages of a standard print novel in around 1 day is quite an effort. You either have to be an excellent reader and also give full focus to reading; whilst reading. Let us do some maths. I take 60 seconds (1 minute) to read 1 page of a standard thriller novel which has 11 words * 45 lines in a single page. i.e. 495 words. Assuming exactly the book would have 100 pages in the same pattern, it would then take me = 60 seconds * 100 pages = 6,000 seconds; i.e. 1.6 hours flat reading. Give and take; 2 hours ought to suffice. But it requires you to be relaxed and read-through properly instead of just browsing through or skimming. I always have either a mug of hot coffee or tea with me after every 1 hour at night when reading. Right now its around 9:15pm at night; I will make tea now and sit to read till 12 mid-night. I also usually use markers if I need to mark something specific I like or wish to revisit again. ",
