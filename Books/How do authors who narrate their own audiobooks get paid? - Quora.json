            "answer_text": "Q: How do I get paid to narrate audiobooks? A: Once you\u2019ve got your recording space and are comfortable with editing and mastering your recordings (unless you have someone to do that for you) sign up with either ACX or Findaway Voices. Fiverr is another place but they really push fast and cheap which isn\u2019t very viable for all the effort that goes into voice work for books. Have Paypal set up or a bank account. Square is another possibility if you have external clients who are paying up front. Most of my audiobooks have been through ACX. One started there and then the rightsholder and I mutually agreed to migrate her book to Findaway instead. I have not gotten to poke around in that one with a narrator account yet, only rightsholder and self-narrator so far. ",
