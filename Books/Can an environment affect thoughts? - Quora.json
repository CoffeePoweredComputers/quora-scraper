            "answer_text": "If we are talking about the physical environment we live in, and if our climate / weather can affect people. I can say a resounding YES! I can say that living in Chicago, Florida, Seattle and LA areas, So I have 4 points of view. I could\u2019t get out of Chicago fast enough. Born there and the weather sucked, so I was always sick. I grew up in Florida, and in general, people were happy, lots of Sunny days, beaches, attractions. Sure everyone gripes about something like rain (but that doesn\u2019t last long) traffic, bugs, crazy drivers, slow lines etc. But in general, life seemed better. Then I had a job opportunity in the Seattle area and we moved. The first thing we found was the profound unhappiness. Daily ads on TV and radio for addiction of every type. Sometimes the commercial breaks never showed a product, just addiction hot lines, addiction specialists, and treatment centers. It really startled us. Then in the Fall / Winter months when it got dark at 3:30 and it wouldn\u2019t really get bright until 9 or so, it was doubly bad. People went to work in the dark, and came home in the dark. Now I did that even in Florida, usually because of the projects we worked on. But this was different, months on end, and it was dreary with constant misty rains non stop, and it could be 35 degrees, dark! Plus your surrounded by mold from the humidity. Then you see more ads for people suffering from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) and all the light therapy devices to combat the depression. Alcoholism was rampant. They did not sell booze on Sundays so on Saturdays the liquor stores were jammed. These are things that seem normal to the people there, but we were outsiders. Fast forward to LA. Now depression was as bad as Seattly, but it seems to be more drug related, LOTS more drugs. Still lots of ad\u2019s for high priced treatment centers, I mean, they even advertise themselves as 5 Start Treatment Centers. Like Best Drug Rehab Treatment Center California & Los Angeles | Best Drug & Alcohol Rehab Centers | Cliffside Malibu, or Malibu Hills Treatment Center - Non-12 Step and Mental Health Evidenced-Based Recovery Or even for Teens, Teen Mental Health Treatment - Pacific Teen Treatment Yep, environment / weather does affect people, it is complex based on the regional climate. But if your question was the \u201cClimate Crisis and the Environment\u201d affecting people? Different response, but yes, it has turned a normal discussion into a shark feeding frenzy. Misleading, incomplete biased, self serving information, supercharged and aimed at our youth that terrifies them at their most impressionable ages. So in that case, the Climate Alarmists are creating an environment of hopelessness that is, in my mind, unacceptable. They think its great that they are pumping up children to alarmist levels. That is child cruelty, no doubt about it, and their parents should be jailed! I know, that is harsh, but child services take kids out of toxic environments every day, and doing that to the kids is toxic. ",

            "answer_text": "Living things experience reality. Although most may not be aware (conscious) of this experience, they will respond to reality\u2019s conditions. A plant\u2019s roots respond to gravity and grown downward. Its leaves utilize solar energy to draw water and nutrients from the roots transporting them to every part of the plant, and transforming carbon dioxide into oxygen in the process. Some plants communicate with each other. When disease effect one, it releases a chemical into the air that when it reaches another triggers the alteration of its chemistry and protects it from becoming infected. Some microorganisms send chemical messages that influence the behavior of the recipients. It is not known whether a plant is aware of itself or of its biological processes, though many doubt the possibility. It seems even more unlikely that microorganisms have this ability. On the other hand, many animals have demonstrated self-awareness. The ability of some to recognize their image in a mirror, for example, or the aptitude of certain species of bird to use objects as tools in novel ways suggests that a mental map of the external environment has been created. Sentient animals, such as ourselves, carry an unconscious depiction of themselves and their environment, a representation of reality in which they are the center. All living creatures have means to experience the environs\u2019 stimuli. Our five senses convey information to areas of the brain that reacts with physiological processes that when they enter our consciousness are in the form of a rationalized recognition \u2013 rationalization being the assemblage of diverse neural data and stored experiences into an understanding, albeit approximate, of reality. One\u2019s unconscious reactions to a set of stimuli are likely to be transmitted to their consciousness when they are associated with desirability, and even more likely with undesirable associations; the rest will remain in the domain of the unconscious. Conscious thoughts are generated when information from the environment excites primal instincts, such as the smell of a favorite food being prepared initiates thinking about eating, or perceived information creating perturbation requiring cognitive resolution. Stimuli can elicit memories that when reflected upon one can consciously consider different actions they might take in similar situations that might produce results that are more desirable than had happened. Our thoughts are inextricably linked with our environment. ",

            "answer_text": "Environment plays a very large part when it comes to our mental health. It seems that people who live in a bad environment have the worst problems of all. A bad environment can mean anything from the people you live with to your housing situation. If you are stuck in a dysfunctional marriage, for example, you would be open to many different illnesses including depression and anxiety. Also, a situation where you are subject to repeated abuse can cause no end of problems. If you are homeless, or live in undesirable circumstances, you are far more likely to suffer from some form of mental illness. Or at the very least, you will suffer from extreme stress. The best thing you can do is to pin point the cause of your problem and do what you can to better yourself. One thing that springs to mind is clutter. As they say, clutter in your life causes clutter in your brain, so it is always better to try to minimize your mess. Even things like light and color can make a huge difference. If you live in a house with the blinds drawn all day you will no doubt be distressed as you are not getting any sunlight in your retinas. Also, if you are in a room with jarring colors, that will likely have an affect on your psyche. It is a good idea to choose the colors in your room to enhance your mood. Colors like yellow and blue are easy to live with and mid green is always serene. Do what you can in your environment to enhance your mood and stay well. ",

            "answer_text": "A child is born as a Consciousness. He is unaware of what his religion is, of what his qualifications are, of what his race is, of what is social standing is, of what is gender is He simply is, a virgin presence, unconditioned and unaware. As the child grows up, many parameters(environments) set in on the unsuspecting child. It can come in many garbs, be it religion or through beliefs or social rules(Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s), family, school, gender, nation and the process of conditioning starts. Essentially, it is the mind in each individual that gets conditioned to the above and many more such environmental parameters. Can the child/mind escape it? NO\u2026 Subsequently, any decision that the mind takes is simply a by-product of the above conditioning(beliefs and values) and also proportional to the level of conditioning For ex, it is ok with some children to freely discuss and exchange ideas with their parents(even if it is on a dissenting note), where as it is absolutely unacceptable to some parents that the child voices his disagreement. In the latter case, the child may want to express his views, but soon realizes that it is better to stay quiet, for the repercussions may be too much for him to handle. All this is part of the growing up process where the environment shapes us into what we are, whether we are aware of it or not. Our intelligence is in keeping what is optimal and junking the sub-optimal\u2026 That is the choice we have and that is what makes each human different. However sooner than later it is important for the mind to disassociate from it as well, else it leads to some form of extremism. Religious extremism is one such case!!

These things determine your lifestyle. Moving from a SoCal beach to Manhattan has affected my patience, stress levels, anxieties, etc. A friend that moved with me also experienced SAD (seasonal depression) our first winter because it was so harsh and long. Everyone jives differently with different environments. Beach, city, woods, desert, solitude, multicultural, suburban, etc. these areas attract different kinds of people, customs and activities. All of which we respond to in a negative or positive way. I'm sure there is a more scientific answer but I can confirm your environment truly affects your mental health, but you have control over it most of it if you are aware of it. Happiness is a often a choice. Its just like finding a partner to be in a healthy and happy relationship with\u2026. Find that place matches you and your interests best and you will thrive! ",

Respecting each individual person\u2019s ability to develop their own unique consciousness without abuse by lower consciousness adults is every childs sovereign right. Humans develop in consciousness from the second density of animal consciousness through the third density experiences to make a choice which path of consciousness development they desire following. There are a group of very wealthy, selfish and greedy elites that have been dwelling in lower consciousness family blood lines for Thousands of years. They have used satanic rituals, sacrifice and child abuse as a way of remaining in power over humanity by physical means of retarding the normal consciousness development process. Many people are awakening around the planet so that we will now begin to create a far safer environment for our children to develop in that is based on self-respect and unconditional love. ",

            "answer_text": "If yiu look all around you, the things that happen, the people and their actions are all an interplay of the human mind and environment. By interplay, I mean that it is not just the Environment that controls the human mind but also human mind controlling it. Thus both live in harmony or disharmony depending upon the subject/area of operation. A simple point in case - imagine a new product in the market which costs say 1,00,000\u20b9. The number of buyers for the same maybe 100. A rival company introduces the same product at 50,000\u20b9. Now the number of buyers will swell to more than 100 say 250 which may also include 50 of the buyers who were ready to buy the product at 1,00,000\u20b9. Looking at his dwindling sales, the first company slashes it's price to 60,000\u20b9 at the same time announcing offers which effectively pegs the rate of the product at 45,000\u20b9. What happens next? The number of buyers may go upto 400. Here, in the first instance, the 150 buyers wanted to buy a premium product and be known as the first users of the product. This is a case of the human mind being controlled by the environment as is the instance wherein 50 buyers shifted loyalties. In the case of the second company launching its product at nearly half the rate, it is a case of the environment being controlled by the human mind. The company saw potential in the product as well as buyers if the cost was reduced and it paid results. So is the case of the first company slashing it's rates. ",

            "answer_text": "Any environmental condition, beyond the threshold of our senses (too much heat, painful injuries, foul smells, etc.) sends its signal to the brain to do something about the situation. The chemical reaction of our brain to such signals is to produce chemicals/hormones that prepare the body for the fight/flee response. If the fight/flee options are taken away from us, we will not feel good, so long the chemical imbalance continues (cause of stress/anxiety). However, our mind can alter its own chemicals. It can do so by raising its pain threshold (i.e., getting used to the situation). Or, theoretically, our brain can also alter its chemicals by observing the reality differently (at least in the case of mental pain such as bad relationships, loss of a loved one, financial difficulties, etc.). So, the environment does influence our state of mind, but in many cases, the brain can override the effect. ",

It's enough to take a look at people living in the country side to notice how their general nature is different than city people. Their generosity, kindness and even daily priorities. You can see people who live in the desert or rock mountains have a more reselient and harsh nature than those living in valleys and have black soul and greenery. People who live by salt water are different than those by fresh waters. Busy life and high towers and noisy streets make effects people's behavior and mental state to match the environment, they are always in a rush and short of time and sentiments, when people in the country are calmer and have a slower pace to everything.. Etc.. You can project this to people living in an extreme conservative family or too liberal family, or stuck in a miserable marriage or a hateful hardworking job. This is how people become depressed or stressed or overworked and they fall physically ill or suffer high blood pressure, or self isolate or become socially disconnected due to the pressure they feel constantly in their daily life.

Person B ( worker class) mind makes him focus on a job to be done outdoors and so he stands in hot sun to finish the job. The environment (heat) is the same for both but mind control is different which makes them act differently. Thus mind controls environment.
