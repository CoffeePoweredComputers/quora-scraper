            "answer_text": "In nearly all circumstances a dying person can cry. Even patients in a vegetative state can sometimes make spontaneous movements and respond to external stimuli. They occasionally cry or even laugh. Even so, there are numerous complex scenarios where crying might become complicated. For instance if there were significant brain or eye injury that restricted these functions, then the dying person in question might not be able to cry. ",
