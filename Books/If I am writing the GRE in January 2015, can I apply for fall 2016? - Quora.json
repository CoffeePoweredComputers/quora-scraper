            "answer_text": "A2A. Yes, you can, if I am correct to assume that you do not mean January 2016. For admissions to Fall 2016, the deadlines for applications would be somewhere around mid December 2015 to mid January 2016. Ideally you would want to give your GRE/TOEFL latest by October 2015. And as previously stated, the GRE scores have a 5-year validity, hence they would be valid until then! ",

            "answer_text": "A2a The deadline for the 2015-2016 is for the application. The GRE scores are necessary for the admission committee to determine if an applicant is ready for Graduate work, and it is a requirement of the University not the Department. What this means you application will not be referred to the Department until the University receives your application. So yes, you can apply for Fall 2015 with a GRE taking in January. ",
