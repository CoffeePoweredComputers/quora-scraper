Let\u2019s all become Iran and solve this stem cell thingy. Lol. But seriously\u2026 There are some people in Turkey who would love to live in an Islamic state called Turkey (later to be renamed as Ottoman Republic, maybe). But their percentage is not the same as the percentage of the AKP voters, or Erdogan supporters. Erdogan and his party are supported by different groups of people for different reasons. Some got rich thanks to them, some got accepted by the society thanks to them. And some believe that they\u2019ll bring the oh so lovely Islamic administration to Turkey. I\u2019m pretty sure that if Erdogan turns this country to an Islamic state, people would be like \u201cWhoa, dude we just wanted a better life, not this\u201d. So no. People do not want an Islamic state. But it can become one if that\u2019s what Erdo\u011fan is aiming. Countries do not become radicalized overnight. I won\u2019t wake up with my long beard and jihad wishes tomorrow morning. This happens slowly. First you ban alcohol. Then you beat who consumed alcohol instead of putting him into prison. Then you start to check who goes to the mosque. Then you condemn who doesn\u2019t go, then you prison them. There you go, your Islamic state. Here is the thing, though. I am feeling hopeful. After the coup attempt, he did not mention becoming president. He mentioned presidency even after terrorist attacks. But not this time. The recent dismissals of military personnel, teachers, academicians etc are all related to the coup. You see, Gulen movement was a big thing. It still is. Now, with so many people being dismissed, you cannot keep track of who is sacked and who replaced them. He might be getting rid of all the opposition and putting his men into these valuable seats. Or, he might just be cleaning the institutions from the parasite called Gulen movement. It is not clear yet whether we are running towards a dictatorship or just a better democracy. At the moment, the whole country is a whole, and they are out in the streets to defend their democracy from military intervention or Gulen intervention. This question will still be relevant after two years. ",

Decmocrcy has got a bug called populism. In populism, politicians take popular stand despite of what is right or wrong. Like donald trump who always talk about white supremacy. Same thing happening in turkey, Tayyip Erdo\u011fan wants ottmans empire. So he also take islamic stand to satisfy muslim world(hagia sophia conversion). Many people in turkey are against his islamphobia views. If Tayyip Erdo\u011fan continueed his progress towards his vision, then it is a bad news for turkey peace. In pakistan, indian, somalia, algeria and many other muslim countries people like tayyab erdogan because of his islamic view.  hagia sophia conversion ",
