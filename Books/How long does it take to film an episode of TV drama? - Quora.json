            "answer_text": "As others have said, it depends. Multi-camera comedies, better known as sit coms, typically shoot an episode per 4- or 5-day week. It's a pretty luxurious schedule. Single camera comedies take a bit longer, and hour-long dramas longer than that - commonly around 8 days per episode. And the hours on single camera shows are generally much longer than on multi cam. To save money, more and more shows are doing something called \u2018cross boarding,\u2019 which involves shooting multiple episodes at once. So they'll set up at one location and shoot everything that happens there across several episodes. On shoots like that, there's no standard number of days per episode. ",

            "answer_text": "Standard model for a \u2018old hollywood\u2019 show is 1 week. That is 6 days on and 1 day off. Next week is 6 days on 1 day off. Classic shows like Star Trek the Next Generation, CSI, Law and Order were all shot in this manner. Television is rapidly changing however as HBO, Showtime, Netflix and Amazon are redefining how we view (and watch) conventional television. Instead of treating the show as a week-to-week sort of endeavor they are often running the show as a top-down endeavor. The show Stranger Things is shot in this manner, with production set up as one 8-hour long movie instead of an episodic breakdown. ",
