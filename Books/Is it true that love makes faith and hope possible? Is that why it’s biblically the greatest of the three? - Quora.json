St. Paul writes: \u201cif I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.\u201d (1 Corinthians\u202c 13:2\u202c) Faith is the adherence to God. Hope is for God; hope in anything apart from God is useless. Love, however, is the very nature of God. \u201cHe who does not love does not know God; for God is love.\u201d (1 John\u202c 4:8\u202c) ",

People know a man or woman of God within the first five minutes of a conversation Although faith is believing. But remember that going through trials and tribulations will help you grow stronger in life. Especially when you turn to God in times of troubles instead of getting mad and turning away from him. ",
