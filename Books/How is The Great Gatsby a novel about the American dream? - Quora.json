            "answer_text": "People view it as such at least superficially because of the characters (at least initial) fascination with the title character Gatsby.  He is rich, mysterious, throws the great parties and is a man to be idolized by his peers.  Again this is the superficial image, as the story move forward the true shallowness of both Gatsby and his entourage become abhorrent to the narrative as it devolves down to base pleasure with a veneer of respectability.  It is a novel of the American Dream in that initial it is aspirational but soon switches to a realization that with everything Gatsby is still empty inside, thus the accumulation of wealth, power, women, etc is ultimately futile and comes crashing down due to a lack of a moral compass, thus IMHO it is more a warning that depending on how you pursue it achievement of the American Dream comes with a price, in Gatsby's case he appears to have been born with it and thus does not cherish it.

            "answer_text": "Gatsby's ability to invent himself as an aristocrat after rising from very humble origins certainly represents the American dream.  The famous denouement about \"the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us\" and \"the last and greatest of all human dreams . . . this continent . . . face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder\" seems to represent the American dream; also the green light on Daisy's dock. The dark side of the dream of course is represented by carelessness of Gatsby's rich guests, driving their expensive automobiles drunkenly into ditches, and by Gatsby's association with gangsters who wear human molars as cuff links.
