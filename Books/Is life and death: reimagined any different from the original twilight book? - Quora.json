            "answer_text": "Everything is same, except.. there is a gender swap & the end is different. Life and Death is mirror story of the Twilight. The scenes, the dialogues.. everything remains same. Edward (Edythe) is a girl vampire. Bella (Beau) is guy. And it sort of shows how the story would have ended if Edward would have turned Bella into a vampire when she was attacked by James. ",
