            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define modals. There are modals and there are semimodals. Both modals and semimodals are auxiliary verbs that express modality, such as permission, possibility, obligation, etc. The modals, as distinct from the semimodals, are single word verbs that are not inflected, do not have nonfinite forms such as infinitives or participles, and are used only as auxiliaries followed by a bare infinitive. Nine verbs have all these properties: can and could, will and would, shall and should, may and might, and must. The semimodals include ought, which governs the to-infinitive; dare and need, which have non-finite forms and can be inflected; had better, which is not a single word; and had in \u201chad to,\u201d which can be inflected. Be, have and do can be used as auxilaries but are not modals. Thus one could count anywhere from 9 to 14 modals, depending on how strict your definition is. See English modal verbs - Wikipedia.

            "answer_text": "Traditionally, there are EIGHT modal verbs namely: WILL, SHALL, CAN, MAY, MUST, NEED, DARE and OUGHT. Of these the first four have their own past forms, i.e. WOULD, SHOULD, COULD and MIGHT respectively. Modern grammar includes used to, going to, about to, have to, had better etc also as modals. (A MODAL verb, which is always auxiliary, indicates the mood of the speaker, and sometimes the mood of even the listener.) ",
