            "answer_text": "I will temporarily assume that you mean artificially. Well, we don\u2019t know. The accelerating expansion of the universe is aided by dark matter and dark energy, and as you know, we don\u2019t understand a thing about them; thus we cannot extrapolate whether technology could reach such a point, at which it could manipulate dark energy and dark matter. Thus, if you mean artificially we don\u2019t know. Now if you mean naturally, there is a possible scenario, which may prevent the heat death from occurring.  The Big Crunch theory suggests that the Universe could, at some point, stop contracting. That can happen as the universe might have density above the critical density. The critical density, for our universe at its current expansionary rate, 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter, describes the watershed between an ever-expanding universe (below 5 H atoms/m^3) and a universe, which will eventually contract (above 5 H atoms/m^3). Data suggests that the density of our universe is around 0.2 H atoms per cubic meter, thus below the critical density. This measurement though, does not take into account the contribution of dark matter, which as I mentioned earlier is still not understood by science. In conclusion, yes there is a possibility that the heat death will not be the ultimate fate of the universe, and the universe will die in a huge collision, only to be reborn again from its own ashes, the singularity. The fate of the universe is another mystery shrouded under the veil dark matter has put on on our current understanding of physics. ",

            "answer_text": "By huge coincidence, I've just dug out an old issue of the New Scientist magazine, last night, expressly to re-read it: \"Will life last forever?\"/\"Never say die\" (NS, 03-Aug-2002, p28). It is a report on how two theoretical astrophysicists, Freese and Kinney, have followed on from a paper by Freeman Dyson (1979). On the face of it, machines in general (and living cells, and thinking brains, in particular) can continue to work, so long as they can get slower and slower as the amount of temperature variation gets smoothed out. However, the universe is expanding, with potential supplies of energy constantly going over the de Sitter horizon, out of reach of future generations. They consider this, and the way that the machine will get warm, and will need to dissipate heat as it works, so the Hawking temperature imposes new constraints on the duty cycle of the machine. They also consider the implications, should our universe be a brane within a larger dimensional universe. The bottom line is that, in a universe with a simple cosmological constant, life will run out of resources, but in each of the other situations considered, life could eek out a slower and slower existence for ever.
