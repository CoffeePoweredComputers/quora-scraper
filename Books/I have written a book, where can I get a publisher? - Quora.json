            "answer_text": "Okay, let\u2019s assume that your manuscript is really done (written, edited, re-edited, re-re-edited, proof-read (ten times or so)): You basically have two options. (1) You can self-publish. You become your own publisher and earn more money per sold book - but you have to do everything yourself (or hire someone to do it for you): Editing, proof-reading, design, marketing \u2026 There are several possible services to go with. Just google \u201cself publishing\u201d. You\u2019ll find a wealth of information. (2) You can try to have your book published through a publisher. First you need to do some research: Find out, which publishers may be suitable for your book. On their respective websites, you\u2019ll find information on how to submit your book. If you decide to go this way, follow those instructions to the letter. Given that they deal with 1000s of submissions per year, this is the first filter. Anybody not able to read and follow instructions will end up rejected. These days, most books are sold by agents. Meaning, you have to find a agent who fits your profile (not all agents sell everything) and who is willing to represent you. Again: Agencies have guidelines about how to submit manuscripts to them. Also: You may get them interested with your manuscript. But they take on clients for potential, not just for existing projects. So: Be prepared to present solid future plans for other books. Another alternative: There are also thousands of competitions for all kinds of books. Find out, which are most suitable for your book and submit it. General hint: Avoid anything that smells like \u201cpay to play\u201d. While some competitions expect a relatively small entrance fee and some agents ask you to pay a small fee to pay a reader, these costs should stay well within two digits. Also: Anybody wanting money for printing or any other production costs is probably a scammer. Also: Find out what a usual book contract in your country looks like. Writer\u2019s guilds and other associations will provide sample contracts. You can find them online, e.g. here: Approved Publishers Guidelines Good luck. ",
