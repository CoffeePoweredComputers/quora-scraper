            "answer_text": "Well, reading Pratiyogita Darpan isn\u2019t a pre-requisite but it will help you revise the major events of that particular month. It is very detailed. You must skip the details (it is not required). Note that reading Pratiyogita Darpan will not only help you in revising but it will also help you in inculcating the habit of reading. If you have time, you should go for it. If you are preparing alongside boards, I will advise against following too many sources (stick to 2\u20133 good online sources and follow them religiously) Thanks :) ",

Some may find it covered with too much detail but too much details are for your your help and you may ignore them and focus on headlines only. yeah it\u2019s true that this magzine is inclined towards CSE and SSC but you are not a union leader that you should care about such things.just go for current affairs. I would advise you to buy some other monthly magazines as well.English newspapers are a big help. Underline the important details under the headlines and remember them .it will surely help you in CLAT. ",
