Design is something you develop with someone else\u2019s software .so its an invention Only if you are finding out something which is naturally pre-existing . which no one else has found (or) seen before you are a discoverer . Example : If you are the first person to find gravity, first person to discover a new place you are a discoverer Invention is combining natural source or products to make a new product (or) also combining man made products to make a new product Invention involves the process of Creation where as discovery is only finding out pre-existing.
