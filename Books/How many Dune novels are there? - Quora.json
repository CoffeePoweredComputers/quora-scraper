            "answer_text": "Frank Herbert wrote six novels between 1965 and 1985: Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God-Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune. Chapterhouse ended on a cliffhanger, but Herbert died in 1986, before he could write a sequel. Starting in 1999, Frank\u2019s son Brian and Kevin J. Anderson began writing a series of prequels and sequels, which currently stand at 13 novels. In rough order o publication, they are: The Prelude to Dune trilogy, which details the events leading to Dune: House Atredies, House Harkonnen and House Corrino The Legends of Dune trilogy, which depicts the war that lead to the foundation of the Imperial system: The Butlerian Jihad, The Machine Crusade and The Battle of Corin Two sequels to Chapterhouse Dune: Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune The Heroes of Dune series, which fill in the gaps between Frank Herbert\u2019s novels: Paul of Dune (set between Dune and Dune Messiah) and Winds of Dune (set between Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. Apparently two more books are planned in this series. The Great Schools of Dune trilogy, set after Legends of Dune, it details the rise of the non=noble powers in the Dune universe: Sisterhood of Dune, Mentats of Dune, and Navigators of Dune So that\u2019s a total of 19 novels, with two more at least mentioned to be planned. If you want to round it up to 20, there\u2019s also The Dune Encyclopedia, published between God-Emperor and Heretics, which was authorised by Frank Herbert, but has contradicted the original books at some points, and has been ignored by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson ",
