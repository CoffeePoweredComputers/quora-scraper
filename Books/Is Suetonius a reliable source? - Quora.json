            "answer_text": "In general, he\u2019s not bad, if you accept some caveats: He wrote during the reign of Hadrian, almost 225 years after the birth of Gauis Julius Caesar, the first figure in his only surviving work (The Twelve Caesars). This is like a modern historian writing about George Washington or Thomas Jefferson, except that fewer records were kept then. His subjects get progressively closer to him in time, but he is obviously relying on secondary and tertiary sources for most of his subjects.All Roman writing of the time was at least somewhat political. Part of the goal of Suetonius (or any other writer of the time) was to flatter the current emperor, and one of the better ways to do that was to dump on the predecessors of the current dynasty, in this case, the emperor Domitian. Domitian was not an admirable figure based on other sources, but he really doesn\u2019t come off well.Suetonius was more than a bit of a gossip. If there were salacious rumors about one of his subjects, he wrote about them.He should be taken with a good sized grain of salt, but he\u2019s a good read. ",
