            "answer_text": "For some people, yes. For others, no. I know quite a few people who would think 50 pages a day a lot, but do personally read at least 100 pages on days I'm busy (e.g. days I work), otherwise +400 daily. It also depends on what you're reading. Non-fiction and older literature usually take longer time to read than fiction and newer literature. Some book also have pages with more text than others (one page of the Bible does, for example, have a lot more text than this book) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. For some people it is. For some people it isn\u2019t. Reading speeds vary widely. In the last 24 hours, despite work, I\u2019ve read around 500 pages. For some, that is a week\u2019s worth, or more, of reading. Reading is not a race. You are not in competition to see who can read the most pages or books. Read at the pace that is most comfortable for you. It is supposed to be a leisure activity, not a something that causes stress. Don\u2019t worry about what others are doing. Read at your own pace. ",
