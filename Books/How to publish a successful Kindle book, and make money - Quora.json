            "answer_text": "Success is defined differently by different people. Some see success as being able to successfully follow all the platform requirements and finally make your book accessible to readers worldwide\u2014Published. But since you explained part of the question, \u201cmake money\u201d I assume success here means making a living. To answer the question, it depends on several things: The Book Itself - is it what readers want to read? Know your audience and then write a better book for them. Cover design, blurb and the first few pages of your e-book may determine what readers do with it. I still get it wrong most of the time as an indie author, learning how to work with this craft. But I am determined. I will have to learn the art bit by bit.Promotion - How many people know your book exists? Marketing is important. It takes a lot of time to reach the [right] people with your products. But with technology, you can do the impossible. Things like blogging, content marketing, SEO, SEM, SMM and the like are ways to reach people with the news about your book. Yet, it\u2019s not easy. Mark Dawson has a course you may check out here[1].I hope that helps. Would you like to learn how to publish the book yourself on Amazon? Check out my free course here[2]. Or let me do it for you (fees apply!). :) John Monyjok Maluth Footnotes[1] Home[2] John Shalom | Pro Digital Products and Services",
