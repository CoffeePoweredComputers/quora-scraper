            "answer_text": "\u0141*Spoiler warning* This is a tough one and it actually enraged a lot of fans. After the Formic War, Ender becomes a traveller through the Universe (and implicitly through Time) in his search for an appropriate planet where the Formic Queen in the cocoon can hatch and establish her civilization. He becomes a Speaker for the Dead at funerals and lectures in a university. Eventually, he also finds a woman with a bunch of kids and a broken family. He does his best to fix this family and becomes a member of it. He finds a mysterious, incomprehensible new sentient species and goes on to mediate the relationship between them and the human inhabitants of the planet. He makes many friends. He gives the Formic folk a home and a new start.All the while you get the impression that Ender lives for others, ever putting their needs ahead of his. He is the stuff that saints are made of - and many fans who love this character find it unjust that he doesn\u00b4t seem to get to be supremely happy and mainly strives to bring happiness and peace to others.Anyway, Ender\u00b4s life has an average duration, but he gets to live through hundreds of years due to the time paradox. The final book, Children of the Mind, is quite obscure, metaphysical, the events take a twist explained through physics and philosophy and Ender at some point enters a metaphyical space (sort of like Plato\u00b4s \u201cworld of ideas\u201d combined with string theory) where he sort of generates two live people by wishful thinking : a new version of his sister Valentine and one of his brother Peter - not the real siblings, but his interpretation of them, the way he saw them as a child, before being taken to Battle School. The two go on to have their own adventures and tasks to solve and by the end of the book Ender the old man disintegrates after having lived too long (spiritually speaking) and his soul reincarnates into the new Peter. I guess for Ender, Peter is the one issue left unresolved: he only knew him as a cruel sadistic creepy child, but Peter is not like that anymore. They never got the chance to catch up as brothers back on Earth and now two strains of soul have to live in a body and find peace with each other. How that happens, we dont know as OSC hasn\u00b4t written that book yet. This final book in the series is a weird philosophical experiment. I guess that fans felt like Ender was killed off unjustly and deserved more than disappearing into someone else, after having lived what could be deemed as a romantically unfulfilling life. Then again Ender was a leader and sort of a Messianic figure and plain wordly human satisfaction and happiness is beneath such figures, so it is more poetic and suiting if they end up tragically. I cannot say I loved the ending but I do recognize the attempt for what it is and I respect the endeavour at a denouement meant to be bigger than words and human perspective. ",
