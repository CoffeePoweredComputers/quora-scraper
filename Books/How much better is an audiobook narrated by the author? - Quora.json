            "answer_text": "Agree with the other commenter that it\u2019s great when someone reads his/her own autobiography. In fact, I find it a little disconcerting when it\u2019s not ready by the author, especially if you already know what that person sounds like. However, most of the authors are terrible narrators, such as Stephen King. The only author I can think of who\u2019s an excellent narrator is Malcolm Gladwell \u2013 in fact I would say his voice and conviction adds to experience. Be sure to always listen to the audio samples on audible.com, bad narration not only detracts from the book but sometimes makes it completely unlistenable. If you\u2019ve listened to enough audiobooks you realize that narration is a serious craft and not everyone can \u201cjust do it\u201d. ",
