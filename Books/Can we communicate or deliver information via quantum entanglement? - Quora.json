            "answer_text": "Short answer is that it is not possible because quantum entanglement acts over any distance instantaneously, so having an ability to transfer information by means of any quantum state (entangled, mixed or pure) would allow for information to be transmitted faster than light. Luckily, relativity is not violated because it is not in fact possible to transmit information using quantum entanglement. I will do my best to explain why. One of the most puzzling aspects of quantum entanglement is the principle of non-locality. An entangled state represented by the spins of two atoms, for instance, can theoretically be maintained even once you separate them by a large distance (even billions of light years). Thus measuring one of the atomic spins immediately determines the spin of the other, regardless of how far away it is. This behavior, which Einstein dismissively called \u201cspooky action at a distance,\u201d led many scientists to look for hidden variable theories to explain quantum phenomena. Furthermore, the two atoms interact directly with one another, rather than intermediately through the various media separating them; this contradicts our habitual understanding of how the universe works. When people talk about using quantum entanglement for faster-than-light communication, what they really want to do is take one of the two entangled particles and perform a measurement that \u201cforces\u201d it to be in a particular state. For instance, imagine if two maximally entangled ions are generated in the following entangled state and one is given to Alice and the other is given to Bob: |\u03a6+\u27e9=12\u221a(|0\u27e9A\u2297|0\u27e9B+|1\u27e9A\u2297|1\u27e9B)|\u03a6+\u27e9=12(|0\u27e9A\u2297|0\u27e9B+|1\u27e9A\u2297|1\u27e9B) Where 0 represents spin down and 1 represents spin up. This can be interpreted to mean that both ions are in the same spin, but weather that spin is up or down can only be determined by measuring. To transmit a binary 1 to Bob, Alice would perform some operation on her ion that would force it to be in a spin up state. Thus Bob could instantaneously measure his ion and find that it is also in a spin up state. The problem is that she cannot force it to be in her chosen direction without breaking the entanglement. Since we are using ions, Alice could use a Raman transition to ensure that her ion is in spin up state, but by doing so the entanglement would be broken; Bob\u2019s ion would still be in a superposition of spin up and spin down. This operation is not just a measurement, since the outcomes of quantum measurements are necessarily random. Physicists have also thought of other more creative ways to \u201cforce\u201d the result of a measurement. One way would be for Alice to perform a measurement on the particle asking \u201care you in state 0 or 1 ?\u201d when she wants to transmit bit 0, and perform a different measurement asking \u201dAre you in 0+1 or 0-1 ?\u201d when she wants to transmit bit 1. The former would result in Bob\u2019s ion being in 0 or 1 with 100% probability, while the later would result in a 50\u201350 mix of 0 and 1. Since we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios by taking a single measurement, Bob would need a lot of copies of his state in order to determine weather a 0 or 1 was transmitted by Alice. However, the no-cloning theorem tells us that it is impossible to make copies of a quantum state unless you already know what it is. So, in the end both Alice and Bob both have a random string of zeros and ones which only turn out to be perfectly correlated once they get back together and compare them later. In quantum teleportation, this comparison is done by means of a classical communication channel. In this case, Alice makes a \u201cpairity\u201d measurement of her ion (measures if it\u2019s spin is the same or opposite as a known ion, lets say it is in spin up) and transmits the result to bob over this classical channel. If the spins were the same, Bob directly performs a measurement and gets that his ion is also in spin up. If Alice tells him that the spins were opposite, Bob first reverses the spin of his ion then takes a measurement. The key point here is that even thought the quantum state is \u201cteleported\u201d instantaneously (it exists with Alice up until she measures it, at which point Bob has it), the classical communication channel limits the speed at which information can be passed between the two parties to the speed of light in an optical fiber, for instance. So it is only possible to transmit information by using a classical communication channel as well. There are still practical applications where both a classical and quantum channel are used, such as in quantum key distribution where the no-cloning theorem provides absolute security in distributing random cryptographic keys. For a more rigorous, mathematical derivation of why information can\u2019t be transferred using only quantum states, look at the No-commuication theorem. ",

            "answer_text": "We have to be very careful with this and understand what we mean by the term \u201cdeliver\u201d information. To transfer information between Alice and Bob, the simplest way is for Alice to create a bit of information (e.g. a binary 1 or 0) and send it across to Bob. For there to be real information transfer, Bob MUST NOT be able to predict what Alice is going to send. Information theory calls this (by analogy) a high entropy state. But he must be able to accurately determine WHAT Alice has actually sent once she sends it, even if he cannot predict ahead of time what it was going to be. So he must have a high certainty that any change he observes is due to the agreed protocol that Alice and Bob agreed to upfront and that it is accurately transmitted with low error. So how could entanglement be used to communicate? Well, there are two ways. First is transmission of the particles. To communicate, Alice generates a \u201c1\u201d particle and the entanglement guarantees that a partner particle which is also a \u201c1\u201d is sent over to Bob. So assuming that Bob knows the channel distortion with some accuracy, he can then determine what Alice sent. Now some people may say that this is no different than Alice just sending HER \u201c1\u201d particle over a calibrated channel. Thats not true. At the quantum level, Alice can now test what particle she actually sent without destroying that information on Bob\u2019s particle. That sounds very good. But there is a problem. In some cases, the quantum theory cannot establish that entanglement has actually occurred until both ends have received the particle pair, measured them, and then compared notes\u2026.. and that is clearly useless for a communication channel. There is no other way to know for sure that the particles WERE entangled . If Alice generated both particles and tests them for entanglement before sending the second particle to Bob, then unfortunately the quantum measurement process will not preserve the entanglement beyond the measurement process. She would destroy the entanglement! A second way to potentially communicate is for Alice to create a large pool of \u201c1\u201d particles and \u201c0\u201d particles and, ahead of time, send the entangled partners over to Bob. When Alice wants to communicate, she performs some pre-agreed operation on one of her particles, and in theory, Bob should suddenly see one of his particles change state. Its not clear from the theory whether this is really possible since for low error rate Alice has to be sure that the particles received by Bob are indeed in the correct state! And if she did this, at the quantum level, she would destroy the entanglement! Also, for every bit of information to be transmitted to Bob, Alice first has to send the entangled partner to Bob before she communicates. Alice then changes one of her bits and then Bob should in theory see his entangled bit changing, and he can then determine whether it was a \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d sent by Alice. Not exactly a practical system. So, although I believe it is \u201cin theory\u201d possible to dream up a way to communicate with entangled particles, I still have not seen a practical way for it to be implemented in a \u201creal\u201d system.

            "answer_text": "I am not sure I understand what you are asking. If you are asking can we send entangled relationships through a communication channel I don\u2019t know. But if you are asking can entangled information assist in transmitting information, there is a very interesting thought experiment. It is called the GHZ paradox. https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cleve/courses/F11CS667/Lec19Qip09.pdf It is possible to play a game involving 3 people which they cannot always win without using entangled qubits but which then can always win using them. Centrally the game depends on the three players providing an answer which displays evidence of them collaborating to arrive at it, while being too far away from each other to communicate before the answer is required to be given. (They are each further away from each other being at the points of an equilateral triangle than they are from the referee at the center of that triangle). A referee sends out three bits one to each player. The game requires that the referee arranges that either all three bits are 0 or just two are 1. Each player can create any function they like to generate their answer given the input they\u2019ve just received (a 1 or a 0). They then send their three answers independently back to the referee. They win if their three answers has no 1\u2019s in it or 2 1\u2019s and 1 zero in it when the referee sent out three zero bits, but one 1 or three 1\u2019s in it otherwise. No player sees any bit but their own so can\u2019t know if three zero bits have been sent out, and no player sees what other players send back so can\u2019t know if they should send back a 0 or a 1. But they can each use one of three entangled qubits (also sent to them by the referee) to ensure that all three always give the right answer. It behaves like a cheat sheet making the unknowable answer knowable. So entanglement can assist communication when there is no communication. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the common misconceptions about entanglement is that it can be used to communicate (i.e. send information) faster than the speed of light. This has been proven to be false: see No-communication theorem for formal proof. What entanglement tells us is that, in the physical reality emerging from QM, two measurements at any distance in space and time can have correlated results without the need for any causal connection between them. Pls, pay attention to the last sentence (\u201cwithout the need for any causal connection\u201d) which means actually two different things; No transmission of any information occurs from the first measurement to the secondThere was no previous interaction between the two particles that may have lead to an even hidden configuration so that the properties being measured were somehow already set (though not knowable) before the measurementsThese two points are indeed both very important. In fact, when the entanglement was revealed to the world as a fundamental property of QM by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen with the famous EPR paradox, only point 1 was clear. Indeed, the work of Einstein & Co. aimed mainly at using that point to argue that QM was not complete so that point 2 could not be true (i.e. the properties being measured had to have already their values set ahead of the experiment, even if QM was not able to tell these values). It was then only with Bell's theorem that it was proved that also point 2 holds up. After this little historical excursion, let\u2019s go back to the question. The supposed argument in favor of the possibility to transmit information between two observers (say Alice and Bob) by means of the entanglement is that one of the two observers (say Alice) is supposed to be able to prepare her measurement apparatus in such a way that her measurement can just give a certain well-defined value as outcome, thus constraining the outcome that Bob may get from his measurement to a well-defined value as well. Therefore, Bob may deduce the preparation done by Alice from the measured value (i.e. Alice would have somehow sent that information to Bob). Well, this argument is incorrect as shown by the aforementioned No-communication theorem. In a few words, the theorem proves that there is no preparation that Alice can put in place so that such preparation may be detected by Bob with a measurement. This, of course, under the condition that neither Alice nor Bob took part in the preparation of the initial entangled state of the two particles. In this latter case, of course, either Alice or Bob could have easily encoded a message in the entangled state itself (such information, however, would not be sent at the act a measurement but, rather, would be hardly encoded in the system of the two particles since the preparation of the entanglement). So, in conclusion, entanglement cannot be used to transmit information from Alice to Bob or vice-versa. What Alice and Bob can do is just to run their experiments and then to meet and show to each other their outcomes, thus realizing with their eyes that the values measured by the first are correlated with those measured by the other so that entanglement is true.

            "answer_text": "I would like to offer an explanation that might help demystify this a wee bit. \u201cInformation\u201d is not defined in physics the same way it is in normal life. Information has a much stricter definition in physics. For example. Let's say our old friends Bob & Alice each have a single entangled photon, Bob on Earth, Alice on Mars. Now we know that if Bob measures his and finds \u201cspin up\u201d that Alice's when measured will now show \u201cspin down\u201d Likewise we know that if Bob measures and finds \u201cspin down\u201d over on Mars Alice will find \u201cspin-up\u201d if she measures it. (That IF is important) Now let's assume that Alice is lonely on Mars, and is considering killing herself, but just can't decide. Back on Earth, before leaving for Mars, Alice found herself concerned that melancholy would overcome her and so Alice told Bob, \u201cif I see \u201cspin down\u201d I am going to kill myself. If I find \u201cspin up\u201d then I will remain alive. (Alice\u2019s last name happens to be Schrodinger) Now we know that if Bob measures \u201cup\u201d that Alice will measure \u201cdown\u201d and die. We know that if Bob measures \u201cdown\u201d that Alice will not kill herself as she will measure \u201cspin up\u201d. AH HA! So if Bob measures \u201cup\u201d he knows Alice is Dead, he measures \u201cdown\u201d she is Alive. We did it! Information telling Bob if Alice is alive or dead has been sent instantaneously from Mars to Earth and Bob start Alice's funeral arrangements! Right? No. See we can't tell if Alice EVER measured her photon! It's possible she left Mars. It's possible Mars blew up. It's possible she just decided not to do it. Or that her laser pistol failed to kill her and just lobotomized her. \u2026 and on and on. The physics definition of information is not met because Bob can't learn ANYTHING about what happened on Mars unless he checks via Classical Methods. Those classical methods happen at the speed of light or less. Therefore NO information was instantly transmitted. We can not even know if Alice ever measured her photon. There is no way to check, except by classical methods. This is a very fine point and kind of feels like a kid trying to talk their way out of trouble, but it is SUPER important. \u2014\u0000\u2014\u0000\u2014\u0000\u2014\u0000\u2014\u0000\u2014\u0000\u2014 Now, this may feel wrong to you. You are not alone. It often feels wrong to me. But we are confusing information, knowledge, human experience and reality and applying it to a very specific definition of Information. Here is my troubled non physics logic: To me it seems that if Alice measured her photo at the exact moment Bob did, saw her spin as \u201cdown\u201d and killed her self not with a laser gun but by blowing up Mars that this would all happen nearly instantaneously if the whole process was automated with triple redundant systems. And than while it may take time for the light of the explosion or gravitational effects of a planet vanishing to reach Earth that it doesn't matter. Alice died instantly. I just learned about it later. But that is not how information is defined in physics. Basically until we can know for SURE by direct and not indirect data that Alice is dead, no information has been transferred. Essentially humans every day make decisions based on \u201cinformation\u201d which is really just a hint, or a suggestion of something happening, and we act on it. Physics is far more precise. Hopefully some of the confusion makes more sense now. \u201cInformation\u201d & \u201cTheory\u201d are two of many words used VERY differently in Science and this causes much confusion & many many issues.

            "answer_text": "Quantum entanglement doesn't transmit information. When you have two experimenters (usually called Alice and Bob) doing widely-separated experiments on entangled particles, each of them does a separate experiment on each particle. For example if the entangled particles are photons with opposite polarizations, each experimenter must decide whether to analyze the polarization as horizontal/vertical, or one-or-the-other 45\u00ba diagonal, or left/right circularly polarized. What Alice and Bob get from these experiments in their own labs are completely random lists of orientations (horizontal, +45\u00ba, horizontal, right-circular, vertical, \u201345\u00ba, etc.). It's only when Alice and Bob compare notes later \u2014 using a classical communication channel, like a telephone \u2014 that they can determine whether there was entanglement or not. Alice and Bob must compare notes to determine which measurements they made using the same basis. If Alice determined that her 47th photon was horizontally polarized, and Bob determined that his 47th photon was right-circular polarized, those two measurements are completely uncorrelated and carry zero information. However, if Alice determined that her 48th photon was horizontally polarized, and Bob measured his photon in a horizontal/vertical basis, then Alice knows (assuming a high-fidelity experiment, low noise, etc.) that Bob's 48th photon must have come out vertically polarized. This is great for encryption! It lets Alice share innocuous information (her detector orientations) over an insecure communication channel, so that Bob suddenly knows secret information (a random subset of Alice's measurement results) about Alice's lab. Even better for encryption, if a third party (Eve, the eavesdropper) tries to \"steal\" the secret information by measuring Bob's photons en route, the entanglement is destroyed in a detectable way. But Alice can't control her measurement results to send information to Bob. Even if Alice and Bob agree in advance on the pattern of measurements they will make, e.g. \"always horizontal/vertical\" or \"diagonal every third time,\" the polarization results in Alice's lab are still random. She can know what Bob is getting, but cannot send him a message. The philosophically interesting part of quantum entanglement is even more subtle. If Alice and Bob measure their polarizations in different but not orthogonal bases \u2014 for example, Alice measures horizontal/vertical and Bob measures linear polarization at 22.5\u00ba rather than at 45\u00ba \u2014 then quantum mechanics predicts more correlation than any classical theory. But from your perspective I think just means that even more measurements are required to determine whether entanglement is present or not. In order to transmit information you must also have a classical communication channel. ",

            "answer_text": "The quantum waves are in the plane (3D space) of the physical vacuum, and are subject to the laws of physical communication and transportation. However, there is an underlying plane, the information field, which communicates via torsion fields. Evidence of such a connection is in the quantum entanglement phenomena themselves, which evidently do communicate (as an internal \u201caccounting\u201d or \u201cbalancing\u201d system) hyperluminally. The information field governs the quantum wave phenomena; no physical transmission of any kind including communication can exceed light speed. However that does not exclude that the information itself maintains its internal consistency at nearly instantaneous speeds of mutual connection. There is a way to effect a type of supraluminal connection using the information field in Torsion Field Theory, and it works as follows: An optical (photographic plane) matrix containing the mapped-in information of an object containing informational content is entangled with the information content of the photographic object via the universal information field. Then if you remove the optical matrix (which may be electronic, a photograph sheet, or a facsimile thereof) to an arbitrary distance (say to the Moon), then the optical matrix will still convey the immediate and instantaneous informational state of the object in question. To \u201cread\u201d this content requires either a Torsion Field transceiver, or ESP capability. ",

It might be completely the wrong way of looking at it, and I suspect that it is. If you want to communicate, you need Shannon information. A simple example of a Shannon message might be the title of a record I once had (but I dropped it, and it broke): FOO TO YOU! That's pretty simple. You can break it down like  FOO TO YOU!However, with quantum information, you get something vaguely like this:  If this letter is in the first half of the alphabet, the letter on the other message is in the second half.If this letter has an even number, the other one has an odd number.If the other letter is a vowel, then forget about all the other rules, except for this one. They're opposite....This is a kind of information, I guess, but it's pretty useless unless you have the other message. When you get the two sets of measurements back together, you can get a sensible message. However, to do that, you need Shannon information of measurements. And so you haven't solved anything, because you might as well just have used a wire in the first place, and that's less than the speed of light. Because quantum rules are very hard to understand, people have hoped that there was some loophole in there somewhere that would allow some Shannon information. Then they could not only communicate faster than c, but they could get Saturday's winning lottery numbers today and pay back the loans for their experiment. Nobody has been able to do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question! Short answer: No. With this answer, we will demonstrate that quantum entanglement does NOT mean there is communication between entangled particles. We will demonstrate this by looking at what happens with filter polarization. Introduction to Quantum Entanglement The majority of readers may not be familiar with important details of what entanglement is and so we will start with a short introductory to quantum entanglement experiments. Feel free to skip this section if you are familiar with entanglement experiments and how they are performed. The majority of Quantum Entanglement experiments are done with photons, so we will focus on photons in this answer, but the same principles apply to entangled electrons, atoms or even molecules. Here is how an experiment is carried out: A quantum entanglement experiment begins by preparing two entangled photons.An excited atom or molecule over a given time interval will release a photon when it's electron drops down a shell.This photon is then split using a silver screen.Both photons may then be stored in a device.Finally, both photons are measured with a polarized filter at precisely the same time in different locations(or they can be measured at integer intervals of the photons' frequency). Syncing both measurements must take into account special and General Relativity, as applicable.The experiment will measure the photons' polarizations at random angles and then compare results.Results will tend to be correlated according to Bell's inequality: So that sums up the majority of entanglement experiments. Now let's look at one often overlooked fact. Polarized Filter Experiments Explain Correlation without Causation Just because both photons tend to be slightly more correlated does NOT mean the photons communicated to each other. Let me demonstrate exactly why this is the case. Consider two polarized filters. If we take a left-right oriented filter and an up-down filter, we block all light from passing through.  But if we insert a 45\u00b0 filter between them, some light gets through.  Here is a short video demonstrating the same:  Light is a wave. Even if it's polarized up and down, some will still go through a 45\u00b0 filter and become oriented in that new direction. So in our entanglement experiment, we have to acknowledge that some of that light getting through our measurement filter was reoriented to the angle of measurement. This exactly accounts for the difference between classical and quantum correlation in Bell's inequality. And no communication was necessary for the light to reorient itself when using polarized filters in the above demonstration. Likewise, when a photon reorients itself in an entanglement experiment, this does not prove Bell's Inequality arises from communication between the two photons. \u201cSo why do I see articles about Quantum Communication?\u201d When scientists are talking about using quantum correlation for communication, they are referring to encryption for security measures. They are not referring to transmitting information faster than the speed of light. Here's how it works: I send you, say, 1,000 entangled photons to which I have their matching pairs.I also send you, via classical means(i.e. the internet, radio, etc.), an encrypted message using the measured orientation of my photons as the encryption key.You decrypt the message with your photons as the counter key.No one between can hack the message unless they first read your photons, rendering them useless, because they can only be measured once. You can know they were already measured if the message cannot be decrypted.So the answer is No, we cannot communicate through Quantum Entanglement. That's because no information travels between entangled particles. I hope this helps unravel some of the myths surrounding entanglement.

            "answer_text": "One thing that is agreed upon is you cannot send information using quantum entaglement at least not quantum entanglement alone. However information is transferred from one location to another but the information is entirely random. If we both have one of two entangled particles and I observe mine and you observe yours and we do it such that the observations are parallel we will both observe opposite states. No one anywhere else can know what these states are except you and I. However I have no control over which state I observe so I also have no control over which state you observer therefore information is transferred but it is random. Suppose I sequentially send you 10 bits and I tell you to number them 1\u201310 and I number mine 1\u201310. I then observe the 10 particles I have and see a series something like 0100110111. I know at this point that when you observer yours you will see 1011001000. Now suppose I want to send you the hexadecimal 9, which would be 1001. I can send you the numbers 2\u20131\u20133\u20135 for example (numbering my binary digits from left to right as 1\u201310). You would then pick from your string of binary numbers 0110 and invert them to 1001 which is hex for 9. Nobody in the entire world would know what number I have transmitted to you except you and me. So the information would be totally secure. A third party can know the address but not the content. This requires two separate transmissions, one via entanglement and the other via ordinary means. Therefore information is not being sent at faster than the speed of light. So that is an idea for a way of using entanglement to send encrypted data safely. Of course the address has a pattern but if the data pool is very large and the addresses are randomly selected it should be possible to transmit data in utter secrecy. ",

            "answer_text": "It is wrong that it not possible to transmit information using quantum entanglement. It is the believers in quantum mechanics who invented this impossibility because of their unwillingness to understand that quantum mechanics contradicts the theory of relativity and predicts the obvious absurdity. The fiction of the believers can be easily refuted by simple examples, one of which is shown in the figure of the article \u201cThe reasons for doubts about the reality of quantum computer \u201c, available on ResearchGate Alexey Nikulov | Dr. | Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow | RAS | Institute of Microelectronics Technology and High Purity Materials | ResearchGate . According to the postulate on quantum entanglement (i.e. the EPR correlation) the interference pattern should be observed on 2 detecting screen when the first observer removed 1 detecting screen (let this observations mean 0). The second observer should not observed the interference pattern when the first observer returned 1 detecting screen (let this observations mean 1). In this way, the first observer can transmit information to the second observer, such as 0101001, by removing and returning 1 detection screen. Anton Zeilinger descried in the review paper \u201cExperiment and the foundations of quantum physics\u201d Rev. Mod. Phys. 71, S288-S297 (1999) experimental results according to which the pattern on 2 detecting screen depends indeed on the existence of 1 detecting screen. But he refers only on Ph.D. thesis (University of Innsbruck). I could not find the publication of this experiment in articles and no one in twenty years did not repeat this outstanding experiment. So I'm not sure that this experiment was made. But quantum mechanics predicts the possibility of instantaneous transmission of information regardless of whether the experiment was or was not made. This prediction not only contradicts our habitual understanding of how the universe works but also results to the obvious absurdity, for example to an ability to change the past. The believers do not want to understand why quantum mechanics contradicts the principle of locality. Although it is obvious. Some believers are aware that Einstein protested against \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d predicted by quantum mechanics. But they do not want to understand that the action at a distance is spooky since it is the action of the mind of the observer on a quantum system which is observed. The believers do not want to understand that quantum mechanics contradicts the principle of locality since the action of our mind is non-local. The ability to change the past is not the only absurdity that quantum mechanics predicts. The postulate about quantum entanglement, i.e. an influence of the mind of the observer on quantum system results logically to the other absurdity: two observer can create by their mind different state of the same particles, see the article \u201c Logical proof of the absurdity of the EPR correlation \u201c available on ResearchGate https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexey_Nikulov/research . This absurdity is logical consequence of the contradiction of quantum mechanics with realism. Einstein insisted that quantum mechanics is not a scientific theory since he understood that realism is \u201dthe presupposition of every kind of physical thinking\u201d rather than a claim which can be disproved with any experimental results. But most scientists don't want to understand what Einstein understood. Moreover, they censor scientific journals so that no one could understand that quantum mechanics is not a scientific theory. ",

            "answer_text": "Rules for Quantum entanglement that prohibit faster than light communications: If two observers make the same measurement on quantumly entangle particles they will always measure the same result.If two observers make orthonormal different measurements on quantum entangle particles they will only obtain the results as if the particles were not quantum entangled.Note: For mixed measurements the same results the component common axis to both measurement the distribution or results will match requirement 1 for the common axis and the component along the orthogonal to that axis will match requirement 2. Can we Prove these rules? The problem is, how can one ever possibly prove those rules are always true? Quite simply you can\u2019t. But Occams Razor tells us to assume these assumptions are true so long as experimental data supports these assumptions. Simplest Computer Model If you wanted to reproduce these two simple models in a computer model, you could simply at the time of interaction, assign what the results be of all possible measurements. Then when a particle is measured, you make new random assignments for the orthonormal values for the next measurement. It works and could be used to model absolutely every experiment I know of. Requires absolutely no changing values of other particles and waves being simulated when one wave is measured. That is not to say this is the way quantum mechanics works, but is one example of following these rules that definitely does not allow spooky action at a distance or faster than light communications. Learning Secret Data As long as these rules hold true you cannot transmit information faster than the speed of light. That does not mean you can\u2019t become aware of the meaning of information you already have at the same time as someone else at the very same instance. Lets say for example you have the qubit quantumly entangled in two separate storage devices A & B. From some central location C, you transmit a single which indicates which orthogonormal measurement should be made on that qubit. Both quantum computers receive that signal at the same time, and both proceed to measure the exact same value. Now the owners of both quantum computers despite their separation, learned the same secret at the same time, even though no one else in the universe has become aware of that secret. You have learned that we can become aware secret data instantly regardless of separation in space-time. But can we learn instantly about the decisions on the measurements? Triple Quantum Entanglement Scenarios Lets consider triple quantum entanglement. Most of these experiements are thought experiments at this point because triple quantum entanglement is very difficult to achieve.[1] So we have three photons A, B, and C all separated by an arbitrary amount of space-time distance. What happens if I use the same measurement on all of them? Well of course the answer is I get the same experimental results. Now lets say I make the same measurement on A & B, but an orthonormal measurement on C. Do I still get the same results for both A & B? The answer is I MUST. Lets say measuring C caused A & B to give different results 50% of the time. Then 50% of the time I could instantly detect someone choice to make an orthogonal measurement on C. It turns out this would be true regardless how far away C was when the measurement was made, and regardless if the measurement was made in the past or the future. So the measurement of C cannot break the quantum entanglement between A & B. Now there is one other scenario to consider. What if I measure A & B at the same time in orthonormal measurements. Is C entangled with A or B? (This technique is considered quantum compression.) We learned above that measuring C could not break the entanglement between A & B. So likewise if I make the same measurements on C as I did for A, I should receive the same results as A. The measurement of B could not break that entanglement. If I make the same measurement on C as I did for B, then I should receive the same results as for B. The measurement of A cannot break that quantum entanglement. This argument hold true regardless if we measure C in the past of measurements A & B, in the future of measurements A & B, very far away, or very close to where I measure A & B. Ultimately, quantum entanglement tells me what to expect when I later compare the measurements. However, quantum entanglement does not tell me anything about what the distant experimenter chooses to measure until I can compare those results. We never learn about choices made faster than that information can be communicated by traditional means. That is what we mean when we say information cannot be communicated faster than the speed of light. Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser If you think this makes sense, then I suggest reviewing: Delayed choice quantum eraser - Wikipedia If you truly understand what they are talking about you will have to rethink through this several times to reconcile how a quantum eraser, or a delayed quantum eraser can really work with my two simple rules. To me the simplest explanation is we don\u2019t have coherent waves coming from each slit. So of course on the left, I see no diffraction pattern, as the in phase pattern is precisely shifted with the out of phase pattern to create no net diffraction pattern. However, depending on where a photon shows up on screen tells us something about the probability the waves are in phase or out of phase. Say D1 is triggered primarily when the waves are in phase, and D2 is primarily out of phase. Then R1 ( the diffraction data that triggered D1 ) will primarily show the in phase pattern, and R2 out of phase pattern. Since the measurement of in phase v.s. out of phase must be the same for both entangled photons, we reveal the diffraction pattern. If on the other hand D3 or D4 is triggered this is an orthonormal measurement to the in phase/out of phase diffraction patterns, and will provide us no data to help us sort of the two diffraction patterns. Conclusion Notice, I don\u2019t need to talk about wave collapse, quantum erasure or anything of the sort. My two simple rules fully explain the observed results with absolutely no need to understand how nature enforces these rules across a space-time separation. Our actual measured results remain independent, and we only learn a bit more about the system later, when we compare the results of measuring the same thing in different ways.

            "answer_text": "Entanglement is a fanciful and entirely misleading term for the ordinary undirected time characteristic of all time-symmetric determinate systems: basically all fundamental physics since Galileo and Newton. Isolated systems with only a few degrees of freedom display undirected time: there's no before and after, so no concept of communication: all system information is available at every moment of the system's existence. There is no such thing as communication and no need for communication. The directed time of our experience is a direct consequence of the extreme asymmetry in the temporal evolution of our universe. Any system with enough degrees of freedom to support unique entropy, like us, is bound to an Arrow of Time pointed in the direction its entropy increases. Much has been learned and will continue to be learned from studying small isolated systems: they're not entangled, they're just isolated. They become entangled when they lose isolation and start interacting with their Arrow-entangled surroundings. Schrodinger got it exactly backwards when he coined the term in 1935! If you want more details, you might find my answers to What is quantum entanglement? and What is the \"arrow of time\"? of interest. The 2nd link addresses \"Why does the entropy of everything big enough to have a definite entropy increase in the same direction in time?\" ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very deep question. In quantum physics, measurements are subject to two types of uncertainty:  Uncertainty due to the fact that you don't know the state of your 'random' particle.Uncertainty due to the fact that the state of a quantum system does not uniquely determine all the measurements.The statistics of your measurements (including both types of uncertainty) can be characterized using a single mathematical object called the density matrix. Given your density matrix, you can predict the statistics for the outcome of your measurements. There are two key words in your question. These are \"a particle\", which means a single (only one) particle, and \"at random\", which means that you don't know anything about the state of the particle.  Let's look at the \"at random\" first. This means that you know nothing about the state of your particle. This state is called \"totally mixed\" and the density matrix is the identity matrix (up to a multiplicative constant). This means that you cannot predict anything about measurements done on the particle. Any outcome is possible and the results will tell you very little about the state of the particle. This is true even if you have many particles to measure on (provided that each of your random particles is different), because you will not be able to distinguish between the different types of uncertainty. Now imagine that the particles are not chosen at random from an unknown sample, but that you are guaranteed that all the particles have been subject to the same preparation, and have not been exposed to any type of interaction with the environment that could affect their coherent state.  In this case, you will be able to tell if the particles are entangled if you have many of them and can afford to do do many measurements and calculate statistics. There are three crucial aspects that allow you to do so:  You can (approximately) reconstruct the density matrix of a particle if you have many equally-prepared particles and can do measurements on many of them. This is called a state tomography.By looking at the density matrix, you can distinguish between \"quantum uncertainty\" and \"uncertainty due to the fact that you don't know the state of the particle\". This you can do mathematically by calculating the trace of the density matrix squared. If this value is one (accounting for measurement uncertainties), then the system is not entangled. If this value is smaller than one, then the system is entangled.If your particle is entangled to some external object, it looks like it has \"uncertainty due to the fact that you don't know the state of the particle\". This is because the state of the particle is correlated to something external that you don't have access to (*). In fact, the presence of this type of uncertainty is a means to characterize the amount of entanglement that a system has (Even though there is no such thing as an accepted universal measure of entanglement that works in all cases). Note: All this discussion assumes that the state of one of your particles can be described by a vector from a 2D Hilbert space. This is typically the case studied in quantum information. I believe the conclusions are general but they might not be if your state is described by an infinitely-dimensional Hilbert space. (*) There is a trick done in quantum information that exploits exactly that. The trick is called a purification. You can model a particle that you know nothing about by assuming that it's a particle that you know a lot about but that it's entangled to something else. ",

All they see is a bunch of random coin flips. It's only after you compare the experiments that you realize that there is something weird.  When Person A flips heads, person B flips tails.  However to realize that there is something weird, Person B has to send a record of his flips back to person A, and that means that you have to have some outside mechanism to allow people to compare notes. Now it is very interesting that there seems to be this \"weird conspiracy\" that makes it impossible to transmit information.  People have tried to come up with all sorts of elaborate ways to transmit information, but they all don't seem to work.   What I think is happening is that you can try a million different ways to create a perpetual motion machine, but they all don't work, and then you figure out that there is a basic principle of the universe that causes this not to work.  People are thinking about these sorts of things and trying to figure out what the basic principle is that causes all these different experiments not to be able to transmit information. As far as will we ever....  Well that depends, either 1) there is some basic reason that we can't transmit information2) there is some loop hole in the rules that no one has figured out, or3) it's possible that the rules that we have are wrong.  A lot of these things are \"thought experiments\" and it's possible that when we do the experiment, our theories of QM are wrong.... Stay tuned for more updates. ",

QUORA POSTER\u2019S SUMMARY: The Chinese q-eed a photon from Earth to a satellite 300 miles away recently \"Quantum Physics: Title: Ground-to-satellite quantum teleportationAuthors: Ji-Gang Ren, Ping Xu, Hai-Lin Yong, et alia... \"(Submitted on 4 Jul 2017) \"Abstract: An arbitrary unknown quantum state cannot be precisely measured or perfectly replicated. However, quantum teleportation allows faithful transfer of unknown quantum states from one object to another over long distance, without physical travelling of the object itself. \"Long-distance teleportation has been recognized as a fundamental element in protocols such as large-scale quantum networks and distributed quantum computation. However, the previous teleportation experiments between distant locations were limited to a distance on the order of 100 kilometers, due to photon loss in optical fibres or terrestrial free-space channels. \"An outstanding open challenge for a global-scale \"quantum internet\" is to significantly extend the range for teleportation. A promising solution to this problem is exploiting satellite platform and space-based link, which can conveniently connect two remote points on the Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most of the photons' propagation path is in empty space. \"Here, we report the first quantum teleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to a low Earth orbit satellite - through an up-link channel - with a distance up to 1400 km. \"To optimize the link efficiency and overcome the atmospheric turbulence in the up-link, a series of techniques are developed, including a compact ultra-bright source of multi-photon entanglement, narrow beam divergence, high-bandwidth and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing, and tracking (APT). We demonstrate successful quantum teleportation for six input states in mutually unbiased bases with an average fidelity of 0.80+/-0.01, well above the classical limit. \"This work establishes the first ground-to-satellite up-link for faithful and ultra-long-distance quantum teleportation, an essential step toward global-scale quantum internet.\" find more at arXiv.org > quant-ph > arXiv:1707.00934 and in Xinhua news at http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/16/c_136369092.htm And, for an awesome, surely we can't think this is related, can we, but yet... co-existent story, listen to what NASA did with Grant Mahoney's DNA in the following video (starts at about 24 minutes):  You won't believe it the first time.

The result of Bob\u2019s measurement cannot serve as a message from Alice as she cannot control it.In none of the two cases the entanglement allows for any message to be sent. A crucial point her is that Bob cannot sit and see how the spin of his electron changes from uncertain value to certain. His measurement is a momentary event that he has to decide when to do it.

The boxes have a rule that if one of the coins flips heads, the coin in the other box instantaneously flips to show heads. And one coin tails->other coin tails. Let\u2019s say there is a potential habitable planet 5 light years away and NASA sends me on a mission to personally visit it. I give NASA one of the coins in a box before I leave to communicate if it is habitable or not. Two problems in this scenario. 1. I have no control over which way my coin lands, so I can\u2019t force my coin to land on heads to allow NASA to open their coin box, see heads, and know that the planet is habitable. What if my coin lands tails even though the planet is habitable? 2. When NASA opens their coin when I am far out of contact, how are they to know if they flipped the coin first or if the coin outcome was a reaction to my flip? If NASA opens their box and sees the coin on heads, was it because the coin was reacting to my coin that landed on heads or did they flip first causing my coin to show heads? The only way to verify is if I call them 5 light years away and say \u201cI already opened my box. when you open your box you will know which way my coin landed\u201d, but that call would take 5 light years to transmit anyways.

In fact, the information can use \u201cthe hidden time\u201d and/or go out and come into the Observable Universe with speeds faster than the speed of light. I have somewhere an answer about how in the future humanity will protect the Earth against solar explosions, building a shield around the planet. When an explosion takes place it needs 8 minutes to hit the Earth. But from a station near the Sun, a signal of distress will travel two minutes or less and activate the shield. It does not need to be a complicated signal. Neither \u201cthe hidden time\u201d or speeds faster than the speed of light are not so complicated notions. Another example The spooky action at the distance is just another trick of the Universe. This \u201cspooky\u201d appears because our speed of time ( the speed of time in the reference frame of the observer ) does not permit, allow him to observe the duration of time necessary for the information to be transmitted from one particle to another. If we increase the speed of time in the reference frame, then the observer could observe that duration. Period. This explanation is not accepted because we have to accept that information can travel faster than light. (The light is just a messenger for information and we put too much responsibility on her shoulders .) If we increase the speed of time in a reference frame, the observer will measure a slower speed of light than in a reference frame with a faster speed of time ( from all over directions) If we increase the speed of time, the observer can measure the duration between many other physical events that are considered to be simultaneous.

Quantum entanglement is basically defined for two particles that are created simultaneously and the whole entanglement experiment talks about they having opposite spins to a predefined axis because universe doesn't allow change in its total energy and different spin value or I should say different quantum mechanical states of two particles created simultaneously cancels out each other's effect on this universe. And moreover the spin of one particle when measured tells about the spin of another particle, so it basically meant the other particle already had all the probable spin values and when one particle gave particular spin the universe forced the other one to behave in certain way so that to conserve the physical properties of this universe. Let's just hope future physicist solve this question and we will have much more deeper insight to this. ",

How do you place a message onto a system when you have no idea what the first spin, say, will show until you measure it? Then it is too late to code anything onto it. However, you could get more information from the experiment. In my opinion, (details in my ebook \u201cGuidance Waves\u201d) this experiment was flawed because there was another test that should have been done, specifically one of the two paths that are mixed should be shut off, so the other path now becomes known. Prior to doing this, we know the partners of that path gave a diffraction pattern; if they still give a diffraction pattern when the path is known, then you will have some more work to do, and you will understand more about photons and the down converter. If the diffraction disappears, then my suspicions are wrong and Kim et al. were right. Does it hurt to check? ",

Short answer: We are not close at all because the \"quantum phone\" is a theoretical impossibility as been been  implicitly demonstrated experimentally worldwide by thousands of scientists. [Begin rant]The entire article you reference begins with a false premise that has been disproved both experimentally and theoretically. You could try to debunk these said experiments and theory but the odds (kinda a bad pun!) against doing this are staggering. I know of no scientific theory that was ever measured and studied to the vast extent that this one has and then was simply disbanded in its entirety. Theory modified yes! But abandoned? Not so much. We still use Newton. Einstein didn't show that we don't need to worry about friction or that different sized objects falls at different rates. A quantum phone would violate everything we know at that kind of core depth.[end rant] The theory I speak of is the no cloning theorem, well described in Quora, Wiki, arxive, and of course the \"mainstream\" science literature. In a nutshell here it is : No communication theorem: It is a quantum no no to communicate beyond light speed. No data can ever, ever, in any reference frame be sent faster than the speed of light. Note: For some reason people seem to relish debunking science in broad ephemeral language, invoking wisps of technical jargon. I don't understand why! The truth is so much more satisfying, and bizarre! As I quoted elsewhere from Mark Twain:\"Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.\" ",

Let alone how fast or how slow or how much.Quantum entanglement links two particles in a way that a measurement on one will instantly determine the outcome of the other. It looks like there is some information being transferred but there is none - otherwise the theory of relativity will go out for a toss.. The jury is still out on how exactly one particle could influence the measurement on the other located much farther away. Some suggest there are hidden variables but Bells inequality rules that out and experiments are going on to prove that. The only use that quantum entanglement would find in information systems is that in cryptography. If someone eavesdrops and reads a packet which is entangled with another packet, then we would come to know that the packet in transit has been read/tampered with as the eavesdroppers act would break the entanglement.

It\u2019s only when we bring together the two sets of measurements that we can tell entanglement was a factor at all. This is all just as well, because if information could ever be transferred faster than light, relativity tells us that it would then be possible to find a frame of reference in which the information is received before it is transmitted, which seems paradoxical.

This contradicts causality and leads to logical paradoxes. A number of theories and phenomena related to superluminal communication have been proposed or studied, including group velocities greater than the speed of light, tachyons, quantum nonlocality, andwormholes. Similarly Quantum entanglement is also impossible.The basic scenario for entanglement-based communication looks like this: two people, traditionally named \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d share a pair of particles that can each be measured in one of two quantum states, which we\u2019ll call \u201c0\u2033 and \u201c1.\u201d These particles are prepared in an entangled state in which a measurement of the state of A\u2019s particle is correlated with the measured state of B\u2019s particle, no matter how far apart they are. That is, if A measures her particle in state 1 at precisely noon in USA, she knows that B in India will also measure his particle to be in state 1, whether he\u2019s in Delhi, Mumbai, or on 55 Cancri(Just kidding). Anyway this seems like a perfect mechanism for sending information over vast distances. It\u2019s a brilliant plan, but there\u2019s a problem: entanglement only works if you ask a particle, \u201cwhat state are you in?\u201d If you force an entangled particle into a particular state, you break the entanglement, and the measurement you make on Earth is completely independent of the measurement at the distant star. If you had simply measured the distant particle to be +1 or -1, then your measurement, here on Earth, of either -1 or +1 (respectively) would give you information about the particle located light years away. But by forcing that distant particle to be +1 or -1, that means, no matter the outcome, your particle here on Earth has a 50/50 shot of being +1 or -1, with no bearing on the particle so many light years distant.

Experimental research has shown that we can transmit information through properties of quantum entanglement via a phenomenon called Quantum teleportation - Wikipedia. This process has led to a deeper understanding on the transfer of information through particle field theory and associative field functions.

            "answer_text": "Yes. But maybe not in the way that you think. Due to bad science communication (communicating about quantum mechanics is hard), a lot of people think that entangled particles communicate with each other faster than light, and this leads them to believe that we may be able to use entangled particles to communicate with each other faster than light. Unfortunately this is not possible. However quantum entanglement is already being used in the development of secure communication technologies that aim to prevent third parties from eavesdropping. The most famous of these is the BB84 protocol. These protocols allow the exchange of information that, even in principle, it should not be possible to access as a third party. Of course, this relies on the fact that your protocols are implemented properly. The biggest recent advancement of such technology might be the launching of a quantum communication satellite by China. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-37091833 ",

For example we want to sent an information like a series of 4. bits <up,up,down,down> which we know the other particle will be measured as <down, down,up,up>. However, we cannot make the particle to show in a particular state. When measured the particle will always appear in one of the two states randomly, therefore we cannot choose a sequence. Although we cannot send information using q. entanglement, it appears as if as soon as we measure one particle, some information travels instanty to its pair and tells it which state to show or what state was that particle measured. But information cannot travel faster than light. We can only say it is a manifestation of quantum entanglement. We could easily wonder if the state was predetermined and the particles both carry a hidden variable that determines the result. However, Bell\u2019s theorem shows that it is not the case. ",

If two parties A and B share an entangled state, then they does not gain any information even about that state. However, when it is measured, suppose A measures it and his state collapses to |0>, then the state of B also collapses. By looking at the state, B can get the information about the collapsed state of A. Nevertheless, the entanglement, then, is lost. Also teleportation protocol shows that it is not possible to transfer any information using entanglement that is faster than the speed of light. Because it is necessary to transfer classical information too. So, entanglement, itself does not transfer any information. Even if A measures in some basis, and does not see the output, the statistical ensemble of B remains same as it was before the measurement. ",

Of course, it is the former, because that is the only channel in which information is actually transmitted, even if the information is effectively unintelligible. In the latter, nothing is transmitted. Both parties merely have access to a non-local entropy source, i.e. a source of randomness that lives in two places at once. ",

Then when you measure the momentum of the electron, it collapse into a pure state, say with momentum k, what is interesting is that, the positron's momentum should also collapse into a pure state, with momentum -k, to ensure the conservation of total momentum.If you just randomly pick up a particle without observing its little friend, I don't believe it matters if they are entangled or not, since you don't care what happens to its little friend.

While a change of state of one particle leads to the instantaneous and opposite change of state of the other particle. A measurement at either end will randomize the system yet again, making it impossible to gather genuine information. Let's say person A has a particle entangled with a particle at person B. Person A interacts with his particle, measuring it to be spin up. Therefore, particle at B is spin down. But, when person B measures particle B, he changes the system's state again, with a 50% chance he reads his particle as up or down.

            "answer_text": "Today, particles have been teleported several hundred kilometers away, but not physically. Instead of physically moving the particle to a destination, it is instead recreated elsewhere, while the original is altered. In contrast, sci-fi teleportation involves physically sending something, like a human being, to a predetermined location. While the technology in individual films vary, in many this is done by scanning a person\u2019s body perfectly, down to the body\u2019s sub-atomic particles\u2019 quantum states, and then dematerializing that person and sending the scanned information to be rematerialized or reconstructed back into that original person somewhere else. However, this theory is fraught with multiple challenges, both philosophical and practical. Once one of the entangled particle is measured, the other unmeasured, entangled particle will immediate assume the opposite spin orientation. The incredible phenomenon of quantum entanglement not only allows for rapid information transfer, but also makes teleportation possible.

It was assumed that the information exchange was happening faster than the speed of light. But they were all hypothetical. Nothing travels faster than the speed of light. Not even the information we are talking about. Well, future is undeterministic. We cannot tell whether it would be possible to send information to other particle or not.

No waiting around. **** The KJV was selected because it is in the public domain. The Bible was selected as a data source because of the structure of: Books, Chapters, and Verses. 180 complete copies of the KJV Bible were loaded to this Flat File Database, with each copy assigned its own BOGUS translation number from 1 to 180, to make a unique lookup key for each verse {TranslationNbr, Book, Chapter, Verse}. The data is stored in the Flat File database encrypted to MIMEBASE64 to make it unreadable to the casual observer. Decryption occurs below. The Foreach Loop performs the lookup of 5 verses indicated by the 5 hard-coded KEYS. For each of these 5 KEYS, the record byte offset location of the particular Bible verse desired is retrieved from the SDBM index, the file pointer is set in the Flat File, then the record(verse) is read, decrypted, and then displayed to the screen.
