            "answer_text": "Well, lets get updated with the pattern first of all and understand how IBPS frames its questions and what kind of similarities or differences can we expect in CET paper. First things first, I gave CET exam in 2019 which was the first time when IBPS took hold of the exam. As you could see many posts of the analysis, still let me summarize the CET 2019 paper section by section VARC - EasyQADI - Moderate to difficultAbstract - EasyLR - ModerateAll in all, the paper was somewhat lengthy and difficult and one can expect a raw score of around 130 to be a good performance. The rest will be taken care by the scaling done. Now upon analysing the CET 2020 paper, again the summary is as follows VARC - Easy but lengthyQADI - EasyAbstract - ModerateLR - Moderate - DifficultWell certainly there are many changes in both the papers. The CET paper of 2020 was lengthier as compared to CET 2019, but again was much more solvable than CET 2019. As the basic required analysis is now done, let us now move to the preparation strategy for CET 2021 paper. Preparation Strategy Well, IBPS is really testing the nerves of the students by putting some changeling and tough sets, leaving it to the students what to pick up from the paper and ensure the best returns of investment. The First step that a student should ensure is not only top solve a practice set and move to the next one, rather a proper timer should be put forth for the same, see how much time you are taking and make ways to optimize your strategy and cut short the time required to solve a set. A set/ question must be properly analysed by defining the difficulty category and make a rational decision of whether this set should be solved in the actual exam or not. This is something that many candidates don\u2019t do, some would start doing so and leave mid-way, but trust me, this is one such thing that a candidate should thoroughly work upon. Now coming to section by section preparation strategy Logical and Critical Reasoning - One word, cannot be neglected! Surely this is one such section that excites one half of student and checks the nerves of the other half. With 75 question in the pocket, LR sections becomes very important and negligence in this section would be sheer bad gambling. CET 2020 exam saw a sudden surge in the number of puzzles coming in this section. Around 42\u201344 questions were puzzles based, 11 Critical Reasoning and the rest of the section divided for singletons. The puzzles were of difficult level, only 2 sets doable and lengthy Critical reasoning. Given the vagueness of this section, there is one hack which we can surely use to make things in our favour. The sets coming are lengthy, tough and everything, but they are only those traditional sets with some twisty conditions. Enough practice of such traditional sets of all difficulty level would surely make a candidate pro in this area and given he stays calm during the D-day, he/she would surely ace the puzzles part of this section and the rest of singletons are quite easy to manage and hence a 45\u201350+ bet would surely be possible in here.Quantitative Aptitude - With totally opposite difficulty in just two years, we can totally understand the fact about how should a candidate prepare for this section. In short, prepare for the worst. Arithmetic is the dominator as always, but how those values come is a bigger question. I remember that CET 2019 paper was known for giving such not so friendly values. Atleast in my slot, the values did not had zeroes in the end and the percentage indication was also not a natural number. For example, we had a pie chart divided into different expenditure or something and the percentage values were like these, 29.8%, 42.1%, etc. so yes, this made calculations lengthier and one was required to answer with approximations. Moreover, some questions had close options making it more difficult to answer. And this is the worst-case scenario that I am talking about.Comparatively, the CET 2020 paper was far easier than expected. The questions were straight forward and none of the DI set was difficult. The whole section was very easy and hence investing time in QA would surely have fetched results. I myself attempted around 43+ genuine in this section. Well the whole point is, anything can happen. The IBPS is not sticking to one level of difficulty for all the sections. What will happen next year is something not known and hence I said be prepared for the worst. Preparation for QADI will be quite crucial and for what I know, many candidates are weak in this section. But again, nothing to worry. Arithmetic is the dominator so please understand each and everything in here and practice as much as you can. Speed calculation is necessary but I personally stuck with my traditional multiplication style and quickened my addition with some mobile apps. Also, practice of some difficult DI sets from other exams like IIFT would surely help you in here as Level of difficulty is something that must not be predicted upon. QA requires good amount of practice and given it is done properly, everything will turn out to be great. 3. Verbal Ability \u2013 Well even before I start with the preparation strategy, let me get this straight. I got a 58%ile in my Verbal Ability Section and after CAT 2018, only the doors of JBIMS was possible for me. But as the paper was CET, I knew that the Level of difficulty would not be much difficult. And CET did not surprise me. The verbal ability section was nowhere near the mock tests of different tuition classes as the level of easy. The Reading Comprehension was a cake walk and the rest of Verbal Ability was quite easy. Many questions were straight forward and could be easily answered. And for a person like me who is weak in VARC, any good reader with basic grammar knowledge would have nailed this particular section. And this analysis is valid for both the years of CET exams. For preparation of this section, I was into regular reading of newspapers and articles, I was solving the IMS CET take home mocks and kept a self-timer of 30 minutes for this section. And apart from this, I made sure to carefully analyse this particular section and compare my scores with those who excelled in this particular section. Before moving to the last section, just a bit of advice. Always read the instructions of all the questions before answering the questions. In CET 2020, a cloze test was asked and the questions were related to which of the following options does not fit the blank. So, be aware! 4. Abstract reasoning \u2013 Well obviously, the most neglected section of the CET paper, right? Consists of only 25 questions, the level of difficulty is easy, and ultimately, all of us love images so its quite simple. CET 2020 was just a trailer of what IBPS could do. The CET 2019 was easy, no point in discussing that. However, the level of difficulty of CET 2020 Abstract Reasoning could surely be considered lengthy. The options were close and the movement took some time to understand. The basic generalisation of solving this section within 20 minutes and score a 20+ was surely debunked by this year CET paper thus now forcing students to study for this section also while giving the paper next year. Now coming to the preparation strategy of this section, I do hope that the coaching classes would understand the level of difficulty and update the following changes in their mock tests. It has now become high time to properly reconsider each and every section because CET paper is now turning more towards changes in Level of difficulty of the sections thus making it dynamic. Students cannot judge or generalise how the paper will turn out to be and thus it\u2019s better to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. In case you need any help for the CET exam, I am happy to help \ud83d\ude0a ",

            "answer_text": "The MHT-CET exam for MBA is usually conducted in March. So as exam will come near in some time, it is necessary that you make MBA CET preparation plan right now. Before making a timetable for your it is essential you have knowledge of the exam thoroughly. You must know the correct exam pattern and Syllabus. After that, we can move on to our preparation plan. Now, manage the time and divide it in a ratio according to your strengths and weaknesses. For that, it is necessary that you take a brief test before starting your MBA CET Preparation. To prepare strategically for MBA CET , you must go through the following Time ManagmentFor any exam, it is necessary that you keep track of time in the exam. Make a proper timetable for your studies. If you want to devote even four hours a day, then do it anyhow. Remember consistency should be maintained. If you manage your time well, then you will see progress in your learning level automatically. In the exam, you have to attempt 200 questions in 150 minutes. So, it is utmost that you manage your time well. This habit does not come in a day. You have to develop a habit of attempting a question in minimum possible time. Moreover, you must master to differentiate questions like their difficulty level, data present, if a question is doable or not etc. To do that what you can do is, in the starting set a timer while doing a question. Keep a record of the same so that after some time you can see if there is any improvement. This will come slowly, once you become pro, you will able to solve questions on fingertips. Besides, that try to solve questions via short tricks, learn tables, squares cubes etc. It will save your time a lot in the exam. Enhance your speed and accuracyAs time management is most important similarly speed and accuracy are very essential. Once you increase speed and accuracy, you will definitely score better and automatically see yourself much ahead in the competition. Take mock tests regularly to improve your speed. See if you taking less time than the previous day. Most importantly, check solutions of the mock test. You will find short ways and tricks to solve the questions in short period of time. Remember, Don\u2019t compromise on accuracy in the advent of attempting more questions. Take Mock TestFor the best and smooth preparation, it is necessary that you keep practicing model papers like crazy. Never stop practicing the test. The moment you lose the hold of your preparation you will get lazy and it will directly affect your preparations. So, give at least one test daily (One month before the exam) and analyze it as well. For any exam, revise questions from individual sections and then give the mock test of all the section together. Don't spend much time on QuantThere are only 50 questions in CET and you spend around 75% of your time on Quant. Thus, if you spend this time on verbal and reasoning, you score can change drastically. Thus, prepare every topic according to the merit of it and spend your time wisely. Hope this Helps! ",

A student can crack the examination with a good MAH MBA CET coaching which is willing to provide guidance at every step. My decision to join EQL Classes was the best decision that I have made. Like everyone else, I also wanted to be a part of the best business school for my MBA. This is reason why I did a lot of research over the internet, where I only found various promotional advertisements related to popular coaching centers. I took all the information I could get from all of my friends and acquaintances, who have been a part of MAH MBA CET coaching institutes. Almost every review I came across regarding the MAH MBA CET coaching institutes were pretty unsatisfying, this is when I got to know about one of my friend's cousin who cracked MAH MBA CET and was a part of JBIMS. She advised me to join the EQL Classes which has highly trained faculty as well as specialized programs. ",

Being a student of EQL classes, Pune I have realized the importance of time management because as a working professional I was not able to cope up with both of my worlds. When I started my coaching, EQL provided me with a SWOT analysis, after which I got my personalized plan. It gave me an insight on my strengths and weaknesses. Post that analysis, I knew how much time and effort should I invest in a topic or subject. ",

Also note that there is no negative marking, so attempt all the questions.

For MMS program you need to fill in the form on dtemaharashtra website for all the colleges in Mumbai offering MMS. ",
