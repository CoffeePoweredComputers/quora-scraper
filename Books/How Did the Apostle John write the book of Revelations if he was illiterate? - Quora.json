            "answer_text": "Illiterate in what language? John bar Zebedee, disciple of Christ and fisherman from Galilee, was almost certainly illiterate in Greek. It is very unlikely that he is the author of the Revelation, or of the 4th gospel, or of the 3 epistles that traditionally bear his name. All of these books are written in Greek. The style, syntax and vocabulary of the Revelation is drastically different from the 4th gospel. It is highly probable that the works were composed by different men. The author of the Revelation is specified as a man named John. It is a very common Jewish name honoring King David's best friend. I believe that this is a different man named John. Scholars now call him John of Patmos. The author of the 4th gospel and the Epistles is somebody else, not bar Zebedee. I have posted about John's exclusion and possibility of another man's gospel authorship here: Who are the other possible authors of the Fourth Gospel other than the Apostle John? Several other replies here have suggested that Roman period Israelites were generally literate with a decent understanding of reading and writing. Everything that those other posts said is true, as it is relevant to the Hebrew language. Hebrew is what they were taught because the Torah is written in Hebrew. They were probably not taught Greek, especially not in conservative families. Whether or not an Israelite would be literate in Greek has nothing to do with whether or not Israelite children were taught Hebrew. Ancient Galilee's population was majority observant Jewish, but there existed a significant minority of pagan Greek speakers. It is likely that the Apostles and the average resident spoke at least broken Greek. The Romans had occupied the land for about 90 years (since 60bc, advance of Pompey); so it is likely that they also spoke a little Latin. However, bi- or trilingualism does not correspond to bi- or triliteracy. Speaking a language and writing a language are different ballgames. Jesus, for example, was certainly literate in Hebrew. He stands up and reads from the Isaiah scroll in Luke 4. The Torah scrolls would be in Hebrew (not Greek LXX). Jesus questions the Jewish leaders \"haven't you read\" such and so in the Scriptures? See Mat 12:3, 12:5, 19:4, 21:16, and 22:3. And that is just from Matthew. Clearly Jesus had read those passages for himself. Jesus, a working peasant from the hill country was literate in Hebrew. Jesus was not an exceptional case. It is likely that most 1st century Jews could read Torah in Hebrew. Galilee was a conservative \"bible-belt\" region, they likely didn't use the LXX. However, there is no evidence that John, Peter or Jesus would be literate in Greek. Speaking enough to get by in the agora, ok. Accomplished enough to write a book, highly unlikely. (Matthew, Mark, Luke and Paul are different. These 4 were proficient in Greek, but that is a different post). Curiously, you will notice that when Jesus quotes the OT, it is usually recorded as having been from the LXX. Consider Mark 7:6\u20137, wherein Jesus quotes the LXX of Isaiah 29:13. However, most likely Jesus' actual words would have been in Hebrew or Aramaic. The gospel author records it from LXX since the manuscript is being written in Greek. We know very little about John, as he is a minor character in the New Testament. We have much more to work with regarding Peter. Peter is also a Galilean fisherman just like John. Was Peter competent in the Greek language? Probably not. Both the letters of Peter were likely penned by a helper, called an amanuensis. 1Pet directly claims to have been scribed by Silvanus (1Pet 5:12). This is probably the same guy as Silas frequently mentioned in the Acts as a companion of Paul. 2 Pet doesn't give us the amanuensis' name, but it does have enormous similarities with Jude, which itself claims to have been written by Jude the half-brother of Jesus. I think Jude was probably the scribe for Peter's second book. Peter had scribes, because Peter was illiterate in Greek. However, the Johannine corpus, including the Revelation, all claim to have been written/scribed/penned by the source himself. I do not think John of Patmos used an amanuensis for the book. Rev 1:11 Jesus gives him an imperative command to write these things down. Do you really think he looked for a scribe on desolate Patmos, who would undertake the effort for him? Or did he immediately, while Jesus is practicality still talking, reach for reed stylus, soot ink and papyrus and obey? In the first 3 chapters of the Revelation John is repeatedly told 7 times by Christ \"to write\" a short message to the churches of Asia. The Greek verb is in the 2nd person singular (you), imperative mood (command), active voice (do it). This seems to to me as evidence that John of Patmos did it himself. The clearest demonstrates that John of Patmos by his own hand wrote his book is found in Rev 10:4 \"When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, 'Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them.'\u201d Did the amanuensis accompany John along on the vision? Or was John doing his own writing? There probably were not any scribes on Patmos anyway. The whole reason to exile John to there is that it was an uninhabited rock. He would have no impact on anybody. He could not witness or preach the gospel. However, the Romans forgot about the possibility of him writing a book! Ha, John got the last laugh. So to directly answer your question: your basis is correct that John the Apostle was probably illiterate in Greek. This means that John the Apostle probably did not write, nor had been the source, of the Revelation. ",

            "answer_text": "I upvoted Dick Harfield\u2019s answer. It is accepted by New Testament scholars that NONE of the gospels were written by the named persons. They were all transcriptions of oral traditions that had been floating around for around 50 years after the putative death of Jesus. It was common practice at the time to attribute such writings to the various \u201capostles\u201d\u2026\u2026 Out of either respect or aggrandizement\u2026 Further\u2026 The three \u201csynoptic\u201d Gospels are all from essentially the same source material, Mark, and possibly the never-found \u201cQ document\u201d. \u201cMathew\u201d and \u201cLuke\u201d are just extensions of the simplest and earliest transcription, Mark. \u201cJohn\u201d was not transcribed till later, and differs markedly from the other three which is why it\u2019s not included in the synoptic texts. John portrays Jesus in the way that would come to be standardized for the emerging new religion. Again, none of these writings are attributed to any of the reputed \u201capostles\u201d of Jesus. Further\u2026. Revelations is often felt by the more-fundamentalist sects of Christianity to be a handy guide to the \u201cEnd Times\u201d\u2026.. But again, non-religious scholars maintain that it\u2019s in fact a heavily-coded rant against things that were going on at the time. \u201cThe Beast\u201d is Nero, who was thought to be dead at the time but Christians feared his return (as was rumored) as he was responsible for a great deal of persecution. The \u201cnumber of the Beast\u201d is simply Jewish numerology for the letters in Nero\u2019s name. ",

            "answer_text": "John was not illiterate. The mistaken idea that he was illiterate comes from a statement made about him at Acts 4:13 : Acts 4:13 NW \u2014 Now when they saw the outspokenness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were astonished. And they began to realize that they had been with Jesus. The Greek term used here (a\u00b7gram\u02b9ma\u00b7tos) can mean illiterate, however in this context it meant that they had not recieved a formal education in the rabbinic schools. The Jews were a very literate society. Most Jewish parents took their responsibility to teach their children early-on to read and write, and many schools were held in synagogues. However, like Jesus, Peter and John had not studied in the rabbinic schools. Deuteronomy 11:18\u201319 NW \u2014 You must impress these words of mine on your heart \u2026 Teach them to your children, speaking about them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up. The religious elite in Jesus\u2019 day felt that an education in the rabbinic schools was the only acceptable form of a religious education. The Sadducees and the Pharisees viewed Peter and John as unqualified to teach the people. In addition, both men were from Galilee\u200b, where most people were farmers, shepherds, and fishermen. The religious leaders and even others from Jerusalem and Judea looked down on people from that region as uneducated (or unlettered) and ordinary. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, there has been a debate almost from the time Revelation was written about whether it was the Apostle John who wrote Revelation (note that the name of the book is not Revelations). Revelation itself only says that its author was John; it does not indicate whether it was the Apostle John. Second, one of the reasons that even the ancients questioned whether the Apostle John was the author is that the writing in Revelation is not refined Greek. The writing in the Gospel of John and the Epistles, where the Apostle is widely believed to be the author, is very refined Greek. Finally, John by definition could not have written anything if he were illiterate. The only possible exceptions to this would be if he dictated the book to an amanuensis (or secretary) or if he were magically enabled by God to write when he could not. Being in exile alone on the island of Patmos, he would have had no access to an amanuensis. And, the hypothesis that John was an illiterate enabled by God to write is a strange idea never mentioned in scripture. Most likely, some have confused the thought that John\u2019s Greek was rough and unrefined with the idea that he was illiterate. ",

            "answer_text": "Who said John was illiterate? He was a fisherman, yes, but that doesn't mean he couldn't read and write. In the Gospel of John we also see that he knew the High Priest. He could have been somewhat more wealthy and had a comparatively good education. There is a lot we aren't told about him. But, even if he was illiterate, he didn't have to write to be the author of Revelation. He could have dictated the letter, though that would raise other questions, like who was his amanuensis? But, though it may be hard for us to imagine he would have had an amanuensis on a prison island, it isn't impossible. According to tradition, the apostle John wrote Revelation. Whether that means he literally wrote it or dictated it, the result is the same. (Just as a note, some Greek scholars note that there are certain usages of the Greek in Revelation that indicate it was written by someone who didn't speak Greek as a first language. An example would be the angels carrying the bowls with the plagues. The Greek could indicate that the angels were the ones full of plagues, if I remember correctly. It's been a while since I read the book in Greek.) ",
