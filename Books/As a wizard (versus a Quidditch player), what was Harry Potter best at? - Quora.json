            "answer_text": "What was Harry Potter the best at, not including Quidditch? I wouldn\u2019t choose Quidditch to begin with. Maybe for Viktor Krum, because he became an international player while still a student. But Harry had many other talents. Harry thought quickly on his feet. That\u2019s what I see him doing the best: doing well and beating the old masters at quick-thinking. Harry Potter doesn\u2019t have lots to lose, given that he does not have a family to protect, so he throws caution to the wind when he must and he solves problems. Problems that no other student would even think about during a dull moment in class.  The Philosopher\u2019s Stone? What other students gave a second thought to what Fluffy was guarding upstairs? Oh, yeah, they didn\u2019t know a Fluffy existed. They were busy dreaming of their next snogging session or pondering the delicate flavors of pumpkin juice. And as a first year, Ron and Hermione came along for the ride because Harry dragged them into it. And then they discovered how much they loved helping Harry solving hidden mysteries. They were adrenaline junkies hooked on helping Harry.  Harry could duel without thinking much. He did not overthink the process, which was admirable. In the Little Hangletone graveyard, while Cedric Diggory wondered where they had landed the second Harry and Ced took the Quidditch Cup for theirs for the win. Harry told Cedric to grab the portkey and scat (see, Harry didn\u2019t mind if that portray wasn\u2019t there for him and he didn\u2019t know how to disapparate, so Harry would die or think up another brilliant way out of Voldemort\u2019s resurrection scene). And then Harry faced Voldemort and dueled him. He didn\u2019t over think it.   Harry didn\u2019t have an awe for Voldemort or really any other adult, except for Dumbledore and Sirius. So Harry, having grown up in a decidedly unmagical world, had little fear, and he thought on his feet. Had too. To Survive. If Harry thought it through the way many of us would, he\u2019d be shaking in his trainers and would be unable to properly hold his wand to produce any satisfactory sort of magic. So Harry lived in the moment, as much as he could.  Sure, Harry Potter felt scared about his death. But, he didn\u2019t dwell on it. Somewhere, in his future a very dark wizard would face off against him, so he tucked that day away, and lived at Hogwarts quite happily. Harry was the one who saw Peter Pettigrew on the Marauder\u2019s Map, and as confused as Harry and friends were about Peter being alive, they went into the Whomping Willow, and Harry knocked out Snape, just long enough to hear Sirius and Lupin out. Most students wouldn\u2019t give their professors a concussion (and that\u2019s a good thing), but Harry doesn\u2019t think that way. The consequences come later. Right now, problems in front of him need addressing, and why not him? That\u2019s how Harry thinks!  That\u2019s why I love Harry Potter! He\u2019s brave, too brave for his own good. He enters \u201cadult\u201d situations without thinking he\u2019s out of his league. Because Harry\u2019s not. He notices nuances that others fail to see. And the kid just reacts. And he reacts in a way that works. Could it be the Horcrux in him? Maybe. Voldemort\u2019s soul might give Harry that push. All I know is Harry is fun to watch. He possesses so much chutzpah!  See? No Quidditch necessary! Harry is pretty good at a lot more than a game of Quidditch. And even there, his fast thinking and quick reflexes serve him well. ",

            "answer_text": "As a wizard (versus a Quidditch player), what was Harry Potter best at? Defence Against the Dark Arts. Harry is the best at Defensive magic and the best duelist in his year, and in other years too\u2014he was better than most of the students at Hogwarts. He was good enough to be the real Defence teacher in fifth year (thanks to Hermione setting it all up for him)\u2014Umbridge was as much of a Fraud as Lockhart in her own way\u2014and some of the students he was teaching were in sixth and seventh year. But Harry is more than the best at defence and the best duelist among Hogwarts students. He led a team in battle against adult wizards in the Department of Mysteries and despite taking a lot of damage, they held their own long enough for the Order to get there and finish the job. That battle between Harry\u2019s team and the Death Eaters must have been going on for a while, because after the Order arrived, things were wrapped up fairly quickly and when it was all over, it was about 4:30 am (when Harry was portkeyed back to Hogwarts, dawn was breaking, which in Scotland is roughly 4:30 am at that time of year). And by the end of Deathly Hallows, at 17 years old, Harry had grown skillful enough to take on most adult wizards\u2014including Voldemort.  Also worth noting is that Harry was the second most magically powerful wizard in the books. Dumbledore was ostensibly the first most powerful wizard, and Voldemort came in third. (magical power should not be conflated with skill, experience, or knowledge\u2014magical power is raw physical power and strength of Willpower). In third year\u2014at thirteen years old\u2014Harry produced a Patronus as powerful as Dumbledore\u2019s (and no, that wasn\u2019t a fluke\u2014time travel did not confer power on Harry. That power was already in Harry. The time travel just revealed that he was capable of wielding such power). In fourth year\u2014when he was fourteen\u2014he was already more powerful magically than Voldemort. He kicked Voldemort\u2019s ass during the Twin-Core duel. \u2026 Harry forced Voldemort\u2019s wand to submit\u2014if Voldemort was more powerful, he would have forced Harry\u2019s wand to submit. GoF Ch 34: He [Harry] concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back towards Voldemort, his ears full of Phoenix Song, his eyes furious, fixed\u2026 and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way\u2026 and it was Voldemort\u2019s wand that was vibrating extra-hard now\u2026 Voldemort who looked astonished and almost fearful\u2026 One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemort\u2019s wand. Harry didn\u2019t understand why he was doing it, didn\u2019t know what it might achieve\u2026 but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort\u2019s wand\u2026 and slowly\u2026 very slowly\u2026 it moved along the golden thread\u2026 it trembled for a moment\u2026 and then it connected\u2026 At once, Voldemort\u2019s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain\u2026 then\u2014Voldemort\u2019s red eyes widened with shock\u2026 ",

This is all the more amazing considering the uneven teaching he had. Over six years, he had three good teachers of DADA (Lupin, Moody, Snape) and one of those three was an imposter, and of his remaining teachers, one was actually his greatest enemy (Quirrell), one was a fraud (Lockhart), and the other was a political fanatic sent to undermine the subject (Umbridge). In fact, Umbridge was so bad that Harry had to secretly teach the class that year. His three best spells seem to have been Expelliarmus, Accio, and Expecto Patronum. However, he did have a lot of other spells under his belt. But he learned both Accio and Expecto Patronum well ahead of his peers, and the latter even before many adults; his Patronus was particularly strong. And of course, Expelliarmus is how he defeated Voldemort. Harry was a powerful young wizard, but I think that the biggest advantage he had in learning defense were his clear motives: first, he was fighting to survive, and second, he was fighting to protect others. He had other motives as well, but I do not believe that he would have fought nearly so hard for revenge alone. ",

He was skilled in defensive skills and understood a lot of the power required to perform the skills well. He was able to perform the Patronus Charm at 13 years of age, something that Lupin states is remarkable. He is really talented at expelliarmus, a skill that he hones and understands the power of in a battle. He evenly matches three other 17 year old wizards at age 14 and through common sense and luck, manages to come out the victor. He is self-sacrificing and this allows him to abandon some fear when he faces situations that should end in death. He (and Dumbledore) go up against dozens of Inferi and Harry manages to bring Dumbledore back, mostly safely. I don\u2019t necessarily believe that DADA was what he was best at, but where the skills that he developed shone through the best. Harry was best at caring for others and doing all that he could to protect them. He worked with many other witches and wizards but in the end, it was his desire to protect those he loved that gave him the power to succeed in dangerous situations. ",
