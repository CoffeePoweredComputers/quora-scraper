            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s think about this mathematically. If you throw comprehension out the window and just scan every page (looking for jokes or interesting names, maybe? Honestly, I have no idea why anyone would do this), I would say, from timing myself skimming a random page of the nearest book, you could read at a rate of 3 seconds per page. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re \u201creading\u201d a bunch of short books, so you can fit in as many as possible in a single day. If you take a year off from work, hobbies, etc. and take up page scanning for ten hours a day, you end up with 36,000 seconds of reading time, which (using the above metric) translates to an extraordinary 12,000 pages a day. If you can keep this up for a whole year, I admire your stamina. A quick Google search shows that an average book contains approximately 200\u2013500 page, so let\u2019s say 200 in order to cut down on unnecessary reading. Therefore, every day you could conceivably skim 60 books. In a year, you could get through 21,900 books- more than twenty times your desired number! Luckily, that\u2019s far less than the total number of books in the English language, which is almost 130 million. But let\u2019s do something more realistic. Instead of proudly boasting that you\u2019ve looked at more than 21,000 books in one year, you decide that you want to understand what you\u2019re reading. Doing another quick reading timing test, I came up with a reading speed of 50 seconds per page. Instead of 200 pages, let\u2019s give your books an average of 500 pages. Once again, you devote ten hours a day (36,000 seconds) to reading, allowing you to read 720 pages per day. Plenty more reasonable than before, but it\u2019s not looking good for your book count. In a year, keeping the same pace, you can expect to read around 262,800 pages. The grand total comes to\u2026 525 books (and getting about halfway through another) Which is still an impressive accomplishment! Unfortunately, it\u2019s unlikely that you will remember many of the details of the books you\u2019re read. On the bright side, you will have probably set a Guiness World Record. Keep track of the books you read. It might come in handy. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, if you read fast, limit yourself to short and easy books, and spent most of your free time doing so. I\u2019ve read 498 \u201cbooks\u201d this year so far; mostly short genre novels, young adult, and a fair number of novellas and novelettes. That\u2019s likely a personal best, though I haven\u2019t always counted \u2014 I basically hibernated most of the year and read unusually much, and furthermore unusually much simplistic escapist \u201cjunk\u201d. I can easily plow through 2 or more of such books a day, but I also read some books that took several days to finish. If you were to read 3 shortish works a day, which is entirely possible if you let go of your social life, you\u2019d be reading 1095 books. You could read even more, or have more of a life, if you read only children\u2019s or teen books. What most people probably can\u2019t do, is read 1000 books of quality literature (which can also include genre fiction), or 100o nonfiction books, unless they don\u2019t have a job. Skimming doesn\u2019t count; \u201dreading\u201d means understanding what you\u2019ve read and being able to talk about the book\u2019s story, theme, and characters afterwards. It\u2019s easy to figure out for yourself how many pages you could read; just time yourself for a number of pages of average page count (generally that\u2019s about 300 words), and then divide by the number to find out your time per page. Then you can calculate an average page count for the types of books you read, and see how many you could manage in the amount of time you have per day. ",

            "answer_text": "Well in theory it\u2019s possible, if you have lots of time to do it and read fast. I normally read a 300~400 page book in about 1 hour if I like the book, and we got 365 days. So to get to 1000 books we need to read multiple books. If we take my time of 1 hour to read we can read about 14 books a day, unless you don\u2019t sleep or sleep less, but let\u2019s just take 14 books a day. Now let\u2019s do this amazing math stuff to show of my skills, 14 * 365 is what we need, and that is 5110 books in a year. Wow, that\u2019s like 4110 books more than you want, that means we even get free time and don\u2019t have to read a book every hour we\u2019re awake! I don\u2019t know about your reading speed, but with this calculation you can take it pretty slow, 3 books a day would grant you 1095 books in a year, so you can even take a day off without a problem! Now let\u2019s get to what would really happen if we try that. I would definitly run out of books to read pretty soon, and I would get tired of reading after reading that much a day. So to get to the point, yes it\u2019s possible, but I don\u2019t think we can keep it up that long unless you have tons of money to spent on books and are really motivated to get to 1000 books a year.

            "answer_text": "I really doubt it, unless you have all day to read and you\u2019re a fast reader. It depends how fast you read, how much free time you have, your discipline to spend lots of time reading etc. Do you have a full-time job and you intend to read in the evenings? Or do you have a full-time course of study? If yes to either of those, let\u2019s assume you have 3\u20134 hours per 24 hour period that you might put into reading. How long does it take you to read one book? If you\u2019re a fast reader, you might finish one book per 3 to 4 hours (depends on book length) and therefore read 365 books per year. To finish 1,000 books per year, I think you would need to be spending the majority of your daytime (12 hours) just on reading - no time to go to a full-time job or go to school. ",
