            "answer_text": "I don't think it was the dance with Miley. There were a lot of \"those type\" of instances and finally, that was the straw that broke the camel's back. I really never understood this entitlement that celebrities think they have. They are no better or worse than I am. Plenty of us have had a dance or two with a sexy person, and it didn't matter to our partner. If you have a secure partner/relationship, it helps to put more things into perspective. Also, being in the spotlight is worse, as your dirty laundry is judged harshly. ",
