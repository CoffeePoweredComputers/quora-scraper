            "answer_text": "Underlying this question seems to be a utilitarian (or commercial) attitude which may not help you much if you set about reading fiction after being convinced of the \"advantages\" of doing so. Yes, reading fiction may help you expand your vocabulary, enrich your imagination and gain the other advantages listed by Akshay Kurhade and Dinesh Nair. But, these are some of the positive washback effects of reading fiction; they take place incidentally -- almost imperceptibly. One basically reads stories for the pleasure of reading them. If you set about reading fiction in order to derive specific gains from the process, it may turn out to be \"business,\" and, for all I know, it will be a punishment for you. Occasionally, I am invited to give talks to children about books in order to initiate them into reading fiction. I take some of the books I have enjoyed reading, show the books to the children, tell them the stories of some of those books in as appealing a way as possible, and try to sound as excited about the books as Rupert Hughes did: Dear little child,This little bookIs less a primerThan a keyTo sunder gatesWhere wonder waitsYour \"Open Sesame\"! I don't attempt to do anything more. Reading fiction is an exciting experience for many people -- like, say, falling in love. Do you want to experience that excitement? Go ahead. If you find the experience exciting, you will ask for more and more of it; you will feel urged to read more and more stories for the pleasure of reading them, and it will be a self-sustaining process. If, instead, the experience leaves you unexcited, don't bully yourself into reading fiction for the sake of some recommended gains. Related to the question you have raised is another: Is the novel good? Can I read it? I often find myself confronted with this question. Any answer to this question is likely to be fallacious and misleading. When I was very young, I was told that War and Peace was good.  \u201cYou ought to read it.  It\u2019s really good,\" said one of my professors.  Sure enough, it was: the very first page put me to sleep.  Even now, whenever I want to read myself to sleep, I pick up that soporific book.  The results are terrific. But the effect is far from being somnolent when I read Milton, Thomas Hardy, Oscar Wilde, Graham Greene, Herman Hesse or Paulo Coelho \u2013 writers who are known for their high seriousness.  They have done a lot of good to me.  But I\u2019m not sure if they are good for others, too.  I once recommended a PG Wodehouse to a friend who later came and complained that the book was tedious.  To me Raja Rao\u2019s The Serpent and the Rope is an excellent read.  But some of my friends whose tastes are by no means plebeian tell me that the novel is a pain.  Well, that's the problem with being prescriptive or recommendatory in matters like reading fiction and falling in love. ",

            "answer_text": "Many people read fiction to escape reality. But I think fiction helps us discover the reality.  I read fiction specifically because I like to discover what goes inside the head of the character. You might have watched the movie series of Harry Potter, but have you tried reading the novels? Believe me. The novels are more exciting than books. The movies may tell you stories. But the books take you on a journey. Whenever I read good fiction, I literally feel everything that the character is feeling. That means when I read, I feel love, joy, happiness, anxiety, fear, depression and sometimes the fear of death! But how does that help? You do need a book to feel all those emotions, do you? You could already feel them in your daily life. Yes, that's true. But you couldn't feel or understand other people in real life. After all, no one taught you to read minds. And that's where reading fiction helps. It helps you develop empathy. Empathy is a crucial quality for healthy human relationships. And in today's world of constant conflict, it is much more needed. It would help us put ourselves in others' shoes for a minute and respond sensibly. Reading fiction could help you reduce stress as you become completely engrossed in a newfound world at least for a few hours. So why are you still here? Go and grab a book now!
