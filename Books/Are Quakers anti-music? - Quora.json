            "answer_text": "Let me introduce you to Sally Beamish.  Sally is one of Britain\u2019s top contemporary composers. She\u2019s also an active Quaker \u2014 she was a member of Glasgow Meeting until a year or so ago \u2014 and an all-round lovely human being. You\u2019ll know Judi Dench of course. She\u2019s an active Quaker too; maybe you didn\u2019t know that. One of her earliest roles was playing Sally Bowles in the original London run of Cabaret. And a bloody good fist she made of it too, getting right into the character before it, like the show in general, was mangled horribly for the film. Her big Act 1 set piece was expurgated and replaced by something more American-friendly but fortunately, film exists.  For a while I was a member of Reading Meeting, which shares an alley with St Giles-in-Reading, a very high-Anglican church of the \u201cfiery handbag\u201d bells and smells persuasion that takes its music very seriously indeed. Several members of the Quaker meeting regularly worshipped in silence on a Sunday morning and later joined the choir at St Giles for Evensong. It was certainly true that the early English Quakers eschewed music but today\u2019s British Quakers are a pragmatic lot and embrace anything that helps them towards sprituality. Including music, if worshipping Friends are moved to offer it in Meeting. Rising to sing is not a regular occurrence but it\u2019s far from unknown either. ",

            "answer_text": "No, they are not. It is just not part of the normal meeting/worship service. Christmas Meeting is one of the few times where music is brought into the services by planning ahead. Sometimes, as with everything in a Sunday meeting, if the Spirit moves someone to sing, they will sing. You won\u2019t find someone tuning a guitar or setting up drums. Just a cappella. Otherwise Bonnie Raitt seems to do a fine job. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Quakers are not anti-music. They just typically do not incorporate music into their worship. However, this has not stopped Quakers from occasionally singing hymns during their time together. As for personal preference, and as a Quaker, I am actually quite a big fan of music of a variety of genres, most notably Indie music. ",
