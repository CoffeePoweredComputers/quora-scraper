            "answer_text": "Until fairly recently, I thought this to be the case. I actually bought the entire collection in one go, just to have it by the side of the bed and read it all as one big narrative. Unfortunately, it proved to be not a very rewarding experience. To be fair, at this point it feels also that it was a bit too much SF for the recent years, after an Asimov phase, followed by more recent writers (Liu Cixin and Adrian Tchaikovsky). Warning: SPOILERS AHEAD Anyway, the first three books: Dune, Dune Messiah and The Children of Dune go very well together. It's clear to me that the initial two sequels to Dune were conceived as a way to counterbalance what it may have otherwise appeared from the first book as an exaggerated sense of trust placed in exceptional individuals restoring balance to the world because they just decide they ought to and it just so happens that they get it right. I liked the fact that in Dune Messiah the initial exceptional individual senses that he should try to counterbalance his own doings, goes through a major transformation, employs all his skills and ultimately fails in reversing what felt to be the unavoidable complex outcome of his initial good impulse. Further on, The Children of Dune only add to the complexity of the worldview, as it goes beyond the \u201cmixed bag legacy\u201d and follows through all sorts of forces at play which could no longer be attributed to the ripple effect of the initial impulse, but to free choices of various individuals and groups. A bit rushed for a book that had such a complex task ahead, but it still conveys a powerful message. So, if you wish to stop here, you'd keep your eventual high opinion of Frank Herbert fairly intact. After this trilogy, I'm not sure what happens. Either Frank Herbert wishes to maintain some sort of prophetic aura brought about by the first volume of the series, or he gets stuck into some mannerisms, or both, or much more. In my opinion, it becomes unreadable. He desperately wants to be deep and philosophical, to rework the paradox of knowing the future with the added nuance that this future includes choices and unpredictable elements, something like that. But he does it too straightforwardly, too aware that Frank Herbert is supposed to compete with himself, too stubborn in keeping some familiar characters just because he thinks there is some interesting moral exploration of scientific progress, all in all he loses the pleasure of worldbuilding for some weirdly complicated philosophical pose. Let me tell you though that if you already went through the first three volumes, you will probably not be able to stop. So you'll muddle through the other three, with a minor sense of redemption in the final one, Chapterhouse: Dune. Here, I found that finally he brings some new type of characters, which, at least for my geeky side, restored an interest in the complexity of his universe. Let's face it though, he's just as bad as most SF writers in writing women characters and, even though they save his last book of the series, they are not complex enough to compensate for the previous two books.

            "answer_text": "All the ones by Frank Herbert are worthwhile, full stop. The ones by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson - well, they aren\u2019t bad, but they lack the magic Herbert brought to his books. Because Frank H\u2019s last book ends on a tremendous cliffhanger, you might want to read their two-volume conclusion, which consists of Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune. If you decide to read those, you might want to start with their \u201cLegends of Dune\u201d prequel trilogy, consisting of The Butlerian Jihad, The Machine Crusade, and The Battle of Corinn, because events in the conclusion reach back to that trilogy. But read them after you read Frank H\u2019s books, because they will spoil some of the sense of mystery around those. Good reading! ",
