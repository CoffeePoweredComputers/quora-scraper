            "answer_text": "Wow. Interesting question! Here\u2019s the thing. So many English words have multiple meanings, which meanings change, often considerably, depending upon the context in which they are used. A true genius might\u2014miight\u2014be able to write a novel in which, as the pages turn, the context of words previously writtten are seen to change to indicate a different plot drection or twist. (Character: \u201cOMG! She didn\u2019t mean that at all!\u201d) Theoretically, at least, this could create a near-endless loop\u2014but let\u2019s not go there.) Now: how even to begin doing that? Were I to try, I would go through the entire dictionary, thus, to create my own (digitally cross-referenced) grid of words which meanings significantly change according to context. (Even the thought of doing only that is mind-boggling.) Then I would concoct a plot in which these contexts are ruthlessly toyed with. (P.S.: All \u201cnovels\u201d Being fiction, all are \u201cfictional novels.\u201d Were I you I wouldn\u2019t use that phrase again.) ",

            "answer_text": "Possible? Maybe. It will be extremely strenuous on the mind though. I\u2019m not sure if these ideas exist, or not, or this has to do what you are talking about, but it would be amazing if someone could accomplish these things I talk about shortly. Are these ideas in actual books, or just crossword puzzles? If anyone knows anything about this, please let me know what books are out there. Somehow combine, and use all of these: acrostic words (vertical), palindromes, left to right (normal), and maybe even diagonal words into one paragraph.Example: These words spell to, ha, and et vertically as well, and are all actually words.THEOATThe other possible thing I came up with is the book gives you three choices, on what to do, or where to go. You choose your fate. The book is slightly different every time you read it.go sky divinggo to the beachgo to the movies",
