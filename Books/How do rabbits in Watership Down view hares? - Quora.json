            "answer_text": "Hares are a completely different species than rabbits. Any interaction between the two would be that of caution. As the Wikipedia page for the European Hare in states: Hares \u201cseem to be fewer in number in areas with high rabbit populations, although there appears to be little interaction between the two species and no aggression.\u201d It may seem like General Woundwort is a good candidate to be a hare \u2013 he is described as \u201cvery wild,\u201d \u201csavage,\u201d \u201cterrifying to fight,\u201d and he is known to have a lot more weight than that of an average rabbit \u2013 However I\u2019m convinced he is not. On one hand Adams describes his parents: his mother a doe, and his father \u201ca happy-go-lucky, restless buck.\u201d He also refers to Woundwort as a rabbit multiple times throughout the book: \u201ca singular rabbit,\u201d and \u201cmost rabbits in his situation would\u2026\u201d It is interesting to note that Adams directly compares Woundwort to, but does not claim him to be, \u201cCowper\u2019s Hare,\u201d which is a reference to William Cowper\u2019s \u201cEpitaph on a Hare.\u201d But to answer the question, because real rabbits do not have any special interactions with hares, Watership Down ones wouldn\u2019t either. It\u2019s possible upon meeting one they might try to be diplomatic like they did with the mouse, or even the seagull, Keehar, but only with a purpose in mind. For fun, here are the second and third stanza of Cowper\u2019s \u201cEpitaph on a Hare\u201d: \u201cOld Tiney, surliest of his kind, Who, nursed with tender care, And to domesticate bounds confined, Was still a wild jack-hare. Though duly from my hand he took His pittance every night, He did it with a jealous look, And, when he could, would bite.\u201d ",
