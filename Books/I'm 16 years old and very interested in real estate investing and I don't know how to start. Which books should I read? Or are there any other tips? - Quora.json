            "answer_text": "The three most important suggestions: Read Buy Low, Rent Smart, Sell High by Frank & Heller.  Not only will it get you off to a good start, it will show you how to do it ethically, without becoming a slum lord.Look for a local real estate investment group.  Every major city has one.  The one near me meets regularly, has speakers, and many members willing to help you.  They can help you with leases, and contracts, and refer you to local contractors and real estate agents who work with investors.Find a good home inspector and use him, before you buy the property.  Remember, you make your money when you buy the place, not when you sell.  (In other words be sure you purchase the right place for you.)Also: Don't get suckered by the \"get rich quick with no money down\" schemes.Do consider using \"sweat equity\".  Nobody can do real estate investing without a good network and lots of help, but you should also know what you can do yourself and do it.  This does not mean you need to become an experienced carpenter, plumber, and electrician.  Maybe you can paint or do yard work.  Or maybe you can sell your properties yourself without an agent.  Whatever suits your abilities. ",

            "answer_text": "I have some tips for you if you want to start investing in real estate. 1) Location is prime so check it deep down- There are buyers who purchase properties without even understanding the value of location which is not appropriate because it\u2019s important to have a grip on what kind of location it is and how beneficial it is from the investment point of view. So before only clear the complete benefit of location and analyze how effective it is going to be in the future. 2) Be clear about what kind of investment you want to make? As there are two options residential or commercial so before hand as per your budget and purpose choose your option. 3) Sit with someone and get the right direction of investment so that whatever you invest in you have surely that you will reach your goal. Selecting property is still not a child\u2019s play but with right way you can fetch your dream property. 4) Don\u2019t fall for attractive properties- it\u2019s not appropriate to fall for those properties which are only attractive and which can offer better lifestyle because along with this there are many other things which are important to mull over so that there are chances of obtaining better benefits from all the angles. 5) Know all the best real estate players in the market- it\u2019s important to know the Builder and understand how better they are in delivering the properties and above everything, how customer oriented they are and what kind of properties they offer to there customers in order to make better society and wide range of options to enjoy.
