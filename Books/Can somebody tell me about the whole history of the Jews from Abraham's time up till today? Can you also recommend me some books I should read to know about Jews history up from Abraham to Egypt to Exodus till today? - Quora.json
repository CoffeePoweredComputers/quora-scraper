There are, however, some helpful books which might serve as an introduction. First, Max I. Dimont does a fair job of portraying the scope and complexity of the Jewish people in his 2 noteworthy books Jews, God, and History, and The Indestructible Jews. Both volumes have some minor flaws but generally speaking they make a pretty good introduction, and they\u2019re very readable. I would also recommend To Be a Jew by Hayim Halevy Donin, which speaks to what it is to be a Jew today. That should be a good way to begin. There is, of course, a great deal more to learn than this, but all that will come when you are ready\u2026 ",

Can you also recommend me some books I should read to know about Jews history up from Abraham to Egypt to Exodus till today? Before you go searching, perhaps you should be aware that: There\u2019s no evidence that Abraham ever existed.The story of Exodus, and all the characters in it, is entirely fictional.Biblical stories are one thing, but don\u2019t go confusing them with real history; they\u2019re very different.
