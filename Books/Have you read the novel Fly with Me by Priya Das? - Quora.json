            "answer_text": "Yes, I have finished reading this novel last week. The story is of a young girl who have passion for dancing but somehow living a dead monotonous life because her past doesn't leave her. Because of a seemingly break-up with her boyfriend, she remains cold and uninterested in most of the things. However, things begin changing when she comes in contact with Sameer, another guy. Without giving away much, I liked this book for its concurrent love theme and the pace. Nice read - I finished reading it one go. All elements of a romance genre are evident in the narration. Hope this short review helps you. ",
