            "answer_text": "If there is a strong connection, does that make Trump an \u2018Antiglobalismist\u2019? Globalization is defined as[1] : \u201cA process of interaction and integration among people, companies and governments of different nations, a process driven by international trade and investment and aided by informational technology. This process has effects on the environment, on culture, on political systems, on economic development and prosperity, and on human physical well-being in societies around the world.\u201d The short definition is that \u2018Globalization\u2019 is the collective effort to make Big companies bigger, and create a climate to insure that their actions won\u2019t land the chief perpetrators in jail.\u2019 Some use to say the direction was to \u2018make the World Safe for democracy, however\u2026 globalist corporations really do better in non-democratic venues. Democracies may facilitate competition, and that is not what the large corporations wish to deal with. They are just fine with bribes and kick-backs. Theoretically, successful capitalist simply find a need and fill it. Competitive globalization consists of the outsourcing and offshoring of jobs such that the job goes to the lowest bidder, the most oppressed collection of workers\u2026 and the easiest to corrupt officials. Governments, and political actuaries are indistinguishable from \u2018corporate\u2019 interests in almost all cases. As Hillary wrote as \u201cWe need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to Isil and other radical Sunni groups in the region,\u201d Ms Clinton wrote. [2] Following this, according to the Clinton Foundation, the Saudi Arabian government donated between $10m (\u00a38m) and $25million; no doubt the Saudi government sees this as lubricating their oil business, and for the same reason, the Saud\u2019s financially supported Isil. So that\u2019s the reality. A strong candidate for POTUS taking millions from the same entity she knows is backing Isil. Globalism is more so of a moral and ideological belief that nations, or supra-national entities have an obligation to expedite or initiate the process of globalization. The concept of globalization is more so of a process, while globalism is an ideological belief that is, for the most part, superimposed and centrally planned by government or the public sector.
