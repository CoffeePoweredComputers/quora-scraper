            "answer_text": "I want to become an avid reader. What are some novels which will pique my interest into books?We really cannot tell you what YOU will find interesting, and we don\u2019t even know anything about your level of reading skill. Here are a few ideas: If you aren\u2019t very advanced as a reader you might try the Harry Potter series, in order as the books start easier and work up as Harry and his friends age. I used them to learn to read in Spanish in a couple of months (along with vocabulary study.) By 2\u20133 months my reading was entirely fluent. Also, at a more advanced level than the earlier Harry Potter books, I then found Dan Brown\u2019s books such as \u201cThe DaVinci Code\u201d. If you like science fiction, read pretty much anything by Robert Heinlein or Pohl Anderson. If your reading level isn\u2019t very advance read \u201cThe Hardy Boys\u201d or \u201cNancy Drew\u201d mysteries. Add something about your interests, age, and more importantly your reading level. Historical fiction can also be quite interesting. ",
