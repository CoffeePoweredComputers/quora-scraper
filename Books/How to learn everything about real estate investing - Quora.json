            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve been taught this right since your childhood if you\u2019ve played Monopoly (The board game) ever. Described as The Fast-Dealing Property Trading Game, Monopoly is that game which has seen many families and friends fall apart ;) You learn many things about wealth creation via real estate in one sitting of Monopoly with your cousins/friends than you would from probably talking to an experienced investor. Few things you can learn by playing Monopoly:- Starting Early. The first and the most important trick in Monopoly to stay ahead is to buy everything that you can, as soon as you can. Even if you have a smaller purse, you can buy the brown properties closer to \u201cGo\u201d and start investing. Generation of rent early on in the game and high probabilities for creating monopolies are the incentives you have to start early.IRL:- One must know the importance of starting young. I know of someone who was 22 when he bought his first under-construction apartment (staggered payments) in an upcoming 2-tier city. The property has already appreciated 25% and he\u2019s just 25, by the time he decides to sell the property, he stands to gain almost 35\u201350% of the original price of the apartment. This way he\u2019s way ahead of his friends with similar incomes but no appreciating assets. It\u2019s about decisions. He\u2019d be able to liquidate his asset sooner, if not he can at least start earning an extra income. No downward risk in investing small. Creating a source of recurring income. A lot of properties like the railway stations and utility areas are seemingly useless since you cannot build houses/hotels on them. However, the probability of other players landing on them is higher and since there are 4 players in the game. Similarly, the properties that you build during the course of the game protect you from going bankrupt if you land at someone else\u2019s high-rent properties.IRL:- It doesn\u2019t hurt you to buy property, what hurts is not having something to fall back on in real life. A lot of times young people take stupid decisions like defaulting on credit card payments, investing in depreciating assets like a car without having a savings net. The way it screws you personally is by always making you live hand to mouth. Creating wealth is only aided by decisions which will create further wealth. Rent is the most common source of income across the world. A property should be purchased keeping rental incomes in mind. Trading. Once the first few rounds are over, most properties are occupied and most of the players are in a fix on what to do with their assets since they can\u2019t build houses/hotels on their acquisition but just collect rent. Very rarely would it happen that you\u2019d get a monopoly by luck. In most scenarios, you would need to trade the properties to get more area in the same location to be able to build.IRL:- In real life, you\u2019re highly unlikely to feel the need to do the above if you own just 1 or 2 properties. However, if you choose to live life like a master landlord, it\u2019s a good strategy to look at the markets you\u2019re investing in and invest in multiple units in one particular market. The management of those very properties could become much easier for you, even if you depute. However, in real life, you cant always purchase everything from a bank/builder,etc, you will deal with humans. Trading in Monopoly will teach you the knack of negotiations :) Development Control. A player who is ahead in the game can play very hostile tricks to let the others not win by controlling the built area. Every board has 35 houses and 12 hotels. A player with many monopolies would try to finish up all the houses (as opposed to hotel, because one needs to return 4 houses to build 1 hotel) so that others cannot build faster. This lets the player maintain his monopoly and stop others from winning.IRL:- While in life, unless you become a big builder, you don\u2019t need to bother about someone being hostile towards your personal wealth creation.The last point wasn\u2019t much of a learning, but in life everything is not about learning, you should also be earning! ;) Some of my close friends find these parallels I draw from Monopoly very absurd. But IMO, just like Monopoly, sadly our social economy is one which rewards wealth creation and keeps our social status higher. ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest three DO\u2019s and one huge DON\u2019T. Do start reading books about real estate investing and start collecting them in your library. I have some books with financial formuli from 30 years ago that I still use. Do collect a list of blogs about real estate investing and check them every day. Do find a list of forums and social sites where real estate investing is discussed and monitor it until you feel like you can make a valuable contribution, then begin taking part. DON\u2019T accept what you read on the blogs and forums concerning legal, accounting, or tax matters without checking the credentials of the person involved. So far this morning, I have read three pieces of advice that are guaranteed to get you audited by the IRS. Here\u2019s how you find your books: 1.) Go to Amazon and select \u201cBooks\u201d in the dropdown category to the left of the Search box. 2.) Without entering anything in the box, click on the search icon on the right. 3.) In the left sidebar, scroll down to the categories and click Business & Money > Real Estate > Buying & Selling Houses. Scan the books available and if one interests you, mouse over the author\u2019s name. If there is no link, stay away! If there is a link, click it, and you will be taken to the author\u2019s Amazon Page. This is where you will find the author\u2019s credentials. This is what mine looks like: amazon.com/Michael-Lantrip/e/B01N2ZRGUY. See if this is someone who wrote from their own knowledge and experience, or just collected stuff from elsewhere. Next, you can click on the book cover and you will be taken to the Book Page, where you can do a \u201cLook Inside\u201d the book to see if it is the one for you. You can also do a \u201cFlip to back\u201d underneath the cover to read the back cover of the book, and this should tell you what the book is about. For example, here is mine:  It will be written in the style of a sales pitch, but it will also tell you what the book is about. Use this and the Table of Contents in the \u201cLook Inside\u201d and you will pretty much know what is in the book and whether you want it. As far as the blogs and forums go, you can check out who is behind the comments by doing a search of their name. Beware of Facebook, they can put anything there. If they have a LinkedIn profile, it is more likely to be accurate. Anyway, I hope this helps. You will be primarily concerned with finding and learning the correct information about real estate investing, but secondarily you will be concerned with avoiding the incorrect information, which can be very damaging. Good Luck. Michael Lantrip ",

            "answer_text": "There must be dozens of books and online resources that teach real estate investing. If you want the details, that\u2019s a go-to. But I\u2019m more pragmatic. First, do you own your own home? That\u2019s the first and most important real estate investment. Assuming that\u2019s so, and you now have additional money to invest, I say keep it simple. Only consider places that have high demand, and a shortage of housing as these will produce the highest rents, least vacancies, and have the best price appreciation. If you have personal construction skills, buying a place and giving it a cosmetic renovation (or more) can add value, and likely increase rental income and decrease need for future repairs. If you need to hire contractors, or a place is just too run down, be careful, even if the price looks good. It will cost much more to repair/replace/renovate than you think. Better to buy a place that is more or less, move-in condition. Although markets vary, if you are looking for positive cash flow, you will likely need a large down-payment, maybe 40\u201350%, possibly more to make the numbers work. Calculate rental income against expenses. They include mortgage payment, property taxes, maintenance fees (if any), routine maintenance and periodic repairs, management fees, and generally give yourself a 5% vacancy rate. You also may be liable for excise, state and federal income taxes on your net income. The good news as an investor, there may be tax benefits beyond an owner-occupant. You must consult a tax expert, but you can likely deduct, mortgage interest, maint. fees, most repairs and maintenance, and management fees. So you may run a negative monthly cash-flow, but a positive, after tax cash-flow. My business is in a high cost, robust real estate market with huge demand for rentals. Most of what I outlined above is gained from experience with investors here. It\u2019s not easy, but can work, and in a good market, it\u2019s the price appreciation on a solid, safe asset that makes it worthwhile. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": " If you want to learn EVERYTHING there is to know about Real Estate investing, you have to do one, or all, of these three things! Investing in a Deal Passively- For all \u201cfirst time\u201d real estate investors, I strongly urge you to invest passively before you attempt to take on the whole enchilada. From an educational standpoint, investing passively with an established group will show you how the experts acquire assets, reposition them, and create outs to generate profits for everyone involved. Doing a few deals from the sidelines can not only give you the blueprint on how to do a deal yourself but also make you money while you learn! In the long-term, many people prefer to invest passively due to its ease and an above-average rate of return at about 20%!Join the Real Estate Community- Whether its Linkedin, Biggerpockets.com, or your local real estate meet up, you need to get connected with the people investing in your desired area. Once you connect with these people, you need to find a way to add value to what they have going on. That could be introducing them to someone else, helping out their operations in an ancillary way, or even being nice and taking them out for lunch. Adding value to other people will allow you to leverage their knowledge and network! Who knows, maybe you find yourself a mentor or a partner who can catapult your growth and help you avoids some unnecessary headaches. (HINT HINT)House Hacking- A great first way to invest and learn about real estate is to \u201chouse hack\u201d. What this means is you take your primary residence and rent out the unused rooms or units to offset the mortgage cost. Generally, this strategy worst best with properties with 2+ units, however many young, single adults are buying single-family homes and find roommates to foot the bill! Doing this teaches you how to manage a property and turn a home into a cash-flowing asset. Like the book, Rich Dad Poor Dad teaches if your property does not produce cash flow, it is more of a liability than an asset. Don\u2019t buy a house just to pay the bank as much if not more in interest than the value of the asset itself. Flip the model on its head and have the asset pay for itself and some! I like this strategy for first-time investors because you can make good money while you learn the ropes.Doing any of these three things will teach you everything you need to know about investing in real estate! However, you will see the most success if you do more than just one of these. In real estate, never limit yourself and what you can accomplish! Limiting mindsets will hold you back much more than not having money will. Hope this helps you in your real estate journey. Happy Investing! ",

            "answer_text": "Real estate investing is a tempting way to build wealth. At a minimum, it offers income and a little financial padding. At most, it means financial independence and serious net worth. But unlike in Field of Dreams, diving in headfirst isn\u2019t going to bring in those dreamy Shoeless Joe Jackson-level returns. At least not in real estate. If you want to see long-term success, learning the fundamentals is critical. Want to build that foundation and learn the ins and outs of real estate investment? These resources will help. Learn the basics Educational certificate: Harvard Extension School Harvard offers a real estate investment certificate by way of its online extension school.

            "answer_text": "There are a couple of things you can do to learn more about real estate investing and getting started. Here they are: 5 Steps to Get Started in Real Estate Investing 1. Make a plan and know what your goals are. When first starting out, it's really important to know what your goals are. If you already have your personal finances in order, the next step would be to make a plan to get to your financial goals. Depending on where you want to be financially will determine what your goals are. Are you short on money and need to build up cash? If so, how much cash do you need to build up? Or, do you have some money saved up for investing and are ready to buy and hold? If you're looking to go this route, what is your investment criteria and how many properties are you looking to buy? What is your timeframe to establish these goals? Before you get started in real estate investing, you need to make a plan and know what your goals are. (Note: I've had a lot of people ask me whether they should try to do both building up cash (aka bird dogging/looking for deals for other investors) and buying and holding at the same time. To those just starting out, I don't recommend it. Why? Personally, I feel it's better to get really good at one thing first before moving on to other things. It's better to be an expert in one area and get the experience you need (while at the same time working your plan and getting to your goals) than spreading yourself out too thin trying to learn multiple systems and being mediocre in different areas). If you\u2019re interested in learning about find your niche and being a successful real estate investor, you may want to read more here. 2. Educate Yourself I'm a firm believer in education. If you plan on learning about real estate investing, learn all you can about the business and the system. If you haven't done it already, the first thing you need to do is read books on the subject. This is a must if you're interested in learning about this business. Here is a list of 9 Must Read Real Estate Investing Books. Other than reading books, check out real estate forums and websites on the subject of real estate investing such as BiggerPockets, REI Club and CREOnline. Network with other investors, ask questions and discuss anything real estate related. 3. Learn Your Market Since I'm a film believer in education, I'm also a film believer about taking the time to learn and educate yourself about the market you are in. Even if you plan on working with birddogs/wholesalers to help you find deals, you still need to know your market so you can spot a deal and not have to rely on others for you to tell you what a deal is. Believe me, I've seen a lot of investors get into some really bad situations because they've depended on someone else to find deals for them relying on their \"analysis\" of what a deal is. Everyone is going to have different criteria and a different perspective on what a deal is. A deal to me, may not be a deal to you. And vice versa. By taking the time to learn your market, you will feel much more confident with your investing decisions and not have to rely on someone else for information. 4. Build Your Team We've all heard the saying, \"Two heads are better than one.\" Before you can even start to invest in real estate, you must take the time to network and build a team that can help you get to your goals. Why? You cannot do this alone. If I did not take the time to build my team and create a strong network in the beginning, I probably would not have been successful. It's essential to build up your team so that you will have a strong net of \"go to\" people who can help you in this business. The first thing you want to do is figure out what team members you're going to need. Again, this will depend on your overall goals and investment strategy. (Note: I wrote an article here that will give you some insight on some key players to have on your team). After you've figured out who you need on your team, take the time to go and seek these people out. For example, if your plan is to birddog/wholesale deals to investors then you need to go out and find investors (aka your buyers) who are looking for homes to buy. Let me be honest, it takes time to build a good team. It does not happen overnight. It's always good practice to develop more than one relationship with one type of team member (i.e. investors, contractors, park managers, etc) because it's always a matter of personality. Sometimes you may not really get along with one person, but things really click with another. From there you can pick and choose those you wish to work with and have on your team. By taking the time to build your team and develop strong relationships, it will make this business easier and save you a lot of time and money in the end. If you\u2019d like to learn about building your team and working with contractors, you may want to read more here. 5. Keep Updated Staying up to date on your market and the latest trends is a \"must have\" in any business. This includes real estate investing. If you don't keep up to date, a lot of things can change. By staying up to date on your market and knowing the latest trends in the real estate industry, you are better prepared to handle change and position yourself ahead of those who did not taking the time to stay updated. Some things you can do to stay updated on your market and the latest trends is to keep in touch with your team members on a regular basis. It's so important to maintain a consistent relationship with your team members. Everyday they are in the trenches and see this business first hand. Another thing you can to to stay updated is to constantly read the news. By taking the time to keep updated and educate yourself on the latest news and trends in the real estate industry, you will know and understand the real estate business much more than the average investor. Conclusion These are just a few things you can do to get started in real estate investing. If you\u2019d like to learn about being a successful real estate investor, you may want to read more here. Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Don't waste money on expensive seminars, there are no magic formulas. I can say real estate has created the largest number of millionaires with small businesses and equities close behind, so I advise doing all 3. In terms of real estate, I always purchase properties direct from homeowners that are in Preforeclosure. I get the list weekly on the day it comes out showing new NOD,s Notice of Default or Trustee Sales. I contact the homeowner direct by knocking on the door as well as direct mail w/ postcards and a letter first immediately then after 3 weeks. It is easier to just pay the arrearage owing for back payments, interest, attorney fees. I usually give homeowner $5K or more depending upon equity in home and often allow them to stay on a lease purchase option which less than 2% ever repurchase the home. Lastly, I do flips for income and rentals for long term net worth investment w/ some income. Finally get a quit claim deed and do your homework on the title search. I know people say there is a do on sale clause in mortgages, but I have done over 100 deals like above mentioned and have never had a mortgage company exercise that clause. I currently hold onto 42 units managed by partners I purchased the homes with and they are a solid passive income stream I utilize along with equity and business investments to roundcout my passive income streams because I want to be diversified for safety and ROI reasons.

            "answer_text": "Commercial Real Estate is a hands on and very personal business. It has within it specializations like Retail, Industrial, Office, Agriculture, Medical, Tech, Sales and Acquisition to name a few. Many Brokers specialize in one field and are subject matter experts in that one specific area. Becoming an expert in your specialty and market is critical to longevity and success. When you want to buy agricultural land to plant strawberries you don\u2019t talk to a Retail broker that leases space to Starbucks. You talk to a Broker that focuses on the sale of Ag-Land. If you want a wide variety of exposure to different property types and to learn the business I\u2019d suggest you first become a property or assistant property manager for a commercial real estate portfolio. If you\u2019re a bit further down the ladder become an admin for a property management company. Reading leases and contracts helps you get exposure and understand the business very quickly. This will put you in the best scenario to learn. You\u2019ll learn about leases, tenant improvements, renewals and the temperature of your local market. You\u2019ll learn about big deals going on and become a part of the local broker community. Those relationships you build will turn into new deals, friendships and potentially new employment. If you take the route of joining a brokerage house you\u2019ll learn a very different set of skills depending on where you land. For example if you join Marcus & Millichap you\u2019ll become a trained real estate assassin but you\u2019ll also likely spend your first year as a runner, associate and be getting tiny portions of a commission on sales. Also noteworthy the number of transactions you\u2019ll do in your first year as a Tenant Rep Broker will be nothing close to what you do as a property manager. ",

            "answer_text": "Investment Real Estate Marketing Plan \u2013 Putting Details Into Action Marketing is one of the most important things a real estate investor can do to grow his business. It is also one of the areas that is easiest to make multiple mistakes. From failing to properly plan, failure to track your results and even worse, failure to control spending; marketing is practice perils that beginning investors and long time investors alike must be aware and prepared to avoid. There are 3 main areas of marketing to concentrate on when seeking to grow sales and revenues. The first is education, the second is planning and the third is tracking for adjustments and success. All three are important for investors to watch as they seek to grow sales and revenues and more importantly, build a business model that is sustainable through any real estate cycle. EDUCATION Educating yourself as a real estate investor and marketer is absolutely paramount if you are going to have success and grow your business. There is simply no excuse for not understanding the basics of each as they both are extremely important for the longevity and ability to stay relevant and profitable. Here are a few examples of places to become educated on good marketing techniques for real estate investors. 1. Local Library \u2013 There may not be a better place to become educated on real estate marketing than the local library. Break the topic down into two subjects and you can have the basics down inside of a week. Under the real estate section there are multiple titles that explain the basics of real estate investing from beginner levels to expert levels. In addition, many of these books will give a basic outline of some simple marketing techniques and tools to get you started. When you combine that knowledge with a good marketing 101 book from the library, you can quickly pick up the basic outline of why marketing must be done and how properly set up a marketing plan. The best part about an education from the library is the cost \u2013 practically free! 2. Real Estate Investment Clubs \u2013 Often times, these clubs are referred to in the industry as REIA\u2019s. Associations of local real estate investors who come together multiple times a month to discuss topics relevant to real estate investing. These are great sources for so many things related to real estate investing, including marketing ideas and plans. By attending and immersing yourself into these groups, it is easy to develop friendships, partnerships and even mentors who can answer questions and provide guidance. By paying attention to what the top performers are doing in the field and how they are marketing their businesses, you can pick up ideas and integrate those ideas into your marketing plan. It is called modeling and it is one of the best ways to educate yourself on what is working in a particular real estate market. The biggest upside to becoming educated at a REIA is that you are surrounding yourself with the type of people that are going to be vital to your future success. The costs are usually very affordable and you can often avoid mistakes made by other investors before you. 3. Go it Alone \u2013 There probably does not need to be a tremendous amount of discussion under this heading. It speaks for itself and generally goes against all advice I could ever give any business person, especially a real estate investor. As far as education is concerned, it is an approach that many investors choose to take and often at a tremendous cost. Going it alone means deciding to jump into the deep end of the pool with both feet and learning as you go. Trial and error can be good and can sometimes lead to good results, but often after many hours and many ups and downs. Strictly looking at costs, many investors have experienced huge losses in the areas of marketing to learn what works in their particular market and often are a little behind the actual trends due to not really learning to track and adjust. My suggestion when it comes to education to use all the resources available including those that come with little to no costs. When you are becoming educated on how to set up a proper marketing plan complete with tracking and adjusting, then I would make sure I was a part of a local real estate investors association so that I am always up to date with the latest marketing techniques. PLANNING When I talk about planning and marketing, I mean to process of laying out the actual strategies you are going to use to market your business, the time frame you are going to use those strategies, the way you are going to track those results and the possible adjustments you are going to make as your results come in on your plan. One of the biggest mistakes that we see today in the real estate marketing world is not a complete failure to plan, but a failure to lay the full plan out from beginning to end. That being said, here are a few tips to properly develop a plan. 1. Know what you are currently doing and what results you are currently achieving. Even if the answer is that you are doing nothing, you can not work on where you are going if you do not know where you are currently starting from. You should be able to pinpoint today any marketing you are doing and the cost of that marketing as well as any results you are seeing. 2. Know what results you are looking for before you begin. So once you know where you are starting from, the next question is were you going? Lay out concrete results you want to achieve and be specific. One of the glaring mistakes in this area is not being specific enough. You can not track abstract goals. Your goals must be specific and detailed so that you can verify if you are achieving them. An example would be a specific number of new leads you want to bring in from each marketing source. 3. Give yourself set time frames to test your marketing. This is definitely the second biggest problem for real estate marketers and most marketers in general. Marketing plans must be given time to take shape and develop. Most real estate marketers are developing marketing plans which are call to action in nature. They are asking their target audience to take a particular action so that they can capture that action and develop a new lead. An example would be to \u201cCall Today to Sell Your House Quick!\u201d. This is a call to action marketing phrase. Often times, there will need to be multiple impressions of that message before the action is followed. Failing to plan a specific amount of time such as 60 days or 90 days, leads to a marketer stopping his action before his target audience responses. If you allow your plan to last longer and stick with all of your marketing pieces and techniques longer, you give yourself a greater chance for success in the long run. It allows for you to see over a longer period of time the results you are getting and that provides a clear picture of what works and what does not work. DO NOT quit marketing after a couple of weeks simply because your phone is not ringing off the hook. Set your time period on the front end and then let your marketing plan work. 4. Failing to get input from other experts can be costly. If you have access to other real estate investors, I would definitely get their input on your marketing plan before implementation. If they are able to give you advice and direction it can often times help you figure out the best route to take or at least if you are on track for success. If you have taken your time and all the steps necessary so far to put together a quality plan, then take advice from other experts, but do not be persuaded to change everything. Simply let others take a quick look for feedback, but be prepared to move forward with your plan and any adjustments that they think would make a difference. TRACKING Tracking means having a way to actually follow and measure all of the marketing activities you are doing and the number of results each gets you. Here are some examples of the things that real estate marketers need to track for every marketing action they take. 1. What are the total number of leads generated per marketing technique tracked daily, weekly and monthly.2. How many of those leads turned into qualified prospects daily, weekly and monthly. (qualified prospect means you were willing to invest more time to develop the lead)3. The number of offers made to purchase property daily, weekly and monthly.4. The ratios of offers made to where the original lead came from. I am going to insert a quick note here to make sure everyone understands exactly how to track. It is not enough to simply know how many calls you are getting or how many leads are generated or how many offers or deals are being done. When you actually purchase an investment property, you MUST know where that lead came from at the very beginning. Tracking ratios is extremely important to this. It is important to be able to track and measure not only the leads but the quality of those leads. You can have one lead generator that gives you a major of your leads and another that gives you a major of your transactions. It should be obvious that you would want to spend more time and resources with the marketing technique giving your more transactions unless you are in the business to simply feel busy and not necessarily to earn a living! 5. What is the cost per lead generated, per marketing technique daily, weekly and monthly. 6. What is the average income generated from each transaction generated by each marketing technique daily, weekly and monthly. When you are able to track your business in this way, it makes it much easier to make adjustments as you go and it definitely gives a clear picture of how well you are spending marketing dollars. Often times, as legendary basketball coach John Wooden would say \u201cwe mistake activity for productivity\u201d The entire reason for developing and implementing a proper marketing plan is so that we can determine what works, what does not work and what changes we need to make so that we are spending the fewest dollars possible for the greatest impact and result. If we fail to implement any part of this type of marketing plan, then whatever success we achieve can not be measured against any activities and therefore can not be duplicated. I am a big proponent of education and immersion as the best learning tools available and I believe that when it comes to marketing, it is simply too easy to learn the proper way to plan and track. When you have the fundamentals down and solid plan to follow, success will follow. Learn More ",

            "answer_text": "Best ways to invest in real estate 1. Buy REITs (real estate investment trusts) REITs allow you to invest in real estate without the physical real estate. Often compared to mutual funds, they\u2019re companies that own commercial real estate such as office buildings, retail spaces, apartments and hotels. REITs tend to pay high dividends, which makes them a common investment in retirement. Investors who don\u2019t need or want the regular income can automatically reinvest those dividends to grow their investment further. Are REITs a good investment? They can be, but they can also be varied and complex. Some trade on an exchange like a stock; others aren\u2019t publicly traded. The type of REIT you purchase can be a big factor in the amount of risk you\u2019re taking on, as non-traded REITs aren\u2019t easily sold and might be hard to value. New investors should generally stick to publicly traded REITs, which you can purchase through brokerage firms. For that, you\u2019ll need a brokerage account. If you don\u2019t already have one, opening one takes less than 15 minutes and many companies require no initial investment (though the REIT itself will likely have an investment minimum). 2. Use an online real estate investing platform If you\u2019re familiar with companies such as Prosper and LendingClub \u2014 which connect borrowers to investors willing to lend them money for various personal needs, such as a wedding or home renovation \u2014 you\u2019ll understand online real estate investing. These platforms connect real estate developers to investors who want to finance projects, either through debt or equity. Investors hope to receive monthly or quarterly distributions in exchange for taking on a significant amount of risk and paying a fee to the platform. Like many real estate investments, these are speculative and illiquid \u2014 you can\u2019t easily unload them the way you can trade a stock.

After I attended a few, I immediately knew who is the best and it was a real estate hedge fund manager who was not selling coaching or mentorship but instead was raising capital to grow his syndications and investments and was teaching others how to become syndicators and how to invest in residential and commercial The training changed my life. I networked directly with him and a couple of other students. Instead of buying coaching from others I ended up buying residential homes that he had vetted, rehabbed and rented (they were managed by a third party management company) Fast forward several years later, my relationships grew in the business, I continue to buy from them homes that are rented and I get 12%+ cash on cash returns with no hassles A short cut indeed to financial freedom ironically my friends, my family members and my own husband had criticized me long time ago when I went to attend seminars :-) Today they all want to partner up (maybe I should do my own syndication next!)

            "answer_text": "As a Realtor for a very long time I would say to consult one. At the very least talk to people that have been investing in Real Estate for the last 12 years. They have been through the. lows and highs of the market. There is so much to say on the subject. First of all ,current value of the property, condition,and so on. Do you want to hold and rent it out? If so check rental prices in area of where you are going to purchase. Know and investigate the Real Estate market and trends in your area of choice. What is the current average time homes are taking to sell. Average days on market that way you will have a basic idea on your holding costs. This will be an important factor if you are getting a loan to purchase the property. What will your expenses be on it monthly until it sells.How much will it cost you to do repairs or updating. Does it pay to do certain updating and will you recoupe that and more in the sale. Again, there are so many factors to investing, purchasing in Real Estate. I kinda gave you a short 411. And this is on Residential Real Estate. (Homes) Hope some of this info helped.",

            "answer_text": "I think a key first step is to define your goals. What do you want to accomplish? What is your area of focus? Some investors start with rental properties. The predictable cash flow and property value appreciation make this an attractive option. On the flip side, dealing with problem tenants and handling maintenance can be a drag. Other investors want to buy and rehab houses, counting on an attractive renovation to pull in high returns. Success with this area requires construction and real estate market knowledge. Both of these options are hands-on. For investors who prefer a more passive income stream, investing in REITs or mortgage backed securities are good options. Once you determine an area of focus, research everything you can! Learn about the industry and set concrete goals you can achieve with a specific timeframe. Don\u2019t forget to research your desired market! Learn about vacancy rates, buyer demand, historic value, and projected appreciation. These suggestions are just a starting point. Experience is a great teacher. ",

Here are a few of my personal favorites for someone just starting out: Inman is a great resource to learn about general real estate news, including headlines about market trends and specific happenings in highlighted reachings. You can also learn about the reliability of online listings and the important of utilizing technology.Trulia is another one of my favorites. It tackles four key subject areas (that will be helpful for a beginner especially): the basics of real estate, financial aspects of real estate, home hacks, and celebrity homeowner news. It tackles common issues in the real estate world and gives you helpful solutions.You could also try an educational program. Travis Robertson\u2019s is probably the most intensive for someone starting out. They are less than $100/week, and even if you can\u2019t afford them, Robertson\u2019s site hosts education videos. If you do attend his coaching program, you can receive both one-on-one coaching and an intensive boot camp, which includes 6 weeks of one-on-one calls with your own real estate coach and 5 weeks of personalized actions.If you want to check out more awesome resources, check out this list of 25 options.

I really like the Bigger Pockets website (also see the podcasts, forums, and blog/articles) (biggerpockets.com) Spending time on that site will make you more knowledgeable. Books are great, too. You might hone in on a strategy (be it flips, buy and holds, etc) and find some of the leading titles in that area. One word of caution: there are quite a few widely selling books that get lumped into the real estate genre that are more about self help (which is ok, too, if you need the motivation, mindset or mental models). I would look for the more practical websites and books\u2014like the ones that show you how to select tenants, fix up properties, etc (not how to envision success, unless you need that). The more practical books and websites might be ideal for knowledge. And low cost or even free resources are best in my view (like at the library or free sites and podcasts like Bigger Pockets mentioned above). Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The absolute best way to learn about real estate investing is being taken under the wing of an experienced investor, who mentors you throughout. You get to see his deals, how much they net, the problems you come across, etc. Maybe you\u2019re willing to call the shots and put together a list of all the investors in your region. Knock on their doors and beg to be taught. Maybe you\u2019re lucky, but be prepared for rejection. Now, the most realistic way to learn about it, is really reading about it and doing it by yourself. There is no trick, really. Read as much as you can (BTW, I am trying to make this task way easier for everybody by putting together a list of books on finances and investing, here: Books). In my blog I also post a lot on Real Estate investing, and I am writing a book on the subject: From cents to retirement. Then, do it! Start with small deals, which will turn out big considering the experience you\u2019ll gain. Do it as earlier as you can, because experience is all in this game. To make money in Real Estate, there are two absolute core things you must do: buy when you\u2019re on a bottom of a market and sell when you\u2019re at the top. Experience teaches you how to recognize where you are. Follow me on Quora for more. ",

This plan would allow me to learn in stages while still moving forward. It would help me focus on the essentials while ignoring the inessentials. By following the steps, I would have saved a lot of time and frustration and avoided becoming overwhelmed. While I can\u2019t go back in time for myself, I can create a step-by-step plan for YOU to get started using my own 18 years of full-time real estate investing experience. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll find in the rest of this article. (read more) ",

            "answer_text": "By far the best way is to learn from somebody who has been successful at real estate investing. As with any investment, real estate investing is more than about learning the rules of the game. You have to learn how to adapt the rules to your situation and figure out the best ways to play your moves. Learning from somebody who has done well in your neighborhood would give you tremendous insights and shortcuts that would otherwise take you years to pass on. And like any game of skill, there's no problem for a master to share some basic secrets with a novice. The gap in skill is simply too large to bridge. The really advanced and profitable techniques just takes years to understand and master. ",

Many people who have reached financial independence have done so investing in real estate (in fact, it's one of the most common ways to become a millionaire).

Find others that are doing what you want to be doing and hang around them as much as you can. Glean knowledge from their experience. Just do not wait to start investing until you know it all; you never will, so you\u2019ll never invest.

You need to be equipped with the right tools and basic knowledge before even approaching a real estate agent. Buying a property is a major purchase, you could find yourself at a loss if you don\u2019t understand the basics of real estate.  I would recommend using a variety of online resources to start learning about real estate. You could use realtor.org, Mashvisor, Zillow and many others. The best resource will depend on what exactly you want to learn about. Are you interested in Real Estate Investing, Commercial Real Estate, or simple just interested in being knowledge about purchasing your first home? Each category has it's own resource. For example, if you're interested in Real Estate Investments, Mashvisor is the best site for that.  Hope this helps and good luck with your research. ",

Get a BS in Real Estate, find a graduate RE program that has classes in the evening, achieve the CCIM certificate, etc. In my opinion, working in residential (single family homes, etc) will prepare you for sales. However, this skill will transfer to some extent to leasing and less so to say, investment sales. Commercial real estate will require a much different product knowledge base than say single family homes. Curb appeal still counts, however financial returns largely drives commercial real estate instead of personal objectives. Hope this helps. ",
