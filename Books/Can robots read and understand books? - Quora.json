            "answer_text": "To a small degree, yes. Computers can read the text of a book and \u201cknow\u201d what word the letters spell. They can also summarize key points of a chapter or book (or they will be able to soon at least). But all of this is really automatic. The machine doesn\u2019t contemplate the meaning of the book, it just spits out a summary based on the words it read. It doesn\u2019t feel happy or sad because of what it reads, which some people argue is necessary for understanding. You can watch the Jeapordy! episode that features the computer Watson. It uses material that it read to answer questions better than humans, but it can\u2019t really have a conversation about something it read. ",
