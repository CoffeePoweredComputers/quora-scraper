            "answer_text": "The revised version more clearly describes how Google software scans the user's email, both when the message is stored on Google's server and when it's in transit. Last month, a US judge decided not to put together a single class action lawsuit in which Google sued for infringing hundreds of millions of email users' privacy rights. Users of Google's Gmail mail service have violated federal and state privacy and eavesdropping laws by scanning their messages so that they can create secret profiles and target ads. And accusing the company. Google claims that users implicitly agree to the activity and acknowledge it as part of the email delivery process. Does Gmail read my email? Many people are concerned about their online privacy. It is good to worry about who can access your information, especially what is included in your personal email. If you're a Gmail user, you may have noticed hyper-specific ads, such as ads for products and services related to send and receive email that appear when you use the service. Read your email, Google employees do not personally read your email, but are scanned to deliver more relevant ads and search results. It is possible to turn off these ads, but Gmail will scan the content of your email as a security measure. We discuss the pros and cons of this, how to opt out, and what if you don't like the idea of \u200b\u200bGmail monitoring. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The terms and conditions you accepted when you signed up for gmail include: We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos. So, yes, the Google algorithm does look at your email content, and shows you ads based on that content. It also checks the content for spam, checks it to auto add stuff like diary entries, delivery information and flight info and a whole load of other stuff. Email is moderately expensive to provide, especially at that kind of scale. To pay for all this, Google shows ads. By scanning the content to show more relevant ads, the advertisers get better response rates, and so are willing to pay more for the ads. This does not mean the advertisers have your info. you are just lumped in with a group of people flagged as \u2018male, 35\u201355, likes cars\u2019 or whatever. It does not always get this right. You can check who Google thinks you are in the personal advertising data area, and even delete stuff that is wrong, if it\u2019s showing you annoying ads. You can get email that does not do this, but you are going to have to pay for it. ",

As far as humans reading your email goes, there are few circumstances where this will happen. If you\u2019re a person of interest in a criminal investigation and Google\u2019s been ordered to turn your email over by a court, that can happen.[1] If there\u2019s a bug in GMail, and it can\u2019t be fixed without someone looking at email, that can happen too.

That started with Morse Code back in the 1950s the progressed to teleprinters before moving on to computers. Every telegram (a kind of prehistoric email) that came through my hands had to be read word by word, letter by letter. With rare exceptions, they were forgotten as soon as I moved on to the next message. The words went in through my eyes, scrambled around in my brain, and re-emerged from my fingertips without taking root. To professionals, other people\u2019s private messages are rarely interesting. Even if it were possible for Google\u2019s employees to read your emails, why on earth would they want to? Is your life so uniquely entertaining as all that? Of course, if you were involved in criminal or terrorist activities, you\u2019d have bigger problems than Google. Then you\u2019d have to worry about the NSA, or GHQ, or whichever spy agency is operating on your part of the Internet. ",
