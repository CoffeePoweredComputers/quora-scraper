            "answer_text": "I have been living with my partner for 18 years and I do love her very much, she is the one human constant in my life. That being said I don\u2019t fall in love with people the way most do. I do not become enamoured or infatuated, nor have I ever experienced that rush of lovey dovey feelings which motivates people to want to spend all their time with another person. My relationship with my wife started as a very slow burn. We met at work and worked together for over a year, at which point I left and went to a different job. In the year I worked with her we spent 40 hours a week together in the same building working side by side for much of it. I knew I liked her and respected her as a person. We laughed a lot together. We never hung out outside of work, not once. I knew she had feelings for me but I kept her at arms length the entire time we were colleagues. The few times she let me know she was attracted to me in that year I would get really awkward and usually distance myself from her, which for whatever reason she never took personally. I did not entertain dating her while we worked together as it broke my first rule of dating/sex which is don\u2019t sleep with people you can\u2019t get away from (I say sleep with because I have really only had an actual relationship with two people in my life but I have had lots of trysts). Basically I got to know her well under circumstances that did not put a lot of relational pressure on me as we were together to get a job done. After I left that place I noticed that I missed her, and I never miss anyone. I reached out (very unusual for me) and invited her to join me hiking or for a meal. We weren\u2019t exactly dating yet, we were just hanging out. This went on for several months until I finally admitted I thought I loved her and we decided to start a romantic relationship. I chose her and fell in love with her because she never pushed me into anything and on a basic level she seemed to intuitively understand that intimacy is my greatest fear and struggle so she waited for me to come to her slowly. Trust is a massive hurdle for me and it took me 18 months of spending lots of time together before I was willing to trust her enough to embark on a romantic relationship. My wife is inordinately patient, always gentle and quite flexible in her understanding of what a relationship needs to look like. Sometimes my detachment frustrates her and if I am too inattentive she lets me know and also explicitly states what she needs from me. She gives me clear direction and I do my best to follow it because she never asks more than what I am capable of. I love her because she is the only person in the world that I trust always has my best interests in mind 100% of the time. It took me over a decade to get to that level of trust with her and there are still times that I don\u2019t believe that when I am mired in self loathing. ",

            "answer_text": "Many of my Schizoid clients are quite romantic and they do fall in love. I know the common view of the Schizoid person is that they are a detached loner who does not want close relationships with other people, but in my experience that is simply not true. They are fearful: My clients with Schizoid Personality Disorder long for love, romance, and understanding. Unfortunately past interpersonal traumas, childhood abuse, and indifferent or intrusive parenting have made them fearful about being in intimate relationships. They are afraid of losing their autonomy and being dominated by the other person's needs. They usually react to these fears by becoming fiercely independent because they feel unsafe relying on other people. They find compromises: In relationships they often seek out acceptable compromises that give them as much intimacy as they can tolerate, while keeping barriers in place to prevent them from feeling overwhelmed. They may shut down emotionally: When individuals with Schizoid adaptations get closer than they can tolerate, they tend to emotionally shut down, dissociate, or find a reason to leave the relationship entirely. Common Schizoid Love CompromisesLong Distance Relationships: They fall in love with another person with Schizoid issues that lives far from their home. Both feel safe having a passionate weekend together a few times per year. In between they keep in contact by texting and occasional phone calls. Neither pushes the other to move in with them. Relationships with Married People: They fall in love with someone who is married and have a passionate romance. As long as the other person stays married, they feel safe showing their love. They have different degrees of self awareness about this situation and what makes their ability to freely express their love possible. Sometimes the naive Schizoid lover begs the other person to get a divorce and marry them. If the married lover leaves their mate for their Schizoid lover, it often ends in disappointment. Now with no barriers to intimacy, the Schizoid individual becomes fearful and starts backing out of the relationship. This may happen a few times before the Schizoid individual realizes his or her own limitations. Love Triangles: Some of my Schizoid clients marry, but find the one-on-one relationship unsatisfying\u2014usually because they feel threatened by the intimacy of it. Suddenly they get \u201cbored\u201d and fall in love with someone new. They often try to persuade their mate to accept being part of this love triangle because it meets their need. They may turn their wife into a sexless mother figure, while the new person becomes the romantic sexually desired one. However, if they were to marry the one who is now the desired one, she would eventually be shuffled out of that role and someone new found to fill it. On the surface it looks as if it is about finding passion, but it is really about feeling safe. Marrying an Unintimate Partner: This can take a number of forms. Two cerebral Schizoid individuals may marry and have a cool, basically intellectual companionship. Or a Schizoid individual may marry someone who cannot return their love. They can safely love their mate and yearn for more love from them, but they do not have to deal with the inner conflicts that real intimacy stirs up in them. Fantasy Relationships: Some Schizoid individuals are so afraid of real relationships that they fall in love with famous people that they only know from television shows. They construct elaborate and satisfying fantasies about a imagined relationship with this person. A more common version is that they see someone occasionally in class or at work or in the local Starbucks and fantasize about that person. Punchline: Individuals with Schizoid PD can and do fall in love. Their main difficulties occur in the realm of how to feel safe while expressing their love.
