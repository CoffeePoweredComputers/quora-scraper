            "answer_text": "Original question: \u201cAre written novels dead?\u201d Do you mean \u201care they a thing of the past and will disappear soon\u201d? If so, then, no. Although libraries are sadly falling to budget cuts all over the world (yes, here in Switzerland, too), small local bookshops are struggling not because of a lack of books, but because of the competition of large chains of bookshops and of course Amazon. However, people still buy books and will continue to do so. Books work offline. Books can\u2019t run out of battery charge. You can pass a book on to a friend to read once you\u2019re done. And you can collect books to fill your bookshelves. So, no. If you mean \u201cAre written books not alive\u201d? Hmmm\u2026 Speaking from the perspective of a writer who has published a little (with limited success, but I did it for fun anyway, so I\u2019m happy), I can say that I personally had a weird feeling that the book was \u201calive\u201d in a way that it difficult to describe. It\u2019s easy to imagine that a writer is omnipotent and can twist and bend a story to unfold exactly as they plan it. But in my case, this was strangely difficult. Whole chapters of my book seemed to write themselves. Others resisted when I tried to change them, and I suddenly felt as if I was struggling to write a boring essay at school, until I gave up and \u201cwent with the flow\u201d. Then the text started flowing again, and it sounded and felt completely different than my attempt to change the story. So I certainly felt that the story had developed a sort of life of its own. Also, when you publish a book, It feels oddly like seeing a child move out. Once it\u2019s published, the book is no longer private. It\u2019s no longer \u201cyours\u201d. It becomes something separate. And readers may interpret thing differently than you intended them. You have to learn to accept other interpretations as valid. As the writer, you have the right to say: \u201cOh, that\u2019s an interesting approach. When I wrote it, I was thinking along different lines. I thought XYZ. But yours is an interesting idea. Thanks for that.\u201d But you have no right to say another interpretation is \u201cwrong\u201d, unless you can demonstrate that logically. So when a book goes public, it develops a life of its own in a different sense. It \u201cevolves\u201d with feedback, with criticism, with questions readers ask. So in both senses, no. Written novels are not dead. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but I hope that the e-books would live up to their full potential. Gramarye Media Yes, the CEO is my internet friend. No, I am not getting anything for promoting his company. Anyway, stories had been a part of the human culture for the very long time now. The first ones were presented, told, sung, drawn. Writing helped to preserve them and to reach larger audiences. I don\u2019t see writing as the meaning of creation and recording disappearing any time soon. ",
