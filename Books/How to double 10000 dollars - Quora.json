            "answer_text": "There are many ways to double 10k, most of which carry a lot of risk. To minimize your risk, I would suggest reducing the amount of speculation involved as much as possible. Things like stocks, derivatives and options trading are highly speculative, and require skill and experience to succeed. In the case of 10k, i would suggest real estate. Find a property in the range of 50k purchase price that you can renovate with a 20k budget and sell for 80\u201390k. The amount is small enough that you might be able to get a 100% return with just one real estate transaction, and real estate will also carry a much smaller risk of a catastrophic failure than something like stocks or derivatives speculation with the same amount of leverage. You will need to do some research to find a good property, and there will be a lot of management work, and perhaps some handy work to get the renovation done, but the more work you can do yourself, the less risk you will incur. Lets explore an example:Step 1: You buy a property in a good location, but in need of some renovation for the price of 50k. You use 7500$ as collateral for a mortgage to cover the purchase price (assuming a 15% down-payment). The mortgage carries a 3% interest. Step 2: You will need to finance your renovation. Most banks offer a shorter term loan to make such a renovation possible (some times referred to as a bridge loan). This loan will have higher interest rate than your mortgage, but something in the range of 5\u20136% interest should be realistic. Step 3: You renovate the property and put it on the market for a price that will cover your purchase price, renovation, and leave a 10k+ profit that will realize your goal of 100% profit of your original investment of 10k. Given the above numbers, your numbers would look something like: Expenses: Down payment on property: 7500$Expenses/ fees related to loans: 400$Holding costs on property (6% of 20k + 3% of 50k / 2 in the case of a 6 month renovation): 2 100$.Total expenses: 10 000$ You spend 20k on renovation with a time frame of 6 months. To get the 100% profit you are looking for, you need to sell the property for 50 000 + 20 000 (reno budget) + 2100 + 400 + 10 000 (your profit margin) = 82 500$. If you are not able to achieve the target sell price, you can now refinance the property to pay off the expensive renovation loan, and reduce your total interest rate to 3%, and then rent the property out, and achieve your 100% profit over a longer time span of a few years. Notice that this takes a lot of research, planning and some work to get done. Notice that in that case you are using work as a way to reduce risk. You could however use a property manager to oversee the renovation, and reduce the involvement required to almost nothing, but that would require a higher sell price later. In any case you have to do your preparations carefully beforehand. Always do the numbers carefully. Also do the numbers both for a flip-scenario and a hold and rent kind of scenario in case the target price cant be achieved. In the case of a renovate and rent strategy, you might even be able to refinance such that you get your 100% profit out in advance, and still cover expenses, depending on how high a valuation you are able to get. In that case it might put you in a very good position, as you have received your 100% profit in cash right away, and still retain the property as a rental, so you can enjoy the long term return-on-investment it will generate as long as you always cover expenses + a healthy cash-flow left over.

            "answer_text": "I suppose that would depend largely on your appetite for risk and the timeframe you would like to double your 10,000 in. Thinking in terms of investments. If you\u2019d like to wait a awhile, I\u2019d suggest a low-cost SP or DowJones index fund. That should be nice and safe, sort of a savings bond. If you want to be a lil riskier with it, try bitcoin or ethereum and wait 6 - 12 months. If current trends continue (possible, but not necessarily likely) you\u2019d double your money easy. Or you could always walk into a casino and put it all on black or red - you\u2019d have a 48% chance of doubling it. Which, really, isn\u2019t all that bad. Okay I\u2019m kidding don\u2019t do that.
