            "answer_text": "What do you mean by \"fair\"? Being charged with a felony is automatically an enormous punishment, particularly in the Federal system.  The punishment precedes the trial.  If innocent you still suffer huge losses just to gain acquittal:  loss of time, earnings, and the legal expenses - the last can be huge.  And the best outcome you can hope for is \"not guilty\", the legal equivalent of \"never mind\".  No possibility of recovering your losses (unless you can prove malicious prosecution in a subsequent civil case).  Typically only well-off and well-connected individuals suffer this kind of persecution, and usually for political reasons.  But it is not fair. In 1987, Raymond Donovan, Secretary of Labor, was acquitted after a lengthy trial even though his attorney had not called a single witness:  the prosecutor failed to provide credible evidence that Donovan had committed a crime (probably because the defense had destroyed the prosecution witnesses during cross-examination) so there was no need for defense witnesses.  Yet Donovan had to pay for his defense.  Donovan was rich enough that he could afford what he had to pay, but was it \"fair\"?  In no way.  Being rich is not a crime, nor an excuse for harsh financial punishment. Poorer people are often advised, by their publicly-paid defense attorney, to plead guilty even though they are innocent.  The charges are plea-bargained down and the defendant is advised that, if he goes to trial, he risks being convicted of a bigger charge with more prison time.  That's not fair. It might be more fair if juries could find the defendant \"guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\", \"not guilty\" or \"innocent\" (based on a preponderance of evidence - say 51%).  If the jury finds the defendant \"innocent\" then the prosecutor's office has to pay all the costs of the defense - hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions, plus all back pay and other financial losses the defendant suffered.  If the defendant is truly innocent, his defense would try to prove innocence, that is, prove that the defendant is more likely innocent than guilty.  As it is, anything beyond establishing a reasonable doubt - maybe a 5% probability of innocence - is a waste  of time. I suppose the vast majority of people convicted actually did commit the crime.  I also presume most of the people found not-guilty actually did commit the crime, but we want to err on the side of reasonable doubts, so they should not be convicted.  (Nobody believes OJ didn't kill Nicole, but the prosecution failed to show guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, so OJ properly went free.)  But some of the people acquitted should never have been charged - they can prove their innocence based on a preponderance of evidence.  If they should never have been charged, fairness demands they be made whole.  The wrongful charge should be a black mark against the prosecution, not punishment for the innocent defendant. On the other side, if the police break the law gathering evidence, the evidence (even if demonstrably valid) is disallowed and the police (who broke the law) escape punishment for their crime.   I don't know how often this actually happens in real life, but that also is not fair. What is \"fair\"?  Our legal system is pretty fair for the community, but I don't know that any system is going to be fair for the accused. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Kevin Carothers says it well -- a right to the best legal defense you can afford. But even Mr. Carothers is kind.  Under the U.S. court system, lawyers file cases they have no business filing, cases that win on appeal because a lower court got it wrong, and cases that are thrown out because the lawyer and/or the plaintiff screwed up. Obscure, obtuse, obnoxious loopholes do not make for justice.   Qualified and absolute immunity shield horrible people from personal responsibility for hurting innocent victims. Indemnification of connected defendants protects them from even having to hire a lawyer, let alone pay damages if they lose. What happens to innocent people in this country, with and without costly attorneys, is criminal and worse.   Take the case of Long Island teenager David Pearl. Here's a 16-year-old kid who was walking down the street in 1967 and was stopped by police in a patrol car.  They questioned him briefly.  Then they ordered him into the back of the car and they all headed to the precinct. On the way, one cop began to punch him in the stomach and the face.  Another cop held the boy so the first cop could get a better shot.  When they got to the police station, they punched and kicked him in the head. They kept it up until he was unconscious.  Someone called an ambulance.  Young David Pearl spent 10 days in the hospital.  He would be blind in one eye for the rest of his life.   Then he was charged of assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct.   The police version, of course, was different.  They said he was swearing at them and claimed he had resisted arrest.  Pearl and his very angry mother sued the City of Long Beach and the police officers. There was no hope of winning this case, of course.  No jury believes police lie.  So for $30,000, Long Beach settled the false criminal charges -- \"an amount that did not cover his medical bills and the fees and expenses of his criminal defense,\" a judge noted later.  In 1999, former P.O. Vincent F. Milo, Jr., the cop who had held the teen in the patrol car for P.O. Nolan, confessed they made the whole story up. Yes.  Milo confessed. Wrote the court:   \"[T]here existed a pattern of brutality ... [b]eatings by senior officers, especially the detectives to extract confessions were common\" ... it was \"standard operating procedure\"; and \"[b]lackjacks, clubs and rubber hoses and telephone books were all part of our `unofficial' equipment.\"  The police were represented in the civil case by attorney Leon Stern, who   was allowed to be present in the Grand Jury room while the Pearl case was being present[ed].  In fact, he gave us detailed accounts of each civilian witness'[s] testimony so that we could adjust our presentation.... [H]e was `one of the boys' while an Assistant District Attorney and understood the way we operated.\"    Armed with this confession and new evidence of the official Long Beach, N.Y. policy of police brutality, Pearl sued.  Two law firms took his case: Beldock Levine & Hoffman and Tolmage Peskin Harris & Falick. When it was dismissed, Pearl appealed with one of the best trial lawyers in the country, William Goodman, at his side.  He lost. Conceding it was \"harsh\", the court threw out Pearl's lawsuit.  He was entitled to no estoppel -- the legal dance that gives New York plaintiffs an excuse to extend the statute of limitations because the defendant lied.   The judge found, too, \"no basis in federal or New York law to make an exception to accommodate Pearl's claims, just because he now appears to have much stronger evidence than he had in 1967.\" Is this fair?  No.   This is the legal system -- the \"flawed\" part people complain about.  I don't care if it is \"the best.\"  I care that a 16 year old kid was beaten to a pulp by half a dozen grown men in uniform who lied about the attack, and when one of them finally admitted their assault and perjury, the federal court decreed there was nothing we could do about it. It is a small blessing that one of these monsters came clean.  For whatever reason, in the twilight of his life, now retired and living in Florida, Vincent F. Milo Jr. told the world the truth.  When these things happen, we are all injured.  For every 16 year old David Pearl with the dirty-cop-turned-clean, there are 1000 others, some who don't survive. This was disgusting. ",
