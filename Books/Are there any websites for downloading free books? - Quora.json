            "answer_text": "Easily, if you go to a site that offers free books. There are many places you can go to find any number of books from throughout history all the way through to the 1940s and later. And if the author is dead and the work is out of copyright, you can download as many books as you want, all for free. However, if the books are still in print and in copyright, you will be breaking the law. People who download books without paying the author are stealing that author\u2019s work. If everyone does that, no author will be able to afford to live. Of course, you may not be over worried about that. Still, here\u2019s another little point. All the firms providing free downloads are, of course, breaking the law. They are deliberately infringing the author\u2019s copyright. They are happy to do so because most of these firms are criminal gangs in their own right. They will happily promise to download a book to you, Some may ask for your credit card details, just as a proof of your ID. If you give them your card details, you will almost certainly be robbed. But even if you don\u2019t give them your card details, usually such companies will be scamming you, not providing a download, but instead loading malware on your computer. This will invisibly hunt around your hard drive and find all your details for ID theft. Many will also hunt down your bank account and details. The short answer is, if you go to illegal sites that are providing criminal services, you can expect to be robbed. And to be frank, if you want to go to the trouble of depriving authors of their income, you deserve it. ",

            "answer_text": "Go to your local library. Most subscribe to services like Overdrive, so that they can loan out ebooks. Go to promotional sites, where authors give away copies to get reviews or to build a fan base. Instafreebie is one. Great deals on bestsellers you'll love has good deals, and giveaways, too. Go to sites where writers who are starting out offer their early works for free, to build up a fan base. There are dozens of them. What you don\u2019t want to do is pirate books. Think about it: these people have no problem taking the money out of the hands of the people who create the work that they love. Why would they have a problem with stealing your id, or putting malware on your computer, etc? You\u2019re not a friend, nor do you do anything they like. You\u2019ve got to be lower on their priority list, than the authors/musicians/etc. And, let\u2019s face it: piracy is defined by taking away the ONLY thing that lets authors, actors, and others make some return on the time and money that they\u2019ve put into making the stuff you want. That is, indeed, theft. Do the right thing, and get books legally. ",
