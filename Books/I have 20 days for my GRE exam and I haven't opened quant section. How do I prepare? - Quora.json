I couldn\u2019t even read the last couple of questions or so. Point is, its not that tough if you have your basics clear. Just brush up on formulas and concepts, learn some shortcuts to be able to solve quickly and manage those 35 minutes properly. Theres a lot of hype and i understand its importance if you are applying somewhere its needed but its not as tough as its made out to be. Ps: i chose a bad date and got stuck with festivals and college internals and practicals right before the exam. Do not recommend going in without proper preparation. ",

            "answer_text": "We Indians have an inherent advantage when it comes to GRE Quantitative. Hence we require little preparation for the same. 20 days is a lot of time for you to brush up your concepts from any material - ETS official guide or Barron\u2019s. I would suggest you to spend a couple of hours daily for the next 20 days and solve as many questions as you can from these materials. This should suffice for a good Quant score. All the best! ",
