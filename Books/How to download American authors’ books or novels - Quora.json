            "answer_text": "Ideally, by buying them! Or renting them. If you\u2019re looking for advice on illegal downloads on Quora, you have come to the wrong place. There are plenty of avenues available online, but as a published author, I would discourage their use. Every penny of royalties helps keep authors in business. Don\u2019t deny them their livelihood. However, if you\u2019re willing to pay a minimal sum and enjoy lots of books, Amazon has a Kindle Unlimited offer that puts millions of books (including those by Amazon authors) within your reach for as low as Rs 149 a month (if you take the annual membership). I\u2019d say that\u2019s a fair price, if you read more than one book a month. If you live in the US, have a Kindle or Amazon Fire device, and a Prime membership, you also have the Kindle Owners Lending Library where you can \u2018borrow\u2019 electronic books from other readers.

            "answer_text": "Sometimes I use the Project Guten site for downloading books in different formats like PDF, epub, Kindle editions, etc. I've mostly used this for novels and those kind of books. For textbooks, TextbookRevolution is highly recommended. I've been able to get a couple of textbooks in PDF format. In case you can't find the books you're looking for in the above sites, you can always Google them and some site or the other is bound to turn up.
