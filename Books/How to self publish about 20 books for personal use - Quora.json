            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you mean 20 copies of one book, not 20 different books. I\u2019m also assuming you want hard copy - like a book you would buy in a book store., not an ebook. If those assumptions are true, I would go with Createspace on Amazon. No matter who you use, you will have to format the text and upload it to a platform. You\u2019ll have to design a cover and upload that also. Createspace will allow you to create you book in a professional manner and you do not have to offer it for sale. Simply do not complete the final step which puts in on Amazon. You can order your twenty copies through Createspace and Amazon is none the wiser. It will just sit on Createspace as an unfinished project. No problem there. If, in the future you want more copies, they are there for the taking. Good luck! ",

Why not simply convert your word document to PDF format? That\u2019s even easier than self-publishing, and it gives you the same effect\u2014read only material. ",
