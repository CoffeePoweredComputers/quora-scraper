            "answer_text": "yes, at that age children's imaginations are very active and not so able to distinguish imagination from real life. Although it may be worse for some children than others. Some things you can do to help your child are\u2026 A lot of children are scared of the dark, and that could be causing some nightmares. Buy your child a salt lamp or nightlight, as these are both very gentle soothing lights. You could also keep the hallway light on at night whilst leaving their door open a crack.Make sure they arent getting the nightmares from another influence. Although nightmares are pretty normal in children theres also the chance they\u2019ve seen or heard something that has scared them enough to give them nightmares. The most common example I can think of is your child seeing something on youtube or tv that has scared them. Although I wouldnt worry too much about this, you should still keep an eye on what things they are viewing. Sometimes something completely harmless can scare a child (like a cartoon character comedically falling down a hole or something like that) so you cant completely keep them away from things or stop them from getting scared every now and again.Provide comfort and support when they have nightmares. When your child wakes up from a nightmare they are probably going to be really scared and upset. Make sure you give your child a hug and talk about the dream if they want to. That way your child will know you\u2019ll be there for them when they are scared and will be able to get back to sleep.Thats all I can think of right now, good luck and thanks for reading! ",

Although if they happen more often than usual or consistently than it could also be do to an underlying trauma either psychological or physical. my eldest daughter use to suffer often from night terrors when she was younger around that age due to psychological trauma from witnessing my past domestic violence abuse and my suffering during the womb. children are in fact affected during the womb when we suffer emotionally/physically also when children are having \u201cnight terrors\u201d they\u2019re still in a state of sleep so it\u2019s very difficult to try and comfort them since they\u2019re still sleeping. It\u2019s best to have as much patience as possible and try to help them go back to sleep. ",
