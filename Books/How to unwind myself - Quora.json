            "answer_text": "Deep breathing exercises work wonders on relaxing your mind. Practice  these daily and in times of stress to help soothe your anxiety. Close your mouth and take a deep breath in through your nose. Try to  time this inhalation so that it lasts for four seconds. Hold your  breath for eight seconds, and then exhale your breath for a count of  eight seconds. Repeat this four times total.If you have trouble slowing your breathing this far, start at a faster pace and slowly work your way up to a longer time.Feel free to adjust the time each inhale and exhale lasts, but be  sure that your exhale lasts for twice as long as your inhale. Pause  between each breath",

There is a place called Tumling. You will have absolute solitude there. A small town with a few hundred people. You're surrounded by Himalayas. I have never seen a clear night sky as I have in Tumling. ",
