            "answer_text": "I was a children\u2019s bookseller for many years. There are many very good fantasies about princesses but they\u2019re different in plot - not focused mainly on marriage. Since I don\u2019t know the age of the person looking for them, I\u2019ll give them. They are all by top women writers and are for ages 10 to adult. Dealing With Dragons, Calling on Dragons, Searching for Dragons, Talking to Dragons by Patricia Wrede. About a very independent princess, Cimorene. The Song of the Lioness (four books): Alanna: The First Adventure, In the Hand of the Goddess, Woman Who Rides Like a Man and Lioness Rampant by Tamora Pierce. The Hero and the Dragon and The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley. Both books won the Newbery Award for children\u2019s fiction. Probably better for 12 and older. Beauty by Robin McKinley (a retelling of Beauty and the Beast) This is a really beautiful book. And on more, the very best: Riddle Master of Hed, a trilogy. This is a serious fantasy for older teens and adults. Better than Tolkien, with very strong women characters., a couple of princesses but different types. The young women in these books are working out what roles they feel called to in their lives. The closest to the Princess Diaries would be Dealing With Dragons or Beauty.

            "answer_text": "I should first clarify: if you are talking about the main Princess Diaries series by Meg Cabot, they are neither fantasy novels nor children\u2019s novels. They are quite candid \u201crealistic fiction\u201d for teens. I put \u201crealistic fiction\u201d in quotes because waking up one day and discovering that you are descended from royalty isn\u2019t particularly realistic, but it\u2019s technically possible (though not likely) and there are no fantasy elements like dragons or magic or anything. I honestly wouldn\u2019t recommend the series because the main character gives up most of her moral values throughout the series and makes terrible decisions. That being said, if you want diary-style kids\u2019 books, the Royal Diaries series by the same folks who published Dear America are interesting, although the historical/cultural accuracy is questionable.
