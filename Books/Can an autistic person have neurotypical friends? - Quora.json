            "answer_text": "Yes, but the reality is that it will only work under a few conditions: a) the autism is diagnosed or at least agreed to exist and out in the open and everyone in the relationship knows about it and understands it; b) the neurotypical person makes allowances for apparent unusual behaviour within set boundaries; and c) the person with autism attempts strategies to be flexible and better able to adapt to changing situations so as not to unduly stress out the neurotypical person. I am neurotypical and somehow wound up with tonnes of friends on the spectrum. Honestly I think it's because I have been historically very accepting and accommodating to behaviours that other neurotypical people don't tolerate. However, years of experience have taught me that putting my own needs last is not a solution to conflict in a relationship between myself and an autistic person. It is not sustainable. Friendship is a two way street and I never used to expect my friends on the spectrum to reciprocate with the same effort as me because I allowed my interpretation of their social limitations to act as justification for poor efforts at friendship. I no longer tolerate certain behaviours, because I have defined them as beyond my boundaries, and I continue to make allowances I feel are reasonable. It can be hard for SOME (not all) people with autism to be held accountable for unreasonable behaviour if they've had a history of \u201cgetting away with it\u201d under the assumption that it was an autistic behaviour rather than just a plain old childish one (which neurotypical people are also capable of). In short, yes. But both parties have to define boundaries and expectations and put in the same effort to speak the other person's language. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a non-spectrum human in a long-term relationship with an autistic one, and we\u2019re very happy. So yes. Autistic humans can have neurotypical friends and also neurotypical partners! Now, in the interests of full disclosure, I do suffer from bipolar disorder type II, so I\u2019m not 100% neurotypical but while I think that does give me quite a lot of understanding and acceptance of unusual behaviors, I feel like the way that my partner processes information about the world around him is so different from the way that I do that there is something fundamentally different about his brain. Which yes! There is! Because he\u2019s on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. I think in some ways it\u2019s very useful for him to have a non-spectrum partner, because I can in many ways serve as a social interface and interpreter for him. We\u2019re both pretty open about it with our friends, and it\u2019s easier for him to understand social gatherings if I can help him out. It is much harder for him to maintain friendships on his own with neurotypical people, and he tends to assume that most people don\u2019t like him, so it\u2019s also good that he has me around to explain (repeatedly) that his friends like him very much, no seriously. It definitely takes some patience to not get frustrated sometimes if we have to leave some place early because he can\u2019t handle something that\u2019s happening in a way that doesn\u2019t really make sense to me, or if we have to cancel plans because he\u2019s too anxious to go out, but I love him. He takes care of me when I\u2019m ill (and I often am), so I take care of him if his differently-shaped brain can\u2019t handle something in our weird world. Partnership! ",

Back in 2013, a friendship I had for 3 years fell apart due to the fact I\u2019m autistic. I did mention to her I was but at the time I didn\u2019t talk about it a lot, so it\u2019s very likely she forgot. Once she saw me stim, she jumped to irrational conclusions. It took her months to admit that this is what was bothering her. She wasn\u2019t going to listen to a reasonable explanation at that point. Besides she\u2019d see it as me \u201cusing austim as an excuse.\u201d Even though there is nothing wrong with covering your ears and rocking, there\u2019s nothing to excuse, just to explain. This is why I\u2019m now so open about being autistic now. If a neurotypical is going to have a problem with it, I want to find out early. ",

I've learned that many autistic people apparently are more fake towards people, than NT's. Plus, many autistic people act very \u201cracist\u201d against NT's. So nah, I'm glad I don't have any asperger friends, or that I act inany way like them. People are people, they are not their diagnoses. And they surely can't use them as excuses. Are you being an idiot, then it's you, and not your diagnose. ",

I choose not to call people neurotypical because in many circles, that word is used as an insult. However, rejecting a group is based on stereotyping and stereotyping is responsible for a great deal of injustice towards autistics. I think we should choose our friends as we wish. We know that many autistics have family and friends who are not autistic and vice versa. In my opinion, there is no place for hate. We share the world and we model how to do that with mutual respect.
