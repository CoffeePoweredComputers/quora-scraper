            "answer_text": "Unlovable is a shame conclusion you came to because your original caregivers couldn't, or wouldn't, give it. The typical response is trying to get others to give you that value but they are unable to, even though they may try. Your interpretation of this is to confirm what you already believe through experience, ie: You're unlovable. All the performing you do will ultimately be futile because they cannot make up for what you believe you need. Namely your parent-Gods were supposed to love you unconditionally. Love isn't supposed to be something you earn. To heal that soul-wound, you have to trump your original (Gods\u2019) messages about your worth, you received as an experience. In addition, it really isn't the adult you who needs the validation. It is that little ghost-child inside who is still lonely and insecure. That kid needs you to create an experience where the blessing is a given. That is why most all societies have Priests, Shaman, or Holy people to help people discover the truth of who they are. You can't be subjective and objective at the same time. So to get over it, or heal it, You have to find someone skilled in helping you find the truth. That little ghost-child was lovable \"just the way they are\", to quote Mr. Rogers. The child was lovable just because it exists and belongs in this world. It is not a truth you are unlovable, just a feeling. Your feeling can be changed with a new paradigm. There are a number of therapies and processes designed to change that. Find one that works for you. ",

            "answer_text": "I was asked to answer for the first time, thanks for that. I think first and foremost that no one is truly unlovable so I think I'd rather answer \u201chow do you cope with *feeling* unlovable?\u201d because I have some experience in that and that may still be of help to you. I have felt unlovable many times during my not so long life. There are notes I've written at thirteen, fourteen, fifteen (you get the idea) that ask this very question: what is is about me that's so awful that no one can love me? The answer was: nothing. I wasn't unlovable. I grew up thinking that my parents didn't love me, which I now think they do in some way even if they're far from the best parents in the world. This, I applied to everyone as a rule since I also wasn't very popular in school, didn't have many friends, some people made fun of me, I was always pickes last in PE, the list goes on. As far as romatic relationships go I only recently had experience with that (at twenty) but I still haven't been kissed (long distance). I think the reason I have such trouble with people is that I am a bit different than them, especially people my age. Growing up the way I did made me have to grow up very quickly, I always felt older than my peers and I think they could tell too that I had other values than they did. That's why my romatic interest is eleven years older than I am\u2026 whoops\u2026 My mother hates it but I have never met anyone who accepts me like he does and I've realised that I would've settled for a lot less than that. I still don't have that many friends due to my living situation but I am hoping that'll change and I think it could. So. How do you cope? You realise that you're a bit more of an acquired taste than others might be and that you just have to find the people who'll appreciate you for it. Unless there's something critical in your behaviour, like that you don't treat people well for instance, you should be fine. Finding people with similar interests is always a good start to get to know people and -here's the clich\u00e9- you have to try to push yourself to accept yourself as you are, despite what past you have that makes you feel this way. It's just a feeling in your head, you control your head in this case. That's not to say it's easy, I still struggle almost every day to stay positive, but it's worth fighting for, it really is. I hope you find a way to cope! ",

            "answer_text": "Hard to answer a question like this without finding out some more about you, but I'll give it a shot. To elucidate the concept of self-love (without which you will never be able to understand how others could love you), most psychologists use the analogy of two cisterns providing water for the same village. Both collect the same amount of rainwater, but when a draught hits one day, only one of them continues to supply the villagers, as it has access to an underground reservoir that it can draw from until the rains come back. Following are just a handful of strategies for acquiring (\"rediscovering\" would be a more accurate term, since we are all born with it as children) that underground reservoir, and for learning to draw from it when the world might not be as kind to you as it has been in the past:   Nurture relationships. As much as you can, try to make sure you are surrounding yourself with people whom you value. There are few substitutes for good relationships - be they with friends, family or romantic partners - to make you feel a sense of belonging and that you are loved. You may think that you don't have enough of these... Well, then it's time to go out and look for more. There is a chicken and egg problem here (i.e. How do I put myself out there if I don't have anything to offer?), but force yourself to do it and you may surprise yourself.Focus on personal qualities. Most people have certain skills or attributes that make them more valuable than others in the eyes of society (I have met very few people in life who do not have at least some... Make sure you are being honest with yourself). Whatever they are in your case, spend time reflecting on the things that make you unique, or the things that you have accomplished, and learn to recognize your worth in that way. The easiest time to do this is of course when exercising the qualities in question, but it is a good practice to make a list or otherwise encourage yourself to concentrate on them at other times, too.Consider meditating. As another answerer suggested, explore meditation as a path to feeling more compassion towards yourself. \"Love\" in the way that most of us consider it is a very ego-based construct, whereas meditation is an excellent teacher of loving yourself as part of an interconnected whole, thereby gaining a more authentic understand of the expression \"no man is an island.\" It's not for everyone, but buy a book called \"Mindfulness in Plain English\" and see if you can't put aside 15-20 minutes per day for just a couple of months to see if this would help you.Look after your body. At times when I have thought little of myself, I noticed that one of the first things to happen was that I stopped caring about my physical wellbeing. If this body doesn't house anything of value, why waste time on its upkeep? It's a logical argument, and impossible to refute on its own merit. The mind-body relationship runs much deeper than a lot of people think, however... In the same way that smiling for long enough can serve to make you feel happier, taking small steps whenever possible to care for your body will help you to feel better about your self-image. It will also help to lift your spirits on a physiological level.Build will power. This is a big one -  arguably the most important of the list. Whenever you are down on yourself, you will not feel like telling yourself how great you actually are - and naturally, since the very reason you're feeling down is because you don't think that about yourself. By simply forcing yourself to get up and engage in an activity to divert your mind from negativity -  or in any of the other strategies I've mentioned - you're giving yourself the biggest leg up you possibly could. The first few times you try to distance yourself from yourself in this way will be the hardest, and you probably won't succeed. Will power is like muscle, however, and the more times you manage to exercise it successfully, the more reference points you'll be giving yourself to make it that much easier the next time.Ultimately, if you've tried many suggestions such as these, and nothing seems to be working, then I would recommend seeking out professional guidance. There is zero shame in this and you would by no means be \"giving up\":  many high successful people receive counseling of some form or another on a continuous basis, and most of us have sought this kind of help at some point in our lives. When all is said and done, you must accept (and it's by no means an easy task) that you are the only one who can increase your self-esteem and appreciation for your qualities that I'm sure you richly deserve. Once you have fully acknowledged that no other person can, or indeed should, be relied on to help you achieve this, you will already be on your way to building that self-replenishing reservoir, which is probably the biggest key to happiness in life.

I have waited for her for last 4 years. And then finally\u2026 she was with me . The heart always skipped a beat whenever she held my hand. I loved the way she used to tease me. And I loved the way she used to keep on texting me . I still remember when I was out of station for 7 days and there was no phone at all with me . And when my phone started working , there were blunder of messages by her. But\u2026.. She loves someone else.. Maybe someone\u2026 who is perfect. Maybe someone. . whom she thinks is the best. At one night\u2026 I called her .. a long time ago\u2026and when I heard her crying my heart just got broken. She was crying just Coz of him. And I swear of Mahadev, if were there I would have punched in the face of that guy. But you know what.. you feel completely broken and helpless when your love compares your love with someone's else love. The most beautiful day of my life was when she said \u201c i love you Prashant\u201d.  I just can't express that feelings in words. And the next day\u2026 she said \u201c i am sorry Parshant. I don't have feelings for you. I still love him\u201d And seriously\u2026 it seemed like a sword just hit my chest. Her words just cut deeper than knife. I was so broken that I didn't sleep for straight 7 nights. And when you are unloved by someone\u2026 you just start hating yourself. You either become a poet or a writer. And yes.. I wrote 7 poems for her. And then what happened next\u2026 she made fun of my feelings (poems). But I don't know why I can't stop loving her. I don't know why I just can't stop thinking about her. I don't know why can't she see my feelings.. I don't know why \u2026 I don't know why. .. But yes\u2026.. I still love her\u2026 And I fall in love with her everyday\u2026. Every moment spent with her is bliss. And the most important thing\u2026. I still love holding her hands .  ",

            "answer_text": "First recognize that this is a feeling. You quite likely cannot be certain you are or aren\u2019t, but if the feeling is there all the time, it is the fact that counts and you need to take some action to fix things because life is painful without feeling love. If you\u2019re in one or more relationships then look at each, decide if this feeling has been going on long term. Decide whether you can talk with (each) person about it. If you it has been long term, can\u2019t be talked about, then try to figure out how to move away from that person permanently. That will give you a time goal for solving that lack and freeing up time to form new relationships in place of the old. If you\u2019re not in a relationship or are planning to move away from old one(s), then take some time to figure out as best you can why the old didn\u2019t provide feelings of love, how new ones might and whether you need to learn or change any behavior of your own that may be getting in the way. That might require some counseling, perhaps from a friend or even professional. But the key thing about planning and taking action is that it by itself starts you on the path to feeling better, starting to believe there are better times ahead and you\u2019re taking positive steps to improve things. Many people delay such steps because they feel it will take too long to make a difference. There are two answers to this - first, if you don\u2019t start, you will never make progress. But more comfortingly, the second is that it almost always takes far less time than you expect and that time will pass quite quickly the more effort and thinking time you put into planning a better future right now.

            "answer_text": "Firstly, I sit back, relax my mind and think about the reason of this feeling. If it is because of someone else like less attention from husband or family then I calmly and gently remind myself of the theory which I preach that we should not be dependent on someone else for happiness or love. Its our own duty to make our life loved and fulfilled. No one is responsible to keep us happy ALL THE TIME. It is such an unrealistic expectations.Sometimes it is because of me like not spending enough alone time, or doing way too much for the family or loved ones and not getting enough appreciation in return. Then I jot down mentally all the big or small things which are leading to all the negative thoughts in my mind. It can be due to husband not doing any particular thing in the way I want him to do, or maid not doing her job properly. And then I let go of the control which I feel I have over these things or others. I let them free and be the way they want to be. I let go of any behavioral expectations I have from others. This single step can stop lot of negative feelings from getting generated. Next, I focus on doing things which gives me peace, calmness, happiness like reading a good book, writing a gratitude journal, cooking one of my favorite things, or just sleeping for some time. There are so many such small things which bring me back on track. I spend some time thinking good thoughts about future, thinking about excelling in my career or having a beautiful home of our own. Positive visualization of future creates lots of excitement and happiness and I automatically tend to work towards achieving these things instead of wasting my time on thinking who loves me less and why.

            "answer_text": "Questioning my thoughts did it for me, a la Byron Katie and also Access Consciousness. I don't think there is usually anyone who tells us we are unlovable. We just get an idea of what love looks like, and when we don't see that coming from anyone in our lives, we conclude that we are unlovable. Or it may be based on judgments that are so prevalent in pretty much any society, or even on media which tells us certain things about us are unacceptable. By the way, there is no feeling that can be labeled \"unlovable\". We basically feel sad or despairing or hopeless in response to the thought that we are unlovable. I remember observing one day that I believed I was unloved and unlovable, even while surrounded by people who would literally die for me. Therefore, it couldn't be true. The error must had to be in my perception. Now, I know that all the love I will ever feel is already here, inside my heart. I don't have to wait for someone else to demonstrate love to feel it. I can feel it any time I choose. This can take practice if you're used to only feeling love when some outside action stirs the awareness of love within you. Sometimes, it helps to begin with a memory of feeling love, and recreate that memory until you're in touch with the feeling. But whatever you do, know that the fact that you care at all is evidence of your lovability. In fact, that you exist at all is evidence of the same. Love is not something to earn, but something to receive. ",

            "answer_text": "First, you must ask yourself why you consider yourself to be unlovable. Although I may not know your circumstances, I do know that you are a wonderful, beautiful, unique human being who deserves to be loved and respected. For me personally, whenever I may find myself thinking in this sort of way, I am reminded of my faith in Jesus; and how much he loves and cares for me even though the world may not. We should not cope, we should overcome. Let me tell you something that you may have not heard before: You can overcome anything, and you are in control of your life, your destiny is in your own hands. You are not unlovable, maybe you may not feel loved now, maybe from your family, friends, or by the world, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from finding those who love you for who you are. When I didn\u2019t feel loved by my friends, I eventually decided that I wasn\u2019t going to allow their negativity towards me to affect my happiness, so I moved on and found new ones. Now that I have friends that truly love and care for me, I\u2019ve never felt so alive. I don\u2019t want you to think that this was just a happy story for another persons happy ending. No. You can make your own happy ending, and while I am a man of faith, I recognize that my destiny is in my own hands on this earth. Either I could have chosen to remain complacent and abused by my \u201cfriends\u201d and the world, or I could roll up my sleeves and make my own happiness. Whenever you may find yourself thinking you are unable to achieve what you want in life, or that you can\u2019t do something, remember this quote, \u201cYesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.\u201d - A wise man. Please, I don\u2019t want you to think you are unlovable, every human being has lovable aspects about themselves. If you find yourself isolated from the world around you, keep in mind that it is impossible to fit in when you where born to stand out. If you may find yourself unable to connect with others solely because you are unique, remember that there are millions of others who sing the same song. And trust me, you\u2019ll know when you find those people that were eager to meet someone who understands them. Remind yourself not to lose hope, and that there are 7 billion people on this planet, all with their own complex fears, desires, philosophies, and motivations throughout this lifetime. Try not to think that you will never meet someone who would ever be able to love you or understand you, every human is broken in some way, in nature, we are all inevitably fallible. Try not to allow bad relationships in your past define your future relationships with others. If you may find yourself blinded by your own future, or not sure of what you may want or can do, take the Enneagram and Myers Briggs evaluations to aid you in discovering what may come naturally to you as a potential career path. Introspection and meditation helps with finding your passions by evaluating previous experiences and an evaluation of your personality to provide potential insight for your future. If you may find yourself prisoner to these type of thoughts, and find it affecting your overall perception on life, your mood, appetite, and overall well being, please, do not hesitate to seek help from a professional who\u2019s top priority is to put you into a position to become the best and happiest version of yourself possible. When I found myself at my lowest, I decided that I could either wallow in my own self pity and unhappiness, or I could take control of my life and admit that I needed help for my crushing anxiety. My therapist taught me how to keep myself in the present moment, face my fears, maintain a positive attitude, and live life courageously and with purpose. You are not unlovable. You are worthy of love. You are beautiful. You are unique. You are strong. You are intelligent. You are not a quitter, you are a dreamer. You\u2019ll never be regular, you\u2019re spectacular. Final question, how many times do you get to live life? Twice? Three times? Five times? Nope, you guessed it, once. So live life every day courageously, and remind yourself that life is too short to spend it fearfully, or unhappily, remind yourself that you CAN. And that you can find happiness in this world, one way or the other, you can. Life is a gift, you can laugh, cry, create, destroy, think, experience, learn, and most importantly love. Please remember, you are loved. ",

The fact that love and affection involved in any type of relationship- personal, friendship, family- get expressed mainly through feelings and emotions makes it a bit difficult to deal with.Though the role of intelligence has always been minimal in those tight situations involving relationship, it is necessary to understand the significant role it can play when properly employed. Take a deep breath and think about it. Try to identify your priorities in your love life. What is it you loved/wanted/longed to do/feel/experience always but couldn't and didn\u2019t. Locate and list it in a proper order. Look for possibilities and opportunities to get your top priorities active. Accept responsibility for your choices/rejections and get ready to enjoy or suffer in the process. Dive deep. A word about love and being loved. It is always complicated\u2026 shackles made of gold makes no difference. We know that people generally fall short of expectations. But if you choose to attach a tag of genuinity to your love then the next best thing you can do is to ignore the faults of your beloved and be realistic. Best. ",

            "answer_text": "Transmute feeling unloved by OTHERS into finding more ways to love YOURSELF. When you have love for your self (and I do not mean being selfish, that is different) no one can injure you in that way. That is the short answer. The long answer is, that feeling of being unloved (romantic or otherwise) is due to your own thought filter. You have placed intrinsic value upon that feeling. Feeling loved is good; feeling unloved is bad. Somewhere along the way (and many of our paths) we have been told that feeling unloved is an external force that is unpleasant. What I can say is, there are likely MANY people who love you and it just isn\u2019t verbalized as much as you would like to hear. If there is someway that you can change your perspective on that thought filter, you will see improvements on that. That is the reason many people will tell you to look within for that unconditional love. Seeking it from external sources will often lead us to a dry watering hole. \u201cTeach a man to fish\u201d kind of thought process involved in deeper thinking about love. Love is spiritual; it is internal before it can become external. If you do not love yourself, how can others love you if the energy you are emitting - the lower frequency of negative emotions - is covering that beautiful person underneath. It\u2019s not the cycle - it\u2019s the filter you place on it. Here is the quote that inspired me to learn to transmute some of my own inner-dialog: \u201cIf you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.\u201d ~ Marcus Aurelius I hope this helps you. \u2665 ",

            "answer_text": "I found myself staring at this question for sometime. Love can be a rare feeling to share with someone else, and feeling love for yourself tends to be a greater challenge these days. Loneliness is a battle for a good amount of people. After all, when we are fully conscious arguments in our head are found to be two sides of the same coin. Love has more depth than words can describe for some people. And the urge to be desired by another person is a natural human feeling. It is truly unfortunate that in its place we use addiction and anger to fill the void created by the lack. I suppose the best advice I can give is to create and grow socially, while at the same time working on increasing your self love. Go out of your way to say yes to friends when asked to go out. Find new people to talk with by doing new things on a regular basis. Things like meetup, or weekly events, are a great place to start as long as there is a common crowd to get over the uncomfortable hump of stranger status. By reaching out and getting involved with those around you, it should give you more of a sense of togetherness. Even if you don't like crowds, make it a point to go. Look for opportunities for new conversations. Personally, I don't believe you should be looking for a way to 'get over' the feeling. Instead, focus on fixing the situation and find the belief that you can do such a thing for yourself. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you find that feeling you crave. Best wishes, Topher ",

Nothing is more attractive than someone with a purpose. Do not lose your purpose once people start noticing you and start to be attracted to you. If you do you'll be back where you started. Stick to your purpose and let it attract people who like you are sheltered by it and take refuge in it. Do not confuse their attraction to your purpose with their attraction to you. Never-the-less they will be attracted to you as a channel to the higher purpose. The highest purpose is to be Enlightened. Other high purposes are to know God and to save the world. The path to these high purposes begins with the introductory purpose to exercise all you talents and abilities so as to make yourself a complete instrument of the highest purpose. ",

If a boss tells you your work is not good this is not the measure of your worth (even if your work is not good.) If a significant other or a lover doesn\u2019t want you anymore their departure is not a measure of your worth. If your spouse seems endowed with magical insight and says anything that sounds like foreshadowing her fear is not the measure of your worth. You, just by virtue of being you, of being human, are in possession of inherent worth. So, let me take it a step further. If you are certain you are worthless not even you are a measure of your worth. ",

My family is pretty unlovable so I understand how it feels to not be loved it\u2019s freaking tiring when all you want is love, warmth, and kindness from others. And you may have friends or don\u2019t and they are just friends they don\u2019t provide the love you want or need. Understand that love, kindness and appreciation can come from anyone and anywhere. Going online to seek a loving friend isn\u2019t a bad thing, great friendships you never knew you could have may happen. Use an app like talklife to engage with others feeling and going through the same thing, also Reddit if you find the right subreddit. If it\u2019s self-love and you personally cannot find the love in yourself. Start complimenting yourself. Google compliments to tell yourself and say them all because you are downright beautiful /maleorfemale doesn\u2019t matter, you are smart\u2026 If you keep holding excuses against yourself that you not and you feel you are lying to yourself. You really not. Enjoy your own company, love yourself, self-love goes a long way. You won\u2019t need others to love you because you are your own champion and your own hero\u2026 Someone is going to find you so damn lovable and irresistible and your children will love the person you are. Look forward to the future and love it for what it is about to give to you. Unconditional love. ",

            "answer_text": "That happens to many of us. Think about who do you want love from. There are people who show they dont care, and if you look at them and really think. WHO CARES. If you\u2019re talking about family, unfortunately, we can pick friends but not relatives. Try doing things you love and surround yourself by positive things and places. The feeling never goes away specially if you feel a relative or partner doesn't care. You have to not care in terms of knowing you are not the only one in this world that feels this way. Many people feel unloved. Because the world the way it is, has become too cynical and selfish. Instead give love, and that can make you feel good. Try not to focus too much to that otherwise you will feel worse. Focus on what makes you happy and try to be as much independent as possible, so you dont need anything from no one..

At the same time, you're torn between wanting to be alone, wanting to be with people, not sure how to communicate it, and not sure how you can contribute to a social circle. Its socially paralyzing and really very overwhelming. The worst part is usually you're totally fine externally, people like you (hence being a social circle seeking to include you), and they are just completely confused by what's going on, while you feel crushed under all this weird anxiety.

It might be a particular person who brings the ray of sunshine, or it might be a particular thought or memory that makes you smile. You can return to these and you need to make a particular note of them. Activities also play a useful part in this, such as going to the shop, visiting the library, playing cards, etc. You will notice that some of them make you feel more at home with the world. You don't need to do anything special to be lovable, quite the opposite in fact. If you are at home in your everyday activities, you will attract the interest and sympathy of other everyday people. This might be just a nod, or a grunt etc, but you will notice it, and take it as a cue for feeling lovable. ",

And feeling unlovable doesn't mean others will not be able to love you. Who told you that? There is actually a contest for the ugliest dog and a dog wins it! (Look it up!) However, that dog is still loved very much. But let's say you had a beautiful dog that bit you every time you touched him. How long would you keep loving him if he always just wanted to hurt you? Would his being beautiful be more important for loving him than his biting you every time you got close to him? A person who is pretty on the outside but mean and hateful on the inside would be hard to love like the biting dog. The person who doesn't look so pretty, but is kindhearted and thoughtful would be much easier to love; just like the ugliest dog in the world. You are not unlovable if you are thoughtful and nice. But if you are mean and bite people, you may have trouble finding someone to love you. I hope this helps. Thanks for asking. ",

Be of service to others. Realize love is everywhere, even in gravity. The earth and gravity loves you so much, that\u2019s why it keeps you grounded. Realize there are many types of love, like siblings, romantic partners, parents, children, and the divine. If you do not feel love with another person, feel love with God. Many people will say I love you because of this / that / for some reason, but realize you have unconditional love from god and you are capable of unconditionally loving others. Hope this helps. Help others less fortunate and you will realize love. Love, ",
