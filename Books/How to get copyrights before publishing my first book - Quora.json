            "answer_text": "Once your book is published, it is automatically copyrighted. The publishers develop a copyright page where the copyright is either given to the author or the publisher, depending on the contract made. In case of self-publishing, copyright always remains with the author. If you want to get your work registered with the government, your publishing service provider can get you one with a small fee but it takes lot of time to get it registered. If your work is not a scientific research or any kind of thesis papers, getting your work published and owning a copyright page would suffice. Happy Writing! ",
