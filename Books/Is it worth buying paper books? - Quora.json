            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a pleasing physicality to the experience of using a real book rather than just reading a screen, but I\u2019ll admit that\u2019s entirely subjective. If holding a book and rifling through the pages gives you no pleasure, we\u2019ll more on to something more general. This may come as a shock to some, but not everything is available in a digital form. I\u2019m interested in certain branches of history where key works are sometimes years or decades out of print, still under copyright, and are unlikely to see new editions of any kind any time soon. If you want to read them, you either get it temporarily through interlibrary loan or buy a physical copy of your own. There are no ebooks for these. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on one's personal choice I guess.I for instance always prefer paperback over digital books like E-books.As an avid reader since childhood, whether it be story books,novels or textbooks I always try to get the paperback copy,if and only if it's not available I go for digital ones.Now digital books too have their advantage..like one can carry multiple books in their e book readers,smartphone,tablets etc..that can be read anywhere.In the end,it\u2019s not about the advantages but comes down to what you are comfortable with.
