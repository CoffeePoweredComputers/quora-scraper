            "answer_text": "You should make short notes for the exam. A simple reason is that you can\u2019t carry those bulky books everywhere. But you can carry those notes and revise easily. Suppose you need to revise Rotational Dynamics, you found some good points from HCV, some good diagrams from DCP and tricks after solving questions from Test Series. You wouldn\u2019t carry HCV, DCP and Test Series papers to revise just 2\u20133 concepts. Therefore if you make notes, you can easily revise stuff. Those notes should contain stuff which you forget easily or are very very important according to JEE. ",
