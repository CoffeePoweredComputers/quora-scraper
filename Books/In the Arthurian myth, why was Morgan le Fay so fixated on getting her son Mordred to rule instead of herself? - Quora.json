            "answer_text": "Well that all comes down to interpretation. There is no one version of the Arthurian legend. I some versions Morgan isn't even a villain. Sometimes she isn\u2019t even Mordred\u2019s mother, and is sidelined by Morgause, another character similar to the former in many ways. Many works simply combine Morgan and Morgues for simplicity (a decision I can\u2019t argue with). Lets assume the version you read, the events taking place are as you have described. I personally love the Morgan-Mordred duo, as it lightly mirrors Merlin and Arthur. That being said. If we are talking about the version where Mordred is Arthur\u2019s child by incest, after Morgan disguised herself to look like Guinevere then it only makes sense she would try to get him on the throne as he would have a much stronger claim (both Arthur\u2019s and Morgan\u2019s by matters of blood.) In addition if it is a version where Morgan has a tight leash on Mordred then what would be the point of ruling as queen when she could essentially get all the power that comes with it, while having Mordred rule officially as she commands form the shadows. After all the throne would go to him anyways after she died, and it would be far easier to get people to follow him than it would be to follow the witch who has a track recored for threatening Camelot. Things get a little more foggy if it is the version where Mordred is simply Arthur\u2019s nephew, however, it mostly comes down to similar reasons as above. Morgan is practically a known super-villian to some within Camelot. And even if that is not the case, if its one of those versions where she somehow keeps her evil deeds hidden from everyone. As a married woman with four or five grown young men for sons; it is infinitely easier to get one of them to fight for her claim under the guise of their own. Meanwhile she rules from the shadows; retaining the fear and respect from those who matter (as anyone of importance would know she was calling the shots). In most versions with evil Morgan, Mordred is her last gambit. She's putting all her chips on the table with him. If the Arthurian legend was a Saturday morning 90s cartoon; then Mordred is the evil version of the hero. He is strong, and a good leader according to some versions. The ultimate weapon. In addition since there are so many versions of the Arthurian legend, and thus room for interpretation, there can be a more nuanced answer. Morgan might have just love Mordred enough (be he sired from Arthur or King Lot) to think that he deserved the throne. If her beloved son took the throne then it is pretty much her own victory by proxy. As mentioned, Mordred and all of Morgan\u2019s other kids for that matter were not children. Having male children essitnally weakened her own claim by putting them ahead in the line of session. However this never really bothers Morgan in any version. She just adapted her plans. As said, she could always rule from the shadows. Regardless, it all comes back to the fact that Mordred is her son. Be her reasons selfish, selfless, or a bit of both, that is really all the reason she needs. ",
