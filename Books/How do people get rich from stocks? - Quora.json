            "answer_text": "I have a few scenarios I built in my head. I\u2019ll start from the stupidest and go to what I think is the smartest. Or at least what I regard as the most respected way to get rich. Buy low, sell high.This is so simple that it pains me to put it on this list. However, we are going from the worst way to the smartest way, so this point has merit to that degree. This method never works. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s used incorrectly, it\u2019s that it neglects key components of one part time and one part emulation.What do I mean?When it comes to buying low, you have to know what low is. Low might look like a 52-week low, but that\u2019s only because you are looking at a company\u2019s forecasts from the standpoint of 52 weeks. Many times, a company stands at a 52 week low, but they\u2019re about to drop even harder because of setbacks that they haven\u2019t recovered from or because competitors are about to eat the rest of their worth.For example, you could have looked at BlockBuster at 2005 trading at $10 a share. You would have seen that its 52-week high was around $30 a share, and thought it was a steal. They would have also recently declined to purchase a newer company called Netflix at the time\u2014a company that was nearly worthless trading at only a few dollars a share.Except, BlockBuster today is completely worthless, and Netflix is trading at $400.In other words, looking at BlockBuster\u2019s history gives you nothing valuable about where it\u2019s headed in the future. The time aspect doesn\u2019t tell you much. To that degree, you also can\u2019t emulate a predictable future with the information, either.People have the element of luck on their side. Large trades can be made in the options world with relatively little capital. One trade can turn someone into a millionaire. You just need a little bit of dumb luck and a belief that your belief is different from everyone else\u2019s.You can hit the lottery, too. It happens, after all.Dunning-kruger miracle.You buy some amount, say $50,000 of a particular stock you think will blow up for a reason you strongly believe. Your reasoning is wrong, because you know nothing about the industry and nothing about the thousand competitors. Your luck hits you something to the effect of a jackpot, and the company turns an incredible profit and miraculously gobbles up its competitors. The stock increases 100-fold, and your account now holds $5,000,000.Dunning-kruger hurts almost everyone. It is an incorrect assessment of your actual ability with your perceived ability. For a small amount of people, they end up with the correct result for the wrong reasons.This (almost) takes the cake for the dumbest way to get rich off of stocks.Your parents teach you about dividends\u2014they\u2019re also rich.Your parents teach you small things about how public companies operate. They teach you that you can earn a dividend if you hold stock in certain companies. You inherit $2,000,000 and it\u2019s all invested in something like IEP\u2014Carl Icahn\u2019s fund.This fund yields a dividend of about 11%. You\u2019ll make a nice $200,000 off the dividends, before tax, before you have to eat into the principal. If you are not a complete moron, you\u2019ll have enough money for the rest of your life.It takes no genius to understand that capital begets capital. If you have a bunch of money, you can simply buy up things that other people can\u2019t so you can reap the benefits of passive wealth from it.If you have that capital to begin with, you\u2019re really going to have to put in a good effort in order to lose it.Incorrectly diversified portfolio.You\u2019re thinking, \u201cdon\u2019t you mean correctly diversified portfolio?\u201d No, I don\u2019t.I mean exactly the word incorrectly. People who actually make money on the stock market know that there is no money to be made by following indices. An index is not moved because the average of the stocks that make up the index go up. An index goes up because select companies in the index explode, causing those weights of the index to do most of the heavy lifting.We can statistically infer that if the index is moved by select companies, and there are weights associated with those companies, then the entire index lifts because of a 10 to 50-fold increase in the company.If your diversified portfolio captures said company, you enjoy the benefits of that uptick, too.That being said, if you have a portfolio that is accidentally diversified with the right companies, it will naturally make you a lot of money over time. People often end up with money this way if they\u2019ve been regularly adding money to their portfolio after 20 years.These are not people making the infamous \u201c10% per year on the stock market.\u201d These are just people who hit the right companies in the right industries.A portfolio correctly diversified does get you something below average, usually 0\u20133% per year or so. But, you never know, out of thousands of diversified portfolios out there, some have to have really great companies in the mix that beat the odds by massive margins.Invest in brands you love and keep adding.This is where I start to enjoy people getting rich. You, me, and everybody else already use products we love.Whether that is Apple, or some semi-conductor company like AMD or Nvidia, or McDonald\u2019s, or Google.We use these companies everyday. We use the products they make everyday.But instead of putting money into the companies, we just end up buying their products instead.There are a small select group of people who slowly contribute portions of their earnings into the companies, instead. These people have turned the system into a simple one.Often times, the system is quite simple. What makes money today is a good indicator of what will make money tomorrow and the next month and the next year and ten years from now.IBM made money back in the day and makes money now.Google made money then and makes money now.Amazon made money then and makes money now.Apple, AMD, Domino\u2019s, ULTA, Toyota, Microsoft, Facebook, Starbuck\u2019s Micron, Intel.The list goes on.People have gotten rich by sticking to companies they know make good products, and then adding to their equity stake in that company over time.If the company begins to drop? Double down and buy more.If the company starts to go up? Double up and buy more.You\u2019re investing in the idea\u2014wealth is what comes as an earning on that investment.The key here is that persistence and good values trump every other analytical metric.Concentration.Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.This is a stupid phrase.If the point of your endeavor on the market is not for retirement but rather to get rich, then your idea should revolve around putting all your eggs in one basket.In fact, most people get rich on the market precisely because they do put all their eggs in one basket. If you are putting them in multiple baskets, you might not know anything about the other baskets you\u2019re placing eggs in.It\u2019s important to really know a product. To that extent, sticking to your basket is the key to getting rich. I mostly deal with semi-conductors, and I hardly branch out to other industries unless I\u2019m completely confident that my reasoning isn\u2019t conflated with my ego\u2019s ability to cloud my judgement.Here is a good example. When I was in college, I wanted to make money on the side. I knew a good deal about hardware, so I would purchase computer parts and fit them into rigs and then sell them on eBay for about 10\u201315% profit.Somewhere along the way I realized that AMD created products that rivaled Nvidia in the department of graphics processing units. They didn\u2019t beat them, but they were either really competitive with their products or they were way too good of a value proposition for me to pass up. I would be able to make a bit more in my margin by using AMD chips instead of Nvidia and my customers didn\u2019t notice a difference in their performance.In fact, when I was doing this, AMD was trading at about $2\u20133 a share. Today, it is above $35. It\u2019s not a shock to me. It wasn\u2019t then, and it isn\u2019t now. They\u2019ve always made great products. Concentration doesn\u2019t strictly have to deal with industries, either. As I\u2019ll show in the next, and most important point, there is concentration through the measure of data that transcends industry knowledge.You\u2019re not looking for alpha, you\u2019re looking for homoskedasticity.Someone will be looking at data, run some analysis they think is important on data, and then run a simulation based on that analysis that then fails to successfully predict realizable gains on the market.So then, the natural question\u2014why?When most of us look at data, we need to understand all of the information that is given and then all of the meaning associated with that information.However, this is really not possible. What ends up happening is that we perceive to understand far more than we actually do.Which brings me to heteroskedasticity\u2014we don\u2019t want this.Heterskedasticity is defined as the circumstance in which the variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it.In other words, we have some data, and we are trying to make sense of that data. However, there is some unknown variable(s) causing the variability in our original model, making that model imprecise or leading us to believe something we shouldn\u2019t.Simpler, we are trying to explain something we don\u2019t know how to explain. Or, we are explaining something in the wrong way because we are missing something.What we want is homoskedasticity.Homoskedasticity is a condition in which the variance of the residual, or error term, in a regression model is constant.This means that the \u201cvariable\u201d or \u201cvariables\u201d that we have determined to be causing the changing in the price of a company are consistently influencing that change in a constant or near-constant degree.These are sometimes, technically, the unknown-variables we can\u2019t or don\u2019t know how to account for in our models that illustrate heteroskedasticity.The people who know how to do things to this precise of a degree are not financiers. A good example is James Simons, who runs Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund that employees only mathematicians, signal processing experts, physicists, and statisticians.James Simons himself has a mathematics ph.d.Their fund has successfully annualized 70% returns for the last twenty years.They know something beyond the knowledge of industry.They\u2019ve found the tools that work.They\u2019ve found homoskedasticity.They\u2019re probably the richest because of it.James Simons is probably the richest man you\u2019ve never heard of.As of September 2019, his worth is approximately $21.6 billion. Every year, it goes up approximately a billion dollars.",

            "answer_text": "Investing in companies through the stock market is often touted as a way to make real wealth for yourself, and even wealth for your family through generations. But how do people get rich from stocks, especially when the stock market is so volatile? When Apple went public in 1980, the price per share was $22. If you had invested $5,000 and held on to it until August 2018, you would have watched the share price grow to more than 10 times its starting price, to $227.63 per share. But even more important, the stock split 56 times during that time. With $5,000 to invest, you could have bought 227 shares in 1980. By 2018, after Apple had split its stock and changed its business model a few times, you would have 12,712 shares in the company. At $227.63 per share, your initial $5,000 investment would have grown to $2,893,632.56. When it comes to growing your wealth in the stock market, you need to have a working understanding of the stock market itself and be comfortable with long-term investing. Very few people become overnight millionaires off of a lucky stock pick, so don\u2019t count on that happening to you. You can use financial advisor if you need help getting started. Budgeting your income is a powerful tool for your investments. Include your investment contributions in your monthly budget so you can track your investments over time. Look for areas that you can cut back in your spending so you can increase your investment amount. Whatever amount you already contribute to your investments, cutting back on another spending could mean investing even more. There's no shame getting help in organizing your finance. Facet wealth is a financial planning firm that pairs you with a dedicated Certified Financial Planne to manage your investments and savings, among other things. Picking one stock that is going to make you rich is a bit unrealistic. That\u2019s why index fund investing is so popular. When you invest in an index fund you are broadly diversify By investing in many different companies in one fund, your investment in each fund is automatically smaller. This means you earn less from each company. But that way also, should some of the companies turn out to be lemons, you don\u2019t lose as much money. What the Apple example clearly shows is that buying and holding a stock can be enormously beneficial for your finances. \u201cBuy and hold\u201d refers to buying stock shares and holding on to them for the long term, even when the stock market is down. short selling te strategy of buy and hold. People are looking to make money in the market in a shorter time frame, and they do that by \u201cshorting\u201d stocks Here\u2019s the gist: You borrow stocks and sell them at current market prices and receive a cash payment. But since you\u2019ve only borrowed the stocks, you need to replace the stock that you sold. And you are responsible for paying dividends for the length of time that you borrow the stock. When people short sell, they want the stock to drop sharply so they can buy it back at a much cheaper price. This means they can take home the difference. And sometimes the difference is a lot of money, which makes short selling a way you could get rich in the stock market. Contributing to your investments consistently over the years is a great strategy to grow wealth in the stock market. It's one strategy that works for the average American paycheck. Many people don\u2019t have huge amounts of money at any one moment to invest but do have smaller amounts that they can consistently contribute over the years.You can use a calculator like this one to see how different levels of monthly contributions can make a difference in your investment results. And if you\u2019re just getting started, you can use an automated investing service like Betterment For those with a bit more experience, try personal capital It not only lets you keep track of all of your finances in one place, but also has a stellar wealth management service. Thank you \u2026\u2026\u2026.. ",
