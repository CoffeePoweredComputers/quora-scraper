            "answer_text": "I have a few scenarios I built in my head. I\u2019ll start from the stupidest and go to what I think is the smartest. Or at least what I regard as the most respected way to get rich. Buy low, sell high.This is so simple that it pains me to put it on this list. However, we are going from the worst way to the smartest way, so this point has merit to that degree. This method never works. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s used incorrectly, it\u2019s that it neglects key components of one part time and one part emulation.What do I mean?When it comes to buying low, you have to know what low is. Low might look like a 52-week low, but that\u2019s only because you are looking at a company\u2019s forecasts from the standpoint of 52 weeks. Many times, a company stands at a 52 week low, but they\u2019re about to drop even harder because of setbacks that they haven\u2019t recovered from or because competitors are about to eat the rest of their worth.For example, you could have looked at BlockBuster at 2005 trading at $10 a share. You would have seen that its 52-week high was around $30 a share, and thought it was a steal. They would have also recently declined to purchase a newer company called Netflix at the time\u2014a company that was nearly worthless trading at only a few dollars a share.Except, BlockBuster today is completely worthless, and Netflix is trading at $400.In other words, looking at BlockBuster\u2019s history gives you nothing valuable about where it\u2019s headed in the future. The time aspect doesn\u2019t tell you much. To that degree, you also can\u2019t emulate a predictable future with the information, either.People have the element of luck on their side. Large trades can be made in the options world with relatively little capital. One trade can turn someone into a millionaire. You just need a little bit of dumb luck and a belief that your belief is different from everyone else\u2019s.You can hit the lottery, too. It happens, after all.Dunning-kruger miracle.You buy some amount, say $50,000 of a particular stock you think will blow up for a reason you strongly believe. Your reasoning is wrong, because you know nothing about the industry and nothing about the thousand competitors. Your luck hits you something to the effect of a jackpot, and the company turns an incredible profit and miraculously gobbles up its competitors. The stock increases 100-fold, and your account now holds $5,000,000.Dunning-kruger hurts almost everyone. It is an incorrect assessment of your actual ability with your perceived ability. For a small amount of people, they end up with the correct result for the wrong reasons.This (almost) takes the cake for the dumbest way to get rich off of stocks.Your parents teach you about dividends\u2014they\u2019re also rich.Your parents teach you small things about how public companies operate. They teach you that you can earn a dividend if you hold stock in certain companies. You inherit $2,000,000 and it\u2019s all invested in something like IEP\u2014Carl Icahn\u2019s fund.This fund yields a dividend of about 11%. You\u2019ll make a nice $200,000 off the dividends, before tax, before you have to eat into the principal. If you are not a complete moron, you\u2019ll have enough money for the rest of your life.It takes no genius to understand that capital begets capital. If you have a bunch of money, you can simply buy up things that other people can\u2019t so you can reap the benefits of passive wealth from it.If you have that capital to begin with, you\u2019re really going to have to put in a good effort in order to lose it.Incorrectly diversified portfolio.You\u2019re thinking, \u201cdon\u2019t you mean correctly diversified portfolio?\u201d No, I don\u2019t.I mean exactly the word incorrectly. People who actually make money on the stock market know that there is no money to be made by following indices. An index is not moved because the average of the stocks that make up the index go up. An index goes up because select companies in the index explode, causing those weights of the index to do most of the heavy lifting.We can statistically infer that if the index is moved by select companies, and there are weights associated with those companies, then the entire index lifts because of a 10 to 50-fold increase in the company.If your diversified portfolio captures said company, you enjoy the benefits of that uptick, too.That being said, if you have a portfolio that is accidentally diversified with the right companies, it will naturally make you a lot of money over time. People often end up with money this way if they\u2019ve been regularly adding money to their portfolio after 20 years.These are not people making the infamous \u201c10% per year on the stock market.\u201d These are just people who hit the right companies in the right industries.A portfolio correctly diversified does get you something below average, usually 0\u20133% per year or so. But, you never know, out of thousands of diversified portfolios out there, some have to have really great companies in the mix that beat the odds by massive margins.Invest in brands you love and keep adding.This is where I start to enjoy people getting rich. You, me, and everybody else already use products we love.Whether that is Apple, or some semi-conductor company like AMD or Nvidia, or McDonald\u2019s, or Google.We use these companies everyday. We use the products they make everyday.But instead of putting money into the companies, we just end up buying their products instead.There are a small select group of people who slowly contribute portions of their earnings into the companies, instead. These people have turned the system into a simple one.Often times, the system is quite simple. What makes money today is a good indicator of what will make money tomorrow and the next month and the next year and ten years from now.IBM made money back in the day and makes money now.Google made money then and makes money now.Amazon made money then and makes money now.Apple, AMD, Domino\u2019s, ULTA, Toyota, Microsoft, Facebook, Starbuck\u2019s Micron, Intel.The list goes on.People have gotten rich by sticking to companies they know make good products, and then adding to their equity stake in that company over time.If the company begins to drop? Double down and buy more.If the company starts to go up? Double up and buy more.You\u2019re investing in the idea\u2014wealth is what comes as an earning on that investment.The key here is that persistence and good values trump every other analytical metric.Concentration.Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.This is a stupid phrase.If the point of your endeavor on the market is not for retirement but rather to get rich, then your idea should revolve around putting all your eggs in one basket.In fact, most people get rich on the market precisely because they do put all their eggs in one basket. If you are putting them in multiple baskets, you might not know anything about the other baskets you\u2019re placing eggs in.It\u2019s important to really know a product. To that extent, sticking to your basket is the key to getting rich. I mostly deal with semi-conductors, and I hardly branch out to other industries unless I\u2019m completely confident that my reasoning isn\u2019t conflated with my ego\u2019s ability to cloud my judgement.Here is a good example. When I was in college, I wanted to make money on the side. I knew a good deal about hardware, so I would purchase computer parts and fit them into rigs and then sell them on eBay for about 10\u201315% profit.Somewhere along the way I realized that AMD created products that rivaled Nvidia in the department of graphics processing units. They didn\u2019t beat them, but they were either really competitive with their products or they were way too good of a value proposition for me to pass up. I would be able to make a bit more in my margin by using AMD chips instead of Nvidia and my customers didn\u2019t notice a difference in their performance.In fact, when I was doing this, AMD was trading at about $2\u20133 a share. Today, it is above $35. It\u2019s not a shock to me. It wasn\u2019t then, and it isn\u2019t now. They\u2019ve always made great products. Concentration doesn\u2019t strictly have to deal with industries, either. As I\u2019ll show in the next, and most important point, there is concentration through the measure of data that transcends industry knowledge.You\u2019re not looking for alpha, you\u2019re looking for homoskedasticity.Someone will be looking at data, run some analysis they think is important on data, and then run a simulation based on that analysis that then fails to successfully predict realizable gains on the market.So then, the natural question\u2014why?When most of us look at data, we need to understand all of the information that is given and then all of the meaning associated with that information.However, this is really not possible. What ends up happening is that we perceive to understand far more than we actually do.Which brings me to heteroskedasticity\u2014we don\u2019t want this.Heterskedasticity is defined as the circumstance in which the variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it.In other words, we have some data, and we are trying to make sense of that data. However, there is some unknown variable(s) causing the variability in our original model, making that model imprecise or leading us to believe something we shouldn\u2019t.Simpler, we are trying to explain something we don\u2019t know how to explain. Or, we are explaining something in the wrong way because we are missing something.What we want is homoskedasticity.Homoskedasticity is a condition in which the variance of the residual, or error term, in a regression model is constant.This means that the \u201cvariable\u201d or \u201cvariables\u201d that we have determined to be causing the changing in the price of a company are consistently influencing that change in a constant or near-constant degree.These are sometimes, technically, the unknown-variables we can\u2019t or don\u2019t know how to account for in our models that illustrate heteroskedasticity.The people who know how to do things to this precise of a degree are not financiers. A good example is James Simons, who runs Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund that employees only mathematicians, signal processing experts, physicists, and statisticians.James Simons himself has a mathematics ph.d.Their fund has successfully annualized 70% returns for the last twenty years.They know something beyond the knowledge of industry.They\u2019ve found the tools that work.They\u2019ve found homoskedasticity.They\u2019re probably the richest because of it.James Simons is probably the richest man you\u2019ve never heard of.As of September 2019, his worth is approximately $21.6 billion. Every year, it goes up approximately a billion dollars.",

            "answer_text": "Investing in companies through the stock market is often touted as a way to make real wealth for yourself, and even wealth for your family through generations. But how do people get rich from stocks, especially when the stock market is so volatile? When Apple went public in 1980, the price per share was $22. If you had invested $5,000 and held on to it until August 2018, you would have watched the share price grow to more than 10 times its starting price, to $227.63 per share. But even more important, the stock split 56 times during that time. With $5,000 to invest, you could have bought 227 shares in 1980. By 2018, after Apple had split its stock and changed its business model a few times, you would have 12,712 shares in the company. At $227.63 per share, your initial $5,000 investment would have grown to $2,893,632.56. When it comes to growing your wealth in the stock market, you need to have a working understanding of the stock market itself and be comfortable with long-term investing. Very few people become overnight millionaires off of a lucky stock pick, so don\u2019t count on that happening to you. You can use financial advisor if you need help getting started. Budgeting your income is a powerful tool for your investments. Include your investment contributions in your monthly budget so you can track your investments over time. Look for areas that you can cut back in your spending so you can increase your investment amount. Whatever amount you already contribute to your investments, cutting back on another spending could mean investing even more. There's no shame getting help in organizing your finance. Facet wealth is a financial planning firm that pairs you with a dedicated Certified Financial Planne to manage your investments and savings, among other things. Picking one stock that is going to make you rich is a bit unrealistic. That\u2019s why index fund investing is so popular. When you invest in an index fund you are broadly diversify By investing in many different companies in one fund, your investment in each fund is automatically smaller. This means you earn less from each company. But that way also, should some of the companies turn out to be lemons, you don\u2019t lose as much money. What the Apple example clearly shows is that buying and holding a stock can be enormously beneficial for your finances. \u201cBuy and hold\u201d refers to buying stock shares and holding on to them for the long term, even when the stock market is down. short selling te strategy of buy and hold. People are looking to make money in the market in a shorter time frame, and they do that by \u201cshorting\u201d stocks Here\u2019s the gist: You borrow stocks and sell them at current market prices and receive a cash payment. But since you\u2019ve only borrowed the stocks, you need to replace the stock that you sold. And you are responsible for paying dividends for the length of time that you borrow the stock. When people short sell, they want the stock to drop sharply so they can buy it back at a much cheaper price. This means they can take home the difference. And sometimes the difference is a lot of money, which makes short selling a way you could get rich in the stock market. Contributing to your investments consistently over the years is a great strategy to grow wealth in the stock market. It's one strategy that works for the average American paycheck. Many people don\u2019t have huge amounts of money at any one moment to invest but do have smaller amounts that they can consistently contribute over the years.You can use a calculator like this one to see how different levels of monthly contributions can make a difference in your investment results. And if you\u2019re just getting started, you can use an automated investing service like Betterment For those with a bit more experience, try personal capital It not only lets you keep track of all of your finances in one place, but also has a stellar wealth management service.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know that I would word it that way but many people become very financially secure by investing in the stock market and yes, some do become rich.  Personally I think it is better not to think about becoming rich in the stock market.  Too many think the stock market is a path to quick and easy riches and do things that are more akin to gambling than to investing.  I am talking about things like day trading, short term trading, forex, bitcoin and the like and most all of those are going to lose their money.  For example only 1% of day traders make any real money and 95% lose all their money in 6 months or at least all they are willing to lose. One of the nice things about investing (note I said investing not trading) is that it is a win-win situation.  No one has to lose money.  If someone is investing wisely in companies that are well run and in a sustainable growing business the value of the stock will go up as the company and the US economy grows.  Everyone who buys and holds shares in the company can have a profit. Most people make money investing in stocks but there will be people who lose money investing in stocks.  Usually it is one of two things.  Those two things are greed and fear.  People who get greedy and invest in over inflated momentum stocks can lose when those stocks come back to Earth.  Those who panic in a downturn and sell for fear that they will lose more than they have already can lose money. As an example of people panicking when stocks crashed in 2008 many who had bought at market highs panicked and sold.  I made some good money because of the crash in 2008.  The value of my portfolio dropped by 50% however I didn\u2019t sell my stocks.  Instead I bought a number of stocks right at the market bottom and those stocks now average a 600\u2013800% increase.  I also bought more stocks as the market increased in price. For someone starting at investing I would recommend going with at ETF that tracks something like the S&P 500 and over time starting to pick individual stocks if they are comfortable with that.  It really isn\u2019t hard to pick good stocks but not everyone is comfortable with that.  Over time it would be good to diversify with a few other ETF\u2019s such as one tracking small cap stocks, one with mid cap, one tracking emerging markets but with the first one being the key one. I have been in the stock market longer than many reading this have been alive.  One of the big things people talked about when I first started investing was when and if the DJIA would ever break 1000 which some thought might never happen.  Now it is about 30 times higher than it was when I started.  That means for every $ 1000.00 I would have invested in the DJ average stock it would not be worth 30 grand plus anyone buying then would have collected a ton of dividends. Investing in stocks can be a great path to financial security. ",

            "answer_text": " The most effective method to Make Money in Stocks in 2020 Purchasing stocks during a pandemic is not really not the same as purchasing stocks at different occasions. Follow these straightforward stunts to begin bringing in cash in stocks today. In case you're investigating putting resources into stocks at the present time, you're presumably considering how you can best put resources into stocks during a pandemic. This is what may astound you: The stocks to purchase during Covid aren't generally that unique in relation to the stocks you should purchase regularly. Be that as it may, how about we return to the rudiments for a second. Putting resources into stocks is one of the most significant money related aptitudes you have to ace. All things considered, stocks have given an annualized return of around 10%. At that rate, your cash pairs each 7.2 years. Suppose you start with $10,000. Following a long term profession, that diverts into at any rate $320K from multiplying multiple times. That is from a solitary $10,000 speculation. I will level with you. You can't get rich off only your compensation. Investment funds and securities won't do it either; the return isn't sufficiently high to have an effect during your lifetime. Stocks are the key. Regardless of your salary, you will get rich off stocks as long as you begin contributing early, continue contributing, and never sell. Anybody can do this. You don't should be a money related wiz, have insider access, or a huge amount of time. I put in a couple of hours out of every YEAR dealing with my portfolio. Time and steady commitments will make you a tycoon. That is the reason I have incorporated elite of simple things you can begin doing from today to bring in cash in stocks. We should get directly into it. Instructions to Make Money on Stocks at a Glance: The securities exchange isn't hot The snappier you understand that the securities exchange isn't provocative, the quicker you will begin bringing in cash from it. For 99.9% of individuals, putting resources into stocks is nothing similar to what you found in The Wolf of Wall Street. It's likewise not tuning in to the purported \"budgetary specialists\" on news channels and purchasing their most blazing supplies of the period. The entirety of that is commotion. It won't assist you with bringing in cash in stocks. Fruitful financial exchange contributing is tied in with being understanding and remaining in the market for a long time. Which carries me to\u2026 ? Stay put resources into the financial exchange It's exceptionally simple to frenzy and sell stocks at whatever point there's a major drop in the financial exchange. In any case, selling your stocks at the smallest fall or when they are down could be the most noticeably terrible budgetary choice you can make. At the point when the business sectors fall, everybody is discussing the following downturn or how things are just going to deteriorate. I get it. Downtrends are unnerving. Yet, recall that they show up more regrettable than they really are a result of the amount they are talked about and broke down. At the point when you are terrifying, most importantly, take a full breath. Since 1900, we've seen some genuine calamities there have been numerous purposes behind the market to fall and not raise: \u2022 The Great Depression \u2022 World War 1 and World War 2 \u2022 Cold War \u2022 9/11 Terror Attacks \u2022 Asian Financial Crisis \u2022 Dot-com Bubble \u2022 The 2008 Recession Through this, markets have kept on developing at about 10% every year. Here's another captivating detail that I love. In the months following a 10% drop since 1900, this is how much the business sectors have ascended in the short term on a normal: \u2022 1 Month: - 0.1% \u2022 3 Months: 7.5% \u2022 6 Months: 11.1% \u2022 12 Months: 14.6%  What does this let you know? The securities exchange has ALWAYS gone up each time it has fallen. In this way, don't freeze when it goes down. Trust how stock costs have consistently acted. Truth be told, when they fall, attempt to purchase more stocks. Quit timing the market My gracious my, I have found out about individuals attempting to time the financial exchange so often. \u2022 \"I'm simply sitting tight for the following dunk before purchasing in.\" \u2022 \"I wouldn't contribute right now on the grounds that the financial exchange is excessively costly.\" \u2022 \"I sold my stocks in light of the fact that the business sectors made an unsurpassed high.\" Everybody is attempting to purchase low and sell high. Indeed, even Financial guides are continually attempting to time the market. Having the option to reliably recognize highs and lows is a troublesome ability. Indeed, even the individuals who have burned through for their entire lives attempting to ace it are not effective at it. It's difficult to do reliably. Think about what the most probable result is the point at which the securities exchange hits another high? More highs! By pausing, you pass up more gains. Same thing happens when times are terrible. The greatest increases come after the greatest drops. In the event that you attempt to trust that the market will be \"all-reasonable,\" you'll pass up them. Furthermore, you won't go anyplace near that 10% yearly return. Here's something that not many individuals think about the securities exchange. An examination in 2020 delivered discoveries that will take your breath away. It found that in the event that you were not put resources into the market for the 10 greatest days of the financial exchange somewhere in the range of 2004 and 2019, your profits would have dropped by an amazing sum. For instance, here's the manner by which a $10,000 venture would have developed in that period in the event that you had: \u2022 Stayed contributed throughout the days: $36,418 at 9% annualized return \u2022 Missed the 10 greatest days: $18,359 at 4.15% annualized return \u2022 Missed the 20 greatest days: $11,908 at 1.17% annualized return \u2022 Missed the 30 greatest days: $8,150 at - 1.35% annualized return \u2022 Missed the 40 greatest days: $5,847 at - 3.51% annualized return Missing only the 10 greatest days cuts your profits by the greater part. On the off chance that you missed the best 20, you are just about equaling the initial investment (actually, you are losing cash as a result of swelling). Attempting to time the market can be DEVASTATING. Disregard the news and contribute each month predictably. That is the way you get the most cash-flow. The most ideal approach to bring in cash in stocks. File supports put their cash in lists like the S&P 500 or the Russel 1000. File finances are latent; their reserve chiefs don't continue purchasing and offering stocks to \"beat the market\". Indeed, their goal is to be the market. A great deal of exploration has indicated that dynamic store directors bomb wretchedly while attempting to beat the market. Truth be told, over 90% of effectively oversaw reserves neglect to beat the list. So the list subsidize approach winds up acquiring a superior return. They likewise have less danger since you're presented to the whole market. In the event that some irregular organization collapses and the stock goes to $0, it doesn't make a difference. They're likewise much simpler to run, so the charges are lower. The charges are lower too since the store supervisors aren't accepting and selling constantly. File reserves truly are a free lunch: \u2022 Lowest costs \u2022 Better returns \u2022 Lower charges \u2022 No exertion \u2022 Less danger You can likewise enhance effectively through record reserves. Ordinarily, they help in enhancement, however you can go above and beyond.  Instructions to pick singular stocks I comprehend you will have the tingle to purchase singular stocks. Be that as it may, I won't gloss over it. Purchasing stocks is severely hard. The chances of effectively picking singular stocks are exceptionally low. From 1926 to 2015, there have been 25,782 particular stocks. During these 90 years, the financial exchange brought $32 Trillion up in esteem. Half of the increases originated from JUST the best 86 organizations. 86 out of 25,728! The rest of the riches was produced by the best 1000 stocks. That is just 4% of the apparent multitude of organizations. The chances of progress by purchasing singular stocks are exceptionally thin. Just 4%. That is the reason I suggest utilizing just the staying 10% of your venture cash-flow to purchase singular stocks. I pick a couple of stocks myself however I keep it well beneath 10%. I get the chance to scratch the stock-picking tingle, eat a lot of humble pie, and afterward return to my day. Mess around with 10% of your portfolio, simply don't go past that. Keep the other 90% truly exhausting. You'll get much more cash-flow. Progressed Tip: If you're truly savvy, rather than putting resources into singular stocks that have a low possibility of being fruitful, you could utilize that staying 10% to put resources into yourself. You may see much more noteworthy returns when you put resources into your vocation or a business. In addition when you put resources into yourself, your benefits aren't topped at 10-15%. Rather, you could gain 1,000% or more. Computerize your ventures I'm a colossal enthusiast of computerizing speculations. Go into your venture records and set a particular add up to get moved consequently consistently Mechanizing accomplishes three purposes. To begin with, you are doing whatever it takes not to time the market. Contributing every month permits you to average out the increases and misfortunes. It additionally makes for smoother returns. At the point when you contribute every month, if the market is high, your portfolio actually develops. On the off chance that the market is low, you are purchasing stocks at a relatively lower value which will inevitably go up. Second, you remember to really contribute. By setting up programmed speculations, you are really grasping the \"set it and overlook it\" technique. You're not depending on yourself to contribute. We as a whole neglect to get things done. With contributing, neglecting to contribute will deny you of a bigger number of profits than any downturn will. Try not to depend on resolve or your memory, get it computerized so you never need to stress over it again. Third, you can spend openly on the rest. By setting up a programmed move to trigger just after you get paid, it never feels like you had the cash in any case. Set up moves for your speculations and reserve funds, saved enough cash for significant bills like lease or a home loan, at that point spend the rest unreservedly until one month from now. You've accomplished the difficult work of dealing with your future by setting up the programmed venture, presently go have a ball by carrying on with your rich life. Programmed speculations permit you to appreciate the present while making sure about your future. You can have everything.   Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "Let's do a thought experiment. 1.) If I buy $5,000 of stock from a company at a price of $10 per share then I will have 500 shares of a stock. 2.) Let's say in 1 year the stock price rises from $10 per share to $200 per share. 3.) My total investment was $5,000 and my shares are now worth $100,000, which means I made a return of $95,000 in 1 year.  This experiment might sound undoable, but it really isn't. If I invested in Amazon, Google, Facebook, or Apple at their IPO price, I would of quickly made a similar return to $95,000.  Let's do Facebook as a recent example. 1.) If I would've bought $5,000 of Facebook stock at it\u2019s initial IPO price of $27.17 per share I would have 184.026 shares of stock. 2.) Facebook stock has risen to a current price (May 24, 2017) of $148.46 so my 184.026 shares are now worth $27,240. 3.) My total return, at this date, would be $22,240.79 in net returns from investing in Facebook at its IPO.  As you can tell, $22,240 is sort of a living wage, and if anything, it's a healthy side-hustle that requires just a little industry intelligence.  Here\u2019s some tips on how you should invest that are common sense, but not conventional. 1.) Do not day-trade because as the example above shows, day trading minimizes your returns. Buy once. And then sit. Always make 1\u20132 year bets. Write an investment thesis. Do research. Put a large sum of money in. Wait to see if you were right. 2.) Do not diversify your portfolio. If you're not a quant trader, and using a highly technical machine learning algorithm, then do not diversify. Diversification assumes you know statistics and can hedge risk. You can't. You will fail at this. Instead, the principle of the average investor is this: I don't need to make a lot of trades I just to make the right one. So don't invest in a lot of companies. Just invest in 2\u20134 per year. 3.) Do not listen to the experts. The so-called stock experts will mislead. 4.) Be ready to lose the money. If you win you could make a lot of money. If you lose you could lose a lot of money. Compound interest works both ways. Passive investing, dollar cost averaging, index funds, and ETF\u2019s all exist to make you win or lose slowly. Active stock buying is for winning big or losing big.

            "answer_text": "I became a broker for a discount brokerage firm in 1992. There i met a man from Taiwan who would buy various stocks throughout the years. He would sell only a few shares of rare losers each December for year end tax loss selling. we became friendly and one day we met at a fancy shopping mall and had coffee in a cafe outside Nordstrom. I asked him how he had accumulated so much wealth investing in stocks, to which he made a comment that took me a few years to understand - or believe. He told me \u201cinvesting in stocks is the safest investment of them all\u201d. He explained the growing earnings of great companies would fuel a stock\u2019s price indefinitely and provide a growing stream of income (and protect against inflation, etc.) Then, he took out a pen and drew on a Nordstroms napkin. He drew a bell curve with two lines separating the tails at both ends.  He told me just continue to buy quality stocks and never sell. Over time MOST stocks will perform just as the market does - these are the AVERAGE stocks, and will be the great majority of your holdings - and will provide excellent long term returns. He went on to say a portion of your stock holdings will fail miserably with some going to zero - these are the LOSERS. The last group of stock holdings will continue higher and never stop. These WINNERS will far outgain all the average stocks and losers and provide never ending wealth accumulation. i am 48 years old today and have watched his portfolio grow to well over $100 million. It is a thing of beauty. And yes, he took a massive TEMPORARY hit in 2000 and 2009, but his portfolio was constructed with pure quality and has roared back. In many of his positions, the annual dividends earned are greater than his original investment. He is a humble man with a great sense of humor. He once told me his greatest investment would be if he could invent x-ray glasses for men to see through women\u2019s clothing - and then to sell clothes for women to prevent those glasses from working.

            "answer_text": "Yes of course you can. Why not.We see so many YouTube channels and bloggers ensuring you to use their strategy to realise maximum gains. See,the first thing you need to understand is there is shitload amount of crap on this topic.Every guy who hasn't even traded for a significant amount of time has some trading strategy up his sleeves. I would highly suggest you don't buy into that bullshit. If you want to get rich quick,stock trading is the best place to lose money twice the pace you anticipated to earn money at. I won't tell you what strategies to use or what to trade I only want to tell you that you should build a system that works for you.Every one has their own strategy working for them.It may sound clich\u00e9 but fact is a fact. You can definitely become rich.no doubt about that.But to reach that level you will have to become John wick. A man of focus,commitment and sheer fuc*ing will. Focus on every move you make in the market.Observe where you make money and where you lose.You need to keep and eye on what triggers the market to move in a particular direction.observe how does a stock or an index behaves once it reaches a certain level.Keep an eye on how news affects the stock and how does it behave when it's peers in the same industry go in either direction and much more. Commitment is a HUGE deal in becoming a great stock trader.If you want to earn a living through stock trading then this is the most important part you can take from this answer.Commit to learning every fuc*ing day regardless of the market being open or close. If the market opens at 9, be ready by 7 on your computer.You must have a daily fixed routine.After the market closes,have a look at your trades.where you got wrong and where you got right. THIS IS THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BEGINNER AND AN EXPERT.Average remains average because once they start realising profits, they think they have learnt everything there is to learn.You can never learn the market fully.You must remain commited to learning everyday.Apply the principle of compounding to improve your knowledge. Willpower is something that many people lack. As you might have heard trading is 30% knowledge, 20% opportunity and 50% psychology.Most poeple(90%) screw up the 3rd part. \u201cHave the will to walk away if there are no trades for you that day.\u201d It's not mandatory to trade every single day.And also have the will to cut your losses quickly rather that HOPE the stock goes up at some point in time any you will recover then.That\u2019s bullshit strategy. It really depends on how strong your will is so that you resist being greedy or fearful.Have the willpower to not trade on days when you feel overwhelmed or experiencing mental fatigue.Never ever hold grudge against market if you lose and don't argue with it. It will fu*k without unzipping it's pants in a matter of minutes. My favourite book on stock trading, Reminiscences of a stock operator has a beautiful quote: Fear and hope remain the same; therefore the study of the psychology of speculators is as valuable as it ever was. Weapons change, but strategy remains strategy, on the New York Stock Exchange as on the battlefield. I think the clearest summing up of the whole thing was expressed by Thomas F. Woodlock when he declared: \"The principles of successful stock speculation are on the supposition that people will continue in the future to make the mistakes that they have made in the past\u201d. And lastly, research yourself and take everyone advice with a grain of salt including mine. Hope it was helpful\ud83d\ude0a ",

            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s understand who can be benefited from the stock market. 1.Owners Steve job/Mark Zuckerberg /Zack ma/ Narayana Murthy had never intended to earn million from stock market, but they have earned a lot. They focus on creating a valuable business. stock earning is just by product for them.( So, try to Create valuable business which can lead you great value unlocking via shares issunce to public in coming years) This a very ironic who don't aim to create the wealth from stock, actually end up creating massive wealth in stock as founder of their companies. 2. Investor Warren Buffet/ Rakesh junjunwala are belonged to this category. What is Their thought process-I don't have any skill to create business, nor do I have technical expertise to build the the product. But yea, I can know the product is good & it sells like hot cake, let me be a partner in this companies. They buys shares( be partner) and enjoy massive wealth creation along with founders. They focus on the product, the growth of the business, founder/management & most important is valuation at which company is being traded. They buy a GREAT business at a good price. They stay there as long as above criteria for selection is fulfilled.What benefit them is POWER OF COMPOUNDING, in trading terms we call it \u201c seating periods\u201d.Let money work for you to create more money is their motto.( if you want to be invested, make sure you buy great business at good price & hold it until future prospect is bright enough) 3. Hell yes, that's me -TRADER George Soros/ Paul Tudor Jones / Ashwini Gujral to name few. These people make KILLING in both up and down market. They required very special and different kind of skills. They study charts, sentiments of crowd, trade on leverage to get most out of their bet. ( you must be thinking, yes.. That's me, I can do all that that soros/jones did/do.) But hang on, let me tell you statistic only 5% is successful, rest 95% Goes broke. Bottom line: to earn from stocks are 1.Create great business 2.Second,Be a partner in great business 3. Last but not least,Be in top 5% trader list ",

Congratulations for not being caught in this deep decline. This is a Great Bear Market. It is not going to end in a few days or weeks. The typical time frame for a Bear is 1.2 -2 years. The typical duration of a pandemic from start to end is 1\u20132 years. There is a correlation between economic strife, bear markets, and epidemics and pandemics. History and stock charts show that correlation. So wait for the bear to end.

Was this a good or bad move?\u201d S&p 500 return since- 19.15% Posted on Quora 3\u201329\u20132020 \u201cSo, to be less long-winded, I believe people will be more willing to buy at prices that are closer to the asking prices when other people who are selling are totally convinced there is never going to be a bottom to the market\u2014in other words, capitulation, giving up the Get Rich Quicker idea and even giving up the Get Rich Slowly idea. That will happen, in my view, at a Dow around 14000 or an SPX around 1800. It will be preceded and followed by a wave of corporate bankruptcies/bailouts/bond defaults.

            "answer_text": "Investing in Share Market - 6 Basic Rules for Beginners The stock market has fascinated people for over a century now. Stocks are even seen by many as the quickest way to get rich. However, there are indeed very few investors who see the stock market and stocks in the right perspective. To most, these are just tickers of prices going up and down. If your ticker goes up, you make money. If it goes down, you lose. That's both the start and the end of the story. But the thoughtful investor is more discerning than that. He looks at stocks not just as quotes going up and down, but as real, live businesses in action. Go one step further and one realize that stocks can be one of the most fabulous asset classes to invest in. They are a vehicle and mechanism that provides ordinary individual investors with some amazing advantages and opportunities. Advantages that are unparalleled by any other asset class.  Are stocks the easiest way to build wealth? Here are six reasons why, if you've not invested in stocks yet, you will definitely want to start this year: Opportunity to own an existing business: When you buy a stock, you get to buy a stake in an already existing business with the huge advantage that business already has all its employees and infrastructure in place, and is already up and running. You straightaway get a claim on the businesses future profits (in your proportion of ownership) without any of the headache or effort involved in running it.Liquidity: Buying stocks, you instantly rid yourself of all the above problems. You can instantly buy and sell your stake in the business with a single phone call or a few clicks of your mouse.An astounding number of choice: You can buy only if you really like something. It would be a truism to say that you will try to find the most profitable business being sold at the cheapest price. But the point is that the stock market puts you in a position where it enables you to make such a choice.Little money required: Think about this. Even if you plan to start a small grocery store in your neighborhood, you will have to stake a substantial amount of money on the success of just one venture that may or may not take off as planned. Compare this to buying a stake in a business in the stock market. You can get a piece of the action with even just a few hundred rupees, let alone lakhs and crores.No hassles of negotiations and brokerage: With stocks, the price is right there for you to see. No hassles of negotiating with the opposite party. The brokerage is usually pretty low too (usually a maximum of 0.5%). This helps ensure that a substantial part of your investment is not eaten up by frictional costs.The prospect of a higher return: One thing at the very core of choosing to run a business instead of investing your money in a bank fixed deposits the expectation of higher returns on your investment. Thus, businesses usually strive to earn returns much higher than your run-of-the- mill investments. The trick is to buy a stock that has shown that it can accomplish the above with reasonable certainty, and to buy it at a good price.",

But it\u2019s important to understand what we mean by \u201cmany.\u201d In absolute terms, which is to say the in terms of the value of the stock market if measured over an extended period time, investing in stocks does make people \u201cricher.\u201d But in relative terms, which is to say how individual players rank relative to each other in terms of their comparative returns, then people tend to underperform the market benchmark in the longer run. This is known as the random walk, whereby it is very difficult for any individual to outperform the market over an extended period of time, due to the complex randomness of stock behaviors. One way to deal with the randomness of stock markets is to simply purchase an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) that basically replicates the market return. In doing so, an individual\u2019s return will always be the same (or very nearly the same) in any condition. This means, however, that in a downturn, the ETF will also fall by just as much as the overall market, which may not make an investor \u201cricher\u201d in any sense. Another way is to continually pick winners. There are a few companies that have built a reputation such as Blackrock, for consistent outperformance. Berkshire Hathaway is another one which uses Warren Buffet and his mentees\u2019 acumen to continually invest in promising companies. Then firms such as 990 capital pool the money of high net worth (HNW) individuals to invest in specific mandates with the aim of outperforming through deep analysis. Many other names have become legendary, but as a whole, stock market investors do underperform the market due to its random walk nature. So people do become richer on an absolute basis, but consistently superior relative performance, the true acumen of a good investor, is a very rare commodity. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends what you mean by rich. But if you mean saving up at least 1 million dollars in investments then the normal way to get their is through buy and hold investing. Create a portfolio of stocks and constantly poor money into it for decades. Never sell it. In 20 to 30 years you will be wealthy. The proven way to ensure you get better than average market returns over a lifetime is to buy and hold the market. Refer to any book by John Bogle. Founder of Vanguard and the index fund. Can you get rich by trading and stock picking? Yes, but for 99% of us you are just playing the lottery. You have as a good a chance at picking winners as losers. Unless you are insider trading. You can also build your own diversified portfolio, but odds are the best mix of stocks will be very similar to a major index fund. Do not attempt to buy low and sell high, this is meaningless advice. This is called timing the market. And at any given time you can\u2019t tell if the market is high or low. Why? Because no one knows what will happen tomorrow. Again unless you are inside trading. Or you are the next Warren Buffet. Every month or every year. Takes as much of your savings as you can afford to not touch. And invest it into a well balanced portfolio. Then forget it exists. Down sell when the market crashes. Maybe by try to buy a but more if it is sinking like a rock. But never sell. There will be bad years and good years. Some years you will end up buying low, and in some you will buy high. Because you are just investing at a steady unchanging pace. Eventually over decades the good years will out weigh the bad and you will have built a large sum of money. A typical long term horizon for investing is at least 20-30 years. But the longer the better. Most of us aren't as rich as we could be because we simply don't start seriously investing young enough. If I were a kid again. With my first job at 16 I would open a Roth IRA and put every cent I could into it. Why? Its tax free growth. And you can always pull your initial investment from it without penalty. And 16 year olds pay next to nothing in taxes. And starting at the early age of 16, you will have already been investing for 20-30 years before even hitting 50. In that fund I would invest in 100% equities and simply buy something like 70% us total stock index, and 30% global stock index. Portfolio diversity is always kind of up to you. Make it as complicated as you like. But keep fees low. Don't get too enamoured with blue chip stocks like Apple and Amazon. We would all be rich if you had the foresight to heavily invest in them decades ago. But the reality is companies like Apples best growth years could be over. And you cant tell me who the next apple will be. That is why people diversify and buy a bit of everything. You hedge with the biggest blue chip companies but you also invest in small cap up and coming companies because these are your growth engines. Over a 30 year horizon broad market index investing outperforms something like 90% of all other diversified portfolios? Will you pick stocks perfectly and be in the 10%? Why chance it, when you only get one shot. If you go 40+ years it's even better. If you do feel the need to gamble and attempt to go after some individual stocks. Do it with a small portion of your investment nest egg. Maybe 10% at most. If you max out all tax advantage accounts like Roth IRAs, IRAs or 401Ks. Then you can invest the remainder in a post tax investment account. ",

            "answer_text": "When it comes to investing in the stock market, it\u2019s not so much about how much money you make, but rather how much risk you took to make the money you made. That being said, there\u2019s a common misconception that you have to take huge risks in order to make a lot of money in the stock market. But truth is, great investors always take the least amount of risk for the biggest potential upside possible. This is called asymmetry.  Take deep value hedge fund manager Chris MacIntosh for example\u2026 He was able to 10x his capital during the last uranium bull market. He did this by never risking more than $0.10 to make a dollar, meaning he can be wrong 90% of the time and still make money. Reality is, great investors know they will be wrong on a lot of their investments, so they always position themselves so they can be wrong the majority of the time and still make money. Now, what do great investors like Chris actually invest in to get rich? They make asymmetric bets while taking advantage of the market cycle\u2026  As you can see above, anyone can get rich from the stock market simply by front-running institutional capital. When a big fund like Fidelity or Goldman decides to invest in a sector, they are usually 10% of the buy volume every day for 6 months on the way up. And as a few large funds get positioned, herd mentality will take place and more funds will pile in, pushing the price higher and higher. So if you can invest in one of these sectors in the \u201cSmart Money Phase,\u201d your chances of making generational wealth is very high. Now, as funds pile in and everyone starts talking about it, this is when herd behavior takes place for retail investors. Because of this, investment bankers try to make money not by investing their own capital, but by packaging ETFs for retail investors who have FOMO (fear of missing out). This is typically the last capital that enters during a bull market, as well as when the assets are most overpriced/riskiest and upside most limited. This is why retail investors often don\u2019t make life-changing returns. Because they always get involved too late during the cycle. However, front-running institutional capital is really easier said than done because when you invest in these kinds of sectors so early, you will naturally be betting against the consensus, meaning you will feel very uncomfortable/lonely, and often doubt your decision to get involved. This is THE trade-off for making life-changing returns. I mean, if it were easy, then everyone would be rich from the stock market. And to complicate the matter, there will always be sectors that will never get attention from big funds, so it helps to invest alongside someone who\u2019s had years of experience in front-running institutional capital. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about how you can front-run institutional capital with asymmetric investment ideas targeting 5\u201310x+ returns, I highly recommend Chris MacIntosh\u2019s weekly newsletter. Chris retired in his late-20s, having made his fortune in asymmetric bets like\u2026 The New Zealand real estate (64x return)The last commodities bull market (10x)Bitcoin (20x)Shipping (27x)Capturing one bull market cycle and riding it for all its worth can be the difference between life in a cubicle and achieving financial freedom!

            "answer_text": "FIVE THINGS NEEDS TO DO TO, GET RICH IN STOCK MARKETS  List your reasons for investing. Most people invest to build money for their retirement. However, there are other reasons for investing that are equally valid. If you know your reasons for investing, you can develop your investment strategy based on those reasons.For example, if you're one of the many people who want to invest for retirement, you need to figure out when you plan to retire and how much money you want to have available to you by that point.If your reason for investing is that you want to buy a house (which is itself an investment), decide what kind of house you want to buy an how big of a down payment you want. Keep in mind that the real estate market can change rapidly.Your only reason for investing may be that you want to own a piece of your favorite company. If that's you, simply buy some stock in that company and don't worry about anything else.Identify your investment goals. To some extent, your goals are separate from your reasons. Your goal is the specific amount of money you want to raise through your investment activities.[3]For example, you might want to have $1 million to retire on. You'd choose all of your investments with an eye toward meeting that goal.Use investments for large goals. If you have a smaller goal, it's better to simply put money in a savings account. For example, if you want to raise $10,000 so you can buy a new car in 2 years, a savings account is a better option than the stock marketCalculate how long you plan to invest. Typically, your investment goals have a time limit, also known as your \"time horizon.\" Look at your reasons for investment and figure out how long you have to save for those goals. Some of these might be self-imposed deadlines, while others will have a specific time limit that you have no control over.[4]For example, if you're investing to pay for your child's college education, and your child is currently 4 years old, you have 14 years to reach your goal (assuming your child starts college when they're 18). This is a relatively short time horizon, so you'd want to choose lower-risk investments to increase the chances that you'd reach your goal in that time.If you're a 25-year-old who's investing for retirement at the age of 65, on the other hand, you have 40 years. This gives you a little more leeway to play around with riskier investments because you'd be able to recoup any loss.If you need money for a short-term goal of 5 years or less, the stock market isn't the best option. You're unlikely to raise the money you need from stock market investments in this time.[5]No investment comes with any guaranteed returns. However, if you look at average returns, you can figure out how long it will take you to reach the goals you've set.4.Set an investment budget. Before you start investing, take a moment to understand your own financial situation. If you don't already have one, create a household budget so you understand exactly how much income you're bringing in and where your money is going each month. Then, figure out how much of your income you can put towards savings and investments.[6]Your investment budget helps you determine what rate of return you need to realize if you want to reach your goal by the deadline you've set. For example, suppose you want to retire in 40 years. You have an investment budget of $500 a month, or $6,000 a year. This means that, in those 40 years, you'll have invested $240,000. You'd need a rate of return of at least 6% to meet your goal, assuming your contributions never increase. 5.Create a practice portfolio to learn how the market works. If you've never invested before, using a stock market simulator allows you to hone your strategy before getting actual money involved. Many online brokers have simulators that allow you to \"invest\" with fake money so you can get an idea of how to use their platform as well as practice trading.[8]If there's already an online broker you're interested in, see if they have a simulator. That way, you can learn about the market while also getting a feel for navigating their site. Please upvote it , comment it , and share it\ud83d\ude4f Reference: wikiHow.com ",

Or other people focus on the opposite, and incorrect assumption; namely that stock markets are risky and dangerous! Assuming you don\u2019t have a big inheritance or a lot of money to begin with, the only way to get rich investing without speculating is: To be long-term. Keep investing for decadesReinvest all dividendsNever panic when markets are downIncrease how much you invest as you age if your salary/income goes up.Put in any unexpected or one time cash injections from inheritances.Never lose faith during periods where makers are down or stagnant, even if it carries on for 10+ years, like it did from 2000\u20132010. This just means that you are buying at cheaper prices.Let me gives you some examples of how this can all add up to a million or multi-million portfolio. Let\u2019s say somebody invests $200 a month x50 years, from age 16\u201318 when they have a part-time job, though to 68, when they retire. They get 8% on average, which is 1%-2% less than the average performance of the Dow or S&P500. They would have a $1.4m portfolio in retirement.Now let\u2019s say somebody invests the same (200 a month for 50 years) but they add a $100,000 inheritance they received in their 20s. The total pot at retirement? $6.1m! yes $6.1m. From simply adding $100,000 from an inheritance, the total pot has increased by over $4.5m!Now let\u2019s say somebody does an average of $500 a month for 50 years but adds $100,000 from a bonus or inheritance in their 20s. The total pot? $8.4m.The point is 6.5%-6.7% above inflation (the average US Stock Market performance - more for the Nasdaq by the way) doesn\u2019t sound like a lot. But over a long period of time, it makes a huge difference. Often you hear stories about an old granny who is worth millions. Often all they have done is held stocks \u201cforever\u201d. This lady was just a secretary.  She left $8m when she died! - Thrifty Brooklyn secretary leaves US$8m for needy students She isn\u2019t a on-off either. I personally know several millionaires who are middle-aged, in some cases never had a high-income or got much inheritance. All they did is start young and they invested \u201cforever\u201d. They never panic sold during crashes, and were just patient. Of course, there are more aggressive wealth accumulation strategies that can help people become wealthy in their 20s and 30s. There are many ways to skim a cat though, and the above strategy is tried and tested. It doesn\u2019t mean it is guaranteed. It merely offers a good probability of a sound risk-adjusted return.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer as a professional in the industry. I broker for derivatives (which are not typical stocks but still requires me to deal with institutional clients 12h per day every day and look at the market on a second-to-second basis). I see so many retail investors on here asking about tips and techniques on how to day trade or pick stocks or what they should buy now, and so on. Listen to me. On the long-run you cannot and will not beat the market by actively day trading or even picking individual stocks to hold. I cannot begin to describe why that\u2019s not possible but the intelligence, resources, information, capital, tools, trading fees and even prices that professional traders and institutional funds have is just insane and unbeatable. Really. I have friends who tell me how they\u2019re getting into technical analysis or trading (with glee in their eye) and I feel sorry for them -it\u2019s wasted money on fees, mistakes, losing positions, bad allocation, etc. With that being said, I invest in the stock market and I\u2019ve managed to double my net worth in the past ten years. Am I being super smart or do I have secret info? Absolutely not. I use the dumbest and simplest form of investing there is. I buy super broad, super diversified funds and hold them for a very long time. This just allows me to follow the market. If the market goes down, my porfolio goes down and if it goes up, it goes up. Fortunately for me, in the past ten years it\u2019s just been going up. It might go down and I will still hold because I believe it will go back up and then keep going. Don\u2019t try to beat the market, just follow it. So far that\u2019s still the safest and most profitable strategy of them all. You get most of the upside you could ever get, you get dividends and coupons from your equities and bonds and you also beat all your friends who try to be smarter. On average, over a 10\u201320 year basis, the stock market reaps about 5\u20136% annual return (compound that over a decade and you\u2019ll be rich). Keep on saving and invest periodically your savings. Good luck, my friend. ",

Afterwards, make some educated investments. You\u2019ll make mistakes. Learn from them and refine your principles. I\u2019ve developed a process of my own over the years that\u2019s worked quite well. It\u2019s an amalgamation of advice from those I deeply admire. Zero to One - This is taken from a book by Peter Thiel with the same title. Thiel\u2019s idea here is focused on startups: does this company have a new and fresh idea that no one else is currently able or willing to replicate? The way I apply it is simple: is [insert company] thinking like a startup? Are they pushing to innovate or are they content with their current business? I prefer the former.What secret do they see? - Another principle taken from Peter Thiel. Following step one, I want to know what the company believes they see that no one else does. What\u2019s their vision? Is it unique, strange, progressive (in the economic sense)? This will give you a sense of their unique value.MOAT - This principle is straight from Warren Buffet. Assuming they meet the first two criteria, I want to know what their competitive landscape looks like. Do they have a large MOAT around their castle (business) protecting it from competitors? Think Google or Amazon. Their moats are quite large.How will the world look 10 to 20 years from now - This requires a lot of educated foresight. However, if you\u2019re an investor I truly believe you have to start thinking about how the world will look in the next decade or two. This will allow you to make BOLD decisions before the herd catches on. You will make some mistakes here. Learn from them. If the company matches your vision of the world\u2026.Invest.Digital Scuttlebutt - In his book, \u201cCommon Stocks and Uncommon Profits,\u201d Philip Fisher introduces the Scuttlebutt (terrible name). Basically, Fisher would go straight to the business source to do his homework. Nowadays, I doubt you\u2019re going to call up a C-Suite executive to get information about the business. However, you have access to something better: The Internet. Glassdoor (employees), reddit, Facebook, Quora. Learn from their current employees. This will let you know if their vision is just a smokescreen. Find the dirty details if there are any.Learn to trust your process. Stay vigilant when an economic downturn happens. Have the courage to THINK for yourself. Provided that you research and stay educated, you\u2019ll do just fine. Best of luck. ",

As a matter of fact, investing in and trading in the financial markets is the only place in the world where you can make an unlimited amount of money. Can you make a millions of dollars? You sure can however you would need to using hundreds of millions of dollars to do so. Anyone can learn to do this business and the amount on money you make is up to you and how much capital you are working with. When first starting out you should only start with a small amount of money to test out your rule based trading plan you will have composed to work in the live markets and that\u2019s only after you have completed the required education and training to be able to work in this business as a self-directed investor and trading. The education and training can take a long time, some people catch on to it right away and become successful at doing it while others it can take awhile to get it. It is said that it takes the average retail trader 18\u201336 months to become proficient enough to manage their own money in the live market and be consistently profitable doing so. I know that\u2019s not what you want to hear however it is the raw truth. You can begin trading stocks in the live market for as little as $500, it doesn\u2019t mean you should. If you wish to earn while you learn that would be the smallest amount of money you could get started with and it should be disposable income which cannot hurt you if you have an unfavorable experience the first time in. Most brand new raw beginners who begin in this business and are unprepared and underfunded lose an average of 40 thousand dollars the first year in the business, don\u2019t be that trader, take your time and do the education and training the right way from the first day and you will have a life long skill to make an unlimited amount of money from anywhere in the world day or night, sounds nice doesn't it. If you\u2019re a raw beginner have a look at these books 10 Secrets to Get Rich from Stock Trading, How to Trade Stocks Online on a $500 account hopefully they can help you to understand what is needed to become successful from investing and trading as a self-directed beginner.

            "answer_text": "Make sure you understand the term \u201cstocks\u201d 100%. If you are talking about the actual stocks, there are different ways to go about them(and understand that there is not just one path on making money out of stocks). Usually making money out of trading (buying and selling) is a long-term process, that gets you rich slow, but at a higher chance than say other financial instruments. There are different time-horizons on stocks trading(or investing) - from scalping, to day trading, to actual long term buy and hold for gains and dividends. Make sure you understand how they work, very carefully. Other way to get rich out of stocks(well not specifically stocks, but most people will mistake those two) are options. Options are very risky compared to lets say buying and holding stocks, or even day trading - if you don\u2019t know what you are doing. You have to be very careful with those, but if you understand them and have can exploit their edges, you get richer way faster than lets say stock investments ( probably). If I remember well, Nassim Taleb, an options trader and famous author said that most of his option contracts expire worthless(or he\u2019s taking a small loss), but when they don\u2019t expire worthless, they make him so much money, they compensate for dozens of years of losses.(read about his 1987 gain of $40.000.000 in one day) - but as I said before, and as Nassim Taleb states, only those that know and understand options very well and exploit their edges MAY get to that. Of course, this implies a lot of psychological strength towards taking a loss of years or even a decade, even if its just a small one(see loss aversion bias). In my point of view, you should be looking at managing your risk(diversified portfolio) rather than picking good stocks just because you like or use the company service or products. That has no correlation on stock, and the same is true for technical analysis for smaller time horizon trades. They are simple assumptions. We can\u2019t predict the future, but we can do our best to avoid getting wiped out by a black swan(Taleb concept) Beware of biases in stock market. A lot of experts and people will tell you a lot of things, but their opinions may be biased, and they may be just lucky(humans can\u2019t usually comprehend that sometimes their home-run is just because of chance. - see survivorship bias) I think reading Nassim Taleb books(incerto bundle) and Daniel Kahneman \u201cThinking fast and slow\u201d is gonna give you all the understanding you need.

So let\u2019s use a 10% average annual return before taxes for this answer. If you invest $10.000 at 10% annually for 25 years you\u2019ll end up with $108,347. While an excellent investment you\u2019re far away from becoming rich. Let\u2019s define rich as someone with a net worth of $10,000,000 (US dollars).  So, how people become rich form stocks? I think you have two ways: You manage other\u2019s people money.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re that good at investing that people start giving you their money to manage. So now you have $100 millions in assets under management (AUM). You charge 1% of your AUM, that\u2019s $1 MM in fees before taxes and costs into your pocket. Nice, isn\u2019t it? Now imagine you have $1000 million in AUM. I let you do the math. That\u2019s leverage. That\u2019s the multiplier effect from investing other's people money. You make bold investments.That is risky investments which can turn into millions, or even billions if you\u2019re successful. Like investing in unicorn startups. These are not \u201cstock investments\u201d per se. I mean, you get an equity stake in a company, but you can\u2019t trade it in the public markets. Had you invested $30.000 at the beginning of Facebook\u2026well, you could become Eduardo Saverin. Google him. Another strategy is being a successful derivatives trader, aiming returns of 50% annually, consistently for 10 years. If you actually pull this off, call me, I\u2019m interested in talking with you. NOTE: derivatives are not \u201cstocks\u201d neither, just google the term.  This is basically how you can become a millionaire from \u201cstocks\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is the easiest way to get rich investing in the stock market: invest as much as you can, as often as you can, put your money in an S&P 500 index fund, wait 40 years. You will likely be rich. This is not a get rich quick scheme; too many people fail at that. Unless you really know what you are doing, you shouldn\u2019t buy individual stocks. There\u2019s no need to buy managed funds; 99% of fund managers have underperformed the market. The S&P 500, over the past 50 years, has returned 9.7% (including dividends.) If you invest $1,000 every year in the S&P 500, assuming that 9.7% annual return: after 10 years, you will have $17,000after 20 years, you will have $60,000after 30 years, you will have $170,000after 40 years, you will have almost $450,000That\u2019s just $1,000 a year, if you can invest more, you will likely have more. Assuming you could invest $10,000 every year, you would have 10 times as much: after 10 years, you will have $170,000after 20 years, you will have $600,000after 30 years, you will have $1,700,000after 40 years, you will have almost $4,500,000Don\u2019t overthink this. It\u2019s really this easy. Some years you may lose money. IN 2008, the S&P 500 dropped 37%. That\u2019s tough to swallow. You may want to sell your investments. Try your best to resist that. If anything, if you have extra cash, you could invest more when the market declines, but I\u2019d suggest not trying to time the market. Simply invest as much as you can, every year. Over the long haul, the markets tend to grow along with the economy. Keep it simple. Invest regularly, Eventually you will be rich. ",

            "answer_text": "By far the most common (and easiest) way to grow wealth from investing in stocks is to make regular monthly investments of between 10\u201315% of your income into a low-cost, index mutual fund (or a small number of such mutual funds). Start with your employer\u2019s retirement program. These are usually called a 401k or 403b. These types of retirement accounts allow you to not pay federal income tax on the growth of the account. This allows the account to grow much faster. The stock market over any 20-year period typically earns between 10\u201312% annual returns on average. Bear in mind that during any one year, the stock market might do reallly well (like 2017) or it might lose value (like in 2008). Ignore these ups and downs. Just keep investing. A 24-year-old who goes to work and invests $450 per month (this number includes the employer\u2019s contribution or match) into a 401k can easily expect to have well over $4 million in the account at age 67. A great place to start investing in an S&P 500 Index fund. With every dollar you invest, you\u2019re buying a small sliver of ownership in America\u2019s 500 biggest and best companies. Stay away from car notes (pay cash for good used cars), and stay away from paying interest on credit cards. You\u2019ll become a millionaire with regular monthly investing. Read good books by Dave Ramsey, Jim Stoval, and Suze Orman. Make a plan for your finances! Save and spend your money accordingly. Do NOT try to pick the next hot stock. If your buddy tells you Technofantastic Inc. will soon be worth more than Apple or Exxon, just smile politely and keep investing in your 401k and in the S&P 500. Also, do NOT try to guess as to when stocks will go up and down (market timing). There is abundant research that shows people who try to \u201cpick winners\u201d or who try to time market fluctuations obtain far less returns than do investors who simply invest in the S&P 500 or similar \u201cwhole market\u201d type index funds. That\u2019s how everyone can become wealthy. It takes working and budgeting so that you can save 10\u201315% of your income into your company\u2019s retirement program. Do not spend all your income. After you save money in your retirement account, save a little bit into a regular bank savings account for emergencies (paying bills for three months after a job layoff) and for buying stuff (car tires, vacations, furniture, and a replacement car when your current car dies). Get started now. ",

            "answer_text": "This is how mere an investment of \u20b96000 turned into 8lac. Rupees !!! Few days back I attended a seminar on stock market. Since it was a basic introductory seminar on stock market, It was very boring (according to me) because neither they taught anything about fundamental analysis nor about technical analysis ! But the interesting part came in a Question and Answer round. One uncle around 65+ years old told us his story that how he made fortune (unknowingly) from stocks !!! The story goes like this (cutting long story short here):- He had purchased 100 shares of graphite india around 60 rupees in 2005\u20132006 and then company declared 10 for 2 stock split. So his number of outstanding share became 800 and stock price went around \u20b910\u201312 from \u20b960. He was furious at that time and got mad about company because he thought his stock price decreased dramatically (of course anyone would be angry if \u20b960 share becomes \u20b910-12 share) and he didn't know anything about stock split so he thought his number of shares are still 100 but actually it became 800. He was totally numb & furious. He thought it is not feasible to sell his stock at that price. After this incident, he loose interest in stock market and didn't look over his stock neither took any interest in stock market. In this year, he somehow came to know that the stock he purchased in 2006 is still listed on stock market and now hovering around \u20b91000. He then researched about it, checked all the documents he received in these years (from 2006\u20132018) and figure out that, right now he has 800 shares of \u201cGraphite india\u201d which is quoting at around \u20b91000. His mere \u20b96000 investment in 2006 now became \u20b98,00,000. And after finishing his story he told that, this is the reason why he attended this seminar (To know more about stock market). Now, suppose meanwhile if he just would have received 1:1 bonus issue his 800 shares would have been 1600 and 8lacs would have been turned into 16lacs.

            "answer_text": "Here are 10 of the most proven tips to reaching your goals, and the earnings you have always wanted : 1.\tFocus on Hot Stocks Hitting New Highs As you get started with your stock market dreams, make sure to focus on hot stocks. Do your research, look into their patterns and place your focus on stocks that are already growing as you plan to stick with them until they reach new heights. Do not look to stocks hitting new lows. 2.\tYou Can Buy and Short Sell There are some people who think they need a bull market to get rich. This isn\u2019t the case. Don\u2019t ignore short selling. You don\u2019t have to hold on to a stock for a long time to earn a profit. Just look at the success some day traders have; they are the epitome of earning off of short selling. 3.\tCut Your Losses Quickly If you want to be successful in the market, take your ego completely out of the situation. If you face a set back, cut your losses and move on fast. Do not dwell on your failure, but instead look to the future. You are going to fail, so be prepared and just be ready to move on. 4.\tDon\u2019t Be Afraid to Take Partial or All Profits The thing about your earnings is that they aren\u2019t really profits until you take them. Don\u2019t be afraid to take partial profits or take profits too quickly. The market changes fast; it is OK to get out when you feel it is right and take the profits that you can. 5.\tEmbrace New Technologies The world is changing and it is changing fast, so you need to be changing with it if you want to be successful in the stock market. Now is not a time to be afraid of technology companies. There are the companies of the future. Embrace new technologies and business models and be willing to stay ahead of the time as you look to your investments. 6.\tStick With Liquid Stocks If you want to earn some serious income, then it is best to stick to liquid, highly traded stocks. Try to stay away from illiquid stocks at all costs. These are stocks that make big promises but tend not to uptrend. 7.\tDon\u2019t Believe Anything the Stock Says In the trading world, talk is cheap. Don\u2019t listen to promises or hype, look only on the action of the stock. Do your research look into how that stock is performing and what action it is really taking. This is how you will know what to expect from the stock in the future. 8.\tDon\u2019t Diversify and Don\u2019t Use Leverage Don\u2019t get too in over your head. So many people talk about diversifying and using leverage. This is not the way to earn millions. I typically keep one to two stocks at a time and don\u2019t use more than 30% of my assets in my investments, that\u2019s it. 9.\tYou Don\u2019t Need to Buy Bottom, Sell Top So many new traders are focused on the old adage that you need to buy right at the bottom and sell right at the top. Yes it would be nice if you could as that would mean the most profits possible, but you just need to focus on the meet of the move, not necessarily the top and bottom. You can get in during the middle and still make some major profits. 10.\tAlways Make a Plan If you want to truly find long-term success in the stock market, the best thing you can do is to go into every trade with a very specific plan. Before you get started create a specific risk/reward profile for what you demand of your investments and stick with it no matter what. Never stray from the plan. Earning millions in the stock market can seem like a daunting task, but it is one that you can achieve, if you follow these steps and keep this dedicated approach in mind. If you prepare yourself for setbacks and understand the challenges that can come with this investing strategy then you may just find yourself coming closer and closer to reaching your investing goals ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s simple concept really. We work for Money. Whether through job, profession or through business or investments. What we earn is our \u2018Return\u2019 on investment. investment being our education, work hours, effort etc. Now what most people are ignorant about (even people from finance backgrounds, like Chartered accountants, MBA finance, Bachelor of commerce graduates; yes! no kidding !!) are the two demons eating away your wealth silently. These are Inflation.Taxes.So, In a nutshell, people get rich via stocks by earning exponential returns that helps them beat inflation easily. Also since most governments around the world give major tax breaks on capital gains on stocks, the rich keep most of the money in investments forms, mainly shares/ stocks. To make this answer more interesting I am posting a link here to understand through a video. I\u2019ll also explain in detail below. YouTube So now for detailed explanation: So the rich when investing in stocks aim for two things that no other asset class provide Exponential returnsCompounding benefit.Please note that I used the word \u2018asset\u2019. I\u2019ll take a moment to explain what are assets because people confuse assets with liabilities in real life also. Assets are \u2018anything that put money on your pocket\u2019. Liabilities are anything that take away money from your pocket. Many people confuse a fancy lifestyle, stylish clothes, expensive cars like BMW, Audi, Personal house, Cash in hand as assets, when in reality they are liabilities. (yes cash in hand is not an asset, as it is just lying in your house and not increasing over time) So Back to Exponential returns and compounding benefit. Equity class over a period of centuries has \u201cConsistently proven\u201d to be the best asset class to give great returns. No other class, has come close to equity when it comes to returns. and this is not from perspective of indian market. No Sir! It is a conclusion drawn from mature market of the West that have been around for centuries. USA suffered their first major set-back in markets in 1929 itself. India suffered first major setback in 2008 (not accounting for harshad mehta like scams because india market was pre-mature that time) and that also due to failure of American majors like goldman sachs and lehman brothers.  The Second is the compounding efffect. \u201cCompounding is the eighth wonder of the world. The one who understands it, earns it; the one who does not, pays it\u201d - Albert Einstein Simply put it means re-investing the income your earned from the asset. The effects of compounding are extremely slow. But rewarding. A simple calculation shows that true wonders of compounding are reaped atleast 15 years onwards, when wealth grows at an amazing rate.  Now a short discussion on Inflation and taxes. Inflation means the growth in cost of living. By a basic observation you know that what you spent last year to buy groceries, or other need-based items are more expensive in the next. This silent increase is called inflation.  Inflation eats away majority of your wealth. Table 1: Cost of Living in Unite States 1975 Vs 2015  Table 2: College Tution Fee has grown most substantially over the years in USA; furthering burdening students with student loans and interest expenses.  The last item on the list is taxes. It may surprise you that Mr. Warren Buffet pays less taxes compared to her secretary. No Kidding. Thats because majority of his assets and income are in form of Equity and dividend earned from that equity, which is tax free in some countries, or least taxed in other countries. In short, the rich understand well how to save their tax outlfow.  So this was a basic coverage of things. Here\u2019s the link again to help understand it better.

However, there's also a lot of evidence that plenty of investors underperform the market, and more than a few lose money. With that in mind, we asked three of our investing experts to tell us: What's the easiest way to get rich buying stocks? Here's what they had to say. Dan Caplinger: It's not sexy, it's not fast, and it's not the answer most people seem to want, but the secret to getting rich in the stock market is no secret at all. By focusing on the stocks of companies that have solid future prospects for long-term growth, you can set yourself up for monumental gains as years and decades pass. And by adding to positions in your favorite stocks month in and month out through automatic investing programs, you can give the power of compounding a boost and take advantage of favorable market conditions to add even more to your portfolio. That simple strategy has a number of advantages. First, if you have a set amount to invest every month, being diligent in making new investments every month will actually buy you more shares when your stock's price is down, helping you take maximum advantage of price declines to build up your overall position and adding to profits when the stock price turns back upward. Also, as long as you're mindful of fundamental changes that would justify selling your position in a given stock, having long-term confidence in proven businesses prevents you from falling prey to guesswork and emotional decisions that can turn out badly. Maintaining discipline can be hard, but the long-term rewards of smart investing are worth the effort. Jason Hall: There's a lot of evidence that investing in stocks is the best way for most people to get rich. It doesn't happen overnight, and it takes a lot of work to do well. However, low-cost index funds have made it much easier for people who aren't able or willing to dedicate the time to pick individual companies. Vanguard has really led the charge, with a number of funds with extremely low expense ratios -- the money the fund takes out each year to cover costs -- that track popular indices, like the S&P 500. By investing in these low-cost index funds, using the method that Dan describes, you can get close to the same long-term returns of that index. What's that worth over time? It can be an awful lot: BASED ON $10,000 INVESTED YEARLY, WITH ACTUAL S&P 500 RETURN EACH YEAR, MINUS 0.5% EXPENSE RATIO. If you'd been able to invest $10,000 yearly in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NYSEMKT:VOO) -- which tracks the S&P 500 -- starting in 1980, this chart shows your likely returns after the low 0.5% expense ratio was paid. This fund wasn't available back then, and there's no guarantee that you'll get the same kinds of returns going forward, but long-term buy-and-hold investors in index funds are far more likely to get rich than short-term traders, and with a lot less effort. Selena Maranjian: As Dan pointed out, patience and diligence are key contributors to getting rich through investing in stocks. But what you invest in matters a lot, too, and a powerful set of stocks worth considering is that of dividend payers. You don't give up stock-price appreciation when you invest in dividend payers. Shareholders of healthy, growing companies that pay dividends will see their stocks' values rise over time. But those companies that pay out dividends will be generating an additional return for their shareholders, and one that can be counted on more than stock-price appreciation, which is generally lumpy over time. If a company pays $0.25 per quarter, as long as it remains healthy, it will keep doing so, as cutting back on a dividend is a big red flag and a turnoff for investors. Better still, if the company is growing, it will likely increase its payout over time. Imagine this, as an example: You bought into a company when it was trading for $100 per share and it paid out $2.00 per year in dividends, for a 2% dividend yield. But if it hiked that payout over the next 25 years by an annual average of 8%, then it would end up paying out $13.70 per year 25 years later. Compare that to your $100 purchase price per share, and you'd be collecting $13.70 at that point from a $100 investment, for an effective yield of 13.7%! The stock would most likely be worth considerably more than $100 per share, too. Investing in strong dividend payers is a great way to get rich over time. Finally These three methods are slightly different, but share a few common elements like long-term focus and continual investing. ",

Their wealth isn't measured by the amount they make each year, but by how they've saved and invested over time,\" writes Ramit Sethi in his New York Times bestseller, \"I Will Teach You To Be Rich.\"\"In other words, a project manager could earn $50,000 per year and be richer than a doctor earning $250,000 per year \u2014 if the project manager has a higher net worth by saving and investing more over time.\"Sethi gives an example of the power of investing just $10 per week:After five years (assuming an average 8% return), you would have $3,295,and after 10 years, you would have$8,136. And that comes from simply setting aside a little over a dollar a day.Putting away $50 a week would result in $16,473 after five years and$40,678 after 10 years. Imagine how much money would accumulate if you set aside a bit more each week, and did that for several years.The earlier you start, the better.This chart from JP Morgan Asset Management, which shows the power of taking advantage of compound interest from an early age, explains why it's so important to get started now and invest consistently, even if you think you don't have enough money to make a difference:  \u200bJP Morgan Asset ManagementYou don't need to be rich to invest, yet so many of us fail to get started managing our money because we're intimidated or don't know where to start. Fear of losing money is also a common concern: \"That's fair,\" writes Sethi, \"Especially after market losses during the global financial crisis, but you need to take a long-term view. Despite wild rides in the stock market, with a long term perspective, the best thing you can do is start investing early.\"Next, consider contributing money towards a Roath IRA or traditional IRA, individual retirement accounts with different contribution limits and tax structures (which one you can use depends on your income). If you still have money left over and are hungry to continue investing, you can research low-cost index funds, which Warren Buffett recommends, and look into the online investment platforms known as \"robo-advisers.\" ",

            "answer_text": "The Math Behind Getting Rich in the Stock Market  When Apple went public in 1980, the price per share was $22. If you had invested $5,000 and held on to it until August 2018, you would have watched the share price grow to more than 10 times its starting price, to $227.63 per share. But even more important, the stock split 56 times during that time. With $5,000 to invest, you could have bought 227 shares in 1980. By 2018, after Apple had split its stock and changed its business model a few times, you would have 12,712 shares in the company. At $227.63 per share, your initial $5,000 investment would have grown to $2,893,632.56. That\u2019s using the stock market to get rich. Really rich. Long-term investing like that, over the course of 38 years, would have made you a multi-millionaire from just one company. So how do you make that much money from the stock market? While there is no one right answer, there are a few things you can keep in mind. 1. Buy and Hold What the Apple example clearly shows is that buying and holding a stock can be enormously beneficial for your finances. \u201cBuy and hold\u201d refers to buying stock shares and holding on to them for the long term, even when the stock market is down. Most legendary investors preach the glory of the buy-and-hold method. In 2016, Warren Buffet said, \u201cThe money is made in investments by investing and by owning good companies for long periods of time.\u201d 2. Use Index Funds Picking one stock that is going to make you rich is a bit unrealistic. That\u2019s why index fund investing is so popular. When you invest in an index fund you are broadly diversified. By investing in many different companies in one fund, your investment in each fund is automatically smaller. This means you earn less from each company. But that way also, should some of the companies turn out to be lemons, you don\u2019t lose as much money. Rather than seeking the one stock that will change your life forever, index fund investing is good for the buy-and-hold strategy and getting rich in the stock market over time. 3. Budget for Investing Budgeting your income is a powerful tool for your investments. Include your investment contributions in your monthly budget so you can track your investments over time. Look for areas that you can cut back in your spending so you can increase your investment amount. Whatever amount you already contribute to your investments, cutting back on other spending could mean investing even more. 4. Short Selling Short selling is the opposite strategy of buy and hold. People are looking to make money in the market in a shorter time frame, and they do that by \u201cshorting\u201d stocks. Here\u2019s the gist: You borrow stocks and sell them at current market prices and receive a cash payment. But since you\u2019ve only borrowed the stocks, you need to replace the stock that you sold. And you are responsible for paying dividends for the length of time that you borrow the stock. When people short sell, they want the stock to drop sharply so they can buy it back at a much cheaper price. This means they can take home the difference. And sometimes the difference is a lot of money, which makes short selling a way you could get rich in the stock market. Shorting the market requires a knowledge of the market and an educated guess on when the stocks will go down. You don\u2019t want to borrow them for too long, because you\u2019ll end up owing a lot in dividends. If you're interested in short selling you can buy and sell stocks through a brokerage firm like TD Ameritrade. 5. Contribute to Your Portfolio Consistently Contributing to your investments consistently over the years is a great strategy to grow wealth in the stock market. It's one strategy that works for the average American paycheck. Many people don\u2019t have huge amounts of money at any one moment to invest but do have smaller amounts that they can consistently contribute over the years. Consistency is a strong investing move. Say you start with an initial investment of $3,000. Invest $500 a month over 30 years at 6% interest, and you\u2019ll have $523,022 in your accounts. At $1,000 a month, you\u2019d have $1,027,897 at the end of 30 years. You can use a calculator like this one to see how different levels of monthly contributions can make a difference in your investment results. And if you\u2019re just getting started, you can use an automated investing service like Betterment. For those with a bit more experience, try Personal Capital. It not only lets you keep track of all of your finances in one place, but also has a stellar wealth management service. 6. Understand the Stock Market and Stay Focused When it comes to growing your wealth in the stock market, you need to have a working understanding of the stock market itself and be comfortable with long-term investing. Very few people become overnight millionaires off of a lucky stock pick, so don\u2019t count on that happening to you. Stay focused on your investment goals and stay calm in down periods. Let the market work for you.   ",

            "answer_text": "Stocks Are Liquid When investing in stocks, you can choose how you want to get profits. The two primary approaches are to seek capital gains (selling our stocks at a higher price than we paid for them) and to generate cash flow (creating new money). Seeking cash flow is the Rich Dad way because it allows you to control the situation better than just buying stocks. Either way, the stock market offers us the ability to easily buy and sell your paper assets. This is liquidity. Liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be converted to cash. Stocks Are Agile When most people think about profiting from movement in the stock market, they think of one direction of movement: up. They don\u2019t understand the concept that stocks are agile. You can learn to profit from a stock no matter if it goes up, down, or sideways. That\u2019s very tough to do in business, but in the stock market, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014because there are profit strategies for movement in any direction. Stocks Give Us the Ability to Scale There is a common misconception that you need a lot of money before you can begin to invest. Fortunately, investing in stocks allows almost anyone to begin their investing sooner rather than later. Because buying stock is buying only a share of a company, buying stock is more affordable for the average person than buying an entire company or starting a business. But the beauty of this is that you can own exactly the same stocks as a famous investor like Warren Buffett. The difference is that, as a new investor, you\u2019ll probably buy a smaller number of shares than Buffett. A company you want to invest in may be a multi-billion dollar enterprise, but you may be able to get a single share of its stock for just $25. The cost effectiveness of stock allows you to scale up into your investing as you gain the means to go bigger. For the average person, this is a faster way to invest than saving up for decades to purchase a franchise or some other business. ",

Let assume that you are very, very good at managing a balanced portfolio. Let say you have spent the better part of two decades working with a team of other professionals FULL TIME analyzing nothing but stocks and industrial data. Then realize: Everyone else are that good and hardworking and experienced too. Stock is not like being a doctor or teacher. It is more like being a trial lawyer. For you to win, the other lawyer has to lose. It is a zero sum game. Every dime you take, is a dime that someone else does not make. And those people are really, really good - the only reason they encourage the falsehood of \u201cgetting rich from stocks\u201d is because you are their food, their patsy, their fresh blood. If you are jumping into a pool full of shark, your thought should never be \u201cHow many shark fin soups can I eat today\u201d (i.e. how do I get rich from stocks), it should be \u201cFor fuck sake, get me out of here\u201d. Anyone who complain and say \u201cyou are investing in company and thus it is not a zero sum game\u201d usually don\u2019t understand the difference between IPO and secondary market. No you are not investing in a company when you buy a stock from secondary market. The company won\u2019t see a dime of the money you spent. Secondary market is merely a change of ownership and not an investment (i.e. increase in capital) in the company. ",

            "answer_text": "Hola! Stock investments are subject to market market risks. Market is volatile and unpredictable so its difficult to get rich from stocks though its easy for some people. Now you might be wondering how. Look you can also get rich by investing in stocks only if you have the right knowledge about stock market and how it works. So lets just understand what is a stock market? Stock market: Stock market is a market for stocks. When a company needs capital to start a business or to expand its business then it will issue stocks in the market at some face valu and when people or public will buy these shares the owner will get capital to expand its business. If your company gets profit through it that means that your stock is doing good but if it doesn't that means your stock is not doing good or simply the prices are falling. Once you get the profit you need to give the money of the investors back to them. Now stock market is volatile since you cannot predict when the price of your stock will fall or rise. Its unpredictable. So if you are investing and need profit then you need to keep certain things in mind: Research well about the market. Before investing you need to research the market so that you can choose a right stock. For that you need to read about the stock market on the internet or in books.Never bring emotions in between. Never be greedy. Never trust anyone in stock market. These emotions wont let you take the right decisions.Do not follow the herd mentality . If everyone is investing in a particular stock it does not mean that it will do good. There are chances that everyone investing might loose.If a stock did good in past that does not mean that it will good good again also. Think before you invest in such stocks.Its not that once you start investing you will get profit the next moment. You need to have patience. Follow the trail and error process. Learn from the mistakes you have made before.If you keep these things in mind you will surely gain profit. This is how people become rich through stock market. I am investing in stocks since last 6 years through Sharekhan and now that I have experience I am getting the desired profit. Thank You! ",

            "answer_text": "If you really want to get rich in the market, you can\u2019t just invest. You need to be a trader. You need to make money on both the gains of a company through holding long, and you need to make money on the losses through holding short. Long selling- this means you buy a stock, or call option, or put option on an inverse ETF. You profit on the gain of a company. Great during bull runs.Short selling- this means you borrow shares and sell them at a higher price, and buy them back at a lower price. You pocket the difference. Or you buy a regular put option, or Inverse ETF call options. Great during bear runs.Learn how to use technical charts. Candlestick charts are used to sort of predict prices on the emotions of investors. Believe me, there are traceable patterns. Like how a stock will bounce off of support and resistance prices. Using that, you can know roughly when and where to buy/sell. Of course, relativity comes into play. Is the market hot? One rumour, people buy in heavily skyrocketing the price. News, and people sell. IThere are many tools to your arsenal when using the charts. Trading volumes, tracing averages, RSI, support and resistance levels- there\u2019s plenty to go from. My personal favourite that I\u2019d choose among all others is trading volume. Once you can read signs in a chart, volumes can tell you lots. You can also employ the Warren Buffet method and hold long- for a very long time. This requires some research into a company. Does the company offer a bargain price and large prospective gains in the future? These finds are often in new niche markets. Do those markets cater to a large, sustainable audience? Hope all of that helps! There are tons of information on investopedia and YouTube videos. The internet is a haven of knowledge for FREE when you seek past the useless social media and porn. ",

            "answer_text": " 7x in 5 years investment Return also huge. This is how people get rich stock market Story of 15X times Return in just one year. How do people get rich From stocks? Hell yea I am the answer . I am a student of BBA 3rd year I belongs to a lower middle class family to just thinking like to have a bilion rupees in your account is imposible for a middle class family but I dream for it So now up to your question if you say I am rich then I am not actually because I have just a net worth of 1.5 lacs in my trading account but from my prospective you can say yes I am rich because when you hear the story where I was begin and you can imagine where I can go I started my trading careers 2 years back with the net capital of 2k rupee I was not actually there for making money but actually to learn because i know the lesson that I will learn from this is going to lead my whole life. so I had justed manage to get 2000 rupees and open A trading account with zerodha my father help me to do this and I was trading with my father's account he just give me 2000 rupees to put in my trading account and then I was losing day by day I do get profit from trading and again lose this was like thrilling. trading was a thrill for me at the same point I stopped trading and withdrawal all money I left share market for 4 months. i start learning more about all technique and TECHNICAL charts and everything for next 4 months then I get intern and where I gain 6000 rupees and ask my father to give me 4000 rupees more and he gave me from this 10k then I start my trading and in my first trade I made 4000 in one day means 40% return in one day which is huge. with the help of leverage here is the proof because when I Tarde this I snap a screenshot so I can show to my friends that I made something.  it was my first trade and I made 40% return in one day and after this day this huge profit taking continues for 2 months where I made 30k in 2 months including the 10k capital means 200% in 2 months after this I start learning about option trading of option and start option trading as well. I was so hungry for the knowledge and learn something so I was keep reading blogs, books and watching YouTube videos and getting inspired by investor and trader day by day which lead me to grow my trading capital from 10000 to 1.5 lacs   Now actually I moved from trading to investing to catch the big fish of the ocean. By investing in good fundamentals and about timeing! Everytime is good time to get in good company I put my 1 lakh in investing and 20k for trading on daily basis and rest of my 40k is kept in my bank account so I can apply IPOs whenever I see a good opportunity. I stop to option trading because 1.5 Lakh is so much for a middle class family that's why I think I should not risk that money. 1.5 Lakh is nothing for so many people but for me this is 15 times return in one year which is much more than any business owner and any kind of business I can get from very few people can do this so this is how I became rich from rags because of stocks . If you know anyone that made this kind of return please suggest me in comments and with this kind of return you can think or imagine that where will I be in next 10 years thank you for reading my answer happy investing keep your eyes on valuable stocks and you can also get such return EDIT 1 :- thankyou for your all loves Wow 600+ upvotes thats really mean something to me in my future answers I will try to be more motivational and inspiring and try to give the best of my knowledge to all who is seeking the knowledge.

            "answer_text": "Q. How do people get rich from stocks? A. First try to understand what are stocks, stock market and why should you invest in it. When someone saves money, he/she needs to put money somewhere. Person has many options to do that: Put money in banksEarlier when stock market was not much popular(even now those who are not aware), people kept money in banks and made FDs(fixed deposits) which they expect gives good returns. Speaking of numbers, on average, a bank FD gives an interest of 7\u20137.25% p.a. that means if you invest \u20b9100 then after an year, you will get back \u20b9107. But average inflation(learn about inflation here) every year is around 10%. So that means if a product is for \u20b9100 at time of investment then after an year when your \u20b9100 became \u20b9107, cost of product has risen to \u20b9110. So effectively you have lost \u20b93 for every \u20b9100 you invested. Invest in real estateThis option includes buying and selling of properties. For investing in real estates firstly you need a lot of initial funds, and secondly there are many risks related to real estate investment. Check them out here. Invest in gold and silverOther option to invest your money is to buy gold. In India considering a typical middle class family, when gold comes home we straight away keep into lockers and forget about it. Best case scenario is we will take it out in a wedding of some close relative and make jewellery of it. Most of the families don\u2019t think about gold from selling perspective. Also check out Four Reasons Why Gold Is A Bad Investment Invest in stocksAnother way to invest in money is through stocks. Basically when a company needs money, they release shares(stocks) to public. So when you buy shares of a company, you become that much owner of the company. Owner of a public limited company is the one who owns most of the shares. On an average, returns from stock market are 12\u201315% which are 7\u20138% above inflation. What you do in stock market is you keep an eye on shares you have bought, sell them when the prices are at its topmost peak and buy new ones when prices are low. For many families buying and selling stocks is the primary source of income. Till now, investing in stocks has turned one of the best option to invest money. If one do not have time to look over company\u2019s status for investing, you can also opt for mutual funds. Investing in stock market has shown some great results till now. ",

            "answer_text": "The base principle that a good investor in the stock market goes by is \u2018buy low and sell high\u2019. While in theory, this is a very well said dialogue, this is just the base principle and not comprehensive or enough to make tons of money in the market. To make money in the stock market, first be prepared to lose some money once in a while. Losses are natural. It happens to everyone. Do not back out of the stock market due to a couple of losses. However, if you continously make losses, you should probably think twice. Over a course of 6 months of experimenting, if your losses exceed gains, exit now! So how do you trade in profits? Understanding the market is the most important thing. Identify, for a whole month why the markets are going up, why it fell, how investors react to news events and likewise. Within a week you will be addicted to this.Let me give you an example. The Indian Government is investing huge amounts into rail infrastructure and development. Trains in India lack one thing that most trains everywhere in the world has -Air Conditioning. Air Conditioning is soon going to be a necessity, rather than a luxury just like smartphones are now, compared to a decade ago. With the budget in mind, I invested in Subros, a client of the Indian railways. It has been bearish for a few days. The minute the word railways was uttered in the Parliament, the stock shot up. I understood that market and their sentiments. Realised that this stock has potential by virtue of its products and invested.After the catastrophic Gujarat Elections, the Modi Government realised that the agricultural sector is not too happy with them. The Budget was surely going to be agricultural oriented to please the masses, keeping in mind the 2019 LS elections. I bought Godrej Agrovet just yesterday and booked a 35 INR profit per share in under 24 hours!Reading forums also give great insight. Quora is good to an extent. I attribute my profits in Yes Bank shares to Quora as I witnessed multiple positive reports about that bank on Quora (it could just be the algorithm playing, I don\u2019t know). Neverthless, I have so far made a 15%+ gain in those shares in hardly a month or two (the gain% would have been greater if my father had time the previous day to execute the trade as my trades are done through his account). As he did not get time, I ended up paying a 5% premium. Neverthless, a very profitable trade!I also suggest following Money Control\u2019s news updates regularly. It will surely help. Read up on investopedia, surround yourself (if not in real life, atleast in the virtual space :) ) with people who know about it. It is the best way to improve and make money. Disclaimer: No losses that one may incur due to the usage of aforementioned information can be blamed/attributed to the writer of this article. However, please thank the writer for any gains; monetarily or knowledge wise :)) DM me for any discussions/opinions and advice (mutual advice and tips will also be graciously accepted). ",

            "answer_text": " The great Albert Einstein once said \u201cCompound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it earns it \u2026 he who doesn't \u2026 pays it. Indeed, and here's how it works. Ask Warren Buffett for the single most powerful factor behind his investing success, and he\u2019d respond \u201ccompound interest\u201d \u2014 without skipping a beat.  He\u2019s been preaching this for six decades, and it\u2019s made him a billionaire. And it\u2019s something every investor can copy. A significantly small investment of 1000 Rupees will become 147,428,325 Rupees after 6 decades at 20% per annum. Suppose you invest \u20b910,000 into an investment instrument. The first year, the shares rise 20%. Your investment is now worth \u20b912,000. Based on good performance, you hold the stock. In Year 2, the shares appreciate another 20%. Therefore, your \u20b912,000 grows to \u20b914,400. Rather than your shares appreciating an additional \u20b92,000 (20%) as they did in the first year, they appreciate an additional \u20b92,400, because the \u20b92,000 you gained in the first year grew by 20% too. The wonder of compounding (sometimes called \"compound interest\") transforms your working money into a highly powerful income-generating tool. Compounding is the process of generating earnings on an asset's reinvested earnings. To work, it requires two things: the reinvestment of earnings and time. The more time you give your investments, the more you are able to accelerate the income potential of your original investment. Compound interest is incredibly powerful. The chart below from JP Morgan shows how one saver (Susan) who invests for only 10 years early in her career, ends up with more wealth than another saver (Bill), who saves for 30 years later in life. By starting early, Susan was able to better take advantage of compound interest. Chris, the third saver profiled, is ideal: He contributed steadily for his entire career.  JP Morgan Funds For your money to Compound, you need to things: Reinvestment and Time. This chart by Business Insider's Andy Kiersz also emphasizes the impact of compound interest, and the importance of starting early. Saver Emily, represented by the blue line, starts saving the exact same amount as Dave (the red line) but begins 10 years earlier. Ultimately, she contributes around 33% more than Dave over the course of her career but ends up with almost twice as much wealth as he does.  A Compounding Calculator: Power of Compounding, Investment Calculator, Compounding Calculator I feel, in the stock market, this is the only proven way to 100% succeed. You apply it in whatever way you can. If you can apply it, it is bound to work. You need to be extremely patient with your investments. Happy Compounding ",

            "answer_text": " Having a long-term time horizon can help you avoid making poor short-term investment decisions. A multi-year time horizon can also give you an advantage toward achieving superior returns by allowing you to make high-potential investments that others with a shorter time-frame would avoid. This article will elaborate on why being a long-term investor can help you achieve better returns, and illustrate how you can go about doing so. Long-term investors are less common than you might think I was a young associate at one of the biggest investment firms in the world. It was a typical evening in the middle of December, when many of us were working late. Another associate and I were discussing how he liked the prospects of a certain industry based on his long-term outlook when a recently-promoted portfolio manager walked in. He asked my colleague if he had any stocks that he could recommend. The other associate began to tell him about the group of companies whose long-term prospects he was just telling me about, but the portfolio manager cut him off, \u201cI am so close to beating my benchmark this year. So close. I need something that will work by year-end.\u201d There was a silence during which I looked at the portfolio manager and waited for an indication that this was his attempt at late-evening humor. There wasn\u2019t any. Why to be a long-term investor Investing for the long-term allows you to take advantage of high return opportunities that others might shun.Consider an investment that is expected to result in a 15% annualized rate of return over 5 years, but for which the first 4 years are expected to be negative, with all of the returns coming in year 5. Quite a few investors, including many professionals, would pass on that investment. For professionals, this could be due to a misalignment of incentives, which may push them towards a shorter-term time horizon lest they lose their jobs or their clients while they wait for returns. For individuals, it could be due to the desire for instant gratification. Remember the marshmallow test that young children were subjected to in order to see how long they would forego eating one marshmallow in order to get two later? The behavior observed in those children opting for instant gratification is unfortunately frequently still present in adults making financial decisions.Being a long-term investor helps guard against behavioral biases. In Behavioral Defense in Decision Making, I wrote about the recency bias which causes people to over-extrapolate the near-past further into the future more than the facts merit. Taking the long-term view on an investment should cause you to think about more than just what has been happening recently in order to arrive at a reasonable conclusion, potentially lessening the impact of this bias.Long-term investing reduces frictional costs, such as trading expenses and tax impact. There is a dramatic difference in after-tax returns for a taxable investor with a holding period of many years compared to one whose gross returns are due to short-term gains. Over a 20 or 30 year period, that difference could translate into several percent of after-tax return per year. This difference is enough to cause someone who follows a long-term investing approach to retire years earlier than a person who is saving the same amount and achieving the same pre-tax returns, but doing so through short-term trading.Evidence shows that longer holding periods are associated with better performance. According to data from Dimensional Fund Advisors, over the 15 year period ending on 12/31/2015 the average holding period of a stock by U.S. equity mutual funds has been approximately one year.The data presented above shows that when equity funds were divided into quartiles based on their average holding period, a much higher percentage of funds with longer holding periods outperformed the benchmark over the full period than did funds in any of the other quartiles.The quartile of funds with the longest average holding period had an average holding period over 3.5 years and 29% of those funds outperformed their benchmark. This frequency of outperformance is almost twice as high as the 17% for all funds in the study, and more than three times as high as the 8% for the quartile of funds with the shortest holding period which averaged less than 6 months.All quartiles had the majority of the funds underperforming their benchmark over this 15-year period, a finding consistent with Why Passive Investing is an Excellent Default Choice \u2013 an Active Investor\u2019s View.How to be a long-term investor Never put yourself in a position to be a forced seller. Price volatility only matters if you are forced to sell when prices are low. If you don\u2019t have to sell (or even better, if you can arrange your circumstances so that you can deploy capital when assets are priced unreasonably cheaply), then price volatility is not going to hurt your long-term financial outcome. The best way to put yourself in this position is by matching the time when you will require funds to the type of investments that you make. For example, equities and other long-duration assets are not appropriate for those who will likely need a substantial portion of their investment within 3, and preferably 5, years in the future. So if you anticipate needing a large portion of your capital in the next few years, consider investing the amount that you will need in the short-term in lower return and lower volatility assets such as cash or short-term government bonds. This can give you the staying power to invest the rest of your assets appropriately for the long-term.Ignore news, opinions and commentary that is not likely to matter in 5 years. Specifically, be sure to ignore broad general fears about how a geopolitical or macroeconomic event is sure to affect prices in the short-term. There is no better way to ensure you are likely to do the exact opposite of what you should be doing than by getting caught up in the emotional roller-coaster of news reports and opinions about where the market will be at the end of the year. (Hint: nobody really knows where the market is headed in the short-term, but some find it entertaining to speculate nonetheless.)Avoid the principal/agent problem and misalignment of incentives. If you invest directly, then this isn\u2019t a cause for concern, and your challenge is to overcome various behavioral biases and pressures. However, if you invest through an agent (e.g. a financial advisor or a fund manager), then make sure their incentives are aligned with long-term value creation on your behalf. Rest assured that if their compensation or job security depends on their short-term investment results, they are unlikely to act with a long-term time horizon which is most likely to benefit you.Few individuals or professionals are truly able to take the long view. There are too many behavioral and incentive-related pressures to do otherwise. However, the rewards for being able to follow a disciplined investing strategy focused on the long-term are likely to be meaningful for those who are able to do so. ",

            "answer_text": "Investing in the stock market is a way to make more than just a little extra cash. In fact, with the right approach and the right skills, investing even a little in the stock market can put you on the road to earning millions. Becoming a stock market millionaire isn\u2019t an easy task and it isn\u2019t a feat that will happen overnight, but it is possible as proven by several of my students like Tim G. and Michael G. If you want to become a stock market millionaire then here are 10 of the most proven tips to reaching your goals, and the earnings you have always wanted. 1.\tFocus on Hot Stocks Hitting New Highs As you get started with your stock market dreams, make sure to focus on hot stocks. Do your research, look into their patterns and place your focus on stocks that are already growing as you plan to stick with them until they reach new heights. Do not look to stocks hitting new lows. 2.\tYou Can Buy and Short Sell There are some people who think they need a bull market to get rich. This isn\u2019t the case. Don\u2019t ignore short selling. You don\u2019t have to hold on to a stock for a long time to earn a profit. Just look at the success some day traders have; they are the epitome of earning off of short selling. 3.\tCut Your Losses Quickly If you want to be successful in the market, take your ego completely out of the situation. If you face a set back, cut your losses and move on fast. Do not dwell on your failure, but instead look to the future. You are going to fail, so be prepared and just be ready to move on. 4.\tDon\u2019t Be Afraid to Take Partial or All Profits The thing about your earnings is that they aren\u2019t really profits until you take them. Don\u2019t be afraid to take partial profits or take profits too quickly. The market changes fast; it is OK to get out when you feel it is right and take the profits that you can. 5.\tEmbrace New Technologies The world is changing and it is changing fast, so you need to be changing with it if you want to be successful in the stock market. Now is not a time to be afraid of technology companies. There are the companies of the future. Embrace new technologies and business models and be willing to stay ahead of the time as you look to your investments. 6.\tStick With Liquid Stocks If you want to earn some serious income, then it is best to stick to liquid, highly traded stocks. Try to stay away from illiquid stocks at all costs. These are stocks that make big promises but tend not to uptrend. 7.\tDon\u2019t Believe Anything the Stock Says In the trading world, talk is cheap. Don\u2019t listen to promises or hype, look only on the action of the stock. Do your research look into how that stock is performing and what action it is really taking. This is how you will know what to expect from the stock in the future. 8.\tDon\u2019t Diversify and Don\u2019t Use Leverage Don\u2019t get too in over your head. So many people talk about diversifying and using leverage. This is not the way to earn millions. I typically keep one to two stocks at a time and don\u2019t use more than 30% of my assets in my investments, that\u2019s it. 9.\tYou Don\u2019t Need to Buy Bottom, Sell Top So many new traders are focused on the old adage that you need to buy right at the bottom and sell right at the top. Yes it would be nice if you could as that would mean the most profits possible, but you just need to focus on the meet of the move, not necessarily the top and bottom. You can get in during the middle and still make some major profits. 10.\tAlways Make a Plan If you want to truly find long-term success in the stock market, the best thing you can do is to go into every trade with a very specific plan. Before you get started create a specific risk/reward profile for what you demand of your investments and stick with it no matter what. Never stray from the plan. Earning millions in the stock market can seem like a daunting task, but it is one that you can achieve, if you follow these steps and keep this dedicated approach in mind. If you prepare yourself for setbacks and understand the challenges that can come with this investing strategy then you may just find yourself coming closer and closer to reaching your investing goals, just as my millionaire students have.

            "answer_text": "1. Understand the Stock Market and Stay Focused  When it comes to growing your wealth in the stock market, you need to have a working understanding of the stock market itself and be comfortable with long-term investing. Very few people become overnight millionaires off of a lucky stock pick, so don\u2019t count on that happening to you. You can use financial advisor if you need help getting started. 2. Budget for Investing  Budgeting your income is a powerful tool for your investments. Include your investment contributions in your monthly budget so you can track your investments over time. 3. Use Index Funds  Picking one stock that is going to make you rich is a bit unrealistic. That\u2019s why index fund investing is so popular. When you invest in an index fund you are broadly diversified. By investing in many different companies in one fund, your investment in each fund is automatically smaller. This means you earn less from each company. But that way also, should some of the companies turn out to be lemons, you don\u2019t lose as much money. 4. Buy and Hold  What the Apple example clearly shows is that buying and holding a stock can be enormously beneficial for your finances. \u201cBuy and hold\u201d refers to buying stock shares and holding on to them for the long term, even when the stock market is down. 5. Short Selling  short selling is the opposite strategy of buy and hold. People are looking to make money in the market in a shorter time frame, and they do that by \u201cshorting\u201d stocks. 6. Contribute to Your Portfolio Consistently  Contributing to your investments consistently over the years is a great strategy to grow wealth in the stock market. It's one strategy that works for the average American paycheck. Many people don\u2019t have huge amounts of money at any one moment to invest but do have smaller amounts that they can consistently contribute over the years. By all of these steps you can easily able to learn how to make profit in the market to be rich from stocks. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, who doesn\u2019t want to get rich but getting \u201crich via stock market\u201d is a very difficult. I had been doing on-off trading for around 15 years but since last few years - I have started looking at stock market more seriously and have been trying to build a steady additional income stream via the medium. I would split in answer into two groups - 3 things you must do in stock market and 3 things which you must never do in stock market. 3 Things to do: (a) Always always always have a pre-defined stop loss. I have seen it multiple times in my own account, when loss of few hundreds rupees becomes loss of few thousands which then becomes loss of tens of thousands. See the reason is simple - when the loss is less, we tend to leave it (we think that loss is less and we can cut it anytime). Slowly the loss builds to a level where we start thinking, what is the point of cutting the trade now(loss has become more but still manageable) and the final stage - how low the stock can go(loss become substantial and hence we cannot cut it anymore and wait for days->weeks->years)? Also remember that their will be cases when after your stop loss is triggered and the stock will reverse direction. In these cases, you might feel that \u201cI should have taken a little more risk\u201d- try to stay away from this feeling because ultimately it will might impact future trades.  Remember to take care of your losses and your profits will take care of you. (b) Always have a pre-defined target - Depending upon your trading style (intraday or swing or positional or long term) you should have a realistic target. Once that target is hit, you can either take the profit or use trailing stop loss to keep increasing your profits. Having a target is important because without it, you are essentially going on a journey without knowing the destination!!!! (c) Diversify in various stocks- Always diversify in multiple stocks. For instance, if you have Rs 1 lakh to invest, I would recommend that you break them into 10 parts and invest in 10 different stocks. The reason is simple - \u201cNoone knows where the market or a particular stock is headed\u201d. Let it be the TV journalist on CNBC / Zee Business (whose only job is reporting on stock market) or twitter guru\u2019s like Ashwini Gujral or newest breed of traders on Youtube selling their classes - NOONE KNOWS WHERE THE MARKETS IS HEADED. Hence, diversification is the only away to reduce the risk. 3 Things NOT TO DO: (a) Advisory services - Do not opt for advisory services. These people will simply take your money, empty your trading account in few days/weeks and will CHARGE you money for emptying your trading account. Let me give tell you,what happened when I got a call from advisory service few days ago: He - How\u2019s the market going? Me - Fine. He - What kind of return are you making? Me - 2 to 3% per month(in good months) He - Oh, that\u2019s all. I can get you 15\u201320% per month. Me - hahahahahhaha He - No seriously. Me - Quit your job, take personal loan at 18% per year and live happily ever after. He - hangs up (b) Futures and options - Trading in futures / options especially stocks F&O will make you poorer, sooner than you think is even possible. Trust me, you might make some money in couple of times but market will ultimately take take 2 \u20133 times the money you made. PS - I recently wrote an email to to my broker to deactivate F&O trading on my account. (c) FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out(FOMO) is one of the biggest reason for my losses. This is the phenomenon when we take a position in a stock before all the prerequisite conditions are met(whatever that analysis might be) because we fear that if we spend more time waiting the stock might go higher and we will lose out on profit. Remember, it is better to lose out on profit then to get into a losing trade. Okay, enough gyaan for first answer on stock market :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hello traders, As you all know that I am an investor and trader also. so I am giving this answer from both the point of view and as per my own experience. There are two ways to become rich from stocks: Investment in stocksTrading in stocksInvestment in stocks: Investment in the stock market for the long term can make you rich. It requires large capital to be invested as well as a time frame. Getting rich with investment needs patience. Impatient people can\u2019t get money through investment. Suppose you have invested in metals like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Hindalco, jindalsteel when they were at 52 weeks low when the market was crashed due to COVID pandemic, you will get 100% to 500% returns in 2 years. But it requires patience. I bought jindalsteel around 75but I was impatient and booked at 120 only thinking that I am getting a 50% return in a month. So the main thing is patience which required in order to generate huge profits. Also, you need to invest your capital in the longer-term. I know so many people who became rich from the stock market, some of them earned lacs of rupees and lost too. Few people are happy with some extra monthly income and few people are not even satisfied after earning 5 lac per month from the stock market. I know many Traders/Arbitragers/Investors who earned huge money from the stock market and their routine is to gain something every day by their talent. Trading in stocks: Trading is what we do for the short term which involves risk but also generates large profit if you have the talent to use the momentum of the market. Whether the market is bullish or bearish, trading can be done on both sides in the F&O segment which requires less capital compared to investment for the long term. Trading can be beneficial in case you don\u2019t have large capital or you can\u2019t hold for a long time. See knowledge and skill in trading can give you the best results in the stock market and it comes with experience only. You have to learn everything in order to make money consistently. If you are capable enough to devote time and you have the patience to learn everything by investing time, you should learn everything to be self-dependent. But if you don\u2019t have patience and time and you want to earn without waiting, you should take the guidance from some SEBI registered advisors who can help you in trading. I said this thing many times that trading by yourself without having proper skills and knowledge can ruin your whole capital and through you out of this market. I can\u2019t say that I became Rich from the stock market because dreams are endless and there are no limits of expectations but yes I earned good money from the stock market. Reason for that is I have given more than 4 years to this market to learn everything, I tried to grasp more knowledge from my research analyst \u201cEQWIRES\u201d also.  I sold torrentpower today with the recommendation of Eqwires research analyst and booked 12000 of profit in just intraday trade.   This market can give us huge money if we are capable enough to take that. We have to be capable enough to earn in millions, explore different options, and keep on trying until you succeed. You can read my previous answer to improve your skill in trading. I hope you liked my answers and keep on sharing your feedbacks personally through Quora chat where I am always available to help you out. Thank You, Readers.

            "answer_text": "Speaking from a winner\u2019s PoV: \u201cInvest in ideas rather than instincts\u201d The stock market is a very volatile one with fluctuations happening in split seconds (yes, just grin and bear it). Investing in a certain shares calls in for a huge amount of risk. But then, if you want to achieve something, risk becomes an inevitable part of it. Stock market runs on it\u2019s very own mantra, \u201cNo risk. No gain\u201d. Buying a stock requires a lot of technical and fundamental analysis, sorting strategies, and speculating F&O. You must know a lot about the company\u2019s current affairs before investing in it. As I assume you are a newbie in the market,and I will give you some quick ideasabout stocks without going into a lot of details: Buy LOW/Sell HIGH: When you feel that that the company share price is about to rise after sustaining a steep fall over time. Then this is your time to invest. Let\u2019s say you invest with 5500 bucks on \u2018Magnum Ventures\u2019 at 5.50 per share, buying a total of 1000 shares and after some time it changes to 5.80 per share and you want to sell it. So, you sell it at 5800 and make a quick profit of 300 bucks.Sell HIGH/Buy LOW: Well, this concept is called as \u2018shorting\u2019 and may take a while to get through. When you feel that the prices are to go real low, you may take advantage of the situation. Here you do just the opposite in contrast to the former situation. You sell first(though you don\u2019t possess any stocks from that company before) and buy later when the share price drops. Suppose you feel that the CEO of \u2018Magnum Ventures\u2019 has met an accident and lost his life and hence the share price of this company will be suffering a fall until they appoint a new CEO. So, what you do is, sell first and when the price really goes low, you buy it again. The difference is your net profit.A note on holding period: There are generally 3 kinds of traders in the market.The Day Trader- A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward his positions. He is risk averse and does not like taking overnight risk. For example \u2013 He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day.Scalper- A type of a day trader. He usually trades very large quantities of shares and holds the stock for very less time with an intention to make a small but quick profit. For example \u2013 He would buy 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sell it 2212.1 at 9.16. He ends up making 1000/- profit in this trade. In a typical day, he would have placed many such trades. As you may have noticed a scalp trader is highly risk averse.Swing Trader- A swing trader holds on to his trade for slightly longer time duration, the duration can run into anywhere between few days to weeks. He is typically more open to taking risks. For example \u2013 He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12th June 2014 and sell it 2214 on 19th June 2014.A note on how to invest your money: It is best advised that you only invest 35% of your savings in the market, and only after building confidence give it a hike.If you want to invest low, you need patience. To make 5,000 bucks 10,000 takes pretty good holding time on the stock. This will not happen in a day generally, but over time, who knows.If you want to invest high, you need awareness. Here you cannot deny the fact that you are calling in for a lot of risk to your money. So, always be on your toes after investing. Keep the share price in check every now and then. And when you find a slight hike, sell it immediately.Diversify your portfolio. It is always better to invest your money in multiple stocks rather than putting everything in just one. Diversifying safeguards your capital to some extent. Even if, one share falls down the other that is getting a hike may balance it.Keep yourself aware and encouraged: To get into the market, first, you need to know a lot about it. Read articles from websites, books, newspapers, magazines, or whatever you feel like would enrich the mush of your brain. Follow books by Robert T. Kiyosaki, Warren Buffet, Donald Trump and their likes. See the market with their eyes, \u201cAn investment in knowledge, pays the best interest\u201d -Benjamin Franklin.HAPPY INVESTING.

            "answer_text": "The idea is to Start Early! The earlier you start the better your chancesof creating wealth in the Stock Market. And no matter what they feed youabout making a quick buck in the \u2018short run\u2019 everybody in the stockmarket knows that the real money is in the long run. For those who arepatient enough to wait it out. Having said that, not every company out there is worth waiting uponand many have proven to be Wealth Destroyers. For this purpose, one thumb rule to follow is- never invest in a companywhich you don\u2019t understand. You need to pick \u2018Wealth Creators\u2019. The following Snapshot is an Example of few a \u2018Wealth Creators\u2019 inthe indian Stock Market:  So how do you start finding companies worth investing? You can\u2019t suddenly decide one day and find your ideal pick. It is a process,for which you need to start by opening a Demat Account. Start readingInvesting websites, business newspapers, magazines or whatever you find comfortable . The idea is to familiarize yourself with all the macro and micro economic concepts that affect listed companies and the stock market as a whole. Once these concepts and jargons start making sense to you, you can try investing a part of your decided capital in \u201cBlue Chips\u201d The Concept of Blue Chips:  What is a 'Blue Chip' A blue chip is a nationally recognized, well-established and financially sound company. Blue chips generally sell high-quality, widely accepted products and services. Blue chip companies are known to weather downturns and operate profitably in the face of adverse economic conditions, which helps to contribute to their long record of stable and reliable growth.- Investopedia. Such companies have proven their mettle in the past and are known to weather the cyclical ups and downs in the economy over the years. The ideahere is to \u2018start safe\u2019. Since you are still a novice in the market, blue chipcompanies are your best bets to start out. For reasons such as:- Strong Market Share - Regular Dividends - Already established companies with a potential to grow further. Stock market consists of participants, and participants are human beings driven by two major emotions- \u201cFear of losing money\u201d & \u201cGreed for earning more\u201d.Hence, by selecting a blue chip company you can control the emotion offear to a great extent, at the same time not being too greedy( Yes, the ideais to find a balance between the two). After you have made a few \u2018safe bets\u2019 its time to get started with the \u2018real deal\u2019 Fundamental Analysis:  Fundamental Analysis (FA) is a holistic approach to study a business. When an investor wishes to invest in a business for the long term (say 3 \u2013 5 years) it becomes extremely essential to understand the business from various perspectives. It is critical for an investor to separate the daily short term noise in the stock prices and concentrate on the underlying business performance. Over the long term, the stock prices of a fundamentally strong company tend to appreciate, thereby creating wealth for its investors.- Zerodha Varsity Fundamental analysis is about understanding the company you are lookingto invest in from all possible perspectives for eg Financial Statements(P&L,Balance Sheet, Cash Flow), Ratio Analysis, Industry trends and other microand macro economic factors which might affect the company. The central idea is to estimate the \u201cintrinsic value\u201d of a Company and thenaccordingly make a decision to buy or not. If the intrinsic value is morethan its current market price than the company is a BUY and vice versa. Technical Analysis  Technical Analysis(TA) is a technique which is based on studying charts. Mainly, the \u2018candle stick\u2019 charts. TA helps us decide/recognize the trend of a particular stock based on the chart patterns created by the price movement in that stock. There are endless technical indicators available but as a long term investor, learning the basics of candlestick are enough, IMO. Technical Analysis is crucial for: -Recognizing the short term trend: Whether to purchase a stock or wait for its downtrend to end.- Finding an ideal \u2018entry point\u2019 -TA can help you identify the desiredentry points so that you dont end up buying a stock in its down trend. Concepts like Moving Averages, The Dow theory- Double Top and Doublebottom, 52 Week High-low, Fibonacci Retracement, Support & Resistance are worth understanding. Once you have Fundamental & Technical Analysis internalized youare well equipped to scope out your \u2018Ideal Picks'. Now, how do you do that? I have personally derived two methods- either find a 'MOAT' or look for 'Value'. MOAT : This is a term coined by the veteran investor Warren Buffet. It basicallyrefers to a company with a competitive advantage in a particular industryover its competitors. The company is so well placed in that particular industry that it is virtually impossible for any competitor to take over. Companies with a MOAT possess huge revenue numbers and areonly bound to grow. So, if you identify such a MOAT and its Fundamental and Technical Analysis checks out, you have arrivedat your potential \u2018Ideal pick\u2019 Examples of MOAT: - Wal-mart Stores Inc (US):  -Pidlite Industries (India)  If you check into the historical Stock price , Dividend & Bonus trends of these two companies, you will realize why they qualify as \u2018Moats\u2019 Value Investing:This concept involves identifying that company which might turn outto be a potential MOAT in the future. The idea is to identify early withthe help of Fundamental Analysis and intrinsic valuation. Some of thecommon indicators for a value pick: - Low Price to Equity Ratio (P/E)- Low to Price to Book Ratio (P/Bv)- Low Debt to Equity ratio-Good OP and NP margins- Positive Cashflow from operations.- Prudent investment in Capex(expansion) activities. A value pick, identified early can give multi fold returns but it alsocomes with a down side of uncertainty ie it may or may not be able to grow or sustain as its still a fairly small business at the point ofinvestment. Therefore, research your companies well enough till you start understandingthem. Make your own check list and make sure FA, TA, industry trends andall other factors check out before you decide to invest your hard earned money.Once you do, stay patient and watch your money work for you. ;) I hope this write up was able to convey the basic idea about the foundationrequired for successful long term Stock Picking.

            "answer_text": "One way to get rich from stocks is to bet on which direction they\u2019ll move. That is, trade options. Nothing fancy. Just buying Puts and Calls and then selling them and taking your profit. A Put gives you the right to sell the underlying asset for a predetermined price, known as the strike price. And a Call gives you the right to buy the underlying asset. Typically, traders buy Calls when they are bullish and believe the underlying stock will rise in price. Likewise, they tend to buy Puts when they are bearish and think the stock\u2019s price will fall. Options give you a way to leverage hundreds of shares of stocks and ETF shares without you having to buy the stock itself (which costs a lot more money), so they give you a way to profit from stocks without you buying the stocks and then hoping the stock\u2019s price won\u2019t plunge. But never put more than 10% of your account at risk into any one given trade. This is key to risk management. And stay away from the credit and debit spreads, and definitely stay away from short strangles (Google \u201cKaren the Supertrader\u201d). The only people who make money off those most of the time are the market makers and brokerage firms. Is it possible to make money with spreads (i.e. straddles, strangles, iron condors, butterflies, etc.)? Sure. Anything\u2019s possible. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s probable. I don\u2019t think highly of outfits that lure in people desperate for an income - usually those over age 50 who\u2019ve been permanently pushed out of the job market due to age discrimination and who can\u2019t afford to retire but are too young to draw a social security check - because most of the time, these spreads, which are touted as income-generating vehicles, end up costing more money than anticipated and loss of principal capital. With spreads, you only make money, which is narrowly limited by the premium you receive when opening the position, if the instrument moves only slightly in either direction and your contract expires out-of-the-money (OTM). But if the price moves too much in either direction, you run the risk of having the short leg of your spread going in-the-money (ITM), and then you run the risk of getting assigned (meaning you now have to find the money from somwhere to buy enough of the underlying asset). One Put or Call contract equals 100 shares of an underlying stock or exchange traded fund (ETF). You typically buy several contracts. So, keep that in mind in case you\u2019re assigned. So, stick with just buying Puts and Calls to start with. No short sales. Granted, you won\u2019t set the world on fire and not every trade will be a winner, but you won\u2019t lose everything either - mainly because you don\u2019t have to put as much capital at risk when buying options as you do when buying the stock outright.

            "answer_text": "There are some amazing answers in this thread, so I\u2019m going to skip the obvious and touch upon something I feel is very, very crucial for a successful investor. In fact, it separates the best from the rest.   Before addressing the question, let\u2019s do a small experiment and some number-crunching. Consider the following 3 stocks for the instance: Eicher MotorsSymphonyBajaj FinanceIf you have been investing in Indian equities, you would know that these are some of the best \u201cmulti-baggers\u201d in the past one-and-a-half or two decades. Of course, just like Rome, great companies weren\u2019t built in a day. Let\u2019s take a look at how long it\u2019s been since these companies were listed in the Indian exchanges (Some figures may be approximates):  Clearly, they\u2019ve been traded since a long, long time ago. Assuming someone invested a chunk of their wealth in any of these companies, it\u2019s not too far-fetched to assume that they\u2019d be wealthy now. But how, do you think, was their wealth created? In a linear fashion? Obviously not. Stocks move around a lot. Often, investors take crucial investment decisions when the stock has either rewarded them a lot or punished them a lot in the recent past. There\u2019s nothing wrong in it as such. It\u2019s simply human nature to respond to either high levels of euphoria or crushing stress. Let\u2019s take a look at how these stocks moved, both positively (Say >5% in a day) and negatively (Say <-5% in a day) during their journey to fortune: Eicher Motors  Symphony  Bajaj Finance  Can you guess what I\u2019m trying to get at here? On average, these stocks didn\u2019t do anything extraordinary 90% of the time. So, assuming that a successful investor has 50 years of active investing life, he is not required to do anything at all for 45 of them. This is not an isolated result. Take any great stock with a long history from any country in the world and I\u2019m willing to bet my head that this will hold true.  Mohnish Pabrai, the famous investor, once said: \u201cYou don\u2019t make money when you buy stocks. You don\u2019t make money when you sell stocks. You make money by waiting.\u201d  And he\u2019s right. Good investors trade because they have something to do. Bad investors trade because they have to do something. Now, I will not deny the fact that getting rich from investing in stocks requires a business sense, mathematical acumen and incremental capital. But underlying the very essence of \u2018making money\u2019 in stocks in the deceiving act of waiting. People don\u2019t get rich from stocks by understanding a business end-to-end. People don\u2019t get rich from stocks by being a math wiz. People don\u2019t get rich from stocks by starting out with a lot of capital. People get rich from stocks by sitting on their asses most of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "You can only become rich in your late 40s or 50s by investing in stock market, that too when you start investing in your early 20s (Unless your father is already a big shot). Its a bitter truth but if you see an example of any of the prominent investors, they got the lime light or generated substantial wealth only after 40\u201345 years of age. People often get attracted by the stories they hear of any investor making Rs. 100 crs from having nothing when they started but they often forget that it took atleast 20\u201330 years for that investor to build wealth. An investor pass through many breakdowns like any other entrepreneur. One has gone through dozens of losses and hundreds of regrets of lost opportunity due to wrong decision, 100s of annual reports to find \u2018one\u2019 stock and to keep cool when that \u2018one\u2019 stock incurs losses. Its an expertise which comes with time and lot of perseverance. There are multiple things which determines how can one be a successful investor and get rich. Discipline - Investing is a practice which requires lot of discipline as to stick to your principles and don\u2019 get carried away by the \u2018multibagger\u2019 stories. Trust me it is very difficult when only your stocks are not performing and you hear stories from the world gaining X times returns.Perseverance - Not to give up on failure and ability to withstand loss. This is very crucial when you are starting from scratch and don\u2019t have hereditary wealth. One should always pursue investing as a secondary profession till the time you accumulate substantial wealth as you need to pay your bills till then.Book loss at right time - Investors often get emotionally attached to their portfolio stocks and get stuck with it even if it has not performed well since long.Exit time - Most of the investors are very good at identifying stocks and investing in it, but what they fail is to identify when to exit and book profits. They hold on for ages though the stock has performed great in initial 2\u20133 years but stagnant thereafter.List is long, but the point I want to make is clear that like any other profession, investing is also about hard work, failure, perseverance, discipline etc and not all investors make it to the top league just as not all the startups are successful. No doubt returns are humongous and worth the effort it takes. Remember, one cannot reach the destination without loving or getting comfortable with the journey. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll say this. You can get rich from them, but you can also lose all your money. I advocate putting money in index funds unless your job is trading stocks. If it isn't your full time profession you shouldn't put all your money behind it. For me, it's not my full time profession so I put away most of my investment in index funds like the s&p 500, then maybe pick a few stocks I personally like (maybe 5% of my investable income just for fun and to support companies I believe in). And if you do this you'll get rich over decades, not overnight. If you're trying to get rich overnight in the market you're probably going to lose. Having said that, if you're dead set on it, is maybe wait until a company that you can't imagine not getting bailed out or surviving plummets in share value then buy all of that. If the market crashes and google drops down to 50/share (not gonna happen but near with me) or Coca Cola drops to 5/share, buy the shit out of those and wait patiently. But making money in the market for investors, not full time traders, is about patience and time and compounding interest, not about picking a penny stock. But there are better ways to make money than picking stocks and all require hard work. If you're trying to get around hard work you should re adjust your mindset. Even if you get lucky without hard work you'd be miserable with money And that's no way to live either. ",

            "answer_text": " Radha Kishan Damani or RK Dami is a Mumbai based billionaire investor, businessman, and owner of the mega-retail chain stores \u201cD-Mart\u201d in India. The veteran investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala considers him as his guru (mentor) in the Indian share market. Here are some interesting facts about RK Damani Current Age: 66 (Born 1954)Net worth: $15.5 BillionOccupation: Trader, Investor, BusinessmanStatus: Self-Made BillionaireAccording to Forbes\u2019s latest Richest Indian\u2019s list, RK Damani is the 7th richest person in India, with a net worth of over $15.5 Billion, which is equivalent to over Rs 116,200 Crores. Background RK Damani does not consider himself as a highly educated person. He dropped out of college while pursuing B Com from the University of Mumbai. Before entering the stock market, RK Damani had a small \u2018ball-bearing\u2019 business. However, after the death of his father, he started working as a stockbroker in his family business. He was 32 at that time. Therefore, unlike most tech entrepreneurs who start their startup journey in their 20s, RK Damani was a little late to join this journey, still was able to make it big. \u2014 Stock Market Career Although RK Damani started his career as a stockbroker, he soon understood that if he wants to make real money from the market, then he needed to trade his own money in the market, instead of being just a broker. And soon he started trading his in the Indian stock market. RK Damani made a lot of profits from his trading in stocks. He was a very flexible trader and believed in making profits using different market swings. For example, during the Harshad Mehta scam, he made a lot of money by \u2018Short-selling\u2019 the stocks, which was not common at that time. However, after getting influenced by value investor Chandrakant Sampat, later RK Damini changed his approach. He shifted to long-term value investing. RK Damani made a lot of money by investing and holding multi-baggers stocks. A few best-performing stocks from his portfolio are VST Industries, Sundaram Finance, Indian Cement, and Blue Dart. He also invested in VST Industries at an average of Rs 85 and it is currently trading at Rs 3,400. Further, India cement gave a return of +115%. Some other companies in his portfolio are Century textiles, Trent, VB Holdings, 3M India, United Breweries, TV Today Network, Jubilant FoodWorks, etc. \u2014 The career as a Businessman  RK Damani has been very interested in consumer retails for a long time. That\u2019s why he opened D-mart in 2002 with one store in suburban Mumbai. Nevertheless, being a value investor, this was a very planned move by him. In March 2017, D-Mart went public by offering its IPO, under the name of the parent company- \u2018Avenue Supermarts\u2019. The IPO was a big hit. Avenue supermart offered its shares to the public at a price of Rs 299 and got listed at Rs 604 after over-subscription. Currently, the shares of Avenue Supermarts are trading at Rs 2,372 per share, as of 30 April 2020. Further, by 2019, D-Mart has over 176 stores spread across Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, National Capital Region, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Daman and Diu, and Punjab. Dmart stores generated a total revenue of Rs 19,916 Crores in the year ending March 2019.  (Fig: Dmart Stores Success Story) Other Facts about RK Damani RK Damani considers himself as both a trader and an Investor. He trades in market swing and invests when he\u2019s getting long-term value. Personally, Mr. Damani lives a very simple life. He is known as \u2018Mr. White and White\u2019 because most of the time he wears a simple white shirt and white trousers. Besides, he avoids media and public gatherings. That\u2019s all for this RK Damani success story. I hope it motivates you towards your own success journey. Let me know whose story should we cover in the next article by commenting below. Happy Investing. ",

            "answer_text": "Amitabh Bachchan is turning to be the Big B for Indian stock market as well. Learning from the initial setbacks and mistakes,Bachchan is coming out as an investor we should follow. He started off his investment career in stock market in 2011 by investing in unknown penny stocks which turned out to be disastrous.  In July 2011, Amitabh Bachchan jumped into Birla Pacific Medspa IPO, a company which is engaged in the lucrative business of running a Spa and promoted by the high profile Yash Birla, a person from Birla family with zero business acumen.(Guys.. just search for Yash Birla in Google and you will find interesting guidance from Google). Our poor Big B smelled a multibagger in Birla Pacific Medspa and bought 16,75,000 shares (1.49% of the total equity) by investing Rs. 1.67 crore at a rate of nearly Rs.10. Soon after listing, Birla Pacific Medspa spiked to an all-time high of Rs. 30, trebling his investment. But things went wrong from there. If you are brave enough, you can check the current price of Birla Pacific Medspa. Then Bachchan tried his luck in Fineotex Chemicals. After its IPO price of Rs. 72, Fineotex Chemicals jumped to 350 levels. When it started sliding, Amitabh Bachchan thought it is a good opportunity to increase the stake and bought 3 lakh shares between Rs. 170 to Rs. 150 per share. Currently it is trading @ Rs. 42. Till now he has not sold a single stock and holding nearly 5% of the total equity,waiting patiently for revival. Seeing these setbacks, a famous stock broker said-\"He should not be investing in penny stocks and these unknown firms. He should not be wasting his money. A person of his stature should invest in blue-chip stocks. A regular trader can experiment with penny stocks. There are several other investment opportunities which Bachchan should explore\". And yes, he learned from the mistakes and for the third time, got it right. The Amitabh Bachchan bought 92,030 shares of Neuland Labs. At the CMP of Rs. 424, the investment has given 800% gain in the past four year. Amitabh Bachchan Latest Stock Portfolio 2018  In 2011, being the brand ambassador for Just Dial, Bachchan was given 62,794 shares at a throw away price of Rs 10 each. Originally, Bachchan's 62,794 shares were valued at Rs 6.27 lakhs. The value of these shares spurted to Rs 3.83 crore on the debut day after IPO in 2013, as per its listing day price of Rs 611.45 each. Currently the stock is trading @ Rs.535 His fourth pick, Stampede Capital, an unknown company to many, was a surprise to all. He bought the shares in several lots between 14th May 2014 and 6th June 2014. His first bulk purchase of 110,000 shares was on 14th May 2014 at a paltry price of Rs. 88 per share. In 2015 Stampede was trading at Rs. 520. But since then stock is on a downward movement and now trading at Rs 22, after its face value come down to Rs. 2. Stampede Capital has molded itself into a global financial technology house specializing in \"Automation of Knowledge Work\" and Cloud Computing for financial markets.  Sources: Google ",

            "answer_text": "One of the richest men in the world, Warren Buffet, has a rule on investing in the stock market: \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful.\u201d When the economic recession happened, Buffet went on a buying spree\u2014picking up stocks of solid companies left and right. While people were fearful, he was brave. Fortunately, there are general measures you can take to get rich from stocks. The underlying value of your investments is based on what others are willing to pay for it. To that end, how much people like buying stocks will be the driver of your stock returns for years and years. Only over the long haul, will stocks perform based on their fundamental drivers like the earnings and outlook of the company. Investment performance is something you don't want to chase. As a matter of fact, they've found that the more frequently you trade in and out of market, the worse you perform. Spend your energy on those investment factors you can control: when you start, how much you invest, how you're allocated, and how you'll be taxed (to a degree). Just leave the actual market performance alone. You cannot influence it. You cannot predict it. Focus your energies on the controllable stuff! In the end, your investments will perform better as you automate your deposits, and then do NOTHING. What's not to like about that?   ",

The mistake people make is they see rich people in the stock market and assume that\u2019s how they get wealthy. Its not. They use the stock market to store surplus capital while it is not in an asset. Normal people chase cash, rich people chase assets and assets capture cash. I\u2019m 15, so I know where you\u2019re coming from, so let me tell you about me, just so you know its possible. At 11, I started my business. In four years I have accrued over 150 grand in net worth and have become a top selling amazon author. I have been on national media all across Canada and the USA, won young entrepreneur of the year from our universities college of commerce, and have met people from all walks of life and business even up to government officials. So it can be done, but not on the stock market. You need to become an innovator, which is why I wrote my first book. I wanted to teach kids like me how to think in a way that will create innovative products which will create help for people and personal wealth for you. If you are young, start now with your own business. I started by mowing lawns and using that money to go to the next step. You can start with nothing and make it big even as a kid. This is how you get rich. ",

However, for common retail investors this strategy turned out to be terrible as their investment used to become worthless. ",

            "answer_text": "Getting rich from stocks, eh? The stock market is a wonderful place. The bottom line is that stocks are capable of making people filthy rich, but it isn't easy or straightforward. There are a few things which are crucial to people getting rich from stocks. Warren Buffett, one of the most famous investors of all time, started early but made over 99% of his wealth after he hit the age of 50 years. So, always remember that it is never too late to get filthy rich. Don't be afraid to take your profits whenever you can. Profits aren't really gained unless you sell, right? Whether they be marginal or complete, take the profit when it feels right. Another key thing about people getting rich from stocks is that they do intense research before making a decision. They study the stock market patterns, even though it may be unpredictable, the knowledge can still be used to get an upper hand on your next investments. Planning, research, and careful execution is what makes people rich from stocks. People who know how to invest in stocks don't believe in talk. They know that everything and anything that anyone says is most likely overhyped or under-hyped. They only believe what they see, and they only trust the actions of the stock they're tracking. ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking from a winner\u2019s PoV: \u201cInvest in ideas rather than instincts\u201d The stock market is a very volatile one with fluctuations happening in split seconds (yes, just grin and bear it). Investing in a certain shares calls in for a huge amount of risk. But then, if you want to achieve something, risk becomes an inevitable part of it. Stock market runs on it\u2019s very own mantra, \u201cNo risk. No gain\u201d. Buying a stock requires a lot of technical and fundamental analysis, sorting strategies, and speculating F&O. You must know a lot about the company\u2019s current affairs before investing in it. As I assume you are a newbie in the market,and I will give you some quick ideas about stocks without going into a lot of details: Buy LOW/Sell HIGH: When you feel that that the company share price is about to rise after sustaining a steep fall over time. Then this is your time to invest. Let\u2019s say you invest with 5500 bucks on \u2018Magnum Ventures\u2019 at 5.50 per share, buying a total of 1000 shares and after some time it changes to 5.80 per share and you want to sell it. So, you sell it at 5800 and make a quick profit of 300 bucks.Sell HIGH/Buy LOW: Well, this concept is called as \u2018shorting\u2019 and may take a while to get through. When you feel that the prices are to go real low, you may take advantage of the situation. Here you do just the opposite in contrast to the former situation. You sell first(though you don\u2019t possess any stocks from that company before) and buy later when the share price drops. Suppose you feel that the CEO of \u2018Magnum Ventures\u2019 has met an accident and lost his life and hence the share price of this company will be suffering a fall until they appoint a new CEO. So, what you do is, sell first and when the price really goes low, you buy it again. The difference is your net profit.A note on holding period(acc to ZERODHA): There are generally 3 kinds of traders in the market.The Day Trader- A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward his positions. He is risk averse and does not like taking overnight risk. For example \u2013 He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day.Scalper- A type of a day trader. He usually trades very large quantities of shares and holds the stock for very less time with an intention to make a small but quick profit. For example \u2013 He would buy 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sell it 2212.1 at 9.16. He ends up making 1000/- profit in this trade. In a typical day, he would have placed many such trades. As you may have noticed a scalp trader is highly risk averse.Swing Trader- A swing trader holds on to his trade for slightly longer time duration, the duration can run into anywhere between few days to weeks. He is typically more open to taking risks. For example \u2013 He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12th June 2014 and sell it 2214 on 19th June 2014.A note on how to invest your money: It is best advised that you only invest 35% of your savings in the market, and only after building confidence give it a hike.If you want to invest low, you need patience. To make 5,000 bucks 10,000 takes pretty good holding time on the stock. This will not happen in a day generally, but over time, who knows.If you want to invest high, you need awareness. Here you cannot deny the fact that you are calling in for a lot of risk to your money. So, always be on your toes after investing. Keep the share price in check every now and then. And when you find a slight hike, sell it immediately.Diversify your portfolio. It is always better to invest your money in multiple stocks rather than putting everything in just one. Diversifying safeguards your capital to some extent. Even if, one share falls down the other that is getting a hike may balance it.Keep yourself aware and encouraged: To get into the market, first, you need to know a lot about it. Read articles from websites, books, newspapers, magazines, or whatever you feel like would enrich the mush of your brain. Follow books by Robert T. Kiyosaki, Warren Buffet, Donald Trump and their likes. See the market with their eyes. You may also want to visit Zerodha Varsity, one of the leading discount brokers in India, to get hands on their phenomenal ever growing articles. Always remember, \u201cAn investment in knowledge, pays the best interest\u201d -Benjamin Franklin.HAPPY INVESTING. Hope this helps !!  ",

            "answer_text": "The principle of successful equity portfolio management is very simple: buy stocks that go up, and sell them when they\u2019ve gone up. However, putting that into practice is difficult. We\u2019ve collected a few nuggets of experience and wisdom here, some obvious, some not-so-obvious, that\u2019ll help you think about how you invest and how you shape your portfolio:  1. First, there are no geniuses in the business world. There is hard work, experience, and not a little luck. So, don\u2019t make big bets early in your investment career; you\u2019ll make mistakes, learn with small amounts of money and lower risks until you\u2019ve gained that experience. Don\u2019t trust anyone who says that they are a genius, and don\u2019t invest in a stock because you think the promoter is a genius. Follow investment professionals with long careers and learn from them. 2. Stockmarkets have cycles \u2013 short term, long term, and generational. Investing styles change (value, growth, momentum). Decision and research technology changes (from reading yesterday\u2019s newspaper, to machine learning and big data). But whatever the environment, whatever technique you find most useful, always remember that the price of a stock, or the level of a market, is determined by a simple, visceral battle between buyers and sellers. Buyers anticipate profits (\u2018greed\u2019). Sellers feel that the risk of holding is too high (\u2018fear\u2019). Fear and greed are eternal. They\u2019re even inherent in computer models, which are either programmed to reflect human expertise, or reacting to human activity. A really experienced investor is always finely tuned to the changing balance of fear and greed affecting them. 3. Most of us have subliminal (or not so subliminal!) feelings and opinions anchored to the history of our investments. But investment is only ever in the future. It starts now, and ends only when you realise the investment (in part or in full). What you paid for an investment, whether you\u2019ve received dividends, why you originally decided to invest\u2026 none of this matters. They are irrecoverable costs or experiences. This principle of sunk cost is one of the clearest and most useful investment guidelines you can apply. With a blank sheet of paper, today, right now, would you want to hold this investment? Is it a good investment from this point on (and, in a portfolio context, does it justify displacing other potential investments)? This is one of the hardest rules to follow. We don\u2019t want to acknowledge a loss-making investment. We may want to sell an investment that\u2019s done well and put cash in the bank, even though it is still a great proposition. We might remember how smart we felt when we bought it, or feel we put so much research effort in we should hold it. We\u2019d like to prove we\u2019re right. We\u2019d like to prove our colleagues wrong. But each time you review your portfolio, look at it as if it were a brand new portfolio, judge its merits accordingly, and you\u2019ll be a better investor. 4. You can\u2019t control when the market will give you a return on your investment. You have to be invested. Staying on the sidelines waiting for the right moment, doesn\u2019t work. There\u2019s evidence to suggest that up to 40% of your annualised return over a 10-year period comes from only 10 trading days, and that 2/3 comes from only 20 trading days\u2026 but you don\u2019t know which are the \u201cbig win\u201d days until they\u2019ve happened. Similarly, if you have an opinion about an investment, unless you express that opinion by owning the stock, it really doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re proved right. You have to be there. This may seem a really obvious comment, but many investors do try to time their entry and exit into the market. Most professionals would prefer to stay invested. 5. Anything that you can measure is in the past. As an investor, you are interested only in the period from now, until the moment you exit the investment \u2013 i.e., the future. Of course it\u2019s impossible to quantify the future! But do not place too much reliance on data, on history, on quantified risk models; anything that relies on measured experience can only tell you about the past, about history. Conversely, qualitative information has a better chance of giving you pointers to how the future might look. For example, reading up on the board of directors of a company, on the outlook for its industry, or newspaper articles, can create a holistic picture of what the company is like; this may well feel like a subjective opinion, but a well-researched subjective opinion is likely to be more insightful than a spreadsheet full of historic data analysis. 6. And finally, many of our members are telling us that this is the time to move to active management \u2013 picking your stocks carefully and creating a thoughtful portfolio. Indexed investment has become huge, and perhaps now the dominant influence on markets (by some measures, more than $4 trillion is invested in stocks through index investment). There are good reasons for this, and certainly for many investors this is the most appropriate way to buy stocks. But an index fund will buy a stock just because it\u2019s in the index, without regard for value or prospects. That $4 tn is, in effect, dumb money, and is creating huge value distortions in stocks globally. For investors that have the ability, this is an excellent time to be picking stocks carefully, or investing in active mutual funds. Invest wisely and with common sense! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi There, Behind every Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Vijay Kedia, there are many failure stories too. And all these rich investors have become rich by holding onto their stock through thick and thin. We embrace such success stories and feel that getting rich from the stock market is extremely easy. Sadly, it isn\u2019t. One has to go through a lot of pain in order to get rich from the stock market. Let me talk about the dark side of getting rich from the stock market. Consider the case of Kotak Mahindra Bank. Re.1 invested with Mr. Uday Kotak (Managing Director, KMB) in 1985 would be worth Rs.2 Lakh today.  Let me make it sound a little more fanciful. With lots of ups and downs in 33 years, Rs.1 Lakh invested in Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) would be worth 2,000 Crore. That\u2019s an astonishing rise of 1,99,99,900%. Really amazing. Isn\u2019t it? Besides, who doesn\u2019t love to own such companies? Almost all of us. And yet, a majority of us fail to grasp such exemplary returns. Why? Because owning such companies can turn out to be real nightmares during the holding period. The fear that erupts inside us after seeing a decline in stock price outpowers the conviction with which we had bought the stock in the very first place. Thus, the fear makes us sell it even if its primary business is fundamentally strong. In fact, under panic, we fail to analyze the capability of the management that works day and night to make it really successful. During the 2008-Recession, it lost its value by 84.9%. Post-recession, it took more than 5 years to reclaim its 2008 peak. Not only this. At least on 6 occasions, the stock fell down by more than 50%. Around 73% of the time, during its journey, it stayed below its previous all-time high open price. Besides, it tasted the aftermaths of Kargil War, Asian Currency Criss, the Dot-Com Bubble Crash, 2008-Recession and other global key events that made investors pee in their pants. The pain of holding a stock lies in the fact that it can face a drawdown in extreme double digits. That too for a long period of time. Sometimes, it may never even recover within a stipulated timeframe. The other times, it may test your patience by staying stagnant. Be it the adhesive big player Pidilite or biscuit maker Britannia. They all have fallen down in the past. Thanks and Regards, Dhruv Girdhar, RichifyMeClub ",

            "answer_text": "By working hard. Most of the people are doing their endorsement here. That's fine actually. Everyone does that. I have done it too in many answers. But some questions are such that you don't feel like taking advantage of such questions because many people, many genuine and innocent people will be reading it. Let me introduce myself first. I am trader with an experience of last 2 years in intraday trading. I specialize in intraday trading. In these last two years I have learned a lot of things, had conversations with a lot of people especially in the last week because of my profession. Actually I started training people. So, in an answer I wrote, that please share your bad experiences with advisory /trainers /traders. And guess what, the next day my Whatsapp was filled up with 562 messages sharing their experiences. But no one wants me to use their name. Some don't want me share the story even. No idea what scares them. And the most common thing in it was - they approached the concerned person who they state cheated them in one way or the other on quora. That literally gave me goosebumps. Because, now I understand, why can't people trust anyone these days. I provide online as well as offline training. Online through one on one sessions. I provided personal session and attention for each topic to everyone. No I am not endorsing myself, let me complete. I was always offended when people used to doubt me. But when I read those stories, I understood, that you can not trust anyone on quora too. I am just writing my heart out here. I know this is not the right question for this. But let it be. The most surprising thing, many people handed over their capital (which in most cases were the savings of their life) to big names on quora in greed of sharing profits hoping they will trade for them. Foolish. I know. But happens. We all make mistakes. We all trust the wrong people at one time of our life. But the most important thing that I learnt from all this was - that what I want from my trading /teaching career. I want people to remember me with happiness and blessings, whenever they hear my name - I want them to think good things and not release any bad vibrations. I want them to remember me with their outmost love and blessings that this girl helped them with all her sincerety and dedication and honesty. I think that is how I will get rich through stocks. That for me, will be richness. Impractical answer. I know. But sometimes in life you need to be impractical, over sensitive and dumb in order to not sell your soul for the so called richness of this paper money. Yes I know. We need money to survive. I am a trader that's why it's easy for me to earn money and this and that. But I mean it. For once, just think with your heart and let your brain take the back seat. Donot do wrong to anyone for this paper money. If you can and if you have the capability to teach anyone/work for anyone, then only take their responsibility or else just back step and let someone who can do all the work. This is how you can get rich from stocks.       This is how I'm getting richer from stocks. Richer with love, respect and good people. Believe me, no endorsement. Just trying to make a point. \u2665\ufe0f ",

Be responsible for your own money. No one else can make you rich!! Stock Market has given loads of opportunities to make money to serious players, and yes millions of people have made a lot of money from it. But again, you need to be patient and wise and do your own hardwork. Do not treat the stock market as a Casino, it is not a place for Luck. You can only get lucky here a few times, you need hard work to make money consistently. Even then people loose money but they recover it over time. Gamblers will always loose over time. Do not be a sore looser, if you lost money, it is your own fault. Only those who learn from their mistakes and come back smarter will make money. Do not blame the stock market for your mistakes! It is not easy to make money anywhere in the world. Why give only stock markets a bad name. If it is not your cup of tea, stay away. Either be in it, or not at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Google Alerts - Monitor the Web for interesting new contentSet up alerts for company name, domain, competitors, products, services, and so on. Set up IFTTT networks to aggregate updates from all social profiles of companies you are investing in. Contact the CEOs, PR managers, or marketing teams to learn more about their business and plans for growth. A company with no growth plan probably won\u2019t be a winner. Be active on trading forums/discussions/groups. Get to know the C-level Exec\u2019s previous experience. If the core team is incompetent and has made some very silly decisions in the past then you should be sure to avoid them - unless you want to capitalize on that incompetence and short their stocks. Look at Google Trends and news on the industry. Keep tabs on what is going on. In the old days people used to read newspapers. These days access to information is plentiful online through the web. Google Trends- Use Google Trends. Find mentors who are successful traders. Go as high up as you can. Ideally someone who wins more than he/she loses. Learn from their mistakes. Have more than 1 mentor to see things in different ways. If you are good with technology (tech savvy) then there are investors who aren\u2019t tech savvy that you could potentially work with for a win-win (unless they prefer to hire an intern). You\u2019ll need a strong business acumen and some common sense. Read lots of books on investing/stock trading, learn from mistakes, and just do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Discipline trumps conviction. The most important thing you can do is avoid losses. Noticing the bloat in a stock or the market and stepping aside or going short and holding for a collapse or buying low and waiting for a surge and then having the discipline to sell when everyone else thinks it\u2019s a great buying opportunity. (Or buy when everyone says to sell). Go against the grain. Sell options and never ever buy them. Study a stock for a while before buying it. Study it\u2019s history and historic volatility. Never buy stocks on an impulse or because someone else told you to. Buy stocks you are familiar with or have become familiar with. Use time to your advantage - never let time pressure you to sell or buy. Study patterns and candlesticks - be patient - don\u2019t try to guess the market - follow the trend. Things I\u2019ve learned. Really hard to call tops Really hard to call bottoms The longer a pattern or trend stays in tact, the more volatile the next move will be. Stay more patient than the pattern. Never look at a day or a week or a month as an end all. Great months can have terrible follow up and vice versa. You will never stop learning - there are thousands of companies worldwide, each with their own market - find what works for you but remember that whatever feeling you have about a stock, there is the opposite side. Every time you sell, someone is buying and vice versa.. never forget that or think you can outsmart the market. It takes a lifetime to master the market and only a day to lose it all. Don\u2019t be arrogant or egotistical, the most successful investors are super humble because they know what arrogance brings. ",

            "answer_text": "Buy low, sell high. Or, conversely, sell high, buy low. Simple, no? No, not really. Many stocks follow patterns. A simple example might be that lots of people buy pumpkins in October, November, and December; no one really buys them in May. So, in May and June, buy up all the futures for Pumpkins for the fall, then sell them in the fall when they are higher. Okay, so futures and stocks are not really that simple. There is a nearly infinite number of variables, so you have to do a lot of research. You have to time things correctly. Had I invested in Apple in the 80s, I might well have sold off in the 90s when Apple looked to be on the way out\u2014that would have been a mistake in the long run, but unless I have huge amounts of investments, I might have needed to make that decision. There is a famous story about some guy who needed cash to pay his rent or something like that, so he sold his Apply shares for a few hundred dollars way back in the beginning; his shares would be worth 50\u201360 Billion now. So: research on stock fluctuations, research on the market, understanding buying trends, foresight, hindsight, luck, the willingness and ability to take take losses when they occur, knowing when enough is enough. Good luck! ",

Investment Strategy: \u201cI buy lesser-known, high quality businesses to derive maximum portfolio value. I don\u2019t shy away from smaller companies like other \u2018knowledgeable people\u2019 do. And I don\u2019t buy a lot of great companies with clean balance sheet, honest management and clear business visibility. If you invest in such companies, even bank FDs would beat your portfolio returns.\u201d \u2013 Porinju Veliyath Porinju Veliyath is known as a small cap investor.

Most of the companies in his portfolio do not pass muster with large institutional investors, however, has given him multiple times returns.

            "answer_text": "Ans: 10 Steps to Becoming a Stock Market Millionaire  Putting resources into the securities exchange is an approach to make something beyond some additional money. Actually, with the correct methodology and the correct abilities, putting even a little in the financial exchange can put you headed straight toward winning millions. Turning into a financial exchange mogul isn't a simple assignment and is anything but an accomplishment that will occur without any forethought, however it is conceivable as demonstrated by a few of my understudies like Tim G. furthermore, Michael G. In the event that you need to turn into a financial exchange tycoon, at that point here are 10 of the most demonstrated tips to arriving at your objectives, and the profit you have constantly needed. 1. Focus on Hot Stocks Hitting New Highs As you begin with your financial exchange dreams, try to concentrate on hot stocks. Do your exploration, investigate their examples and spot your attention on stocks that are as of now developing as you intend to stay with them until they arrive at new statures. Try not to hope to stocks hitting new lows.  2. You Can Buy and Short Sell There are a few people who think they need a positively trending business sector to get rich. This isn't the situation. Try not to overlook short selling. You don't need to clutch a stock for quite a while to win a benefit. Simply take a gander at the achievement sometime merchants have; they are the embodiment of acquiring off of short selling.  3. Cut Your Losses Quickly On the off chance that you need to be effective in the market, remove your sense of self totally from the circumstance. On the off chance that you face a set back, cut your misfortunes and proceed onward quick. Try not to harp on your disappointment, however rather look to what's to come. You will come up short, so be readied and simply be prepared to proceed onward.  4. Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Take Partial or All Profits The thing about your income is that they aren't generally benefits until you take them. Try not to be reluctant to take halfway benefits or take benefits too rapidly. The market changes quick; it is OK to get out when you feel it is correct and take the benefits that you can.  5. Embrace New Technologies The world is changing and it is evolving quick, so you should be changing with it in the event that you need to be effective in the financial exchange. Presently can't time to fear innovation organizations. There are the organizations of things to come. Grasp new advances and plans of action and be eager to remain in front of the time as you look to your speculations.  6. Stick with Liquid Stocks On the off chance that you need to acquire some genuine pay, at that point it is ideal to adhere to fluid, profoundly exchanged stocks. Attempt to avoid illiquid stocks no matter what. These are stocks that make enormous guarantees yet tend not to upswing.  7. Don\u2019t Believe Anything the Stock Says In the exchanging scene, actions speak louder than words. Try not to tune in to guarantees or promotion, look just on the activity of the stock. Do your examination investigate how that stock is performing and what move it is truly making. This is the means by which you will recognize what's in store from the stock later on.  8. Don\u2019t Diversify and Don't Use Leverage Try not to get too up the creek without a paddle. Such a large number of individuals talk about differentiating and utilizing influence. This can't approach to gain millions. I normally hold each to two stocks in turn and don't utilize over 30% of my advantages in my ventures, that is it.  9. You Don't Need to Buy Bottom, Sell Top Such a significant number of new dealers are centered around the familiar aphorism that you have to purchase directly at the base and sell directly at the top. Indeed it would be pleasant on the off chance that you could as that would mean the most benefits conceivable, however you simply need to concentrate on the meet of the move, not really the top and base. You can get in during the center and still make a few  10. Always Make a Plan In the event that you need to genuinely discover long haul achievement in the securities exchange, the best thing you can do is to go into each exchange with a quite certain arrangement. Before you begin make a particular hazard/reward profile for what you request of your speculations and stick with it regardless. Never stray from the arrangement. Acquiring millions in the financial exchange can appear to be an overwhelming errand, yet it is one that you can accomplish, on the off chance that you follow these means and remember this devoted methodology. On the off chance that you set yourself up for mishaps and comprehend the difficulties that can accompany this contributing system then you may simply end up coming consistently nearer to arriving at your contributing objectives, similarly as my tycoon understudies have.

My son observed that the local youth football and high school teams switched from Nike jerseys to UnderArmor and the UnderArmor were better. He noticed that more of his friends at school had an iPhone, nearly 2:1 over Samsung. He also noticed that most of his friends watched Netflix and not cable. He invested in what he knew. ",

            "answer_text": "The people who get rich from stock markets are the one \u201cAlways stay invested, no matter what\u201d. Because Equity is the best asset class that generates higher returns than any other financial instruments. People make emotional decisions often and make investment mistakes, during bear markets due to fear people pull out funds from Equity and during bull markets peak, they put in more funds due to greed. But if you check the historical data of Indian markets, bull markets always run longer, 4\u20135 years on an average. Whereas bear markets are very short, where on an average the market stays down for 12\u201318 months only. Market cycle:-Major tops/bottom are made after the markets have been going up/down for an extended long period of Time. Indian Market follow the 8 year cycle , Major Tops are formed after 8 year, 1992,2000,2008 have been the major tops in Indian market.  Lets take an example: A Major Top which was formed in March 2015 @9119 from where we have corrected till 7400 a correction of almost 20%. Any market which corrects more than 20% is technically in Bear market. But time alone will not give you the sufficient information you need to identify market tops/bottom. All of the key identities must be in place at or near major market tops/bottom 2.Sentiment: Bullish Sentiment will always be high at or near market tops and Bearish Sentiment near market Bottom . Have you noticed during the recent rally many were giving higher targets 12,000 Nifty.Extreme sentiment is always an attribute of a market turn or top but, by itself, is not a determinant of the turn.One has to understand that Market is King, we need to act accordingly as per price moves. Happy Trading Looking at technical standpoint of view nifty faces mild support around 10,100 levels if it breaches the next big support is being held at 8500\u20138600 which is not that easy to be breached .  SO let\u2019s not time markets and just go ahead with SIP. Since markets are looking very strong for a bull run. Once you miss bus you will never be able to chat it! Happy Investing! Lets take example how a wealth has been created in the stocks: Share price of Bajaj finance in the year 2009 is Rs 6.50/- If you had invested around 1.5 lakh, you would have around 23k shares. Share price of Bajaj finance right now is Rs 1878/- 23000 \u00d7 1738 = 40,974,000 Roughly around 4 crore in 9 years. So if you invest in a right share and wait you will earn a lot.

            "answer_text": "Investing in the stock market is a great way to grow wealth because it allows you to increase your income with no additional work on your part. It is like you're starting a business, but without needing to spend all of the long hours, deal with hiring employees, or need to leave the security of a regular paycheck. It is not a fast process, however, unless you are wealthy to start with since the amount you increase your income is proportional to the amount you invest. If you're not starting with a multi-million dollar portfolio, you need to rely on the power of compounding to build wealth. This process works slowly, but will get you there given enough time. To see the power, try putting a penny on the first square of a chess board, then doubling it every square. For the first several squares you'll be placing only pennies, but by the time you reach the last square, you'll be putting more than a million dollars down. To grow wealthy in the stock market, you must free up some of your cash flow to allow you to start making regular investments. The easiest way to invest is to setup a mutual fund account, which will require a few thousand dollars to start, but then will allow you to send in whatever you can. Start with a large-cap index fund like an S&P 500 fund. Once you have maybe $10,000 built up, which may take a few years if you're sending in only a couple of hundred dollars per month, sell half, pay taxes on any gains you have had, and buy shares of a small- cap index fund. After that, send in additional contributions to whichever fund you have less invested in at a time. Keep this up, and keep reinvesting any gains you have, and you\u2019ll grow wealthy in 20 to 30 years, depending on how much you contribute. This is just a summary. For more details, check out this article. You should also start reading books on investing, focusing on those with a long term investing approach like the Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Investing, since this is the strategy that actually works.

            "answer_text": "Yes. However, the main point of stock investing is to compound your capital and earns passively. You can\u2019t really get rich only off of stocks, but you can use them, in combination with other investment tools, to invest wisely. Even small numbers turn out into something big. For example, if you are to start with a 10k investment, and you add $1000 dollars to it, every year for 30 years, and you let it compound at 8%, you\u2019ll end up with more than $220k. And you didn\u2019t have to do much to get that, unless waiting a lotta time. If you\u2019re looking to become rich in a very short period of time, using stocks, then I am afraid that you only have a few, very risky, options, such as trading. The bottomline is that stocks ain\u2019t exactly the best tool to get rich \u201cquickly\u201d. They are an excellent tool to steady park and grow your capital. As I report on my book, I use specific stocks, as I\u2019ve got specific goals. I think that the best way to go, for most people, it to invest passively into major ETFs and let the capital compound for years.

            "answer_text": "Simple.. Being Robotic, Utter Disciplined and Kill Emotions during Trading, makes you the Rich You Or Anyone Always Wants to Be\u2026.  Well I read Most of the Answers Below\u2026 I din\u2019t find more people speaking about Discipline.. In other words Risk Management.. Read My Answer: Ashok Kumar N Rao's answer to Is it possible to get rich on the stock market with options trading? Are there any examples of individuals who got rich this way? See If You Run Behind Being Rich, which every one does entering the stock market, Market will CHEW Your Riches and Throw You Out! You Can Become a Millionaire in Days :) , when you were previously a Billionaire.. The reverse is not always true :) Any small strategy[1] you may find on the net, youtube, etc. can make you money in the stock market. However, only difference between a novice and a seasoned trader is, Let\u2019s see some differences between Novice Trader[2] and Seasoned Traders: When the trade goes wrong, Novice, with all the (over)confidence that trade will regain its lost sheen, retain the trade. Where as the Seasoned trader, squares of the position when he goes to a certain Loss..Novice adds up to the screwed up position, Seasoned trader, squares of the position and when the time is right, he enters the reverse trend trade.Novice buys when the Market is at the Peak, thinking market has got all the traders back now, where as Seasoned trader, sees for the reversal signals and enters the reverse position.Novice does not know what is a stop loss or though he knows, he/she bars their own stop loss in a hope, Seasoned trader, always trades with stop loss.Novice traders buy or sell with some advisory calls or Hunch feelings, whilst the Seasoned trader, always follow a technical chart or a fundamental analysis of the underlying asset to enter the trade.Novice sells of with very small profits where as Seasoned trader, rides the profits and cuts the losses.If you take care of the Risk in any trade, Profit takes care of You on its Own! I follow a Strict , Cut Throat Disciplined Strategy, where, when am in Loss, no matter, how much, what asset, when, I sell it without any feelings of loss. If I did not follow that, I would not be in the market so long. To mark my words, let me give you a Live Example of my Colleague\u2019s Story what happened after he gained 110% in Company Fund House Money. In the day\u2019s when I was working in JP.Morgan as a Financial Analyst, one of my colleagues came and very happily mentioned, he made a 110% profit from his investment and in matter of minutes, his manager called him and he was terminated immediately. Why? Was 110% Profit not enough for Mgr. at JP.Morgan? Answer from the Manager was pretty simple. Market, does not go up really Fast. Like the heart beats and pulse, market goes up in Staggered manner. When You\u2019ve to make 110% profit, he must have lost almost 4 - 5 times what he has gained. When he is so careless about loosing 4 - 5 times with the Company of Fund Money, he is Unfit to be a financial analyst. One who does not manage the Risk is Unfit to be Trading in the Market. So Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis - Read My Answer - Ashok Kumar N Rao's answer to In the Indian stock market, which is the better analysis method, technical or fundamental? Whatever you choose, stick to it. Even the Best of Diamond in the World is evolved after all the Dirt is removed, after being rubbed, beaten and jerked a lot. A good strategy also is like a Hidden Diamond, when you find one, test it and don\u2019t let go of it thinking its a stone.. You never know the capability of a stone which when rubbed and polished showing up the qualities of the Diamond! Having said that, You would need some information about the strategy I use. I\u2019ve already answered this before. No need to make the answer more Longer :) Read my strategy - Ashok Kumar N Rao's answer to What are some good intraday trading strategies? With the strategies, I can train anyone to make atleast \u20b91500/Day in Options. Having Said that, I wish you best of Luck. Happy Trading, Happy Getting Rich.

            "answer_text": "Simply by Buying good quality businesses for a long time. There is a rule named \u201crule of 72\u201d which says that 'if we divide 72 by annual returns , the answer will give us the time in years in which our money will be doubled'. Which means 24\u201325% CAGR will double your money in 3 year. Ten times in 10 years and 100 times in 20 years. If someone manages to get a return of 26% for 20\u201330 years he'll be rich. \u20b91 lakh invested for 30 years at 26% CAGR will become more than \u20b910 crore. There are a lot of business which have given such amazing returns :- 1- Eicher motors. If instead of buying Royal Enfield in June 2001 which would have cost around \u20b960,000 someone would have believed in the business and invested that money in Eicher motors stocks.  He would be having 2,500 shares of Eicher motors of value \u20b95 Crore. 2- Wipro. Everyone in the stock market regrets missing out Wipro. \u20b910,000 invested in the IPO would be valued \u20b9600 crores today and that too with \u20b93 crores as a dividend every year.  I know that all these are the missed opportunities and people have already heard all these stories. But there is one thing you can do. SIP of 20% of your salary in a mutual fund with a rolling return of 20% CAGR. Do you know that how much will a SIP of \u20b910,000 for invested every month at 20% CAGR for next 30 yers will give you? \u20b923 crores.  And that's ofcourse is a lot of money.  Enough for anyone to spend rest of his life on any beach of his choice with a beer in his hand.  ",

You ask how people get rich from stocks. But here\u2019s my question: Do you think they, either : a. Speculateb. InvestI guess you see where I\u2019m going with this. For the sake of this answer, I\u2019m gonna assume you wanna be in the game for the long haul (since buying and selling, otherwise known as \u201cspeculation\u201d, invites nothing into your life but despair. And that is not the road you wanna take, right ?) People get rich buying stocks using some kind of proven method (otherwise known as \u201cHighway to Boredom\u201d) : They do their homework and study finance, accounting, plus get knowledgeable in a host of other areas, for the more they know, the better they are able to appreciate the true value of any investmentThey have patience: they wait for the right moment to buyThey control their emotions and do not let them get the best of them: they sell their stock once they deem the ofered price actually reflects the true value of the business they hold a piece of.All of this takes time. But, trust me on that one: the Highway to Boredom is actually pretty fun to travel if you take time to see the landscape around you, and stop regularly along the way to rest and exercise!

Remember this, Trading in stock markets can bag you riches overnight. How will you react, if I say Your investment of 1500 Rs can fetch you 10,95,000 Rs in a single night? Isn\u2019t that awestruck? Yes, it is. And yes, you could have earned around 10,95,000 Rs if you had traded this way: Buy 10 lots of SBIN OCT 290 CE option on 24th October,2017 , which had a premium price of 0.05 Rs for a lot size of 3000.Take a chill pill :pFollowing the above two steps, and opening your trading portal on 25th October, 2017, you can see your call position with 0.05 Rs premium increased by a whooping 73000% to 36.50 Rs . And yes, these numbers are real (36.50 Rs being the high for the day, 25th October, 2017) I attach a snapshot of the call profile, showing the previous day\u2019s close and current trading prices:  Source: http://m.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-public-sector/statebankindia/SBI Here, you can see that the previous close (24th October,2017) of the call option was 0.05 Rs, which is trading on 25th October, 2017 at CMP of around 32 Rs. Yes, whatever you are thinking is correct :p This is a return of 730 times of whatever investment you had made, that too in a single day. P.S : 1. Never expect this situation to happen everyday, every month or every year. because this is the first time to get such huge returns in a single day. 2. This is what happens when you trade (unlike investing). 3. It is highly advised to not to enter this field with amateur brains. ",

            "answer_text": "This story is of one of the wipro's shareholder\u2026 Background The year was 1980. Mohammed Anwar Ahmed, a 27-year-old resident of Amalner, in Maharashtra, had Rs 20,000 with him as an inheritance after his father\u2019s death. He thought of investing when he came across a visiting broker from Mumbai, Satish Shah, who had come to acquire shares of Wipro from the residents of Amalner. The journey begins\u2026 Shah asked Mohammed\u2019s to go from door-to-door and acquire as many shares as he could from the residents. He helped and as a parting gift, Shah offered him 100 shares at a face value of Rs 100 each. Mohammed agreed and invested Rs 10,000 of his inheritance and invested the remaining 10k to start a tiny trading outfit.   How his initial investment of Rs.10,000 grew to over Rs.500 crores. In 1981, the company declared a 1:1 bonus. He now had 200 shares.In 1985, the company declared 1:1 bonus. He had 400 shares.In 1986, the company split the share to Rs.10. He thus had 4000 shares.In 1987, the company declared 1:1 bonus. He hence had 8000 shares.In 1989, the company announced a 1:1 bonus. Now he had 16,000 shares.In 1992, the company declared a 1:1 bonus. By now he had 32,000 shares.In 1995, the company declared a 1:1 bonus. He then had 64,000 shares.In 1997, the company declared 2:1 bonus. He now held 1,92,000 shares.In 1999, the company split the share to Rs.2. He now had 9,60,000 shares.In 2004, the company declared 2:1 bonus. He thus had 28,80,000 shares.In 2005, the company declared 1:1 bonus. He came to have 57,60,000 shares.In 2010, the company declared 2:3 bonus. He now had 96,00,000 shares.  The current market price is Rs. 599 per share. The shares are valued at Rs. 575 crores. Hence, his shares are valued at Rs. 599 X 96,00,000 (number of shares) = Rs. 575 crore.Also, over the last 33 years, he has received dividends of Rs. 118 crores from Wipro. Thus, by investing Rs. 10,000, Mohammed has gained a massive Rs. 575 + 118 = Rs. 693 crore He is now retired and donates freely to charity from the dividends he receives. Not just that, he has vowed of not selling a single share till Mr. Azim Premji is the Chairman of Wipro.  ",

There is this site called Parimatch India. It has provided me immense benefits. I have learned that if you are observant, you can double your investment in no time. All that the site has asked me to begin the game is just \u20b910. There are various online casino games like poker, lucky7, rummy, roulette, blackjack, dragon tiger, andar-bahar and many more. I have seen people earn thousands through online slot machine games which this site provides. I would often enjoy the company of the best dealers through live video conferencing feature of this site, too. The payments are accepted on this platform through all the modes - even your mobile wallets are accepted. The amount which you win can be easily transacted through the instant cash withdrawal facility of this site. To help you, the site provides a 24/7 customer service and a chat box as well.

Follow some of the below points while trading and tell me if you don\u2019t see positive change in your trading. Discipline : Follow your trading plan with discipline. Stop loss : Always use stop loss. Follow the trend. Patience : Patiently learn , work hard to understand the market & keep your cool intact while trading. Never average on a loosing trades unless you are sure about the view of your stock/market. Book realistic profit or keep trailing stop loss. Control greed and fear and don't do revenge trades or panic. When you are not feeling good or in bad mood better avoid trading. Below is my simple strategy that you can use. Simple strategy for day trading. Buy the Strength & Sell the Weakness\u2026 It is one of the basic strategies to learn and observe. Patience is of utmost commodity required for this. Before market opening, go to NSE website or any other trading website which gives stocks/index\u2019s cumulative data. Go to Nifty 50 stocks. Look for 52 week high (strong stocks) and 52 week low stocks (weak stocks). Pick 2 stocks from each and keep it in your watch list. After market opens see how Nifty is performing. If Nifty is positive then go for 52 week high stocks and if Nifty is negative then 52 week low stocks. This will work almost 85 times out of 100. Once you get comfortable with the market you can go for the various indicators. The idea behind all these indicators is to determine the trend in the stock itself. One of the basic combination of indicators to determine the trend is SMA(Simple moving average) with Volume along with the Support & Resistance. It is one of the best techniques to trade in the market and to earn sure shot. Keep these few things in your mind and start. These will definitely work for everyone. As mentioned in my other answers as well , HARD-WORK & PATIENCE , there is no substitute for them , so never give up and keep pushing yourself. I have one telegram channel OptionsTraders(find the link in my bio) , if interested do give it a try and earn some profits. I assure you that, you wont be disappointed. Thanks for reading and I hope it will add some value to your trading practices , please share and upvote if you feel this can help others also. ",

The stock market is a way to share ideas, chance, businesses. Some are good, some are bad. You can improve your chances by giving a few minutes thought to the investment. Then, bad investment go down, maybe to 0. What if you had a rule that no stock you held would go below 15% because you would sell? That is risk management.

After 4 years, my stock was worth $135k. I resigned from my job, and haven\u2019t worked a day since. According to the experts, my success will eventually end. These same experts recommend asset re-allocation: That\u2019s where you sell your best performing stocks, and use the money to buy more shares, of your losing stocks. That\u2019s way to brilliant for me. On 4/3/2011, I bought NVDA, at $17 a share. Today, it\u2019s $100. Study the company\u2019s stock price history, earnings, and their products. Then wait. Watch PBS program, \u201cWealthtrack\u201d: Their interviews with Nicholas Sargen, Robert Aliber, Robert Arnott, and especially Francois Trahan. I think the market is overpriced. I expect China to devalue their currency, in order to maintain their exports. It\u2019s what they did, the last time, the Fed raised interest rates. Because the dollar rose. Plus, the next batch of earnings are due out, in January. Compared to people\u2019s expectations, they will likely be lower. Expect stocks to be cheaper. Try to buy NVDA, below $90 a share. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to generate wealth from stocks. Today, I will share some tips that helped me earn good returns over the years. #1. Investing is the key to wealth generation Most new investors confuse investing with trading. While trading is all about benefiting from the volatility of the market, investing is a more concrete way of generating wealth. #2. Always work with an investment plan There are three primary elements to constructing a good investment plan: Financial goalsRisk toleranceInvestment horizonHaving clearly defined investment goals can help you determine the kind of stocks you need to buy. They also help determine the investment horizon. Also, knowing your risk tolerance can help you choose the right stocks. Hence, before you start investing, ensure that you create an investment plan with these aspects in mind. #3. Research the company well before investing Before buying a stock, go through the financials of the company, the details of the management team, competition, and various other factors. Remember, a fundamentally strong company can weather multiple economic storms and market volatility. Hence, in the long-run, investing in stocks of such companies can help you earn good returns. #4. Don\u2019t play the guessing game Successful investing is about making informed decisions. Many investors try to invest on speculation or a guess. Avoid this urge. Always base your buy/sale decisions on research. #5. Patience pays Remember, wealth generation requires a lot of time and patience. Many new investors try to seek thrill in their investments and opt for the stock trading route. Trading is good to generate regular income but wealth generation needs a planned investment. #6. Diversify Finally, diversify your investments. Stock prices respond to various factors like social, political, economic, etc. Hence, it is important to diversify your stock investments across sectors, market capitalization, geographies, etc. The idea is to invest in a basket of stocks that have zero or low correlation with each other. There is no secret formula to get rich from stocks. The key lies in approaching investments strategically and sticking to the plan. Follow the tips mentioned above and start crafting your journey to getting rich. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t lose money.Don\u2019t risk more than 10% of your capital on any one trade, and the less you risk the better.Learn one strategy better than anyone else, or at least as best you can, and never stop learning it. This is your specialty and even if you perform other actions this is the one you must always look for the chance to utilize.When no good action is apparent, do nothing. Patience. The Chinese call this \u201cIntentional inaction\u201d or \u201cnot moving\u201d aka \u201cwei wu.\u201d You can take it a step further and call it \u201cwei wu wei\u201d or action through inaction. Think of the movement of the planets - they have perfect harmony but not because they try to. Just like they don\u2019t try to move themselves you cannot control their movements. The ocean is similar. You cannot control the tide, only when you set anchor or set sail. Imagine what will happen if you try to sail against the tide.Don\u2019t chase losses.No matter what anyone says, don\u2019t ride your wins and don\u2019t cut your losses. If you think a trade is a good one you take it - the stock goes down after you buy it? If you still believe in the company, buy more. It goes up after you buy it? Consider if it\u2019s overvalued now. If it is, sell. Or maybe even sell just to break even. Momentum is real but it\u2019s no reason to make a fool of yourself.Don\u2019t listen to anyone who says they know what will happen or claims to be a true expert. If there were such a thing as reading the future Warren Buffet would never have a losing day, and he\u2019s had some losing years so remember: In the end it is gambling, to a degree.If you want to make a good living, play it safe and smart. If you want to get rich you have to take greater risks. But you have to find risk you\u2019re getting paid to take - don\u2019t assume extra risk without extra reward. Imagine a roll of the 6 sided dice. Roll a die and pay $20, you get $200 if it lands on any one specific number. You can do that all day and in the long run make money. You\u2019re 16% likely to win 10 times your money. That\u2019s a good deal. Now imagine you had to pick the right number two times in a row. Suddenly your chance of winning is only 8% - now you\u2019re losing money all day long. So, consider your bankroll size along with your chances of winning each bet. You can always assume less risk but assuming more at any given time is just plain dumb.Options trading. There is always a way to make money from trading options, if you\u2019re safe and take a statistical approach. This means, again, not risking too much on any one trade. It means accepting that at any given time the market moving up or down is random. Not as a trend, but its next move in any given intraday period. Given that you look\u2026 this will be too long for an item in a number list. Just look at the average movement of a given stock and pick a point and trade that point. If you do so planned on its average moves then you\u2019ll make a little money most of the time and when you lose you\u2019ll lose less than you won. Don\u2019t forget commission costs.Don\u2019t get crazy after a win or a loss. It\u2019s very easy to get emotional - this isn\u2019t an emotional game. Be smart, be careful, and be patient.",

            "answer_text": "It is a loaded question. People invest in the stock market because they want to make money. From what I understand about 75% of them fail to make it and only a few make it. That shows you need to do things the right way. But there is no exact definition of the right approach. From your question it is pretty obvious you are new to investing. You need to start carefully. What you need is investing basics and the knowledge of investing principles. You need to read a lot and follow the financial markets on television too. Once you feel you have sufficient knowledge you may start investing with a small amount of money. The principle is to buy low and go slow will help you .Getting rich is a question of your selection and strategies. In my opinion it is part luck and part your knowledge. If you want to buy a stock of a company you must study the company's fundamentals and be satisfied. In other words if you have the money that you will be buying the company based on your research. There were several factors to make it a success if you have a reasonable amount of money then your path will be easier otherwise it will take longer. If you select the right companies then your path will be excellent. Like if you have selected companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and then you would have made it without much difficulty. For me I learned my lessons by managing my investments in my 401K. If one of my funds is not doing well or doing bad, immediately I call the company and demand answers, if satisfied I leave it. If it is not improved then I demanded that to be moved to some other funds. From this experience it was easy for me to progress into investing in Stocks. Again my answer is yes you can but it depends on your hard work. ",

            "answer_text": "By holding them for a very long time and selling them more expensive at some point. Many people think it makes sense to buy individual shares based on some key figures and charts. But that does not have to be true. Investigations show that most humans, who buy individual shares, obtain less net yield, than the stock market gains on the average. This is because the international stock market increases in value by an average of 6-8% year after year. This means that shares are tending to become more and more valuable worldwide. In order to take advantage of this effect, one should invest in many shares at the same time. But this is very complex and expensive. One solution is the so-called ETF: Exchange Traded Funds. They work like this:  The money of several investors is thus collected, and thus an institution buys several shares at once. In this way, the investors are automatically diversified and can benefit from the annual capital gain of the stock market. ",

Most people who make a lot of money do it by making very stupid descisions that turn out well. You never heard of all the people who lose money. Of course you would have to go back ten years to find one of those. Yep the market today is full of genious investors who intelligently bought some random stock they \u201canalyzed\u201d and rode it up with the rest of the market. I'm bitter because I did that with energy stocks and lost my shirt. Should have randomly been stupid and overexposed myself to tech growth stocks. Just ignore all the genious out there who bet on the horses already winning, or check in when the market tanks and see how many of them are still smart. I'm in cash now so you will hear me tooting my horn all about how I knew it was coming and how smart I am for waiting until there was a sale\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "So for a moment forget about direct investing in stock market and consider mutual funds which indirectly invests in stock market and are more suitable for those investors who does not understand the stock market. Now i am providing the latest data of two mutual funds which were started between december 1993 to oct.1995.out of these two one is mid cap and one is diversified equity funds. Mid cap fund 1 Reliance growth fund-type of fund -mid cap fund,date of inception oct.1995,type of plan -regular growth,return since launch=22.22 percent cagr.latest nav-1068.61 Diversified fund 1 Hdfc Equity fund-type of fund-diversified equity fund,plan regular growth,date of inception-jan01,1995,return since launch=18.79 percent cagr.latest nav=629.44 These are the data as on today. Now take the case of hdfc equity fund which is a multicap/diversified fund so it started its journey from 1st january 1995 after an initial public offer in which its per unit price was kept at rs.10 and it is the case with every mutual fund. So after almost 24 years that rs.10 has become today as rs.629.44 means it has multiplied your money by 62.9 times. Reliance growth fund has grown even bigger which you can figure out from its present nav. And mind you since the starting of this fund date and today India has exploded nuclear bombs in 1998.Faced American economic sanctions after the nuclear explosion.Fought war with Pakistan at Kargil in 1999.Then faced the subprime crisis of USA in 2008 when the market has collapsed by about 60 percent in terms of Sensex.Moreover these returns had come when India has seen the govt.of Mr.Devegauda and Mr.Gujral also. Also these returns were obtained when Indian economy was growing well but now Indian economy is the fastest growing economy of the world hence it will generate more wealth going forward. So invest with confidence for your better future. Note-All these datas are taken from value research website.cagr-means compounded annual growth return Happy investing.

Simple enough. But very hard to follow since there are so many temptations to \u201ctrade\u201d stocks, buy and sell them too soon for small profit, use stop loss and lose money when they decline, etc, etc. Reason why huge majority of people don\u2019t create wealth (or even lose money) in stocks is because they are too clever for their own good and constantly meddle with their portfolios.

I know someone who made $800k+ by buying call options on Micron Technology when that stock traded in the mid-teens. I know someone else who turned $50K into $1 million+ by investing a micro-cap liquidation. I've personally experienced rapid growth in my brokerage account by being on the right side of several bets over the last couple years. (I've also experienced rapid losses as well). Let me tell you how these people got rich in the stock market (not including me lol - I'm poor). They found a situation in the stock market that was extremely mispriced - either due to broad ignorance or liquidity constraints - and capitalized on those opportunities very aggressively. ",

Their portfolio is worth more than \u20b91000 crore now. The investment philosophy of the couple or rather the wiz Rajiv Khanna (the man who actually is a think tank for stock selection) is capturing growth companies in the small and mid-cap sector. They hold the stocks for a long time and let the business flourish, which then levers the stocks to a multi-baggers category. Thus style block as discussed earlier for Khanna couple is Growth \u2013 Midcap, with little dilution towards the small cap. The identification of the stocks is generally based on companies, who show great potential for growth. These companies are identified in the early stage of the business life cycle. However, the portfolio of the Khanna couple shows a slight affection for manufacturing, agricultural and chemical based companies. Khanna couple almost revises their holdings every quarter, recent additions to their portfolio was Radico Khaitan and Som Distilleries, alcohol-based stocks. Rajiv Khanna strictly believes that value investing style is something to move on with, he focuses growth over Value style. ",

Here I am referring word business because one will think differently to invest in business rather than seeing stock prices only. These investments are usually long-term like 5\u201310 years or more. There are people like Warren Buffet who made fortunes from Stock Market by benefiting returns with Compounding.  (Einstein said Compounding is eighth wonder.) These people invest in small caps, mid caps or large caps by analysing fundamentals of company or business of company. Then they hold for few years to benefit from returns.

            "answer_text": "Hi, Jesse, Someone like Warren Buffett is good evidence that you can get wealthy from investing in stocks. However, Buffett and his team are extremely knowledgeable and follow a tried-and-true investment philosophy. Knowledge is power. If you don\u2019t know what you are doing with investments, there is an excellent chance that you will achieve returns less than what you are expecting. Before you decide to become your own investment manager, read, watch, and learn. Spending a bit of time and money to prepare yourself for this job (and it IS a job) is essential. If you don\u2019t have the time or money to invest in training yourself to be your personal investment manager, I suggest you consider investing in mutual funds or exchange traded funds that are managed by professionals who have exhibited a multi-year track record of achieving good results. In my case, I put my 401K contributions into a Target Year fund. The philosophy with such funds is that the investment profile (stocks vs. bonds, etc.) changes over time, based upon how many years remain between the current date and the fund\u2019s target year. For example, if you invested in a Target Year 2060 fund \u2014 40 years out from now \u2014 the fund\u2019s assets would be heavily weighted toward growth stocks, because they have a history of providing greater annual returns. However, greater potential returns essentially ALWAYS come with greater potential annual losses. Such investments have a higher mean annual return, but they also have a higher standard deviation on their annual return. The premise with that 2060 target year fund is that, over a 20-year period or so, there will be some losing years, but over that first 20 years of the fund the annual returns will approach the mean and you will make more money in the long term. Now, as you get closer to the target year, the premise is that the fund holders are getting closer to retirement and are less tolerant to losses. So, the fund\u2019s assets will transition into having a preponderance of incoming-producing securities, such as higher-dividend stocks and bonds. ",

            "answer_text": ",The majority of rags to riches tales of stock payouts are based on degrees of truth. Often people began working for a company and invested in the stock heavily. Some small investors managed to buy Amazon and Google early on. The investors saw the growth capability. Some were speculating and some simply believed in the ideas and products of the company. Some investors buy and sell large volumes of stocks or buy options on stocks they believe will recover from a downturn. The methods vary greatly often involving combinations of favorable factors. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Zanger&ved=0ahUKEwiCkuy7qe_XAhUK84MKHfgUDZcQmhMIYjAM&usg=AOvVaw2Zsqhk8AZ0KAj93z-ruY3u https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.thebalance.com/the-mathematics-of-getting-rich-by-investing-in-stocks-358105&ved=0ahUKEwiSx_fZsO_XAhWq7YMKHfUmAGAQFggdMAA&usg=AOvVaw35m4Hq5B3a5tzCoFv_5OKU https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://amp.cnn.com/money/2013/12/16/investing/penny-stock-trader-millionaire/index.html&ved=0ahUKEwiSx_fZsO_XAhWq7YMKHfUmAGAQFgghMAE&usg=AOvVaw1NiK9r3edVKFmIAWRPKala&ampcf=1 https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/amphtml/270408&ved=0ahUKEwiSx_fZsO_XAhWq7YMKHfUmAGAQFggkMAI&usg=AOvVaw0W2yJWpJ8rzh3KZ5RmZLIv&ampcf=1 https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.moneysmartguides.com/become-stock-market-millionaire&ved=0ahUKEwiSx_fZsO_XAhWq7YMKHfUmAGAQFggwMAY&usg=AOvVaw2yAVRYgMW5WrJDe4G07xOI ",

If you really want to be rich in stock market like Warren buffet then you have to study all about stock market. Relying on stock brocker will make you rich at one level but if want to be super rich then you have to work for it. Patience is the most important thing in stock market. \u201cHold right and sit tight\u201d is what you have to learn practically. You need to study how companies works, how is the growth of company, you need to know the financial health of company that means you need to know about balance sheets, you should know about fundamental analysis, current news , new government policy, you should be pretty aware of natural disasters, where the building are collapsed or agricultural land is flooded or health pandemic like corona virus, So that you can invest in those companies which are related to above issue. You can know share Market in simple words from this blog What is Share Market or Stock market in simple words and how it works? Thank you. ",

Remember this, Trading in stock markets can bag you riches overnight. How will you react, if I say Your investment of 1500 Rs can fetch you 10,95,000 Rs in a single night? Isn\u2019t that awestruck? Yes, it is. And yes, you could have earned around 10,95,000 Rs if you had traded this way: Buy 10 lots of SBIN OCT 290 CE option on 24th October,2017 , which had a premium price of 0.05 Rs for a lot size of 3000.Take a chill pill :pFollowing the above two steps, and opening your trading portal on 25th October, 2017, you can see your call position with 0.05 Rs premium increased by a whooping 73000% to 36.50 Rs . And yes, these numbers are real (36.50 Rs being the high for the day, 25th October, 2017) I attach a snapshot of the call profile, showing the previous day\u2019s close and current trading prices:  Source: http://m.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-public-sector/statebankindia/SBI Here, you can see that the previous close (24th October,2017) of the call option was 0.05 Rs, which is trading on 25th October, 2017 at CMP of around 32 Rs. Yes, whatever you are thinking is correct :p This is a return of 730 times of whatever investment you had made, that too in a single day. P.S : 1. Never expect this situation to happen everyday, every month or every year. because this is the first time to get such huge returns in a single day. 2. This is what happens when you trade (unlike investing). 3. It is highly advised to not to enter this field with amateur brains. ",

            "answer_text": "Investing don't come with instruction manuals. You stumble through it and learn as you go. It's at the start where you're most likely to fail. People invest in stock market to make a lot of money. But there are people who make losses as well when the market is bearish. Your aim is to be the next buffet, but you probably don't have all the parts and the ones that you need may cost more than you have. Your investment is probably at least half wrong too, but you won't know which half yet. All of this is normal. Warren Buffett's first-ever stock purchase illustrates two very important principles of successful investing strategies: patience and the importance of timing. Patience is indeed a virtue for investors. Buffett exercised patience well in waiting for the market to come back in his favor, but he failed to be patient enough to take full advantage of the stock's profit potential. Having successfully weathered the storm, he failed to observe the adage, \"Let profits run.\" Still, he did make a profit on his very first stock trade. There are some fundamentals every investor should be aware of that may help them identify suitable strategies - 1. Set Goal & Expectation - There's nothing wrong with hoping for the best from your investments, but you could be heading for trouble if your financial goals are based on unrealistic assumptions. 2. Determine Risk Tolerance - Before you start investing, an investor must analyse his risk appetite. Risk appetite is the amount of risk an investor is willing to take while investing. An investor\u2019s risk profile can be conservative, moderate, moderately aggressive or aggressive. An investor\u2019s risk appetite also depends on his financial position and other financial obligations. 3. Hold Investments For Long-Term - Buy and hold strategy works best with equities in order to reap maximum profit. Long-term investment strategies tend to look ahead in decades and the buy and hold approach works with stocks as long as you have a decade or two to play with. 4. Stick To A Single Trading Pattern - Traders must identify an appropriate trading pattern and adhere to it. The best way to check if a trading method is suitable for you or not, you should execute a number of trades at a time following a single method. If you lose money consistently instead of gaining profits, find ways to improve your trading strategy. 5. Do Your Own Research Before Investing - Collect information about companies, its financial position, its future plans, any mergers or acquisitions, dividend/return history etc. ",

Let us hear his words. \"I have felt the company should always perform on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but I learnt to my great expense that life doesn't work in a linear manner. I have sold-off some of my best stocks because they didn't deliver for a quarter or two and this again is a part of the education that I have had.\" \"One has to have patience, that good businesses and good managements give them some time to perform and over a period of time, I have felt that has been a better basis of investment, rather than working on strictly quarter-on-quarter performances. All companies can't be Infosys.\" \"I basically look at earnings momentum and a valuation in the 4,5,6,7 price earning multiple kind of range and I also look at the stock charts. So basically, once the stock breaks out a 52-week high and starts trading consistently above that, I get into that stock.\"  Sources: Google ",

            "answer_text": "Compounding is the eighth wonder in the world and the stock market is the place where you can get the benefit of compounding just by investing in good co\u2019s share. One can become rich from the market in three ways 1. from investment, 2. from trading, 3. from advisory from investment: if you want to become rich then the simple suggestion is to find couple of good co\u2019s which are growing at moderate to high rate(25%+) and can continue in future too(5\u201310 yrs), capable and honest management, low debt, positive cash flow, no direct threat from technology or from China. hopefully, after 10 year, you can multiply your asset 14x-25x.from trading: it is a very critical job as in most of the cases people buy/sell shares on some random suggestions given by XYZ co. and ultimately make a loss. Though learning technical analysis is not a hard thing but to make it precise, investing time at the market timing is very important but as most people treat trading as an additional source of income so we never put an ample amount of time to understand this system and then practice on it to make your strategy precise though if you have the willingness and time to learn the system then its one of the best way to make your fortune but always remember market is the king and cut your trade at the SL.from advisory: if you really an expert, then you can help others by providing the tips in their investment as well as in trading, though to become a successful and known adviser you have to work very hard for a long period of time and in any case you fail(which is normal) then be ready for the hear the bad words too.",

            "answer_text": "Well, stock market is quite risky. Even though it tends to return quite well, you never know when you are running into a certain bubble or when you are picking up a stock that could be a subject to some very unexpected events. Think of it, VW used to be a top-tier producer of the cars in the World, even though their brands weren't luxury, their volumes where great. However, after some of their wrong practices got found, where is VW stock now? Exactly... Hence, with stocks you can accumulate wealth, but you can also lose some of it. If you are looking to multiple your savings, I would suggest to strongly diversify, not only in terms of the stocks you are getting but also in terms of the markets you are participating in.  A great source for investing could be FX, if done right. Even though it can be quite risky, or even risker than stocks, it is still a vital component of my portfolio. I recommend you to visit Alpari's investing section to learn more about some investing opportunities in the FX http://alpari.com/en/investor/. The best thing about FX investments is that you get to build your own portfolio of the traders, that later charge you a success fee based on their performance. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. We can get rich from almost anything if we know how to do something properly. There are beggers who've become rich from begging. Getting rich from trading should probably be easier. You must have a trading plan. A trading plan/ system is nothing but rules for taking a position i.e. defined entry and exit points. You ought to have risk tolerance, patience, knowledge. If you don't know how to read charts, it'll be next to impossible to get rich through trading. Is it easy? Hell no. Getting rich by any means is difficult. Trading is no different. Trading requires immense patience and focus. You can't expect to make money from day 1. A person spends 4 years to complete engineering and maybe another 2 years to master it but people expect to make lakhs from day 1 through trading. Also don't expect unrealistic returns. Some people want to make 20% profits per day! That's just impossible. You can probably make it once every blue moon but it's not possible to make that kind of returns every day. Trading is NOT for greedy and impatient people. It might sound bitter but it's true. Trading requires hard work and dedication. The people who want to make quick money through trading will probably lose it all. Know exactly what to do and you'll make money from almost anything.

If it is the first week of the month and market is likely to be fall very heavily in the next morning due bad global event as all European market ,American market are in deep red , then get an early sleep and fix your alarm in between 5\u20136 AM next morning. Take breakfast, bath and complete other regular work by 7AM. Keep a look at Asian market, find that all Asian market are in deep trouble , then ready for the game. Make the fund available in your broker account. Open your market watch(if you are online trader) and get yourself ready to buy call option of nifty of the current month. When the market opens if you find that premium of call option reduces to a very insignificant value then purchase some lot as per your capacity. At some point of the day or in coming days market is likely to bounce back and you may be heavily rewarded. Risk is associated with it. If you can take risk then only do ",

            "answer_text": "5 golden rules of investing in stock markets The lure of big money has always thrown investors into the lap of stock markets. However, making money in equities is not easy. It not only requires oodles of patience and discipline, but also a great deal of research and a sound understanding of the market, among others. Added to this is the fact that stock market volatility in the last few years has left investors in a state of confusion. They are in a dilemma whether to invest, hold or sell in such a scenario. Although no sure-shot formula has yet been discovered for success in stock markets, here are some golden rules which, if followed prudently, may increase your chances of getting a good return: 1. Avoid the herd mentality The typical buyer's decision is usually heavily influenced by the actions of his acquaintances, neighbours or relatives. Thus, if everybody around is investing in a particular stock, the tendency for potential investors is to do the same. But this strategy is bound to backfire in the long run. No need to say that you should always avoid having the herd mentality if you don't want to lose your hard-earned money in stock markets. The world's greatest investor Warren Buffett was surely not wrong when he said, \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful!\" 2. Take informed decision Proper research should always be undertaken before investing in stocks. But that is rarely done. Investors generally go by the name of a company or the industry they belong to. This is, however, not the right way of putting one's money into the stock market. 3. Invest in business you understand Never invest in a stock. Invest in a business instead. And invest in a business you understand. In other words, before investing in a company, you should know what business the company is in. 4. Don't try to time the market One thing that even Warren Buffett doesn't do is to try to time the stock market, although he does have a very strong view on the price levels appropriate to individual shares. A majority of investors, however, do just the opposite, something that financial planners have always been warning them to avoid, and thus lose their hard-earned money in the process. \"So, you should never try to time the market. In fact, nobody has ever done this successfully and consistently over multiple business or stock market cycles. Catching the tops and bottoms is a myth. It is so till today and will remain so in the future. In fact, in doing so, more people have lost far more money than people who have made money,\" says Anil Chopra, group CEO and director, Bajaj Capital. 5.Follow a disciplined investment approach Historically it has been witnessed that even great bull runs have shown bouts of panic moments. The volatility witnessed in the markets has inevitably made investors lose money despite the great bull runs. However, the investors who put in money systematically, in the right shares and held on to their investments patiently have been seen generating outstanding returns. Hence, it is prudent to have patience and follow a disciplined investment approach besides keeping a long-term broad picture in mind. ",

It\u2019s difficult to get rich from investing itself if you\u2019re starting with a low amount of capital. If you have this kind of mindset in investing, it won\u2019t be long before you fall prey to some extreme growth story, tip, or other type of scam that will wipe out capital that will take years to rebuild.

            "answer_text": "Two months ago, I published an academic paper recommending to invest in Zoom. That was at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I carefully did lots of research, and developed Python code to design trading strategies for Zoom stocks. I backtested my strategies and provided lots of evidence that my own long-short moving average trading strategies would have fantastic investment performance, with very satisfying expected Sharpe Ratio, CAGR, maximum drawdown, portfolio value, and portfolio profit. Here the most regrettable thing comes. After the paper was published on April 6th 2020, it turned out that Zoom\u2019s stock price increased sharply and continuously. Till now, its price is almost doubled. However, unfortunately, I was focusing on writing the paper and my school work, and didn't trade it by myself. I should have done it... I actually missed a chance of becoming rich lol... Better late than never. Anyway, I should start to build my portfolio ASAP. What I\u2019ve taken from this is that, always do what you believe and what you know is true ASAP. Do not hesitate. Capital markets will never wait for you. Timing is always the most important thing in investing. Another suggestion would be, buy high and hope to sell higher. Never buy at the very bottom and hope to sell high. You will never exactly know where the lowest point would be, and if buying low what you expect is the situation is going to turning around right after you buy it. ",

In March it was down close to 30%. It\u2019s still uncertain when this pandemic will end. So \u201cWill the markets drop further?\u201d Probably. \u201cWill we see extreme stock market volatility this year?\u201d Highly likely. The people who typically see their financial futures damaged the most in a financial crisis are the ones who completely bail. Can Stocks Still Help You Build Wealth? When you are looking to build wealth over the long term, various staring points may generate higher returns. That being said, the more time you have invested in the stock market, the better your chances of building life-changing wealth. If you set aside money every month and invested those funds into a diversified portfolio over your working career, you would have had a tough time not benefiting from stellar returns on your investments in the stock markets during the last several decades. When the news of the world turns negative, you may be tempted to stop saving or only stockpile cash in the bank. Currently, we have seen a dramatic drop in the prices of some of your most loved companies\u2019 stocks. (Hit me up if you want some copies from hedge funds and blue-chip company annual reports). Of course, that means shareholders of those stocks have seen their account balances drop below their peak levels; you have likely your net worth affected by this pandemic. However, consider thinking of those losses in a different way. Now, all of those companies\u2019 shares can now be purchased on sale. As stock prices decline, the odds of you having above-average returns going forward increases substantially. Upvote if you agree. Share with other professional to see their views on this.

            "answer_text": "The statement \u201cplaying the stock market\u201d is a misnomer in a sense as while trading/investing in financial markets have some similarities with sports, what you should be doing is far from playing. So, if you approach the market from the perspective of trying to make money quickly or being primarily driven by making money, the probability that you will succeed is infinitesimal. To be successful you must have a passion for learning. This is what a lot of people struggle with. They want to trade or invest not because of an intellectual pursuit but because they want to make a certain amount of money. When you approach the financial markets this way, you subliminally set limits on the amount of time you\u2019re willing to commit, the amount of effort you\u2019re willing to commit, how long you\u2019re willing to not make money as a tradeoff for learning, etc. Once the majority of people who approach the markets and just about anything else, from the perspective of a dilettante reach this subliminal breaking point, they quit and say it can\u2019t be done and others who are doing it are only doing so because of some \u201csecret\u201d edge. In short, you can get wealthy doing just about anything. What creates wealth is a passion for what you\u2019re doing, a mindset of lifelong learning, and wisdom gained over time by consistently practicing the first two points. ",

But we never try to see the dark side of it where its more than 90 percent people who have lost their hard earned money. Everybody will say to a novice person in stock market that start investing early, invest for 30 years and with a CAGR of 20% you will be multi millionaire. But its not so simple and the best funny part is that thirty years are very long period. Its a mirage to trap common people to fill up the big pocket of big fund house since we will keep waiting for 30 years and they will have their last laugh. The wolf of Wall Street has shown the ugly side of stock market. If somebody want to invest then its better to track few large cap stock for a time period do a through research by themselves. You need to see its performance over a long time period, if it stands on all standard parameter, then make your mind and invest some part of your saving in a pool of stocks and keep your target. If your target is 40% then just take out your money. Since in stock market only rare stocks move unidiectionlly. It generally make waves so rise and fall of stock is for sure. Wait for right price of stock to enter take entry do the same thing. If your research is solid and fundamental of company is strong then you are not gonna lose. But don't believe in this 30 year and cagr of 20% or more logic since now a days in every 5 year we see world wide recession which reduces your actual invest made in five years half. It's my personal opinion. ",

If you are diversified and play the long game, you will usually be fine because even if the market has setbacks the global economy is always growing. Now if you're a good investor, you will see certain valuations get too high or too cheap and switch the focus of your portfolio accordingly to protect on the downside and gain on the upside. When you see markets rise too high you pull your investments to safer waters and wait for the storm. Once a downturn occurs, you will find cheap bargains to profit on and the cycle continues. You can also invest your money in real estate, your own business, or your own skills (each with its own growth rate). But like everything else, the key is consistent compounding and growing. If you can achieve that, you will be fine in the long term. ",

I roll the Jan 2018 options into the Jan 2019 options. But with the 2019 options I'm starting with $22,000 so I can start with $11,000 worth of options & $11,000 worth of cash.

They take risks that are carefully calculated and focus on diversifying their risks so that statistically the winners greatly outweigh the losers. Investing for capital gains is more risky than investing for dividends or interest but can be much more profitable. In Canada the effective tax rate on realized capital gains in the top tax bracket is only about 25%. (The tax rate of about 50% in the top tax bracket is only applicable on half of the realized capital gains.) The tax rate for interest income or dividends is much higher. ",

Well, \u201cgetting rich\u201d is a relative term, if everyone\u2019s earning $1Mil then no one\u2019s rich. They are equal in monetary terms, wealth as they say. So, who are \u201cthey\u201d in your case, mostly other people in the world but then theirs this \u201csilent killer\u201d called Inflation.A Silent Killer because we are oblivious to the macabre nature of Inflation. Assuming inflation to be 5% at the end of year.  But that\u2019s not the end of story, while the value of your deposit has soared, the prices have also gone up. That\u2019s due to Inflation. So you\u2019re left with \u201clesser ability\u201d to buy goods and services. The lesser ability to buy goods/services is due to the fact that now you can buy less number of goods/services with same amount of money due to price rise. Say earlier with Rs.1000( in the beginning of the year) you could buy 100 Chocolate Bars.Fast forward to end of year the price of 1 Choco Bars is Rs.10.5(10\u2217[100+5duetoinflation]) Now ask your self this simple question how many Choco Bars can you buy with money in your hand right now had you not \u201cinvested\u201d(Bank in our case) that money?Most likely your answer would be 95 Choco Bars (1000/10.5=95) Now ask yourself this, Earlier i could buy 100 Bars @ Rs 10 per bar but nowI\u2019m able to buy just 95 bars with that same amount. Your \u201cability to buy\u201d has gone down due to inflation, remember only prices increased from 10 to 10.5 in the above case while your amount of Rs.1000 didn\u2019t grow. This is called Purchasing Power. Now let\u2019s say you did invest that Rs.1000 somewhere. Say, like an ordinary person you deposit your money in Bank and in India the current Deposit rates(Fixed Deposits, tenure greater than 5 years) is around 6.6% to 7.5%. And you deposit Rs.1000 at beginning of the year. At the end of the year your \u201cmoney\u201d has surged to Rs.1075(1000\u2217[100+7.5]) Now you have \u201cearned\u201d Rs. 75 in an year. Now you could buy 102 Choco Bars.(1075/10.5=102) Thus stock markets are just an enabler for you to earn higher Rate of Return. And making that higher RoR helps you make more money relative to others and you become rich. ",

Shah\u2019s investments in Asahi India, the supplier of automotive glass, have multiplied about 3 or 4 times in 3 years.  I\u2019ve listed his main investment principles below. If the return on capital employed (ROCE) numbers are less than nine percent, the company is not worth investing in.The most important thing is how the firm\u2019s future growth is planned. When promoters constantly raise capital, the equity gets diluted.According to Nemish Shah, it is mandatory to look at the quality of management before investing. As long as the management is focused and understands the allocation of capital, the company has the potential for future growth. Shah focuses on long-term investing in the Indian equity markets. He uses a bottom-up research approach to identify high-quality businesses which have sustainable competitive advantages and the capability for long-term growth. Although Nemish Shah is one of the best retail investors in India, there is not a lot of information available about him. He is a deeply spiritual person and is notoriously private. However, his investing techniques are excellent and you can certainly try them out yourself. As per corporate shareholdings filed for Nemish S Shah holds top 5 stocks Lakshmi Machine Works LimitedHi-tech limitedAsahi India Glass LimitedZodiac Clothing Company LimitedEligi Equipments LimitedSources: Google ",

He couldn't do it because it was out of stock EVERYWHERE. I digged up and it wasnt priced in the stock already. I also asked to some techno stores contacts and they told me that the products were allways coming in short ammounts. So I deducted they were shipping instantly after production. This was in a high variety of products and Wall St. expectations were not that good. They would beat it for sure! So I bought call options for 10$. In 2 days each stocks was up 11%. It was easy, fast and inteligent money I believe. Another way is when you have a credible way of deducting what big money is trying to buy without market knowing it. I have a pattern that worked a couple times so I play along with them since they know more than me. ",

There are two ways of getting rich from stocks: The first way is to learn at your own! Yes, self learning makes you a better investor.  Start reading some books on investment and stock markets. The suggested books are: 1. Stock Exchanges, Investments And Derivatives 2. The Intelligent Investor 3. The New Market Wizards \u2013 Jack D Schwager 4. Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques Now the second way to get richer\u2026.  Start a real time trading with a stockbroker! I believe unless and until you get into a real time experience for trading you wouldn\u2019t develop the confidence and ability to get rich! So the crux of the matter is there\u2019s NO SHORTCUT to earn money in stocks. The only thing is - Learn.. Play.. Earn!!! ",

After his son's untimely death, his grandson looked after him.Suddenly he gained consciousness in 2017 and informed his grandson that he does not possess much but he had bought MRF 20,000 shares in 1990.Now let\u2019s see how much is Ravi worth today. So lets calculate,Rs. 69,290 * 20,000 Shares = 138.5 Crores.Ravi is worth more than 1.3 Billion rupees.How did he become so rich through stocks? Ravi\u2019s grandfather bought the shares for dirt cheap rate, hold it with patience for decades and today the same MRF shares are the most expensive shares in the Indian Index, with a return of over 14,700%.Video of Ravi\u2019s conversation with Zee Business.

            "answer_text": "Generally they don\u2019t. At least, not in the way that you\u2019re thinking. Here a few ways.. Professional traders Professional traders get paid a lot of money to trade other people\u2019s money. They don\u2019t take their money directly out of the market but are compensated for their performance in the market. Back in the early 2000\u2019s, these professional traders could score bonuses worth millions of dollars. The industry has changed a lot since then and that amount of money is not easy to come by. (Hedge) Fund Managers These guys manage a fund that invests other people\u2019s money. The strategies vary widely, but these guys collect asset management fees and performance fees to make their bread. Traditionally these fees were 2% and 20% respectively, but they have since come down thanks to all the competition. It doesn\u2019t take much to make millions, even billions of dollars this way. A successful fund has well over $20mil in assets under management (AUM). That\u2019s $4mil a year just in management fees, not counting the performance bonus. Get Rich Slowly A select few trade and invest their own money over a long period of time. If you do it well for long enough, you could build up a nice little pile of cash. You certainly won\u2019t be making the kind of money that professional traders and fund managers make, but you\u2019ll be comfortable. This requires a significant amount of starting capital and great deal of skill. Most people won\u2019t last and will inevitably blow up their accounts, so I don\u2019t recommend doing this until you learn how to trade properly..preferably at an investment bank. Some ex-professionals are offering education courses though. ",

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of ways to get rich from stocks in the Indian Stock market.  The Indian stock market is very deep and wide. No one can judge it perfectly, as it is all about taking risks to earn good profits and get rich. The equity market in India is brimming with investment opportunities. But how will you know which Investment opportunities will be good for you to get rich from stocks? If one wants to get rich from stocks in the Indian stock market than he has to gain proper knowledge of the Indian stock market and of trading segments. Here we are not talking about only basic knowledge of the stock market if you want to get rich in the stock market. There should be an effective strategy to trade in stock otherwise one can make lose rather than making money. One should be willing to take risks and should also secure capital with some strategy in the stock market because it is our hard-earned money which we are investing in the stock market to get satisfying returns and to get rich in the coming days. One can also adopt some effective strategy to trade from some well-experienced people of the stock market and can do successful trades under the guidance of them like I'm doing. I'm not getting that rich from the stock market but of course, getting some decent returns from the stock market with the help of Equitics Global Research. Because of them, it won\u2019t be possible. They are getting me profits and also securing my capital. I highly appreciated their hard work. THANK YOU:-) ",

If you were lucky then I guess someday your luck will run out and at that point you will start loosing money.  Beating the market isnt easy, It takes a lot of experience and knowledge in order to do so. In share market, you loose money very quickly and gain very slowly. To get good returns you need to get +ve returns for a long period of time.  So, I wouldn't say that investment in share market WILL make you rich. If you have the expertise and experience to beat the market, I am sure it will make you a bit richer.  and Can stock market investments make you super rich?

            "answer_text": "I think it is mainly investing. As said by some anonymous person, compounding is a miracle. If people would have held on right stocks which have grown at a CAGR of 10% for 20 years, their money would have grown by approx 6 times. If the CAGR is just +10% more which is 20%, then the money would have multiplied by approx 37 times. See the difference. But it is very important to identify and invest in the right stocks which have the potential to continuously grow. No industry or technology is growing at that pace for so many years at this point. Hence it is very important to select the right management which can drive the company through all kinds of technological changes. The next I would say is trading. Trading has helped a lot of people to make the next move. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is also known from his trading skills. A lot of people I know have started off with trading, made some initial capital and then started to invest that money. I have started off with a initial capital of 30\u201340k 6 years back and right now, I am standing at an amount which is much higher than that. Moreover, all my college expenses, monthly bills everything was taken care by Mr. Market. Friday has been a lot volatile and volatility helps traders. Managed to make 4.5 lacs on a single day.  ",

Try to have stocks for various fields: aerospace, healthcare, technology, etc. Sime industries do well some years, some don\u2019t. 2: Wait: The stock market will on average go up. So unless you chose really poorly, your stocks will go up too. It\u2019s slow though. So start early and don\u2019t have much in the way of exspectations. Keep putting more in, but the initial money will be sitting for decades. And by the end of it all, you\u2019ll be better off than when you started. ",

            "answer_text": "I have never been able to find official statistics on the lifespan of brokerage accounts. And yesterday I decided to look specifically. Found only in 2016. Well, what actually can radically change there? People are still the same as 3 years ago and now. Everyone wants to get rich and so they strive for the stock market. Newbies' ideas about making money on the stock exchange are very far from reality. Brokers both \u201cdream trade\u201d and trade. Nothing changes ... It got to the point that the Central Bank analyzed the average lifespan of a brokerage account and was horrified! On average, an account is merged in 9 months! That is why the law on qualified and unqualified investors was passed. To prevent brokerage accounts from dumping. And it happens that the client not only loses everything, but also remains in debt. You don't have to go far - a couple of months ago such a story happened with oil futures. Then the contract price became negative. This has never happened on the market! Never! The next day, the price returned to the positive zone. But according to the exchange rules, the price is withdrawn on the penultimate day. As a result, more than 700 people were trapped. They not only lost everything they had invested, but were also left with millions in losses. On which interest is also charged! ",

            "answer_text": "Stock Market is also a Market place where you buy and sell things just like any other market place. Just like other business where you buy things at a low cost and sell them at higher price and earn same thing happens here but you need to be very careful while buying or selling things because it is very volatile, things changes every minute. You need to have a knowledge about the thing you buy whether it is available at a right price and think whether I can sell the same at more higher price and all this is gained by experience, reading books, analysing charts and more. And last thing we need to respect this business like any other business and never think about share market is just like a casino. It is very hard to earn here and 15\u201325% return is considered very high. Happy Investing ",

Every person you meet, ask them for money. Stock Selection Look at stocks for several days, you'll see stock going up and down randomly. Observe carefully, now on next day when you see any stock going down sharply. Immediately use all your money to buy it. After buying that stock, you'll see it going up. Now at this point, immediately sell all your stocks. Repeat this with 3-5 stocks and you'll make tons of money. It's quite simple. Big Money Once you've made lots of money, don't put a lot of money in stocks. Just purchase real estate etc... Let me know when you've read it because I don't want this secret to be revealed to all people, I'll delete it once you've read it. ",

Since I am Answering it I wont just leave it on the above statement but I will share a story about my dad\u2019s friend. He started doing stocks and I believe he is pretty good at it but does not have a good mind set. He started of with 20k, doubled it in a month then kept on reinvesting that money and climbed all the way to 150k in about 3\u20134. Unfortunately ended up losing somehow and ended up with just 50k. His greed came in the way. You can make millions from there, you can lose millions in there if you dont know how it works and aren't ready to work hard. Only a very low % of people actually make a good living off of it ",

And your goal is $1 million within 4 years to retire on. You need is to average 1% per week for 4 years. Seems easy when you say it like that (but it\u2019s not). (1.01^208) * 50,000 = $1,106,000 Or you want to take your time like the average American. At a market rate of 8% per year over a 40 year working career you\u2019ll make over a million if you have at least 50,000. (1.08^40) * 50,000 = $1,086,000 The math of compounding interest makes what seems unachievable quite easy. The hard part is making a long term plan and then executing it. Good Luck!

Meet Mr.Vijay Kedia , one of the most successful stock marketer in India! From childhood he was fascinated about stock market as his family background was the same. Having no idea in stocks, at the age of 18 he started investing! Obviously he got massive losses at the beginning. But he never lost his faith on it. In the meantime his father passed away. He had to support his family. Having small amount of money in hand, he moved to Mumbai from Kolkata. He used to stay in Guest house and eat on streets. He used to meet many people everyday. He started gathering information about it. After gathering all essential informations he started investing in small companies. He got criticizing at first. But his investment get enlightened when the net worth of those companies crosses 100 Crores. Recently he was invited in London Business School for a speech. So what were the reason behind his success? 1.Fascination towards his career. 2. The power of taking huge risks to gain huge amount! 3. Immense trust on himself. 4. Supportive family.(Many times it doesn't matter though) 5. Thirst for knowledge based on his career and surroundings! 6. Patience! 7. Full focus on it and giving enough time to it without getting distracted! These were the things that uplifted him in such a level that his net worth became 1000 Crores![1] Thank you.

The \u201creal market\u201d has been about making 6\u201312% a year, with some bad years thrown in. With discipline, aptitude, and some luck, and 30\u201340 years you can probably do OK. Read some books, things by Andrew Tobias, Peter Lynch, get the cliff-notes on Ben Graham-Dodd. Google up : Tulip Mania. Once you have burned it into your soul that Manias Do Happen to ALL asset classes at times (stocks, gold, real estate) you might, over time, be able to out perform the markets. Problem is most folks are actually wired to Buy High - Sell Low, which is not the winning formula. Good luck, that is part of it too! ",

Good investors pick the right stocks and make a relatively sizable investment but not so big it will leave then broke if it fails. What are the right stocks? Well, its about supply and demand.

            "answer_text": "Stock dealing can be understood by the following example: (P.S.- Figures are only used for representation purpose.) A ltd is a company which needs INR 5 lakhs for its establishment. The owner of A ltd. has saved INR 1 lakh for the start up and further needs 4 lakhs. Now, he might approach a bank but interest rates will be higher, he will need to have a collateral and the time bondage will be strict so he comes up with a different plan. He decides to give ownership to different people in return for the cash requirement. He issues 1000 shares each worth Rs 400(known as face value) in the market. Brokers, investment houses or general public buy these shares at the face value. After the firm earns profit, the owner gives a certain share of the profit to each of the shareholder. Suppose the total profit to be distributed is INR 1,00,000. Each shareholder would be recieving INR 100 thus the market value of this share is INR 500. People keep dealing in this stock and hence the market value keeps increasing or decreasing. Coming to the RICH part- It is essential that you observe companies very closely because stock market is a very dynamic platform. You need to identify companies which have the potential to be profitable in the long run. The key is to firstly be patient, observant and calculative. If you think you do not have adequate skills, you can approach a trustworthy investment company or brokering agency. Warning: Stock dealing is not a gamble but since the market is swayed by numerous factors it is very unpredictable. ",

The problem was when index fell fast the pms have no exit plan.they were least bothered on what to do if index crashed. stupid and novice fund managers sunk the investor :by not exiting at a predefined risk as they had no such risk limit. moral of the stoty is position sizing right is not enough. you need perfect risk management. if you cant exit when loss is 7% or 14% then there is no use exiting after 40% loss hit you hard in the face.

You average your positions when the price is low and high, by doing so the position can cover all the fluctuations in the market and gives a good profit return. Trading, on the other hand, you need to watch the market all the time. You should be good at technical analysis and price action movements. You have to know when a breakout is happening. Both give you a good return. You need to make good strategies and practice first and invest money. ",

For example, if you don\u2019t want to wait around for 30 years making 10% on your account - you could learn to trade individual stocks and make 100% a year. Or more. Once I started actually looking for 100%+ trades, I actually started finding them. Now I didn\u2019t make money on all of them, and I even lost money on some of them. But the point IS, that 100% trades exist, and come up very frequently, making it POSSIBLE for you to quickly become rich with: 1, research 2.effort 3.practice 4.luck and 5. Training I made 400% one year WITHOUT any training, but if I had training prior to that, I think I might have had multiple 400% trades during that time. It\u2019s a learning experience. My point is, anybody can make 400% in a year - except the people who put their money into mutual funds. One of the things I learned, was that you DON\u2019T have to be rich to do 95% of the things you want to do IF you were rich. Actor Jim Carrey has a great video, giving a speech where he says something to the effect of \u201c I wish everybody could become rich and famous, so that they would understand that life is about more than that.\u201d ",

This will help you alot. 2. Focus on investment not on trading ,see the long term profits not short term gains,no one can be rich in 2-3 days ,it takes time ,proper analysis,focus on investing your hard earned funds in good investment opportunities for the long period time to magnify your wealth. In stock market ,98% may lose their money and 2% people may gain.but the fact is that only that 2% people thinks strategically and do analysis before investing their hard earned money. That's it Thankyou! ",

            "answer_text": " Mohnish Pabrai is an Indian-born entrepreneur, successful value investor, author and philanthropist. A bit of an investing late bloomer, Pabrai is a devout follower of Warren Buffett, although he had never heard of him until he was 30. So intent was he to pick the brain of his idol, Pabrai once spent over $650,000 just to have lunch with Buffett. Putting Buffett\u2019s principles to work for himself has brought him great fortune, which he gladly invests in the lives of the poorest in India. Early Life and Education Growing up in Mumbai, India, Pabrai was fortunate enough to attend an elite private school. For the three years he attended the school, he could smell the stench of raw sewage emanating from the slums just feet away. While the sights and smells of the \u201cuntouchables\u201d were obvious, their struggles were never mentioned by any of his teachers or classmates, which left a lasting impression on him. Pabrai came to the United States in 1983 to study computer engineering at South Carolina\u2019s Clemson University, where he graduated summa cum laude. After graduating, Pabrai worked in research and development (R&D) at Tellabs before launching his own successful IT consulting firm, TransTech, Inc., in 1991.2\ufeff He funded the company with his 401(k) account and $70,000 on his credit card, and sold it for $20 million in 2000.3\ufeff Success Story Using principles and strategies he learned from Warren Buffett, Pabrai founded Pabrai Investment Funds in 1999.2\ufeff His long-only equity fund has returned a cumulative 517% net for investors versus 43% for the S&P 500 Index since the fund's inception in 2000. Outperforming the S&P 500 by 1103% from its inception through 2013, Pabrai quickly became one of the most recognized value investors in the world.4\ufeff At its inception, the fund had $1 million in assets under management (AUM)2\ufeff and reached a peak of $570 million in AUM in 2019. Holding between 15 to 20 companies, his portfolio concentrates on India and emerging nations, as he doesn't find many mispriced or under-valued stocks in the U.S. market. In 2004, he wrote his first book, \u201cMosaic,\u201d in which he whittled Warren Buffett\u2019s investing methods down to just a few simple points. In his next book, \u201cThe Dhandho Investor,\u201d Pabrai laid out in more detail how he only invests in companies with huge return potentials and little risk.5\ufeff He suggests that what holds many investors from success is their egos and need for \u201caction\u201d by taking too much risk. Net Worth & Current Influence Never forgetting the extreme poverty millions in his homeland of India struggle with, Pabrai founded the Dakshana Foundation in 2007.6\ufeff Along with his wife, Pabrai runs his nonprofit with the same efficient principles that made him a wildly successful value investor, using checklists and simple metrics to help turn those living in the slums into millionaires. The goal of the foundation is to \u201crecycle\u201d most of Pabrai\u2019s wealth back into society, with the overall vision of alleviating poverty in his native India. The foundations seeks to identify the most brilliant minds among India\u2019s poorest children and prepare them for the difficult entrance examination for the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology. Graduates from the nation\u2019s top engineering and technology universities are nearly guaranteed successful employment. Vinod Khosla, the billionaire co-founder of Sun Microsystems is among its long list of successful alumni. As of 2017, Pabrai had a net worth in excess of $100 million and claimed that his net worth increased at an average annual rate of 16% from 1995 to 2015. Most Influential Quotes During his childhood education in India, Pabrai knew the answer to his country\u2019s problems at an early age, saying \u201cI came to the \u00adconclusion that poverty is driven by lack of education.\u201d Describing his logical approach to running his foundation, Pabrai said, \u201cI wanted to make the greatest difference in the greatest number of lives in the most \u00adefficient manner possible.\u201d ",

You could have earned more than what you expect in a single trading session. Had you have bought the CE of nearest strike price of the BANKNIFTY (weekly expiry) the day before the rally and you could witness the day trading success with just a small amount. But most of the traders did not saw it coming, as the announcement hit after the trading hours. But in similar manner, though accidently, I have earned lakh rupees in a single trading day by investing as small amount as peanuts. Look - The day was 29th September, 2016 (Surgical Strike Day) Just as regular, I trade with small amounts on every expiry of the month. This was Sept, 2016 expiry day and as soon as markets were open I bought 30 lots of NIFTY 8600 PE @ 10 Paise (As a Regular trade on expiry day) And I went down to office as I was doing articleship. Nearby 11\u20320 clock, suddenly markets crash down by nearly 500 points and that took only a moment. And I saw it on my screen this was the scene. I had 30 lots (30*75 = 2250 units) which I bought @ 10 paise which amounts to total of Rs. 225/- And in a moment, after an hour, the price went from 10 paise to Rs. 51/- I squared off my all positions at Rs. 53 (Average Price) which fetched me Rs. 119250. My Principal that day made almost near to 10 lakh from Rs. 15000. Isn\u2019t that cool? National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.

However, the reality is this. If you earn $200000 in X period of time, the company whom you bought stocks from is going earn $2000,000 or even more! Why? The company, and its founder(s) are producers! They not only sell to you, but to others just like you! Investing geniuses like Warren Buffett don\u2019t merely \u2018invest in stocks\u2019 as the finance gurus claim. They build up companies, buy MILLIONS of shares, so much that they have a controlling say AND sell the stocks to millions. They are active investors, playing with more high-powered assets than you and I! If you want to get really rich, you are better off making a very good big business and taking it public. Hard, tough, time-consuming, but not many will do it. And that\u2019s a good thing. You will do it, and become really rich. ",

I have seen it multiple times in my own account, when loss of few hundreds rupees becomes loss of few thousands which then becomes loss of tens of thousands. See the reason is simple - when the loss is less, we tend to leave it (we think that loss is less and we can cut it anytime). Slowly the loss builds to a level where we start thinking, what is the point of cutting the trade now(loss has become more but still manageable) and the final stage - how low the stock can go(loss become substantial and hence we cannot cut it anymore and wait for days->weeks->years)? Also remember that their will be cases when after your stop loss is triggered and the stock will reverse direction. In these cases, you might feel that \u201cI should have taken a little more risk\u201d- try to stay away from this feeling because ultimately it will might impact future trades.

If it takes 15\u201320 years to build your 401k up to $200k, extrapolate your returns over the next 20 years. When you hear the term 401k millionaires that is what it means. ",

Pick any reasonably priced quality Bluechip stock in a quantity equal to its derivative contract and sell an ATM option every month. Gradually it will result in cost reduction with time.

Buying these when the price is at its lowest and selling them on when they reach their highest produces a profit . These fluctuations can happen hourly . But to make money you need to own many stocks or shares in many companies , watch the prices constantly and know when the best time is to buy and sell. Some pay a stock broker to do this for them and pay him commission . ",
