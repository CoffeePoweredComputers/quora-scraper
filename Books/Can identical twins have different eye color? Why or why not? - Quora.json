            "answer_text": "Identical twins will have the same eye color. There are a few genes involved in eye color, and their genes are identical. It is possible for environmental factors after birth (epigenomics) to cause differences in the expression of genes, and therefore giving each twin a different phenotype (or trait). To my knowledge, eye color is not heavily influenced by the environment, so you\u2019re not going to observe drastic difference like one brown-eyed and one blue-eyed identical twins. My twin sister and I have blue eyes, but more specifically dark blue eyes with a yellow hue. It\u2019s unique to our family line. My two daughters have blue eyes, but without the yellow hue. ",

The first set of twins have different eye colors.The second set of twins have different eye color, different hair color and different skin color. Eye color is not fully controlled by genetics, and even if they were, it\u2019s polygenic, meaning it\u2019s controlled by multiple genes. Things can go wrong; mutations can occur. Genetics is so screwed up, identical twins can even have different fathers. Gotta love biology! ",

            "answer_text": "Genetically identical twins can have different eye colors because DNA sequences don\u2019t determine traits. Modern science has revealed epigenetic mechanisms that regulate characteristics of organisms. Eye and pigment color is mostly affected by melanin production associated genes, such as OCA2, HERC2 and SLC45A. Every one of these genes are alternatively spliced. Splice variants are regulated by epigenetic factors, such as CpG methylation and histone markers. ",

At a very early stage, the newly growing individual splits apart into two separate pieces. Each of these two pieces then continues to develop into a separate child. They are genetically identical because they have the exact same DNA. Identical twins cannot have two separate fathers as it is impossible for one sperm to come from two separate men. ",
