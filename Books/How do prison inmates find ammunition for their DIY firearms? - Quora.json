            "answer_text": "During my time there was never a firearm discovered within the inmate population. Just a hint of a possible firearm inside the fence would cause a lock down with all hands on deck searching for it. One time an inmate claimed to know of a pistol \u201csomewhere\u201d within the institution. Even though it was thought to be a dubious claim, extra officers were called in and all the property was throughly searched. Inside and out. Much contraband was found until the reporting inmate backed off his claim. I almost felt sorry for the reporting inmate. He owed a huge debt to many inmates who lost contraband during the all out search. Plus the DRs and everything that goes with them for the inmates possessing the contraband. Also pissed off officers being called in for a BS reason. The inmate was transferred because, let\u2019s face it. His life was forfit. ",

            "answer_text": "I worked for 20 years in Federal prisons, every security level from minimum to maximum, and I only know of one situation where an inmate ever possessed a firearm and it was not at a place I ever worked. A pistol was smuggled into the Federal Correctional Institution at Phoenix, Az. The best I can remember, the inmate who had the pistol took a Lieutenant hostage and tried to escape. He shot it out with Perimeter Patrol Officers, armed with M-16s and he was killed. Their were a few plots to smuggle them in at one place I worked, but unsuccessfully. Now, they have drones. It is probably only a matter of time before someone manages to make it happen. ",
