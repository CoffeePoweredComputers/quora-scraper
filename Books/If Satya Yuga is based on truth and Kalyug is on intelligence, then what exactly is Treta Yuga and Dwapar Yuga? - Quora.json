            "answer_text": "First of all how you can be sure that satyug is based on truth and kaliyug on intelligence. See for these metaphoric and esoteric subjects we need to trust the rishis who have elaborated them. And as per Shastra Satyug is based on perfection of happiness and divinity, there was nothing negative existed at those times, as time passed accumulated mass karmas sent the ages to Treta realm, this was realm of Dharma and Tapasya, you will find Valmiki ,Vishwamitra various Asuras Rama and many heroes and rishis performing severe tapasya being rooted firmly in Sanatana Vedic dharma. They lived in bliss and selfless kindness. Than came Dwapar Dharma having left with two feets. This was time of knowledge and Yagna and Yudha ,People get corrupted (few only ) rishis indulges in yagnas all kings relied on power of yagnas ,this is the time when Vyaas conceptualised four Vedas and divided Puranas, so the knowledge can spread. Dharma was powerful but maas karma also gave birth to adharma but it was very weak and easily conquered because even bad peoples have good character and they abide with sanatana law of Vedas . Than comes kaliyug, this is mix yuga dharma is left with one pillar, this is time of bad and good, intelligence and superstition and mlecha and other pseudo religion came to fore which are called ,mlecha sampradayaS in out text. Old saints tell that this time is for bhagwat bhajan, actually even Rishis also say that this is most beneficial time for pious karma, worship, pooja path etc because what punya one gets through rigorous tapas in Satyug for 10000 years, same could be have in 1000 years in Treta ,100 years in dwapar and only one year in kaliyug . Little good karma pooja path gives enormous punya when done honestly. So this is yuga system it is not as per some authors view of intelligence truth etc, It is a cycle which happened infinite times and will continue to happen till god knows .People get birth in certain yugas as per there karmas mostly sinners are born in kaliyuga with of course few pious great people because dharma is still strong in one pillar, And most importantly know that this is on macro level on micro level people can live in kaliyug while being in Treta or they can live in Satyug while being in Kaliyug ,it will depend on your inner sanctity and spiritual powers ,for those who are staunch Shiva bhaktas it is always satyug and things of satyug will happen to them provided they do methodical worship of shiva. By pious karma spiritual aattunement one can live always in satyug for him happiness is every where, every body will have his karma though if god forgives than karma balance wont affect ,but that will be in case of true devotees, but if people would be egoistic and try to follow the bad doers thinking all right when every body does wrong why not we ,so like everybody they will also pay there karma severely because they do it seeing other bad peoples. But those who learn seeing good people and adopt there ways learn from (vedic knowledge) from vedic learned bramhins they will be forgiven and if they sublimate themselves by accumulation of good karmas there many sins are also destroyed but in every yuga the karm,a factor is prime ,the beauty of kaliyug is lil good karma gives multifold punya and honest devotee destroy there sins also being indulging in pious worship of Sadashiva and contemplating on truth of Shastra ",

            "answer_text": " The four Yugas are based on the four Varnas. The quality of life deteriorates in later Yugas. Satya Yuga is based on instinct, Logic, Knowledge, eternal mode of time and honesty. Kali Yuga is based on manual mode, reasoning, data and transient mode of time. Since all activities of life are delinked being dishonest is extremely easy. People of Kali Yuga look more intelligent because they are interested in momentary gains only. They are least bothered whether it is sustainable or not. In this Yuga everything is better but for a shorter duration, often it is of use and throw kind. It is this fact that would bring an end to Kali Yuga. ",
