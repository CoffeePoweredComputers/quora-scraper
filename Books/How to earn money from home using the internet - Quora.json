            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been making money on the internet full time for the last 6 years, I\u2019d be happy to help. It took a few years to figure out what works and what was a scam. IMPORTANT: I now focus on just 3 online business models, and make over $1M per year\u2026 (Crazy what happens when you focus on what works). Before getting to the answer, it\u2019s really important to understand the following: Making money online keeps us truthful, the numbers will never lie. If you put in the work, you will make money, if you don't put in the work, you won't make money. The amount you make is in relation to the amount of work you\u2019re willing to put in. I\u2019ll show you 10 ways that I currently make money online (all within the 3 online business models), that you can start without spending money. Also, I\u2019ll show you 10 ways that I do not recommend for making money online. You don\u2019t need to buy any courses, or have any specific skills to get started. Additionally, you don't need to sell anyone anything! With that said, I\u2019ll list the categories below, then I\u2019ll attach a video to explain the categories broken down into 10 specific websites. Categories Print On-Demand: Creating simple, catchy, funny, or even text only, designs that are uploaded to websites that offer that design to be printed on clothing items and accessories. You create the designs (with design apps) and upload them to the big print on-demand websites, then they create virtual listings of your \u2018products\u2019, and market them for you. Then when someone order an item, the website prints the item with the design on it, ships it to the customer, and handles all customer service. They take a split of the profit, and you get the rest. [How To Video] Affiliate Marketing: Creating reviews, comparisons, articles, about products or services, then linking the reader/viewer to the product where they can purchase it, and the company who sells the product will give you a commission for referring the person. [How To Video] Information Products: Creating online courses, or ebooks, to share your knowledge on a specific topic, and selling it digitally around the world. You only have to create the online course, or ebook, one time and you can sell it time-and-time again digitally. Rather than writing a novel for you, here\u2019s a video to explain 10 best websites you can use to start making money online, without spending money.  Additionally, here\u2019s a similar video with the 10 ways that I do not recommend for making money online:  ",
