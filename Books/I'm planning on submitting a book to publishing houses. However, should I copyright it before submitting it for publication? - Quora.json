            "answer_text": "Your book is already copyrighted. Under modern law, any work that is eligible for copyright is copyrighted the moment it is set down in a fixed form \u2014 which includes, say, saving it as a file. If you\u2019re in the US or some other countries, it could be beneficial to register your copyright. This officially notifies the country\u2019s copyright office of your copyright, provides evidence that you are the creator of the work in question, and, in the US, is required before you can sue anyone for copyright infringement. You should not make a big deal out of the fact that you\u2019ve registered your work for copyright if you are submitting it to a publishing house. Reputable publishing houses don\u2019t steal people\u2019s books. First, the actual value of the average book is quite low. Second, if they did steal people\u2019s books, those people would inform the public, the company would lose their reputation, and no one would submit to them again. Use books such as Writer\u2019s Market to help you find reputable publishers in the areas you\u2019re trying to publish in, and you should be safe. It\u2019s okay to register your copyright in advance, but if you make a big deal out of it, the publishing company is likely to simply reject your manuscript without even looking at it, viewing you as possibly paranoid and likely to be too much trouble to deal with. The average book loses money for the publisher \u2014 the industry survives on publishing enough books of serviceable quality that the \u201chits\u201d support the rest, because no one\u2019s found a way to predict which books will catch the public\u2019s imagination and become \u201chits\u201d. Publishing houses know that chances are that your book isn\u2019t going to make them money anyway. If you make yourself stand out in a way that makes you appear to be an even higher risk than normal, you\u2019re seriously hurting your chances of getting published. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re wasting your time. Publishing houses have no interest in stealing your book. What are they going to do, steal the book and pay some other author to pretend to have written it? It would be the death knell to their business. Publishers are in the business of publishing books and paying the authors. But your book is copyright as soon as you write it. You don\u2019t have to do anything special to copyright it. However, registering a copy of your book in the Copyright office only applies to that version of the book. As soon as your book is accepted by a publisher, they will want a lot of revisions and edits, and your copyright version is now history. If you are time and money to spare, get a professional editor to give your book a polish. ",
