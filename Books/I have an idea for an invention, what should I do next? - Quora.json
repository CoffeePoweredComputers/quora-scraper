            "answer_text": "I have changed my view from answering the question as \"go raise money and start a company as fast as you can\" or at least to \"get a patent as fast as you can\" to actually talking about the invention. This was a big surprise to me when I heard Keven Kelly say something to the effect that he talks about all of his ideas. He says anyone is welcome to run with the ideas on their own. For those inventions that do not have takers, it is a good idea to run with them yourself. I don't go exactly this far but I do notice that the first response to true invention is skepticism. If there is enough skepticism surrounding the idea, and yet you know that it can be done, it may be the perfect thing to do on your own. I say this with some trepidation as going from inventor to Founder and CEO is the hardest, most dangerous thing I have ever done. I also say it with a kind of fatalism that if it is important and hard you will feel the need to do it, if you are like me (which may not be an enviable person to be like). ",

            "answer_text": "Spend some time to firm up your idea and get a patent if you feel it is feasible. Patents are a mixed bag. You need to have your concept prototyped but do it quickly enough to still own the idea. Is your idea \"novel\", is it capable of being manufactured and does it have an inventive step. The last three are the items you have to tick off to get a patent. If you are idea is new, inventive and can be made then you can move forward. Always try and protect your ideas. That spark lights the invention and you should own it and have success with it, no one else. ",
