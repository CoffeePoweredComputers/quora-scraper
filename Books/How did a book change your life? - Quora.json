            "answer_text": "If I would give a piece of advice, it would be to read. To read as much as possible. To allow yourself to be challenged, to be changed, criticized. To be amazed. To give yourself the opportunity to be empathetic and view the world from another\u2019s viewpoint. To be a child once more, to be a scientist or philosopher\u2026  Books are amazing, there\u2019s no other description. They change my life in various forms, but what I truly value about them is this: Perspective: I like to read every kind of book, from self-help and phycology to romance and poetry. Of course, I have a favorite kind, but sometimes I force myself to read a classic of some sort to broaden my world. We are getting a bunch of thoughts from a stranger. Maybe the writer is from another country and religion, maybe the book was written 200 years ago or maybe it\u2019s about a war or a fantasy word. By reading something that was written by someone completely different from me, with different backgrounds and history, it allows me to get new perspectives. It give us the opportunity to expand our universe, learn new things and practices. Either way, reading is a great way to observe viewpoints from several kinds of people. It\u2019s a way to make yourself complete. Dimension: There is something about reading the words of others that makes everything more human. From the storytelling world like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, to war descriptions in Man\u2019s Searching for Meaning by Viktor Frankl or the religious life of Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. Every book makes you bigger, makes you more mindful, wiser, more creative. It gives a greater dimension to life. I love that I can read a book today and 5 years from now reread it and get a totally different meaning from it. My experience and knowledge shapes the content I\u2019m reading and, at the same time, the content changes me and my future experiences. Books burst the bubbles we are in and add dimension to life. READ! Thanks for reading me. ",

            "answer_text": "So I used to hate reading. Like hate it. My mothers favorite books when she was little we're the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. One day, I decided to go to the library, so I got some of those books. That was when I discovered, I LOVED READING. I even joined the Battle of the Books team in our school. So I kept on reading different types of books. I started reading the first book of Harry Potter, having the attitude that it was boring. I WAS SO WRONG! I LOVE Harry Potter now and will NEVER GET bored of it. Recently I read the book called Wonder, by R. J. Palacio. That book was so striking and AMAZING. It showed the struggles the characters gone through, and not to judge people. It was so amazing, it's now a movie. Reading has taught me many things. Like don't judge things before u truly know it, and taught me to become smarter. If I didn't start reading, I would have hated books all my life, and it would have been hard to go through the future, as you have to read. It also taught me that the only good stories are not on Snapchat or Episode ( although episode is really good ) Reading also taught me not to be limited and have an open mind. ",
