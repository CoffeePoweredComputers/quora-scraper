            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sorry not to have replied to your question earlier. I can call myself a \u2018debut author\u2019 because my first book was published a year ago and only now have I had a book-signing event in a top bookstore. What did I do? Well, first of all I checked out some pictures on line to see how other authors displayed their books and what they took with them to decorate their tables. My publisher supplied the store with 15 books (I think that\u2019s the usual number) but I also took along 5 of my own just in case I sold out. The Store Manager didn\u2019t mind as he thought I\u2019d be lucky to sell all 15 books. I invested in the purchase of a pop-up banner which could extend to 6ft. It had the front cover of the book on it and a picture of me below. It was quite eye-catching, believe me, and I think it drew people towards me. To decorate the square table supplied to me I took along a nice yellow, circular table cloth, some fake flowers and, most importantly, a tub of chocolates which I knew the kids would like! My publisher was supposed to supply posters and bookmarks directly to the store but they never arrived. I was asked to sit near the entrance and hopefully attract people\u2019s attention to my books as they came in through the door. I was very nervous at first but I gradually calmed down and held one of my books up for the children and their parents to look at. I started chatting to them and telling them about the story line and characters in my book. The children enjoyed the chocolates, as did a few of the parents, so I\u2019ll do the same again if I have another event elsewhere. You\u2019ll be pleased to hear that I sold all 15 books in two hours plus 5 of my own which I sold for \u00a310 each and kept the money for myself. It seems that an author doesn\u2019t get paid for promotional work, so perhaps I\u2019ll buy a few more off the publisher and take them along with me if there\u2019s a next time. The good news is that my publisher told me the manager was delighted that I\u2019d sold all 15 books in only two hours and was planning to invite me to do another event at a different store in February. My advice is to take a bottle of water along with you in case your throat gets dry from talking. It was great fun and I enjoyed meeting the children and their parents. They even took pictures of me with their children which I hadn\u2019t even thought about! Good luck to all you first-time book-signers! ",

            "answer_text": "There are a bajillion answers for this question. My suggestion would be to listen to podcasts on how to market your book. The Creative Penn is a great place to start (though it\u2019s all about indie publishing and not just about marketing). Another good resource is Facebook groups geared toward indie authors. There will often be a lot of really good (already tested) tips for marketing. And while author marketing books are okay, this particular subject changes so quickly that unless the book has come out (or been substantially updated) in the last year or so, I probably wouldn\u2019t invest money in it. Seriously, because Amazon has such a heavy presence in this and because Amazon changes everything all the time (and without warning or explanation), it\u2019s much more efficient to be in author groups where the information can be updated dynamically with current changes rather than relying on a book that is static. Best of luck, VG ",

            "answer_text": "If you have a newly published book, (I assume this is what \u201cdebut\u201d means) then yes you should promote it on social media. Facebook. Twitter. Whatever media you have which had got followers. If you have your own blog, use that to promote the book. I do this all the time. If I do get a novel published, I will have done some of the groundwork. There is a certain amount of evidence that a publisher is more likely to accept a submission from an unknown author who already has a following on social media. ",
