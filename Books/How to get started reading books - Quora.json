            "answer_text": "I had lost all motivation to read. I just couldn\u2019t even sit for 5 minutes to read. But my life was horrible. I had no one to tell me what was right or wrong. I had no choice but to find answers from somewhere. So I started goggling things up. I goggled how to talk to people without offending them. Or how to handle negative people in life. That\u2019s when I started encountering Quora. I read a lot of philosphical answers. About how to improve yourself in life. How to talk to people and react in the right way. That led to me encountering better philosophical writers. I read more and more of their answers. Then I started to encounter their experiences in other fields and their failures in them and how they overcame it. So I discovered other fields like entrepreneurship. Or the journey of self help. More I read their experiences in these fields, more I became intrigued by it. Then I read about the books and the authors that influenced them a lot. I ordered those books and was completely blown away with the high quality stuff. Then I went and watched interviews of those people to find out more about them. Then I came across their favorite authors and books or blogs that impacted their lives a lot. Then I went back and read those. Which led to me discovering about more people and books. You see where I am going with this? Reading is like a chain reaction. One thing leads to another. One of the best things you can do is start with something that you already like. You like Hollywood gossips? Start with that. One thing would lead to another. You might encounter good writers who are passionate about Hollywood writing and then eventually you might find other things they write about and on and on and on. So how do you start reading? Pick something that you already like, however bizarre or odd it might be like fashion or shopping. And start small. For first three days, don\u2019t allow yourself to spend more than 5\u201310 min reading. Then eventually increase it. The snowball effect is absolutely essential to build a habit. You must do better than yesterday for a first few days. This is where most people make a mistake. They either pick something like wall street journal which they don\u2019t like or try to read an hour or so in the beginning. Then they can\u2019t increase it the next day and lose confidence and quit. So start somewhere and start small. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to tell you about the magic trick I stumbled upon a long time ago, when I was just a kid sitting in my old childhood bedroom with a battered old copy of Pride and Prejudice in my hands - definitely a dense read for a twelve year old! The trick was so magical, that it helped me not only finish hundreds of books, but develop a tenacious reading habit that has stayed with me ever since! This is what you do. You pick up any book you like - any book - and read 1 page today. That\u2019s it. 1 page. That\u2019s all you have to read. Doesn\u2019t sound a big deal, does it? Done? Good. Now tomorrow, come back and read 1 more page. That\u2019s it. Just one. And here\u2019s the important part - you cannot read more. No matter how much you want to do it, you must resist the temptation. At all cost. For the next five days, do the same thing. Read 1 page daily. That was your first week. You read 7 pages in total. Doesn\u2019t sound like much of an accomplishment, does it? Well, you\u2019ll just have to stick with me a teeny tiny bit longer, if you want to see something truly magical happen! For your second week, read 2 pages every day. 2 pages - that\u2019s it - you cannot read more, no matter how interesting the story begins to get. Done? Congratulations! you\u2019re now in your third week. And you just graduated to 3 pages a day. Go get \u2019em! You get the pattern now, don\u2019t you? Each new week, just increase your daily page target by 1. And if you do keep doing this over and over, by the time you reach your 52nd week, you would be reading 52 pages a day. 52 pages! Boy, that sounds like a lot. But you have to remember, you\u2019re not doing it at once. You\u2019ve had a year\u2019s worth of practice - gradually building up to it - one extra page a week. So, trust me, it\u2019s going to be spontaneous. But still, doesn\u2019t sound like it would add up to much, does it? Okay! Magic time. Let\u2019s count how many pages you have read in total - First week - 7 x 1 pages Second week - 7 x 2 pages : : : Fifty second week - 7 x 52 pages Total 7x1 + 7x2 + \u2026 + 7x52 = 7 x (1+2+\u2026+52) = 7 x 1378 = 9646 pages At 300 pages a novel on average, you would have finished 32 novels in the year! Just think about that for a moment. 32 novels. That\u2019s far more than most people will read in their entire lives. Plus you would have developed a lifelong reading habit that will take you places. Not too shabby for something that began with just 1 page, is it?  In case we\u2019re meeting for the first time, Hi, I\u2019m Abhimanyu Sood, the storyteller. Thanks for reading my answer\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The Red Queen said, \"Srart at the beginning, go the end, and quit.\" But let's see. Critical reading? Then you read the prefatory stuff. You find out about the author, because this helps with insight. You look where they came from, their careers, memberships, and achievements, and who they studied under. Then you might become more interested in these people and that helps with your topic.  Then take notes. You HAVE to do this. First, maybe you might want to just plain read it. Then you get out the notebook and write in your own words the topic of each paragraph. Or just the topic sentence--everyone has their own style and goals. But if you really want to get the subject down tight and be able to question it, no matter your style, this is how to do it. Write down names and stuff that interests you, interesting quotes, etc. This way, you can see what jumps out at you. There might be something boring and repetitive, and that would be one thing. Does the author contradict himself? Don't believe everything. You're pretty OK with scholarly stuff with citations, but you can still disagree. That's what this method is for. Then you can write about it. Reading improves your writing. Read peer reviews of the author you are looking at, and see how they write.  In their writing, count the \"is\" word. It's a bad word. It's a linking verb, and it makes you write in a passive voice. You want to be succinct. You have to bring the word count down in the upper classes. \"Is\" explodes your word count. My writing isn't the best for this post, but so. Notice there are four \"is's\" and one \"isn't.\" I noticed that I almost started to say \"'Is' MAKES your word count EXPLODE,\" but I caught myself and wrote in the active voice, and the word count went down and the voice became more active. If I was writing a paper, 4 or 5 is's is too many. I probably could have written all this without it. Do a word search for \"is\" in your own stuff to make sure. I also see I wrote \"I noticed\" when I could have just said \"I almost.\" So count how many times the authors use \"is,\" and also this: don't begin your sentences with \"So.\" Also \"And.\" Don't say \"where is it at?\" Just \"Where is it? Ever watch Cops? See how many times they DON''T end that question with \"at.\" They can't. They ALWAYS say \"where is he at?\" You don't want to do this. Authors begin sentences with \"So\" and \"And\" all the time; but, strangely enough, they don't end their sentences with a preposition. That's only halfway. Just because they start sentences with \"So\" or \"And\" doesn't mean you have to. Don't. Your writing will be shredded in grad school, and the undergraduate doesn't prepare you for this at all. So they want short word counts, but they don't give you these tips. when you write, you can do the same things to see if you can make it better: count the \"is,\" see if you can get rid of it by rewriting; maybe write down the topic sentence of your paragraphs, which will help you organize your thoughts.... That's an important point. Don't write like I am now when you are in a paper. It's OK because it's the Internet, but it behooves you to practice. Debating on the Internet, even arguing, is great practice writing. The other day I slammed this guy on Constitutional law, then I realized I had just written 4 pages. I had a paper due on the Constitution and free contract law, so I copy-pasted it into Word, got rid of all the insults and bad words, organized it, and changed his name to Rand Paul. Bam, I had an excellent 2-page paper that got the detailed point across in an active voice.  This practice carries over into your brain in general, and it helps you focus your writing, and with practice your thoughts will focus too. Get rid of the word \"will,\" too, if you can. And it helps when you have to rearrange sentences, which helps you organize your paragraphs, and then you can see if you are repeating or contradicting yourself. So count the number of times these authors use the word \"is,\" then count how many times you use it. Re-write your stuff without the word \"is,\" and your writing changes for the better. It's a dramatic change, and by eliminating \"is,\" you are forced to write in the active voice. \"This\" and \"was,\" too. \"This\" is vague and dull, and \"was\" is like \"is.\" You can write a whole book without the word.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019ll be like a Journey where you will never want to reach your destination because the Journey is mesmerizing! You will travel words to words, lines to lines, pages to pages and well, BOOKS TO BOOKS. How do you start? You make me remember a few lines from a Great book. Lemme quote it for you: Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u201d\u201cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u201d said the Cat.\u201cI don\u2019t much care where\u2013\u201d said Alice.\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u201d said the Cat.\u201c\u2013so long as I get SOMEWHERE,\u201d Alice added as an explanation.\u201cOh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u201d said the Cat, \u201cif you only walk long enough.\u201d (Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland). So you see that\u2019s the thing, If you don\u2019t know where you are going then any book will take you there. But if you even have a slight idea about where you want to go, say, fiction or non-fiction, then you\u2019ll get there too more easily. There is no hard and fast rule. Some people say you gotta read simple short stories first and then move on to big books before you get your hands on Classics! I am not saying they are wrong, but if the idea is to read and read more then any book of your choice will get you there. The first book I ever read was maybe a classic. I can\u2019t say for sure but it was Wuthering Heights. I didn\u2019t understand it for sure in one go. But it was interesting enough to keep me going with books. ",

            "answer_text": "Many people wrote great answers. Here is a little known secret that high school teachers use: First, find a book that interests you and open it to the first full page. Now, read that page aloud to yourself (do this in private). Keep track of all the words you have trouble reading or do not understand. If you don\u2019t understand 3 words on the pages, you have 3 points. If there are 5 or more words you have trouble reading or you don\u2019t understand, you might not want to read that book. It will be difficult to read, and not a fun experience. A lot of times adults feel like they HAVE TO read some book. But reading should be a FUN experience. I can\u2019t be fun if you don\u2019t understand the words. Many adults are embarrassed if they have trouble reading. This is silly. Adults have trouble reading because they were not taught the correct way to read. Many times, adults did not get enough practice as kids. Since I am on the Internet, I can\u2019t recommend to you a book that would be the perfect fit. However, I do have suggestions from friends. If you are having a lot of trouble reading, try these books for adult readers: Horror: The Book that Dripped Blood by Michael Dahl Famous Ghost Stories of North America by Matt Chandler Sports: College Basketball Championship (Major Sports Championship) by Tyler Omoth Kris Bryant: Baseball Superstar by Tyler Omoth Pass it Forward by Patrick Jones [Fiction] Just for Kindle: Freshwater Predators (Kindle Edition) by Craig Allen Secrets of the Dead (Kindle Edition) by John Townsend Sharks (Kindle Edition) by John Townsend If you are a good reader, but you don\u2019t like to read, try these books: One Fine Day, You\u2019re Gonna Die by Gail Bowen Unboxed by Non Pratt The Front Room by Michelle Mogorian The Artful Goddaughter by Melodie Campbell P.S. If these suggestions are not helpful, go to your local library. Your librarian would be able to help you. If there is a book you want to read, but it is difficult to read, you can always listen to it. One of my friends found The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins really hard to read. So she listened to it on audible. I found The Blithedale Romance by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston very hard to read. So I listened to them (on youtube) while reading along. Many people say, \u201cread the book before you see the movie.\u201d But, if you don\u2019t like to read or have trouble reading, SEE THE MOVIE BEFORE YOU READ THE BOOK. This will make the book much easier to understand. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is my journey into reading books.... First, a little context .... I am someone who had not read even a single book ever, apart from my school text books. I was someone who couldn't read a short passage in a newspaper. Neither was I capable of reading any magazine article, I used to just flip through pages looking at the pictures. All in all, till 18 years of my life, I had not read even a single book outside my academic books. As I stepped into the university, one thing was clear - I could clearly stood outside almost all the discussion relating to anything apart from semester's syllabus. I was not able to talk about anything and everything. And at some point of time it started to pinch me. So I wanted to change things for myself. One of my friends came handy in starting the journey.... Stage 1: He forced me to read the comic strips in the newspapers. And forced me to explain what I understood from those comic lines. (trust me, in those initial days I didn't understand those comic strips, almost 95% times). My friend was soft on me and used to patiently explain me his version of those comic strips and gave me a chance to grab those lines. I believe after six months or so, I was able to understand those comic strips at least 50% of the times. Stage 2: My friend was certain that I would take a long time to reach anywhere w.r.t. the skill of reading and making anything out of it. So his next challenge was to establish a connection between the written words and a visual translation/interpretation/representation of the same. So what he did did next was something which helped me the most - He asked me to start with the RK Narayan's Malgudi Days short stories and then we used to watch the exact TV episode of that story. I ended up becoming a fan of  RK Narayan. Initially I needed a dictionary to understand most of the words used there and then watching the TV episodes became more fulfilling. This suggestion really paced up my journey, and I was really learning to read. (#NoteToMyself - In those nascent days I pledged to myself that someday I will finish reading the complete works of RK Narayan.) Stage 3: My friend suggested that since I have already spend reading and watching some good number of short stories, time is right to start reading some mass-media publications - Self-Help books like - You can win, and Robin Sharma Stuff. I read exactly two books - You Can Win (by Shiv Khera), and The Monk who sold his Ferrari (by Robin Sharma). These were my first two books which I had read cover to cover. The language was easy, and the lessons were motherly, and to me it gave a sense satisfaction. These two books, I would say, are my start of a journey. Stage 4: Having read two self-help books, my friend suggested that by now you have wasted a lot of time gearing up to the challenge of reading (and understanding), so now you need to ramp up in terms of learning the contemporary vocabulary and the contemporary issues on which people talk. So, for next 3 months this is what I was supposed to do - a) Pull out the Editorial page and read it end to end during the day. b) Pick up all the words which I didn't understand, find their meaning from my Collin's dictionary and then re-read those lines once again and establish a meaning of those lines by the time the day got over. I believe after 3 months I didn't need dictionary anymore. Stage 5:  Having read newspaper editorials for more than 3 months, my friend declared that now I need to change the flavour of my reading. And he gave me 12 monthly editions of Reader's Digest from year 1999. I read them all. I marked each and every and every word and looked into my Collin's dictionary and re-read them again. I established that Reader's Digest is like a kaleidoscope of urban writing. I loved it. And ended up becoming a life-long subscriber of the magazine. I still read it every month. Stage 6:  As per my friend, I was really slow. But then I couldn't help the situation. So he suggested that now is the right time to touch upon some new flavours and get moving quickly. So he gave me a Sidney Sheldon - If Tomorrow Comes. He promised me that this book is gonna a Bollywood script and this will get finished in a breeze. I accepted the challenge and finished the whole book over a weekend. This was a kind of record for me to read, enjoy, and finish a book in a span of 2 days. My friend was OK with my speed because the book was so much like a movie plot. (And Bollywood did make a movie on this book a few years later - Ek Haseena Thi, with Saif Ali Khan and Urmila) Stage 6: Shifting the gear. My friend suggested that there is no need to read Sidney Sheldon ever again, because I won't get anything new in that writer now. I accepted that. And hence I needed to shift into a new genre - Biographies or Autobiographies. And since this was the first time I was supposed to buy a book, he suggested that I buy Gandhi's auto-biography - My Experiments With Truth, which was available for Rs 20/- in those days. I bought that book (my first book) and read it. Trust me, the book introduces you to a vocabulary which is so old that you will be surprised when you look for meaning of those words in your dictionary.  I think it took me more than a week to finish this book. But when I finished the book I had a sense of accomplishment. Stage 7: In those days, Ayn Rand was considered a cult among Engineering students. And my friend suggested that if I am able to finish one book of Ayn Rand and make any sense out of the writing, all this exercise would come to an end and I can continue the journey on my own. So he gave me the thinnest book of Ayn Rand hoping that I will dislike it - Anthem. Trust me, I loved the book. My friend took a test by discussing this book for almost next 10-12 days before accepting that I really loved the book and I am in a position to go ahead on my own. This set me free. I started choosing books on my own (but now I had to buy my books). I started reading anything and everything that felt interesting to me in those days. And I kept wandering until next 2-3 years when I had decided that what my real taste of reading is. And today I have a set pattern of reading, and a set of things I read week after week. Usually I read 50 books each year. And I write everyday, at least one article. Reading and Writing are not my job, but I believe I could have chosen these as my career. Alas, I am not so lucky. So, that's my story. Lesson for anyone who wants to read or start reading is - You just need a systematic plan and a friend who can guide you in this journey. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the times, I start from page 1. I skim through the publisher details and the contents page before i get to the preface or foreword if the book contains any. But i pay attention to the dedications page if the book has it. After all, starting from the very idea of writing a novel and finishing it, getting it published and having readers, all of it is a time taking, brainstorming and mentally exhausting task and when the author who does all of this, dedicates it to someone, that needs some attention from the readers end. Once i am done with this, i jump into the actual novel. Every time i start reading a novel, this phase is always exciting. From here on, how much time i end up reading before taking the first break depends on the book and time availability. And i never turn the book to see what the last page is. I have the urge to know how long the book is, but i kill it. Instead of seeing the last page number, i stare at how much volume of the book i have finished so far, and see how many times of it is still left(bookmarks help me with this). The choice of picking which book to read next changes from time to time. Like, i am currently reading Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility. I didn't see any reviews of it or got it as any recommendation. After reading Pride and Prejudice of the same author, i have decided i should read all of her remaining novels. So my current read is more of a deliberate pick. At times i randomly pick a book, that i don't even know about. I have a box of books which i bought from a book exhibition, which i bought solely from the way the cover pages looked and their synopsis.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, first step to reading a book is to find a book that interests you. If you haven't read any books earlier and the idea of reading a thick book tires you, you can start with short stories (so that you don't get bored with the ever extending plot of regular novels).  1. Get yourself your favorite munchies and drink.2. Open the book.3. Start reading the words written there till you reach some punctuation mark. 4. If it is a comma(,), then take a pause and continue reading.5. If it is a full stop(.) then, then well halt and try analyzing what you read.6. Go on read the next sentence. 7. If the text is between quotation marks (\" \"). Imagine a character from some movie, speaking it for you inside your  head, (for e.g. It's always Tony Stark inside my head, when I need a pep talk). This might be a little difficult initially, but you'll get used to and it'll just come by itself later. 8. Replace the voices/ characters for different characters in the book. Don't read all sentences in same voice. (No, never).9. Also, try putting emotions in the sentence you read. If it's a happy sentence, allow yourself to happy. If there's action involved, feel free to let the sound come alive. If you are reading some mystery novel, and got tired after a few chapters go to end and check out who's alive, who's missing. Go back to where you left and try figuring out what happened to that person. Alternately, you may skip a few chapters and play connect the dots (figuratively). Reading books is pretty interesting. Wish you a happy reading.. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Pick the right kind of book: Even an avid reader cannot pickup just any thing and start reading. To begin the habits of reading books, you should first pick up the right book for you. For most of us, Bestsellers won\u2019t suit, Friend\u2019s suggestion won\u2019t suit, no list on the internet can you give you what you want. You spend some time picking your own book. We can be sure that each one of us have our own set of interests, go by that logic and pick a book which might suit you. For instance, some may like war stories, some may like history, some may like romance, science, anthropology, physics, biographies\u2026. this list goes on. Metadata and the first act: Once you have picked up the book, you start reading it and you cannot get past 20 pages. It is the most difficult part. It is understandable that getting past the first act is difficult. For overcoming this, please do some background work regarding the book. Questions like, Who is the author? What are his credentials? What kind of reception the book got when released? In which period the book is written and what impact the period had on the author? Having answer to these kind of questions will sure make you glued to book and tolerate the slow first act. Because you know what the book stands and what you can expect. For instance, Booker prize is an prestigious literary award given each year for the best original novel written in English. During their 40th anniversary they awarded a special prize called Booker of Booker. which is best novel out of all the award winners so far. Indian prime minister at that time sued the author for defaming her family. Seven years later the same guy wrote a novel which is banned many countries and an Islamic group announced a bounty of $600,000 for the writers head. Are you intrigued? This will get you past the first act. Once you have reached that stage you will most probably finish the book. There starts your reading journey. If you fail even there, try next book. Repeat this process for few books, you will find what you want ultimately. ",

            "answer_text": "START with free & general stuff first. I would not even suggest any free ebook websites as most readers already know of loads of them. Just two things which I personally use and is open to use for all.  Disclosure: Both are ventures started by my bookworm friends. One is a non-profit venture started by my friend Amrut Deshmukh who happens to be a voracious readers and has made it his mission to spread the reading habit. So he sends Book Summary by Whatsapp for everyone who wants it. Just whatsapp him your Full Name to +91 9594700077 and get summary of a book as well as audio summary of that book free of cost every Wednesday. Different books in different weeks. Open to readers across the world and not just Indians.Good for starter as it is just summary and it is FREE. Don't worry that you don't know him personally. He has a mindboggling list of people who use his Whatsapp book summary and he does not know even 10% of them. Nor cares to know as long as he/she is a fellow reader who loves to read stuff. No charges at all hidden or otherwise. So Just whatsapp him and use it. It is free and will remain so (as Facebook says in its homepage. LOL) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another one is a for-profit venture which you guys probably already know of. This bro has started up an online store called neotonn (name inspired by Sir Isaac Newton). This online store has a Quick Suggestions option created by him which suggests shirts to men automatically on entering Skin Color, Body Shape & Height into it. Needless to say, it is his brainchild for he is the laziest person to go shopping. What a waste of time when he can spend the evening reading.Apart from the free \"Quick Suggestions\" for automatic suggestion of suitable shirt, this dude doesn't do Cash-on-delivery in his online store just because he can save costs and transfer the benefit of reduced costs to select customer in the form of FREE Surprise Gifts. You guessed it right. It is always a FREE \"book\". Different books in different months regardless of how much he can sell. One book per month is not bad for a start. Is it? Regardless of whether he may take a hit with his bad business strategy, he still does it (not that he takes a hit actually, he is too good for that). So much for the love of reading. Guys, use it at your own choice. Note: These two are two different stuff by two different people and not one combined thing nor related to each other financially or otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "I went from one to two books per year, excluding technical engineering books, to more than 20 in less than a year. Next year I hope to read even more. It\u2019s a powerful hobby. This is how I did it. First of all, pick a book or a genre that you enjoy. Don\u2019t just read a book because everyone else is reading it. I\u2019m sure you have experience watching TV shows, movies or documentaries. Think about what you like and start from there. Start small, but not too small. Try to start with at least 15 minutes a day, not less. This is so you can see the continuity of the book. Think about it; you wouldn\u2019t watch a movie or a TV show for less than 15 minutes at a time because if you chop the story in tiny pieces, you can\u2019t see the whole picture Let\u2019s say you read three pages in 15 minutes a day; by the time you\u2019re at page 100, it\u2019s been more than a month. It\u2019s easy to forget what happened on page 1 one month later, and then you have to go back and reread it so you can follow the plot. It might be challenging at first if you are not used to reading anything, but it\u2019s worth the effort. Schedule these 15 minutes in your day and remove all distractions like your phone, television, too much noise, hunger or sleepiness. Do give up on boring or too complicated books. Read at least the first chapter and then decide if you like it or not. It\u2019s not fun if you\u2019re genuinely not interested in the plot or if the vocabulary or writing style is way over your head. Think about the benefits of reading. You can travel to a different time and place; you can have conversations with people that died hundreds of years ago; you learn how to view things from different perspectives; you learn about subjects like economics, history, psychology, science, math, biographies etc.; you increase your vocabulary; you improve your writing skills; you improve your concentration; it\u2019s a good way to learn a new language. Finally, reading is like investing. Once you get the hang of it and realize how powerful it is, you wish you would have started earlier. ",

Some books are better at entertaining than others\u2014 they are often bestsellers and the like because of this. Librarians are great resources for recommending popular and unpopular books that are well-written and engaging\u2014 I would seek their advice. I would also think long and hard about what draws you to other kinds of media. Do you watch sports? Action movies? Science fiction? Do you like DIY shows, like \"This Old House\" ? Or maybe you prefer documentaries? Is non-fiction more interesting than fiction? And do you like fiction that's kind of fantastic or impossible, like SciFi or Fantasy? Or do you prefer more down to earth kinds of dramas, like Bluebloods or CSI? Maybe you prefer comedy, like Rush Hour? Look at what kinds of other media (movies, radio, video games, etc) you consume, and let that help you narrow your search as you start reading. ",

Love, look for a romance book. Wish you could date a redhead? Look for the redhead in a book with.a redhead.  Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a classic for her portrayal of a couple not finding their match very easy to take. 2. Want adventure?

A classic travel adventure might be Melville ' s \"Moby Dick\" , a classic mystery might be \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and a classic thriller might include Clancy ' s \"Red October\". 3. Have anger about politicos? Then political criticism books in the form of literature could include satires and utopia/dystopia ' s like \"1984\" or \"Brave New World\". 4. Love old ruins? Then a book like Michener ' s \"The Source\" which takes you down the layers of history and into the creation of the Israeli state offering up fiction, anthropology and arcaeology might be your thing. 5.

            "answer_text": "If you searched this question or decided to read it when it appeared in your feed then you are already on right track. It means you know that reading is important, and trust me it really is. Tips and Tricks mentioned in some other answers are really great and it may work for some people but I don\u2019t think they will have a lasting impact, at least not on me. So, what I did, I made reading, a game. I hate to lose, so I read more - this is how it works. If you love losing then stop reading right now, this answer is not for you. So what\u2019s the game? It is called Read More and it\u2019s inspired by cricket. So here are the rules- One match is one book and can last for several days.You have to set your reading rate (pages/day) and then read that much pages every day. You can set an estimated completion date for a book based on your reading rate. And you have to finish your match, I mean your book before that date.If you failed to read your daily reading target pages for some reason then you need to read more the next day in order to finish your book on your estimated completion date.Every book is a new challenge. Surely, I had lost sometimes but that\u2019s how I have read many books. I am a reader and I read daily but I still track my reading habits like how much pages I am reading every day and I always try to read more than the previous day. I also try to finish my book before estimated. I think what works in this technique is that your mind constantly focuses on what is pending and, so whenever I get an extra 5\u201310 minutes I prefer to read and try to complete my daily reading target. Earlier I used to do all this Maths on my whiteboard then I decided to make an android app to do all this for me. I added extra features like a read later list, daily reading statistics, and reading logs. Reading is way more fun now. If you want to try out this android app then here is the link - Read More: Reading Habit Tracker - Apps on Google Play  If you have some ideas which can help users to read more then please let me know. Thanks for reading :) ",

            "answer_text": "My inclination for the books started when i accidentally made some excellent books\u2019 choices that established my love for books. I started reading as a part of some silly challenge of reading a book in less than 2 days. The book in question was \u201cHarry Potter and the philosopher's stone\u201d. Though i lost the challenge but ended up discovering my fondness for books. The vivid imagination it instilled in me was an unparalleled experience for a school child. I ended up reading successive books in the series.Entered the college life and i came across Chetan Bhagat\u2019s \u201cFive point someone\u201d. Needless to say it proved an ideal set up to continue the journey.Then i gave a try to Dan Brown\u2019s \u201cDa Vinci Code\u201d and boy, I was fascinated by the book.Reading \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d by Paulo Coelho further developed my taste buds.Few more fiction books and all of a sudden i starting developing an inclination towards non-fiction books. By the time i was leaving college i developed a quest to know about lot of things let me to \u201cThe Naked Ape\u201d by Desmond Morris an another amazing book that so much about life and my own human body was hidden from my own intellect.My eagerness to know about my country led me to \u201cIndia Unbound\u201d and \u201cElephant\u2019s Paradigm\u201d by Gurcharan Das.Then i wanted to probe in Psychology and i read \u201cI am OK You are OK\u201d by Thomas Anthony Harris and that astounding book changed by perspective towards others.To know about my religion I read a very long book (some 1000 pages) about Hinduism.(I would add the name of the book when i recollect the name).And list adds on.. I have tried to read few more genres and though the quest has slowed down lately but still continues.So In brief I would like to sum up by mentioning below points that would help peaking up your interest till you develop an appetite for it: Start with Fiction and preferably the category that suits your interest.Prefer paper edition above digital at least for few initial books. Everything from the smell of paper to the sound of turning pages would make you fall in love.Be inquisitive and try out various genres. Try reading the popular books in the category. Take the help of Goodreads to get the reviews.If possible develop a circle of friends who have the common interest of reading.Reading book the last thing of the day is a love of its own kind. Try shutting down your system with reading a book as the last step.Happy Reading ! ",

Skim the front cover with the title, back cover with its credits, inside front cover often with a synopsis, inside back cover (continuing with the synopsis), credit titles on the back cover, and even the preface or introduction, so as to decide whether it piques your interest. Along with this browsing process, grab a few other books of your choice, and proceed to sit down on a desk and read. Read what you actually need. If a particular book is really worth your effort, energy and time for further reading, sign off the book from the library, and bring it home to read it in your leisure time. You can of course do the same thing in a bookstore, but you need to procure the book if you really like it so much. On the other hand, if you happen to have a good friend who is also a book lover, yo can go and visit him or her.  He or she may lend you some books that you may have an interest in.  More importantly, you now have a reading buddy, and both of you can always talk about the reading stuff you love. That's how you get started with developing your reading habit. ",

It gives you the freedom of browsing a large number of books, even reading them in the library, without any obligation of buying them. Take home whatever seems interesting. If you get hooked onto it, then it's good. If not, return it and pick up something else. Second, if you have never been into books, then a good way to ease into reading them is starting with graphic novels. They are usually not text-heavy and the visual component helps move through the story fast. A library may not have a good collection of graphic novels, so you may have to go to a good bookstore or comic-book store to find them.  I will not suggest any particular book, because every person has different tastes. Since you have never read any books, you don't know your own tastes yet. So, explore everything.  Good luck. ",

There my love for J.K. Rowling started. Harry Potter is still one of my favorites. Then in class 8th, I started reading romantic novels. Believe me; even if we criticize romantic genre as clich\u00e9 but they are everyone's favorite. Every reader must be liking one romantic novel for sure. They develope eagerness in mind. They grow interest towards reading So, I would suggest ; if you don't read at all then start with a romantic genre novel. Then start reading other novels of your interest. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Start with popular works of fiction. Select books which are easy to read with gripping narratives. Here are a few recommendations: Thrillers and mysteries - This is the best genre to start with. The element of suspense makes these books interesting. Some of the best thrillers for a beginner are :\u2018The Da Vinci Code\u2019 by Dan Brown\u2018Nothing lasts forever\u2019, \u2018Master of the game\u2019 and \u2018If tomorrow comes\u2019 by Sidney Sheldon\u2018Not a penny more, not a penny less\u2019, \u2018Kane and Abel\u2019 and \u2018The prodigal daughter\u2019 by Jeffrey Archer2. Detective fiction - Agatha Christie\u2019s novels deserve a category of their own. Most of them are short with many twists and turns and unexpected endings. \u2018Evil under the sun\u2019 , \u2018Murder on the orient express\u2019, \u2018Death on the nile\u2019 and \u2018Cat among the pigeons\u2019 are good books to start with. 3. \u2018Chick lit\u2019 - This is one of my guilty pleasures. These books are romances with a dash of humour. Sophie Kinsella is one of the best authors in this genre. \u2019Confessions of a shopaholic\u2019 is a great read. \u2018Bridget Jones diary\u2019 by Helen Fielding is one of the best books in this genre. 4. Historical fiction - Ken Follett\u2019s \u2018Pillars of the earth\u2019 is long but is a wonderful reading experience. It is well worth the time. \u2018Gone with the wind\u2019 by Margaret Mitchell is one of the most amazing works of fiction. 5. \u2018Harry Potter and the philosophers stone\u2019 - This book has inspired people all over the world to take up reading as a hobby. It needs no introduction. 6. Children\u2019s Classics - \u2018Treasure island\u2019 by Robert Louis Stevenson, \u2018Tom Sawyer\u2019 by Mark Twain, \u2018Anne of green gables\u2019 by L.M. Montgomery are enjoyable to read irrespective of age. 7. Indian books : If you wish to get a feel for Indian writing, I suggest that you read short stories by R. K. Narayan and Ruskin Bond\u2019s omnibus for children. Once you start enjoying the experience of reading, you will develop a feel for the genres you like. You can slowly move on to more challenging reads and works of literary fiction. Happy reading!!! ",

I regularly find many good books by looking in the NEW BOOKS section at the Hilo Public Library on the Big Island.  I like nonfiction books best.  I am usually engaged in actively reading more than one book at a time.  Yesterday, I checked out: \u201cTeach Yourself Visually, LinkedIn, The Fast and Easy Way to Learn,\u201d 2014 by Lance Whitney.  Last Saturday, I found: \u201cThe Looting Machine, Warlords, Oligarchs, Corporations, Smugglers, and the Theft of Africa's Wealth,\u201d 2015 by Tom Burgis (a good writer).  I am also reading a brand new book titled: \u201cWho's Afraid of the Big Bad Dragon?, Why China Has the best (and Worst) Education System in the World,\u201d 2014 by Yong Zhao (another good writer!).  You might enjoy reading: \u201cThe Wikileaks Files, The World According to US Empire, with an Introduction by Julian Assange,\u201d 2015 by Verso.

People seldom think today of what sheer magic writing, and consequently reading is.  No coincidence that in the days before advent of printing made books readily available, knowing how to read was considered a special craft akin to astrophysics.  The whole idea of replication of knowledge by such an ingenuous device is wholly lost  on modern people.  We no longer marvel at reading as sacred wonderment it used to be.  We read for pleasure and to kill time.  We read to forget, and to fall asleep.  So, to you I say, depending on what you are about to read, read it with respect for what went into writing.  Hope it helps. ",

Get as many as you can carry. Pick one up and start. If it doesn't grab you in five pages, pick up another one. Once you find one book, just one, that hits you, you will get hooked. Good luck!  ",

Wuthering Heights is an incredibly passionate book but can be a long and difficult read - it's a longer book and it's written in rather elaborate 19th century English. One book I was told that I would not be able to put down was The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien.

Impression after reading back cover. Is it sounds good enough? Is it promising?  Author. I have some 'instant purchase' author who I tend to love.  Goodreads review. With cell phone available, it's easy to snap a review. I like Goodreads. If It's rate below 3.5 then I might skip.  Series. Last factor to seal, if I read the series then the new book is instant buy (and read). ",
