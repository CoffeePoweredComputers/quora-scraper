            "answer_text": "They aren\u2019t Meghan\u2019s PR firm as such. She used them in her acting career and then Harry engaged them to handle the PR for Travalyst. Since they\u2019ve stepped back from the Working Royal Team they\u2019ve engaged them to handle PR for Archewell and to act as their \u2018\u2018spokesperson\u2019 when they want to make official press announcements. They\u2019ll also organize things like fundraisers, schedules and travel and living arrangements for their associated projects. They would have organized the use of the house in LA which was intended to be for the duration of their launching of the new Foundation and networking in that area. They also have James Holt doing a similar job for them in the UK to cover their interests there. Contrary to the false info some tabloids are still trying to sell, Sunshine Sachs has never handled the affairs of Harvey Weinstein, they represent The Weinstein Company (the company that ditched Harvey) They never represented Michael Jackson either, they represented The Jacksons.
