            "answer_text": "It depends on whether you are reading to be entertained (just a \u201creader\u201d) or reading as a writer. If you are reading as a \u201creader\u201d, read slowly and be sure you think a little as you go to ensure you capture the emotions and ideas the author is trying to generate within you. If you are reading as a \u201cwriter\u201d, look at the sentence structure, the variation is sentence length, the interplay of dialog and action. Feel free to jump around. In fact you will notice things if you read the book backwards. People who are shocked by that advice are \u201creaders\u201d. Take notice of how much text moves the plot forward and how much text merely sets the stage or provides interesting facts about the place and time where everything occurs. ",
