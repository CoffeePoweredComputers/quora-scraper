Narratives by escaped slaves were an extremely popular genre in the 19th century United States. Katherine Bailey mentioned 12 Years A Slave, by Solomon Northrup. Here are two more famous accounts of men who escaped slavery, plus Booker T. Washington's landmark autobiography. Narrative of William Wells Brown, A Fugitive Slave, Written By Himself, 1847. Narrative of the Adventures and Escape of Moses Roper, From American Slavery, 1848. Up From Slavery: An Autobiography, by Booker T. Washington, 1901. William Wells Brown and Moses Roper were about the same age as Frederick Douglass. Booker T. Washington was 40 years younger. Brown was born in Missouri and escaped from slavery when he was 19. He became a lecturer and activist in the North. Roper was born in North Carolina. He was sold several times to owners in different states and attempted to escape from many, if not all of them. He was finally sold to a Florida plantation owner. From there, he made his successful escape in 1834. Roper boarded a schooner to England and became a speaker in the anti-slavery movement. England had abolished slavery the year before Roper arrived. Eventually he married an Englishwoman and moved to Canada to live the rest of his life as a farmer. Both books describe the brutality and torture they experienced as slaves. The authors wrote about their thoughts concerning slavery and society. Brown reflected on the contradictions he saw between the Christianity espoused by Southerners and their behavior as slaveholders. Booker T. Washington was born in Virginia. He became free after the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. After describing his years as a child slave, his book focuses on his struggles to get an education at the Hampton Institute, and then on his work founding vocational schools, including the Tuskegee Institute. According to Wikipedia, Up From Slavery was the best-selling autobiography by an African-American until The Autobiography of Malcolm X was published in 1965.
