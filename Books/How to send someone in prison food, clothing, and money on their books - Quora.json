            "answer_text": "It really varies depending on the Prison the person is in. Each institution has their own rules, and contracts with different companies that handle inmate accounts. In the U.S. MOST prisons either use GTL Financial, or JPay. The way it works in Michigan, inmates have a TRUST account, which is basically like a \u201csavings\u201d account. They can use money from their Trust account for anything available at Their specific facility. They can use those funds at commissary to purchase food, and other health and beauty aids, they can use those funds to purchase clothing, shoes, etc from APPROVED outside vendors, and they can purchase phone cards. Then they have a seperate \u201cphone\u201d account. Those funds can ONLY be used for phone calls. As far as depositing funds, by far the easiest is to use a \u201ckiosk\u201d in the lobby of the istitution. You will need the inmates Name & Number, then to COMPLETE the transaction, you have to SCAN YOUR State issued I.D. or Drivers License. I believe the charge is like $4.00? But As you deposit money, THEIR money comes off FIRST! So if you put in $20.00 it only shows up as $16.00! Then you can add money via CC by calling whichever company that facility uses. Like JPay or GTL Financial. The SLOWEST, yet CHEAPEST option is the old snail mail route. This will ONLY cost you a STAMP and the price of a MONEY ORDER. (NO PERSONAL CHECKS ACCEPTED) The thing I find ridiculous about THAT method, is I am in Michigan. My Loved One is in Michigan. But to SEND money, I have to mail it to FLORIDA! They process it, then electronically send it. It takes FOREVER for the inmate to get it! *I noticed another post saying you can send a BOX to the prison, or put money orders in cards? PLEASE CALL before you do that. The rules change FREQUENTLY, ESPECIALLY when it comes to mail! (Due to drug & contraband smuggling) The rules recently changed where MY loved one is, and they wouldn't even let HIM get a letter I wrote because I wrote it on a YELLOW legal pad! They sent HIM a notice saying he received mail that was in \u201cviolation\u201d of the facilities mail code, so the item was destroyed! I KNEW the rules had changed recently, I READ ALL OF THE CHANGES ON-LINE! While it DID say EVERYTHING has to be in a WHITE ENVELOPE, written with either BLUE OR BLACK INK ONLY, It NEVER mentioned the PAPER you write on! So PLEASE, make a call first. They won't return things! They \u201cdestroy\u201d them. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll have to contact the prison/jail for a list of what can or can\u2019t be sent. This list may be available online if the facility has a website. It may also tell you how to label the box, and package sizes allowed. Follow those directions EXACTLY. Do NOT try to put anything extra or not allowed in the package - it will most likely be confiscated/destroyed. In some cases, they may send it back if the inmate agrees to pay for shipping from their books. Usually you can put a money order in with a birthday card or letter. Mail is opened and searched for things - do not send cash - it will disappear. Money orders are deposited into the inmates commissary/books. Again, contact the jail, or look at their website to see how they want you to fill out a money order. Some have online systems to allow use of a credit/debit card to deposit money - you will probably need whatever the inmates info is, including an identification number. Lastly, you can usually go to the jail, if possible, and deposit money\u2026 it may be an automated kiosk, where you will need the inmates info, or they may have a person who handles commissary accounts that can take cash.
