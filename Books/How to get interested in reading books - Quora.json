            "answer_text": "The best way to get interested in books is to read books that are interesting, and to associate books with something positive, like relaxation or comfort. I learned to love books because my grandmother read to me every night before bed. She found books that I liked--a series of mystery novels about a girl named Mandie Shaw--and read them to me a chapter at a time. She encouraged me to read passages for myself and eventually just handed me the book and reminded me to turn out the light and go to sleep at the end of the chapter like usual. She praised me for my love of books, indulged me in my desire for more books (it was the one thing I could almost guarantee she would buy me if I asked for it), gave me complete freedom with choosing what I wanted to read, and very rarely told me I couldn't read anything unless she felt the subject matter was truly inappropriate for my age. Because of her, I associate books with safety, with happiness and home, with family and also with personal identity. And I think the key is that books were never presented to me as a goal or a chore or a requirement, but as a treat. They were a short delay to bedtime, a reward for being good that day (two chapters instead of one!), a gift and a sign of affirmation. They were also a source of freedom and choice that was relatively rare in our household, because she was pretty strict about things like movies, television, toys, clothes, and time spent on the phone or computer. I read very little that would be considered classic literature, mind. I read a lot of The Babysitter's Club, Sweet Valley High, Nancy Drew, the Star Wars Expanded Universe, fairy tales, fantasy, science fiction, and horror. I did grow to love Agatha Christie and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I also eventually developed some favorites that fall in or near the literary canon, though not many. Christie and Doyle aside, I'm not a fan of Brit Lit, and I especially can't stand Jane Austen. I've soldiered through a few books simply because \"smart\" people are supposed to read them apparently, but for the most part if it doesn't grab me within the first two or three chapters, it goes back to the library and I move on to something that doesn't put me to sleep. And for all that most lit professors would (and have, and do) call my approach to reading sophomoric and pedestrian, I developed a sense of grammar, spelling, syntax, and vocabulary anyway, not to mention excellent reading comprehension. As it turns out, you can learn \"how to words\" just as well from things that are interesting as you can from, say, War and Peace.* That being said, how you foster an interest depends on a few factors. Do you seek to interest yourself in reading? Your students? Siblings, friends, your child? Every person is different, and not everyone will come to love reading books the same way. Some people will simply never come to love reading books at all. I personally find this unfortunate because I do love them so much, but I also acknowledge that books are not the only way to tell stories and foster critical thinking and communication skills, nor are they inherently superior to any other method of doing so. (There's this literary conceit that books are better than movies, television, video games, images, and the internet. And it's just that: a conceit. It has everything to do with a sense of superiority that educated people often have and feel they have earned because they are educated, and nothing to do with any inherent ability of one particular format of one particular medium to convey meaning more effectively than any other.) So why do you want to create an interest in reading books? Who are you creating this interest in? What do you want to accomplish by doing so? Are there factors that may make this difficult to do? That last one is important. For instance, my mother has ADHD, and because she was growing up and being educated primarily in the 1980's, this went completely undiagnosed and untreated until adulthood. She never enjoyed reading as a child because she didn't have teachers who understood her inability to focus, and so she associates reading with a chore and with being constantly scolded. Some people read for enjoyment or relaxation, but people with ADD, ADHD, dyslexia, or other learning obstacles may have a harder time enjoying reading books than others, not because they're stupid or uninterested in reading, but because reading is often more difficult and frustrating for them. With the right tools, these obstacles can be overcome, but they have to be acknowledged before that can happen. I think it's great that you want to foster an interest in reading books, whether for yourself or someone else. Happy reading! And if you give it a try and it doesn't work, I hope you find a medium that does, whatever it may be. When you do, I hope you enjoy getting stories and ideas from it, and never let anyone make you feel bad just because it doesn't happen to be a book. *No offense whatsoever to anyone who is actually interested in War and Peace. It is simply not among the things that I personally find interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "Pat yourself on the back for asking this question. I have often met people who complain about how reading is just boring and they just can't seem to take time out for it. Well, if you ask me, my End Semester Exams are approaching and I am in an endless battle of procrastination and more procrastination. Yesterday, I was supposed to finish 2 Units but what did I do? I finished a 400 page novel. Don't ask me how. Anyway, you see, reading is so captivating that it makes you want to forget your crucial tasks and devote time to it. This isn't necessarily good. However, I will tell you one thing, I wasn't a reader myself and to be honest, as lame as it sounds, I started reading Enid Blyton & Roald Dahl. This sparked my affection towards paperbacks & hardbacks. There was something so enthralling about living in another individual\u2019s world and live in their adventure. You also learn so many things! For example, vocabulary and the subtle art of exaggeration. So, if you want to get interested in reading, read a relatively small and easy book about your interest. For instance, I would highly recommend books like Night by Elie Wiesel or Man\u2019s Search For Meaning by Dr Viktor Frankl if you like Wars. They are compact & not difficult to read. If you like Mysteries, Agatha Christie is a wonderful writer to start with. I have read countless books by her. I am not telling you to start with a book like War and Peace or The Fountainhead. Take your time with it. No rushing. Be patient with it. You can't expect a suitcase full of thrill and an enthralling plot from the first chapter itself. A plot takes time to build. If you don't enjoy the book, keep it aside and read something else. Life is too short for reading books you don't enjoy. Also, one more thing that works for me. When you buy books, you are essentially spending a lot of money since books aren't cheap. So, you have 4 options:- Leave it in some forgotten nook and corner of your house and let it get dusty and mouldy.Gift it to somebody because you want nothing to do with it.Or, which works for me, feel guilty of spending your hard earned (in my case, hard given) money. Let the guilt do it\u2019s effects and voila! You might just actually read a book.Again, skipping the book and watching the movie instead.For choosing the right book which is very vital, Ask people for suggestions. Ask your 6th grade English Teacher perhaps.Search online. I usually check goodreads!Remember that no book is too \u201cbelow par in terms of intellect\u201d for you. An innocuous looking Children\u2019s book with illustrations might just teach you a lesson for a lifetime. It might throw you back into your childhood. It\u2019s about perspective.Finally, if you got past Buying a book & not discarding it, here is the fun part. This is what I do when I want to enjoy reading:- Switch off your internet. This is the biggest distraction.Listen to music if you want to but not something filled with \u2018Dhuchuchuk Dhuchuchuk\u2019 & \u2018Yo Yo\u2019 & other inappropriate things which I wouldn't like mentioning. You can listen to peaceful music. There is this app which plays really luxuriate sounds like that on the ocean or falling raindrops. That helps me.Tell everybody to not disrupt you.Also, remember one thing, if you have thoughts regarding abandoning the book and watching the movie instead well, think of it like this, when you watch a movie, you are watching it from somebody else\u2019s perspective. But, when you read a book, you are understanding it from your own perspective. For instance, I had a completely different image of Dumbledore. It wasn't Michael Gambon.Give the book a chance to blossom. Trust me, they aren't boring.After you read a book, discuss it with somebody. I don't know, maybe write a review.And if you got through all these 3 steps, reward yourself by buying another book and perpetuating the cycle. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "When first starting out you want to make reading a habit. If you are already bored of books but you want to get started then I suggest at least getting a good 20 minutes in. Read books you are interested in. Think about what concepts, settings, and genres interest you. For example, if you like space, mathematics, mechanics, or anything in the field of science, science fiction might appeal to you. If you like wizards, magic, knights, and strange monsters, fantasy might appeal to you When reading, get rid of distractions, and use it to reduce distractions. When you are reading, you dont want to have distractions or you will not understand what you are reading. One of the most important things in reading is comprehending what you are reading. Eventually, when you have a great interest in books and are reading ones you enjoy, your time spent on superficial things like social media will tank. When I needed to get a lot of books read last year, I would read every time social media came to mind. Set a goal. A lot of avid book readers set goals for the amount of books they read each year. Setting a goal makes you become more motivated to read more books. At first you may want to set small goals, but as you read more and more you should set the bar higher and higher. The most important one out of those four is reading books you are interested in. if you read books you dont enjoy, you will not want to read books. Dont force yourself to read a book you dont enjoy. Just because everyone else has read it and enjoyed it, doesn\u2019t mean you should have to read it just to feel included. Suggestions: I am a Fantasy, Sci-fi, and Historical Fiction (I\u2019ve also been considering picking up books on philosophy like \u201cThe Book of Five Rings\u201d or \u201cThe Temple of The Golden Pavilion\u201d). Suggestions for Fantasy: Lord of The Rings trilogy, and The Name of The Wind Suggestions for Sci-fi: Dark Matter, Snow Crash, Remembrance of Earth\u2019s Past (Three Body Problem trilogy). I dont suggest starting with Dune or Cryptonomicon. Both are very complicated, but very VERY good. Suggestions for Historical Fiction: The Walking Drum, Lonesome Gods, Last of The Breed (all three are by Louis L\u2019Amour, a historical fiction author that mainly writes Western fiction) Sorry this was so long. I just really like books :) ",

            "answer_text": "Make reading your only option. When I was 12 years old, my dad took my family to his ancestral home in Kerala,India.  Now I grew up in Dubai, a city where everyone had TVs filled with cartoons, and I played endless online computer games, in the young era of the internet. So visiting this house, where my father grew up and played in, was a shocking experience for me. The village is a beautiful place, and the people are genuinely kind and friendly. The tea is superb, and the cool breeze induces the most peaceful sleep ever. But there was one major drawback. There were no cartoons to watch or computer games to play. For the first time, I could not think of anything to do to amuse myself. Time had never been so slow in my life. I remember walking up to my dad, whining for the spoilt child I was, that his ancestral house was boring and that I didn\u2019t have anything to do. He must have felt very happy to be back at his real home with his mother. He was busy running around meeting the villagers, and going to the food markets. So he didn\u2019t waste time on my negative energy. He simply said \u201cWell, find something to do\u201d and walked away. After finishing my tea at breakfast, I was so bored that I went snooping around in the old cupboard and shelves in the dining room. A book fell on to my hand. It was a dusty old book. which had been untouched for about twenty years. I was surprised to see the name of my uncle on the front page, and struggled to imagine a younger version of my usually easy-going uncle, studiously reading books in college. In this village, where technology had yet to catch up, where I was bored out of my mind, I was introduced to Stephen Hawking\u2019s \u201cBrief History of Time\u201d. I didn\u2019t need motivation when reading was the only option I had. I opened the book, and was hooked. I can\u2019t pinpoint why the book grabbed my attention. Maybe I had always been fascinated by space, and this book was trying to explain its mysteries. I remember getting up in the morning, trying to get done with breakfast as soon as i could, and opening this complex book, trying slowly to understand what Stephen Hawking wanted to tell me. I was only 10 years old, so it took me a while to get through this book. I spent the next two months at the ancestral house, reading this book when I felt bored. The day I finished the book, I was lying on my bed. It was about 7am,and the sun peeked in through the windows. I turned over the last page, and just turned my head towards the light. And I knew I would never be the same again. My perspective has shifted. I was wondering about entropy all the time. I was mesmerized by the Big Bang, the expanding universe, and mysterious dark matter. It was beautiful that I could know so much about things I probably would not interact with in my lifetime. And I could converse with an amazing human being. In one book. That is an out-of-body experience, literally. When I left to Dubai, I took this book with me, and it continues to be one of my favorite reads of all time. I would have not found this book if I wasn\u2019t crying from boredom. I would have been blissfully unaware, receiving instant gratification from cartoons or computer games.Try to get rid of social media, Youtube, and Candy Crush for a month. You might be surprised about where your boredom takes you. You want motivation? You won\u2019t need it. Make reading your only option. ",

Because you clearly know you want to start a reading habit or else you wouldn\u2019t have asked this question :) I\u2019ll lay this out in 3 personal commandments to abide by and 5 shorts steps to start the habit. And i believe you should be a reader in no time. 3 Commandants: Not an interesting topic, no chill: Do not for the love of humanity read a book on a topic that simply does not interest you, but others say is cool30-Page Rule: It is not a crime to put down a book if after 30 pages it still hasn\u2019t sucked you in. Throw it away. Unfinished-book guilt is real. And the sooner you accept it and come to terms with it the better. Move to the next one on your list2-way conversation: Make reading an active activity, and not a passive one. By that I mean when you\u2019re reading, really read. Take notes in the margins and scribble your thoughts on the pages. Make it a conversation between you and the author. Make out with the writer\u2019s brain by puking out your own brain onto the pages. Fiction, non-fiction, biography, doesn\u2019t matter. Reading actively and writing your thoughts, emotions, responses will change the way you take in the content. Go wild. No one else gets to see what you wrote :)okay, now The 5 Steps: Ask 5 friends or family for one book that blew their mind - and if the topic interests you or the author seems cool, buy the book. A physical paper copy. You\u2019ve officially just started your library. And trust me, years down the line this will be the best part of the inheritance your children will receive (my collection has 300 right now and i love it :)Block 30-minutes every night on your calendar. Put away the laptop and phone. They belong in the living room at night, or at least need to be off. Have a cool shower right before you get in bed, put off all the lights, except one behind your bed, and get cosyAim to read as slowly as you want. No pressure. Wanna read a sentence again? Do it. Wanna read it 5 times? Do it. Go at your own pace. There\u2019s no rush. Just try and finish 15 pages before you fall sleepKeep the book right by your bed. And bookmarked - self explanatory. You\u2019ve gotta make it as easy as possible to actually pick up the book and read, or else our reptile brains make stupid excuses not to do soWhen you finish, tell someone the story in your own words. Tell your mom, or your partner, or write it out on Goodreads, or your blog, or wherever, just tell someone how awesome or horrible it was. In your own words.3 Commandments + 5 Steps + Time Voila! ",

            "answer_text": "The fact that you are interested in reading books is amazing. I believe books are underrated and can have a profound effect on our lives. To get interested in reading books, start by thinking in specifics, what are your exact challenges : Do you buy books and surround yourself with them?If no, this is your first action step. Buy physical books, Buy ebooks , buy a Kindle. Borrow books from friends and family. Join a public library near you.If yes, great, you have passed the first test in your pursuit of reading.You have books(bought/borrowed) but somehow never end up reading them.If yes, make sure to keep your books at strategic places where you can\u2019t miss them. Place them at your bedside table, coffee table, the backpack you carry on your office commute or while traveling etc. If you read ebooks, keep a few books downloaded on your device always so you can start reading it whenever you find the time.If no, great, move on to step 3.You start reading books you bought and just can\u2019t make yourself to read any more after a few pages because it doesn\u2019t interest you enough or you can\u2019t find the time.This is where finding the right book is extremely important. This is where getting book recommendations tailored to your needs might help.If you tie your reading with a purpose, you will be more incentivized to read. You can read books to solve a problem, to learn something you don\u2019t know or even just for pleasure. I read books to gain perspective about all sorts of problems, for example: I am working on building a book recommendation product known as BookPrescriber. As with most early stage ideas, the challenge is finding the audience. To solve this problem , I read a book \u2018Traction\u2019 by Justin Mares, Gabriel Weinberg and it gave me several eye-opening ideas as to how to go about it.I would suggest you to think of a problem you are facing, it can be a personal or a professional issue: relationships, work, stress, depression etc. Choose anything that bothers you and then read about that, I am sure you\u2019ll gain some perspective. If there is a very specific problem you face, and you need books tailored especially for you, try personalized book recommendations.Read Non-Fiction to be more knowledgeable everyday. Read biographies, auto-biographies or memoirs to learn about the lives of others. You\u2019ll be surprised how many people face the same issues as you, you\u2019ll find solace in the fact that you aren\u2019t alone in your struggles. And you can even learn the strategies applied by other people when faced with similar issues. Read about health and wellness, travel the world, get introduced to philosophy or just read to broaden your mind.Read Fiction to be entertained. Read Adventure and mystery novels for some thrill, short stories when you are starting off to read, books that will take you around the world in the comforts of your home.Read Graphic Novels - They are just like comics, and if you love reading them, and feel guilty or worried that this isn\u2019t counted as reading, change your world-view. Things are changing, comics and graphic novels are finally getting their due. This year, Sabrina by Nick Drnaso was the first Graphic Novel to be nominated for the long list of the Man Booker Prize.I believe there is immense power in books, find the right book for your life and read more everyday with purpose to become a better version of yourself.

            "answer_text": "Wow! That\u2019s possibly one of the best questions I would love to answer. Let me tell you a story. There was a kid having a very high mental acumen and decent memorizing skills. Since his school-days as he was able to grasp everything pretty easily he did not care of reading stuff much from his textbooks and found reading to be a pretty boring stuff. Whenever he started reading his textbook he would quickly grasp the gist just from what his teacher had taught him and skip reading the remaining part as he thought it to be a waste of time. The time went pass by in a flash and he ended up in a decent engineering college where he encountered people having a very good appetite for reading, where most of the people had reading to be on their list of hobbies. Puzzled and confused he approached a friend of his and asked him what makes him devour books? His friend just passed on a smile and took him to the library. Their the friend paused near the fiction section and passed on a book \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d by Dan Brown to him and asked him to just read the first lesson of it. Puzzled by the terse reply from his friend, he just heeded his friends advice and went back home and started reading the novel. Ironically, he ended up reading the first 10 chapters and ended up reading the whole night. So, what made the guy who haven\u2019t read a great deal about anything his whole life end up reading, which definitely was not his genre? It was the plot of the story and the way the author kept the reader involved in his story. The author\u2019s way of writing, the words used, the detail of each and every subject of the story got the better of the reader. Since then he repeatedly kept asking his friends to suggest him books to read. In a similar way, to gain an interest in reading books, start with some genre which you like, be it romance, autobiography of your favorite sportsmen, mystery, inspirational books, anything which you like. It will help you gain an appetite in reading. A good vocabulary is not a prerequisite to start reading books, it is something which can be developed over time. Once you get an edge over reading, shift to different genres and try reading as many different types of books as you can. After reading, say a chapter of a book or a whole book for that matter, sit down and write a summary of what you read or some quotes which happened to impress you the most. If not write then at-least spare some time with your siblings or your parents briefing them on what you read cause they are the people who will definitely spare some time for you no matter what. This will help you improve your retention capacity. *A lot many people abandon reading just because they are not able to connect the dots after a while, this is where writing the summary or narrating it before someone comes into picture.* The guy now had developed a voracious appetite for reading and ends up reading at-least one book a month by simply adhering to the tips mentioned above. But that\u2019s not just the end of the story, the reading hobby got the better of that boy and he ended up writing stuff as well and you just happened to read one of those. ",

Now, that might not be your situation at all, but as a preliminary matter, it might be worth getting yourself tested--it's possible you have dyslexia or another type of issue that could make it difficult for you to read or retain prose, despite the fact that you can read code.  That aside, I have two suggestions for developing an interest in reading.  The first is that you have to find something to read that you find interesting.  You say that you've bought a couple of 300-400 page non-fiction books, but I get the feeling that you're not particularly interested in them.  If you can't spend more than 10 minutes on a newspaper article, 300-400 pages of nonfiction may not be your style. Instead, I suggest you start with shorter works, such as long-from journalism, or short stories.  Longform is a well-established website that collects longer articles about specific topics.  There are also countless well-respected short story writers, from Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury (sci-fi) to Alice Munro (Noble-prize winning author)--you just have to find someone that you find engaging.  If you're really more interested in non-fiction, you might try something generally agreed to be highly readable and approachable, such as Bill Bryson (a very engaging historian) or Malcolm Gladwell (social science).  Surely you have a hobby of some sort--try reading something to do with that.  The goal is to try reading a variety of things that sound interesting to you to find something that engages your mind and helps you retain the text. My second recommendation is that you actively approach your reading with a particular strategy to retain the information you're going to read.  This is going to take some experimentation as well, but you might keep a highlighter or a pencil in hand so that you can make notes, underline, or do whatever else you need to do to get your mind thinking about what you're reading.  In a similar vein, there are a whole bunch of websites that claim to have strategies for helping people to retain what they've read, through outlining and the like.  I haven't used any of them, so I can't tell you what will work.  But it may be that one of them will come through for you.   It may very well be that you're never going to be able to just reflexively retain things you read--some people just can't do that.  But you may be able to learn ways of helping yourself do it. ",

            "answer_text": "First find the time. It is no good thinking you are going to read the books you have chosen, if you have not made the time to read them. It is a like buying a computer. If you do not make room in your life for one, you will almost always find that you will not enjoy the 'thing' in your life. You are supposed to enjoy this life. With books, first understand that they are a product that many people have invested their time an effort in producing. If you look at books purely as books, and do not look at this wider picture, you will not get the most out of the experience.  The first rule is that once you have prepared your life for books, only buy a book you cannot walk away from. It is like buying a pet dog; it tells you what pup to take away from the pet shop. You should never buy a book for any other reason; borrow one, if a friend has recommended one to you. That is what libraries are for, and friends with books. The second rule is, when you have the book in your possession at home, take time to scan the workmanship of the publisher, author, read all the stuff other people don't read, like footnotes, acknowledgements, and certainly the preface or introduction. Remember that somebody spent a lot of time writing this book, and put in more man hours/years than most people spent at their paid work. In most cases it is a work of love. Only then settle down to reading the book. I tend to leave the book around for days, even weeks, and some books lie around for years until I am ready to read the book that chose me. Books are dialogue. The author is in some kind of dialogue. If the book chose you, then you will find that the author is in dialogue with you. If somebody recommended it, then it is very likely the author is in dialogue with them, not you. That is why the two other rules are important. You should put in the same amount of love and full attention what you read the author puts into writing it. If you do, both parties are enjoying intercourse from a distance. It is not unlike making music, only both parties are not present in the same room. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "This year ( by 18th July 2020) I have read over 14 books of which 5 were read in just the last 17 days. I mostly read self-help and psychology-related books. Most fiction and biographies can be so interesting that you may wanna read instead of watching Netflix. Whereas some self-help books can be so boring that reading them can be a torturing experience. My Good Reads Collection: Ashutosh Agrawal\u2019s 'read' books on Goodreads (24 books) Here are my tips and tricks for you to start reading books. Everyone is so hyped up about books and their benefits. So I too thought about reading books but it turned out to be a dizzying experience. Guess why? Because at this time, due to youtube, Instagram, and Tiktok, our attention span has reduced drastically. Most of us can\u2019t focus and read lines of text anymore. It\u2019s natural. But we still have got other options too. One such option is instead of reading books, listen to them. Yeah, I am talking about Amazon Audible. But wait, Ash! Audible is too expensive. Yeah, it is. But if you can spend money on Netflix or Amazon Prime i.e. Entertainment you should also spend some on Edutainment. For those of you who can\u2019t afford Audible or any paid service, I have a secret recipe for you. Step 1: Download Ebooks (.epub) from online websites or convert PDFs to Ebooks using online tools. Step 2: If on a PC download Freda, it's a fantastic ebook reader. Android also has some free options like Moon Reader [Bonus: Use OpenDyslexic Font] Step 3: Start Text To Speech and enjoy listening to that robotic voice reciting the book to you. Now, Now, don\u2019t go away, it isn\u2019t as bad. I am using it for the past 1.5 years and it\u2019s nice. Set it to your desired pitch and rate and it will be perfect and natural. Just try it once and if it doesn\u2019t work for you then what other option do you have? But let\u2019s not stop here. Let\u2019s talk about a reward system which will motivate us to read more and more books. I am an anime fan, so it\u2019s really hard for me to choose between anime and books. So I have told my self that time spent in reading books = time spent in watching anime Typically reading a page may take from 1\u20132 min, which means reading a 200-page book will grant you over 3 hours of anime credits as a reward. Now I had a little debate if 2 page of book = 1 min of anime ( If edutainment > entertainment ) OR 1 page of book = 2 min of anime ( If edutainment < entertainment )  So set your daily goals in exchange for something you enjoy a ton and isn\u2019t harmful. Like read 30 pages a day to watch anime for 1 hour or Read 1 book to watch a movie All the best for your journey of reading books and don\u2019t forget that finishing a book (goal) doesn\u2019t give as much joy as enjoying the book (journey) ",

Books market are flooded with these kinds of books who prey on fast finishing habit of readers. Chetan Bhagat, Stephen King, John Grisham are few example.Even after above step one is not able to concentrate on reading. He or She should go for children authors. Ruskin Bond, Enid Blyton, Roald Dhal. If one is again finding these books difficult to concentrate then go for comics or children short stories. Start from bottom don\u2019t loose hope.

            "answer_text": "For me, reading used to be a very demanding task as compared to e.g watching videos due to one factor: I didn\u2019t have any expectations to remember the latter. I felt as if in order to progress in the book, I had to remember and analyze carefully what I had read. In the end, I feared that all the reading would accumulate in only weakly latent memories. Plus, watching the videos felt more stimulating and were only confined to short durations. This pessimistic mindset about books changed whenever I realized that: Books as a form of entertainment are superior to the short and not consistent - yet entertaining - videos. Their nature of being consumed during a long time gives them a great depth of knowledge which might say something about the world. This, in comparison to the videos that at max gave me shallow facts.Reading the right fiction book, can be an adventure. By supposing a thematic concept and a thematic statement after a while to prove using the book, reading the book becomes more than merely reading. The way to accomplish the task is to interpret the book\u2019s content and search for quotes, in the same way an adventurer grasps its surroundings and collect keys for the dungeon. Since the reading is personal, the thematic statements and concepts won\u2019t necessarily be put to the test, so there is no pressure like the one school can evoke. When the concept has been thought through so much, it is sure to be retained.Taking notes is good. While this might feel much like school, it is a good way to relieve the burden of having to remember too many things and thus the paranoia of forgetting 99% of the book and complicating the analytical process. I take a my notes on a comfortably big paper accordingly to below:Front page: dedicated for notes, chapter summaries and answers for deeper questions about the bookBoth notes and chapter summarizes are noted using few words that go to the core of what is meant to be notedChapter summary: e.g a chapter about a king whose ungodly ways of life supposedly provoked God\u2019s wrath by flooding whose kingdom later fell in civil war can be summarized as \u201chedonistic king =>flood&war\u201d. With those key words I should be able to recall most of the chapter. Every chapter summary has the number of the summarized chapter to its left.Notes: e.g an interesting fact. Every note\u2019s left has a dot as a separator.Deeper questions: questions that might be answered throughout the book and aren\u2019t easily answered and might say something deeper about the book.When finishing a page, skim through the page and summarize each section with few words, then re-read the last section. This way you will better remember what you have read.Example: Back side:From the top to about 2/4 to about 3/4 of the page, depending on book and paper size, is dedicated to important characters of the story. Each name is underlined and has space from the next character in which you write down key words about their character, such as traits or visuals.The rest of the page is dedicated to the thematic concept and statement. Since the thematic concept only requires one word and the thematic statement only one sentence, it is possible to put the two on the same row, albeit giving the latter potential space to the next row.If the thematic statement is expected to go to another row, the \u201cquotes (affirming above)\u201d will be put where it\u2019s expected to end, otherwise the title will be simply put on a new row. This is where you put interesting quotes you find throughout the book accordingly to a format defined below. Once you have decided what thematic statement the book has, you will look through the quotes and underline the ones that affirm. The simplest formatting of a quote will look like: P<page number><first word of quote>,<last word of quote>. On one page there could however be several interesting quotes and one word might appear several times. That is why the following format might be needed: P<page number>(<first word of quote <second word of quote>), <last word of quote>. If a quote stretches several pages, simply make the it P<start page number>-<end page number>. Full formatting: P<start page number>-<end page number>(<first word of quote> <second word of quote),(<second last word of quote> <last word of quote>). To save precious space, the starting Ps will also be the ones separating the quotes.When reading a non-fiction book, the top becomes reserved for questions about the book to make my reading more active, enumerated like: \u201c1 How is X in book similar to Y? 2 How is X implemented? 3 What happens when X is implemented?\u201d. The numbers will serve as reference points for notes on the front page giving information in regards to questions and points these questions in the thematic concept/statement and quotes section. The front page will become notes and quote-area using the format named aboveexample of backside for a fiction book The real reason videos took so much attention was due to them being conveniently accessible on the same device I am being productive on most of the time. When you are on your computer and switch to a video for 10 minutes, it takes some time but you are still on the same device and can therefore quickly go back. Changing to a book on the other hand, is effectively declaring to yourself that you change activity. Reading does therefore have to take place before or after reading hours. I think that there might equally have to be an need to rid oneself of high stimulants that are social media in general in order to like the slow pace of books. However once it has been achieved, much more simpler things can be appreciated in life. By equipping oneself with something to note on, reading becomes a memorable adventure. ",

            "answer_text": "First of you should consider why you want to read books. Is it because you see others reading? Because you want to read? Because you want to be more intellectual? You want to learn something? Be entertained? Other?.. There are a thousand reasons for reading and if you know yours thats a good place to start. (perhaps just wanting to read a book is a good one. .. Then having a set time and read the book in intervals (perhaps chapter by chapter or for 10\u201320 min each and every day) Also consider just what it is about books you might be apprehensive about. If its the length then comics and even children\u2019s books might be a good place to start (try the thicker ones though as the thinnest \u2018easy to read\u2019 might be a bit too simple though. With comics there are a great variation and many are even made for adults/teenagers.. Never mind the Japanese manga (well worth a try - even more so if you like anime (its usually fairly similar or even exactly the same (.. except the anime has fillers which the manga does not have) If its the actual books (that you may or may not get the point of reading for entertainment) then factual or even historical books (non-fiction essentially) might be a good place to start. If you choose a topic you want to learn more about (and are interested in) then that might make it easier to read. When it comes to fiction you should try the various genres (and even various writing styles) and try to figure out which draws you in the most. I personally find a lot of science fiction boring but I do love a good fantasy novel (on the telly I don\u2019t/rarely watch fantasy movies and often science fiction so..). If you like watching the television there are shows and movies that originated from books. .. and its also a good place to start (there\u2019s a reason they were filmed in the first place). Essentially - consider why you need to motivate yourself to read books (I\u2019m not you after all) and go from there :) You can do it. It may require forcing yourself to read at first and to try out various types of books to find what is the easiest for you to read (and perhaps even consider reading well recommended books) and other than that I wish you good luck. Have fun reading :) ",

            "answer_text": "Actually you have asked two questions... One is How did I get interested in reading books? You want to know my experience. Then in the description you have asked how can you get the same effect that you get from movies while reading a book...  I will try to answer both... First for the question 1: How did I get interested in reading books? I got interested into reading books at around my grade 6/7. During those times mostly I like to read the classics and short stories. As things don't hold my attention for too long. I was mildly into comics but not too much. Things changed when I saw the first movie of the Harry Potter series. I loved the movie and wanted to know what will happen next. I later came to know that the movie is based on a book series. Hence I pleaded with my mom and bought the second book in the series. It look me a whole 10 days to read through the book. I was struggling as it was the first novel reading experience. But I was not prepared for the experience, while I am reading the book a movie was being played out in my mind. I am creating a rich and pleasant experience that I have never experienced.  And there it all started for me.. Naturally I got hold of the other harry potter books released at that time.. From there I went on to read the Lord of the rings series... And  for me things really spiraled out from there... For your second question: How you can get the same experience from reading a book? Reading a book is an effort and for each effort you need a reward. So what kind of reward your are expecting depends on validating the worthiness of the reading effort. Imagine you want to escape the tiredness of a stressful day, a fantasy book might offer you an escape to a magical place. You are looking at having the edge in your job, a book on the recent trends or new technology might give you the edge you require. Hence you need to find the good balance of effort and reward system to help you pick up the habit. As with all new habits, it grows on you over a period of time. After a few days, reading might no longer be an effort but will become a reward by itself.  Giving you the double whammy you needed !!! Some points to note: Reading fiction is a very pleasurable experience if you have a reach creative mind and are able to imagine the things you read. If you want to cultivate the reading habit start with something simple, read a book based on your current movie or TV series, it will make the mental creative process easier. Then you can move on to other genre of books.  Reading non fiction, for me,still is an effort in spite of years of reading experience. But I am after the rewards it provides. And finally thanks for this question, it has really reminded me why I was in love with my books in the first place... Have to get back to my magical places !! ",

            "answer_text": "The most important thing you can ever do to increase your interest in reading is to NOT read books that don\u2019t interest. It sounds really simple and obvious, but a common mistake people make is that they force themselves to read and finish a book they genuinely don\u2019t enjoy which just makes them not to read any other books. Some kids grow up not liking to read, because they have to read certain books for school that they don\u2019t enjoy and end up assuming that all books are just as terrible to read. Another simple action to do is to read the summary of any book before you read. Goodreads is an amazing website that not only will give you a full summary of the book, but also let you see how many stars they book got and others comments on the book. Doing this will let you choose books that actually sound interesting to you before you read them, so there is less likely of a chance you end up not liking the book. Really once you start reading, you start to follow certain series, authors, or genres and then your interest will just keep going on it\u2019s own. But to start interest, the best way to research books YOU like/want to read and to not read books you hate just because you want to read. ",

And as no one on Quora knows what kind of things you like to read, you need to think about that yourself. I could recommend books that I love to read and they may be the most boring books ever to you. It would be a waste of my time and yours. Think about what you like to read. Do you like to read stories? If so, then there are so many genres to choose from in the world of fiction. Could be crimelove storiesscience-fictionliterarythrillerfantasymagic realismOnly you know what kind of stories get you excited. Once you know that, then those are the kind of novels and stories you should read. But maybe you have no interest in fiction, maybe you like non-fiction. That could be historybiographyself-helpphilosophyand many othersAgain, determine what kind of books you are interested in, then start reading those.  A good website to find books is Goodreads. This is like Facebook for people who like to read. You might find a book you are interested in and you read it. Then you want to find more books like this. Go on Goodreads and put the book title in the search bar. It would then show you the book plus other books that readers also liked. It literally feeds you a choice of similar books to read. Goodreads also has groups. Maybe you are really into crime fiction. So you join a crime fiction group. Now you can ask the members for book suggestions and they can offer you some choices. Very soon, you could build up a list of books that you want to read. And all in a genre or style that you are interested in. But asking other people what books to read on Quora is not useful. They could give their suggestions, but these are books they like. And you may not like them at all. ",

Adventure movies? World-building video games? There are almost certainly things that interest you. Make a visit to your local independent bookstore. This is important, because they are more likely to have knowledgable staff who can talk about books. Tell them that you\u2019re not a reader, but like horses or food or politics, and ask for suggestions. Leave the store with a couple or three books, and one of them may \u201ctake.\u201d Once you find one book you\u2019ve enjoyed, you can go back to the store and tell them that you hated Hemingway and loved Faulkner or loved A.O. Wilson\u2019s writing about ants, but would like similar writing about mammals, and they\u2019ll be able to help you find more books you\u2019ll enjoy.

            "answer_text": "Light up your IMAGINATION!Summary: start small. Do you remember how you learnt how to write?  You probably started off by attempting to represent the world around you on some kind of medium. This could have been your mom\u2019s wall(she almost killed me), sand, or paper based materials. From this point you learnt the alphabet, individual words, and then slowly worked your way up to sentence construction. Unless Andrew is a Martian child prodigy, he\u2019s going to need time to become comfortable with writing.  Since we are talking about reading, I would advise you to start with comics. I know you that you are probably rolling your eyes right now, but they will definitely make reading fun, and they will lay a good foundation for taking on Schopenhauer and Nietzsche in the future ;-). When your attention span has sharpened/ when regular comics start to feel too short for you, move on to graphic novels, and then get your first book. If comic books and graphic novels are not your cup of tea, start collecting and reading magazines that have content you are interested in. Read them until reading becomes part of your lifestyle. The only reason I am not suggesting that you start off with a book is because I want to ease your mind into the whole skill of reading. Once your mind is able to associate reading with being an enjoyable act, it will be much easier to make it a lifelong habit. 2. Be CONSISTENT. Once you start reading, do not stop. The best way to not stop, is to ensure that you are reading books that you like. Being picky about the content you feed your mind on the initial stages of your reading journey will reduce the likelihood of you burning out and quitting. 3. Read The process of reading becomes a self-sustaining reaction after some time. You\u2019ll know that you\u2019re on the right path when you can\u2019t imagine your life without books. ",

Here's my suggestion: Go to your city public library or local bookstore, and do a gallery walk through the gondola aisles. Just pick up any book title that interests or intrigues you or just strikes your fancy.  In the bookstore, just take a shopping basket from the store along with you. You may even want to talk with other book lovers in the store just to get a rough sense of their favourite books. As soon as you feel that you have enough of your selections, go and sit at one quiet corner to browse the titles: front cover, back cover, inside flaps, preface or foreword, tapestry of contents, and even the index, bibliography and index at the back of the book. Take your time. Feel free to flip the pages so as to skim and scan some passages [based on your earlier exploratory search] that catch your immediate attention. Narrow down you final selection.  Buy them, and go home to read. My rationale behind this exercise: you should read what interests you or catches your attention! Reading is the best personal investment you can make in your life-long and life-wide self-education. ",

So start by reading some good quality Literary Fictional novels that have been written in modern English, easy to understand and maintains a fast pace. Then try and follow these recommendations: Try reading a few pages every single day.Try reading novels of different genres. You will figure out what you love reading, and what does not suit your palate.Try getting a specific time of day wherein you could read quietly. A rush-hour traffic in a London tube could work for some; for me it does not. I need a quiet place to read fast.Try not getting bogged down into details till you become a mature reader.And most importantly\u2014 do it for the right reasons. If you do not love it yourself; it is a pointless act. I know too many individuals who made New Year resolutions of becoming a terrific reader of books by end of the year to impress a girl or boy; gave up by mid-January.To begin with; you ought to read novels that are easy to read, comprehend and analyze. Gradually move from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and eventually perusing more complex longer pieces of Literature. Stage 3 are complex works of writing; and Stage 4 is the pinnacle of world Literature; requiring a focused and polished mind to analyze and comprehend the world of Classical Literature.

            "answer_text": "Hi, A good book can be highly satisfying, it can teach us various things beyond our daily horizons. If reading is a habit you\u2019d like to get into, there are no of ways to cultivate it. Firstly remember reading a book is highly enjoyable, if you have a good book. If you have a lousy book and you are forcing yourself through it so consider changing the book, because reading should be enjoyable and not a duty. Other than that, try these habits to cultivate reading habits Set times: You should have a set times for reading everyday. At starting level you can start with reading 10\u201315 minutes everyday. This is the time you have to read no matter what.Always carry a book: Wherever you go take your book with you. Like wherever i go, the book stays with me. if there is a free time or i have to wait for someone i spend my time reading a book.Make a list: Keep a list of all the great books you want to read. You can keep this in your notes or pocket diary. Keep a running list and keep crossing out the ones you have read. By this method there will always be a curiosity in yourself to complete your list as early as possible.Find a quiet place: Find a place where you can sit quietly and concentrate on your book.Keep a log: Similar to reading list, keep a log with not just only name of the book but also the start date and finish date of your book. Even better keep a note of your views about the book. It is extremely satisfying to go back to the log after a couple of months to see what all books you have read this entire period.Follow all these steps and start seeing the change in you towards your love for books. Good Luck with reading books. Thanks ",

Trust me on it.If it is a fiction one, you sort of make a connection with every fictional character you read about. And there comes a point in your life when the key things you learned in a fictional book/the character\u2019s life, actually help you in tackling some issues in your life. Now that I was typing this, I realized it could be applied for non-fiction books as well.There might be more things which can be the reason we find books appealing, but these are the ones I could think of.

            "answer_text": "I read a lot of my books in my high school. As I grew up, I gave up that habit making excuses such as not having enough time, too much coursework or saying that I am exhausted and want a break. I realised I now saw reading as another task instead of an activity that I enjoyed. My recommendations: Identify what interests in your life? Romance? Fashion? Sports? Adventure? Fantasy? More professional ventures like Marketing, Consulting, Technology? Believe me, anything that you like would have a book on it. That is how you start or get back to it.Do not go after the famous books that everyone is reading. Go online and read descriptions of books in the field that you are interested in. From there on, go with your gut. It is like being in a restaurant. You choose to eat what you want and not what others are eating. Of course, take their opinions on recommended dish but don\u2019t just go along with it if it doesn\u2019t speak to you.Give the book a read for 10\u201315 mins before sleeping each day. It could be a part of your sleeping routine or maybe travel routine (read on a subway, metro, in the car). Make a conscious effort to spend some time with it everyday.Switch books if you don\u2019t like the one you are reading. Just do not give up. Most people give up after they have one bad experience but that is never good way to go. Like with anything, you have to be consistent with it.Tip 1: Don\u2019t pressurise yourself into getting into reading immediately. It will not happen. Take your time with a book but to keep yourself accountable, have a deadline.Tip 2: Have a reading buddy to discuss the contents maybe? Or join a book club.Hope this was helpful. Have a good reading experience! ",

Who is interested in knowing more and more. The one who keeps oneself busy. I believe Curiosity is the value you need to embrace to motivate yourself. That\u2019s the hidden key. Start it slow. Take your time. You\u2019re not in a competition to read 10 books a month. How can call the things that you have learnt as knowledge when you don\u2019t remember to use when you need the most. So, Start reading newspaper, magazines, columns, sports, digest, comics, illustrated cartoons etc. Find your interest. It takes time and proceed further to books. Read books that has less no of pages to start with. Read 4 pages everyday. Even the world is gonna die, make sure you die after reading those 4 pages. When you find yourself in that process perhaps in other 2 or 3 weeks. You don\u2019t need quora or google or someone like me telling you what to do. The books you\u2019re reading would have done the damage. You know what to do? That\u2019s the power of reading. It makes you wise. Happy Reading! P.S The answer applies to all the other questions you have asked me. So, I am not answering the rest of the questions. Feel free to ask anytime or visit my other answers to get a collection of books to start reading. All the Best. ",

He is friends with Brian Tracy so most likely he has mastered Speed Reading, Accelerated Learning Techniques and maybe other advanced methods of retaining information.

Whenever I have a period of time where I\u2019m not reading, I find that it only takes one really good fiction book to get me hooked again. Why fiction? Well, I find that fiction books have a way of getting me drawn to the plot to the point where I am obsessed with finding out where the story goes. Nonfiction books (except for maybe biographies and memoirs) just don\u2019t have that addictive plot that makes people remember why they love reading so much. This same concept can be applied to you. If you haven\u2019t read in a while, find a really good book and just start reading it. Chances are you will get hooked onto the book and then kickstart your reading habit back up again. Here are some of my book recommendations that will (hopefully) get you hooked onto reading again: To Kill a MockingbirdThe Book Thief (my FAVORITE book of all time, I highly recommend it)1984WonderThe GiverThese are just a few suggestions, but you should go out and find a book that you know will get you hooked.

Be a reader by setting a time each night that you turn off the television and computer and pick up a good book. Talk about your books regularly with family book sharing; a time when children and adults can share their exciting new books. 2. Dig up an InterestFind fiction and non fiction books that revolve around a special interest or activity you enjoys. Finding a fiction series that piques your interest or imagination is a great way to keep urself excited about reading. 3. Find the Right SeedsTake trips to the book store or local library and explore. Librarians are great resources, ask for their book recommendations! Ask them for recommendations about what reading level or type of book you can handle independently. You want leisure reading to be pleasurable; not a task you will struggle with. 4. Nurture the Reading SproutRemember that reading is important at any age. This can be a special bonding time before bed time that you can enjoy reading  5. Watch your Seedling GrowSet reading goals for your household. Track how many books you read as a family or how many minutes a day you read. Set up a chart and watch your reading motivation grow and grow!6. Admire Your Bouquet take a minute and celebrate the joy of a good book and the pleasure of growing yourself a reader. Reading is a joy, an escape, an adventure; revel in the beauty of your bouquet! Remember seeds take time and nurturing to grow into beautiful flowers.

            "answer_text": "To make reading a habit you need to make sure that you keep your efforts consistent. Starting and then stopping mid-way will be of no help to you. I would suggest you to start small. You can take up reading the newspaper daily. And I mean a physical newspaper, not a e-paper, reading online will only lead to distractions. Being consistent is important, keep on reading daily to make it a habit. Meanwhile, take up a book, preferably something which is easy to understand and short (like Animal Farm by George Orwell) or even something like a comic book (if you find it really difficult to read books). Make it a task to read at least 20\u201325 pages everyday. As you keep on reading, you will develop a taste for, and soon number of pages wouldn't matter to you. Again, being consistent is the key. Don't limit yourself to one genre, or one type of reading material. You are trying to develop a reading habit to be more well read and informed about the world and various aspects, aren't you? That's why, diversifying your reading material is important. Sooner or later, you will get a taste for reading yourself. Choose what you read wisely, and you would be up and reading regularly in no time. Hope that helps. Thank you for reading. ",

Reading books is something which can create wonders for you and can transform you totally.  First of all, you need to know what genre/category you prefer or more precisely what kind of books you want to read and if you have no clue about which genre to go for, than start with some self help book. If you start reading a genre that you don\u2019t like, you might start hating books because you will get bored by reading it and this experience will make it difficult for you to ever get back to books again. After you have chosen your genre/category,try to start reading books written by authors of your country and try to choose some recent books. It will get you started and will be very beneficial for you in the beginning , because if you start reading foreign author\u2019s books, it can be difficult sometimes to cope with the language style that has been used and the way it has been presented. Some Indian authors that I can suggest you are Durjoy Datta, Chetan Bhagat, Ravindra Singh, Amish Tripathy, Robin Sharma, Arundhati Roy, etc. I sill remember the first book that I chose to read, \u201cTHE NOTEBOOK\u201d by Nicholas Spark. After reading mere ten pages I felt literally terrible, I wasn\u2019t able to understand what\u2019s really happening in the story, the style of writing was so hard for me understand. So it is a good thing that you start out by reading some short books that take less time and where the required English proficiency is low as compared to other. Reading is an easy task but to fully grasp the meaning of the literature and get the most out of it, is something which needs practice and time. It may not work in the case of fictional novels but if you are reading non-fiction books, you need to have good reading habits, good vocabulary, English practice and some previous experience of reading books. As you develop your interest with time, then move on the reading books which are master pieces of literature, books that challenges your thinking. Try to change genres of books that you read after sometime, it will improve your insights, equip you with some new thinking and provide you better perspective of the world. Keep Reading and Keep Learning. Here is my link for \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to read a book\u201d: Sandeep Mehta's answer to How do I read a book?

Now imagine that's the only way you can save your best friend/loved one from drowning, or rather being eaten. Would you jump now? What changed? Your \u2018why\u2019! So to develop a true interest in reading, you might want to take some time to think, what's the reason behind this urge? Do you want to expand your knowledge of a particular topic? Are you just a life long learner and a curious person? Do you want to detach from reality for a little while and take a break? Do you enjoy being in a fictional world every once in a while?

Imagining the situation and characters can actually make you want to read the further plot. Don't be in a hurry to finish the book already, understand every line. Once you've gained some interest in reading you'd want more from the same author. You'll also reach out for different authors. Eventually you'd want more books.

If it is because you would like to like to read because you think that reading novels seems to be a great leisure, here is what you can do. Ask people that know you what they suggest, look around on Amazon.com, Online Bookstore: Books, NOOK ebooks, Music, Movies & Toys , Goodreads.com. Pick 3 to 5 books. Read their summary, a few pages if you can. If you like the style the subject. Try to read one. IF and only IF you like it, keep on going. Otherwise, stop and try again later in a few months or even more. Finally, if after having tried and tested your interest in reading, you find that it doesn\u2019t work for you, think. Are you a people person? If you are who would suggest that you should drop all that time you give to others to isolate yourself to read? Being a social success is as much valuable if not more valuable than being a skilled reader. If that answer frustrate you a little because, even though you are more comfortable with people than books, then ask. Ask some of them to talk about their readings. Now that you might have decided that you will never be a great reader you can go a long way in asking book lovers what they read, what is the story, plot, intrigue, etc. Enjoy a similar pleasure but through them.

That\u2019d be a good beginning. Make an account on Goodreads. Rate the book and write a short review of how you felt about it. Read other reviews to understand the different perspectives that people present. Make it an immersive experience. Then pick up another book and repeat the process. Gradually, transition into other genres. Start maintaining a library. They look wonderful on the shelf. As you start enjoying the pursuit, you\u2019ll start wanting to expand your collection.

If you have any interest in which you indulge with passion, involvement, experience growth and connection with others/ the world, do continue that. If there is no such interest, try exploring what you enjoy. Why the need to pressure yourself 'to develop interest' in reading books? The question reflects that you have tried reading, and not really found it interesting. So you may want to think about what need you are trying to fulfill. Is it the need to talk about books with your peers to seem smart? Is it to increase your vocabulary because you're appearing for a CAT-type exam? Is it to learn more about the world? There are a number of ways of fulfilling each of these needs. Find what comes naturally to you, and which you enjoy.  The single most fruitful outcome of reading may well be a deeper understanding of the world around us. Who says you learn more from a book than from going through a heart-break, or playing an unforgiving team sport, or trying to play the first tune right on a musical instrument? I know people who are not well read and are still wise. There are people who do not read newspapers, and are still in touch with reality. Reading books is over-rated. There, I actually said it. ",

After that point, you can start with reading along with audiobooks. It's important to write as much as you read.  This will help reinforce the words and teach you how to use them in context, which will help your reading as well. If you are an adult and have had difficulty learning, then I would suggest you get tested for learning disabilities as well which could easily prevent you from making progress.  There are many strategies for dealing with these disabilities, but first you have to know if you have any and if so, which ones. The best way to learn how to read *better* is to read and then write about what you read. ",

Did you know that you will get interested in it when you started? Maybe yes , maybe no but you went on with it. Do the same with reading. Go on and read, period. Talk to some people who read a lot of books and know you well. They might know what genre you will like. Or try some well reviewed books, or just start reading and experiment on your own but without reading , I am afraid it ain't gonna happen. The best way to develop interest in any activity is to do it. Do it everyday, every week and once you have devoted enough time you will know what clicks for you. It's a very conscious effort but always rewarding. The secret is to just go ahead and do it. ",

If the page is interesting, the book may be as well. And I have been tricked by so many covers! Yes I know about the admonishment to not judge books by them, but I\u2019m quite the cover reader. And sometimes, the cover delivers on the promise. Another way to stimulate your appetite for reading books is to read reviews of them.

Also, don't feel like you have to read the book all in one go. If your not in the mood to read, then don't. Prehaps swap Tv for a good book instead once in a while.

            "answer_text": "Find a time to read where there is a limit to how long you can read. This will encourage you to start because you know that you won\u2019t be forcing yourself for too long. And chances are, by the time you have to stop, you will want to read on and will be looking forward to your next reading session. An example of a situation where you can read but there\u2019s a time limit is during a commute to work in the morning and again in the evening. I studied English Lit in University and was forced to read about 6 book per class/ 5 classes a semester. This went on for 4 years! So I went from someone who loves leisure reading to someone who associated reading with not sleeping, being forced to analyze something that I understood from the first time I read it, and exams. So as you can imagine, it took me a couple of years to get back into reading for the pleasure of it. And when I finally decided I was going to start again, I found that I still couldn\u2019t just sit on my bed and read. So the next day, I took the book with me to work and read on the 35 minute train ride to work. And of course, two pages in I was like: Oh My God!!! How haven\u2019t I done this in so long?!? So far it\u2019s been a year and a half of me regularly reading again but I still pretty much only read while I\u2019m on public transportation commutes. I still find it hard to read when I\u2019m free at home because I\u2019d usually rather shut off my million and one thoughts and reminders with some mind numbing Netflix show\u2026 But I\u2019m a fast reader so I still finish about 2 novels a month just reading during my commutes and I continue to be a huge fan of reading!

That is, you will have to make a few efforts and read some novels/books/comics before finding what genre you are really into. The next step is to keep a dictionary beside you every time you go to read. So whenever you come across an unfamiliar word, you are then and there accustomed with its meaning.This will help you improve your vocabulary and your fluency ,which ultimately boosts up your interest. The last step includes sparing some free time and picking up books from other genres so that you are able to make out the difference in writing styles all genres.

The insane popularity that the series is enjoying right now means that there are a huge number of fans of the TV show who havent read the books, but enjoy the series nonetheless, which of course is a testament to the marvellous adaptation. But, it also tells you that people who have already read the books enjoyed them as much, if not more, and they probably spent more time enjoying because it takes longer to read than to just watch something. And it also shows that a good story is what matters, the medium it is served in does not.Learn to enjoy the medium of books, and you will have an abundance of great material at your disposal.  This should serve as motivation, because blessed is the person who can find comfort and satisfaction between the pages of a book. ",

Start with Books which are easy to Comprehend.  Our Brain is a muscle. If it has not been regularly reading in past few months that means it was not getting used. Then if you suddenly start with a book which is difficult to comprehend then your brain gets tired quickly. Therefore it tries to find out many excuses for not reading that book. This is the reason why people start reading a book but do not read more than one chapter. Therefore, initially start with a book which is easy to understand.

Information is cool, but stuffing it is even cooler! You can develop your interest by following ways! 1 . Always allot 1 hour to read everyday. Make sure you read 10 pages daily. 2 . Find genres which excites you. 3 . If you stumble to a tough word while reading, just search it and pen it down, don't ignore the word, it will help in creating your word bank bigger or you will engage yourself more in reading. 4 . Take time, and enjoy reading.  ",

More often than not I did not like sharing him with another writer. Selfish YES but reading is for my entertainment and pleasure not the author or publisher or another person. If by the first few chapters I am embarrassed or queasy I quit reading that book and author. Does that limit my reading? No. I have a tablet full of authors I will not be able to finish reading for 50 years. Just read what you like and discard all others. I read 4 to 7 books a week. No ads or opinions .

I started with Enid Blyton, but if you are past a certain age I won't recommend that, so you should probably start with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Now as you find it difficult to pay attention to it for long spans of time, in the beginning you'll have to just go with it. You'll feel like getting up after some time, so get up. But don't give up on the book. Come back after some time and continue. If you've chosen a good enough book, eventually you'll get engrossed enough to see it through to the end. If it is the first in a series, and I think you should pick the first of a series, you'll have gotten a fulfilling experience but you still will want to know more and will read the rest of the series. And as later books in the Harry Potter series are longer, you'll get used to reading longer books too. By the time you've finished the whole series, you'll be a novel reader. Also, Harry Potter rules. ",

She said \u201cRead anything you want if you enjoy it\u201d. That was very wise. If you want to read more, have books in your house. I have worked in a used bookstore for 10 years so I can get books half price. I visit a used Bookstore called Book Monster and check their app for new books. 75 % of their books are used. So I can buy used books for .99 cents and up. I usually read fiction one book at a time. Tips for you? If you like a genre, try to read different authors in the genre. I like reading books 200 pgs or less because I can read them faster. I keep a couple stacks of books by my bed. They are mysteries poems sci-fi and manga. I used to read 1 manga each night. I always carry my book with me in the day. If I lose it I will buy another one. I think create a system for yourself. I only read what I like and what is beautifully written. I savor some passages. Make the books your own and have them within reach. I must warn you I have bags and stacks of books everywhere. Get a really tall bookcase or 2! I hope that helped you. Happy Reading! Remember that poster in school: Reading is FUNdamental! Have your snacks by your side too!! ",

The strongest point I make to teachers, parents and students is to find a book that INTERESTS YOU. Don\u2019t worry if someone else doesn\u2019t like it. All that matters is that YOU like it. Find something that allows you to escape the normal routine and takes you into a different world. My son, who had difficulty reading, hated to read until he discovered Stephen King. I personally do not like horror, but he loved it and it got him reading. Millions of kids (and adults) started to love reading when the Harry Potter books came out, and they just couldn\u2019t put them down. So, find something that interests you so much that you just can\u2019t put it down. My favorite authors are Dean Koontz (Odd Thomas), Jodi Picoult (19 Minutes), Cormac McCarthy (The Road), Gregory Maguire (Wicked). Hope this helps. ",

This will make you reach for a book. \u2022Make it social. See if you can beat your friends or discuss it with them. \u2022Okay, you have to trust me on this, but read AT LEAST until the fifth chapter of the book. Mmost AMAZING books don't get interesting until then. *Dictionary because you'll just like the flipping of the page and get used to it. Thanks for reading!

Books are exactly the same way, where light material is effortless and difficult material challenges you. The same for every type of media. Becoming a good reader is all about building habits. Don't feel discouraged if you want to put a book down after only a few minutes. Pick it up the next day and the next. Your brain will soon be wired. I'd recommend starting off with something that's truly effortless: a YA book or something you've already read. Then work your way to finding that one that stays with you. ",

Of course, this only works with books that you don't have to struggle to read.Stop reading a book if you lose interest in it - especially at first, when you don'y know yet which genres interest you.",

Try to pick a topic of interest (for example World War I; then google books on the subject)  2. Instead of reading generally, try reading books that carry a certain argumentation.  In the above example, a war account of a participant may pique your interest. 3. Try to read articles, preferably long form.  It is essentially reversing the process that used to happen in the pre-social media era. We would read books and then read articles and with time and social media, our attention span has become infinitely shorter. Try to reverse the process. It's a difficult thing to so but the efforts are extremely rewarding. ",

It is very easy to start and finish these stories before going to sleep at night, or very short stories can be read when nature calls. Anthologies can be very helpful in this respect introducing you to authors you may enjoy more than others. Then Collections or Best Of by those authors can encourage further reading and allow you to build up to their longer works. Understand that many films and television series have been adapted from novels or even short stories. Try researching who wrote the story for movies or shows you enjoy and try reading the original stories. Don\u2019t limit yourself to modern works only. There is a whole history of writing and even though Audible will tell you different, audiobooks are not reading, but they can stimulate your interest. ",

            "answer_text": "An interesting question. It can otherwise be put as Why do some of them find reading pleasurable and fruitful. How can i make it so for my self? Purpose! What is your purpose of reading a book? If you feel that reading a book is like staring at a wall. Trust me you wont last an hour. The purpose of reading a book coupled with the interest to learn new things. I would replace the word interest with the \u201cEXCITEMENT\u201d. \u201cNothing is more creative... nor destructive... than a brilliant mind with a purpose.\u201d \u2015 Dan Brown, Inferno I read non fiction books in-order to learn and educate myself but i found it really really hard to finish the book - Common Sense on Mutual Funds by John C Bogle. It was as dry as a desert. He is a number devil. A very good one at it. Purpose drove me to complete the book, I wanted to invest my savings and wanted a reliable source of information. You can ask any one about investing and everyone has an opinion! Opinions are free! and really useless. Unless we want have the drive to succeed in life, It is hard to pick a non fiction book and keep reading it one after the other continuously till you master that field. There are people who have never touched a book and became of the richest man alive for example - Dan Pe\u00f1a. The 50 billion Dollar man. He lives in a God Damn Castle!  He bought the castle, He did not inherit it. Now that\u2019s a totally different league all together. Find your purpose of reading a book. Is it leisure? Is it wanting to learn some thing new due to necessity? Necessity is an emotion. A very good built in motivator. Use it. Let it guide you in the right path to success. I leave you with a question. What is the one thing that drives you to read a book instead of watching that movie over a popcorn? ",

            "answer_text": "I think it all depends on which book you are reading and in which genre you are interested . For example I have a friend who has been trying to read 1984 by George Orwell for past 1 month and in the same time she has finished reading Jane Austen and The Notebook. This might be because she likes reading romantic novels more. And I believe one can never complete a book which one finds boring. So, you need to discover what kind of books you prefer. If you have just began reading then here\u2019s a list of book which I loved personally from different genres that you may give a try: The NotebookThe subtle art of not giving a f*ckAnimal FarmLittle womenA thousand splendid suns( must give a try)ItThe room on the roofRebeccaLet it snowThe giftour impossible love (if you are looking for a good book by an indian author)TwoMurder on the orient express( must give a try)To kill a mocking birdAlso, I cannot read only one novel at a time.Frankly speaking, I get bored so I read two or three novels simultaneously so you can try this trick as well to keep yourself interested into reading. Once you start a book try to read in larger portions;sometimes when you begin a book and close it after reading only two to three pages you lose interest for no reason.Also, try to read when you are relaxed without the tension of so many things you should be doing but you are reading ,like a night before an important exam, in this situation you lack concentration and you are simply reading the words written in the book, this may make you lose interest as well.

Find the best recommended book in that genre or closely related to the genre. Join a book club or find a reading buddy. If not a friend, then join a site like Goodreads. That keeps one motivated to read forward, so you can have those crazy, brain storming discussions with others about what you read and how you think the story will unfold as your proceed. This is important because everytime one reads a book for the first time or nth time, it always means a little different. Discussing brings out different prospects in the book. And builds interest. Challenge yourself. Set a reading challenge, STAY AWAY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. Force yourself out of it. Can be done easily once you develop interest. when you read, imagine that you are part of the world inside the book. Feel connected. These are a few things, that can get you started. Happy reading!

Graphic novels have a little bit of both; kind of like picture books for young adults and kids at heart.  Graphic novels have a variety of storyline a, including renditions of popular movies. Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series has a bunch of graphic novels. A good graphic novel series I would recommend is the Elf Quest series. I'll also say that graphic novels are slightly different from comic books in such they provide more narrative than comic books, which is why, for those loving movies who want to get interested in books, I suggested them over comic books.

Honestly, I could care less about the number of books you read or whatever material it covers. If something does not interest me, then why should I waste my time with it? If you seek the motivation to read something you don't like, then here is my suggestion for you: read the summaries of each chapter beforehand; you will gain a better understanding without the burden of confusion. Reading the summary before and after also helps to consolidate your memory of what happens. If you want to read more as a pastime, then find a topic that you like. Do not force yourself to like something that has no bearing. If you do not know what you like, then try to explore. Learn something new and read more about it. ",

In addition, while friends and loved ones may not be as knowledgable like people who devote their lives to good reading, we benefit a lot from sharing with them. It does a social bond a lot of good to have shared experiences. I suppose you could even call it shared effort, and as they say, a burden shared is a burden lessened. Or\u2026 lessoned. The compare/contrast/discussion/debate/argument stuff that comes after can be a real pleasure to look forward to, too. If you truly like learning and growing. Often the stuff we aren\u2019t interested in is actually done well, and that sometimes means\u2026 its an area we have tons to learn about. The stuff we\u2019re easily drawn to? It can keep us in our bubble, or our echo chamber. Growth keeps us humble too. Reminds us we\u2019re less powerful than we think. And always remember that power corrupts! :) ",

There are multiple ways we can start again reading again,but unlike any process you have to dedicate yourself to this as well. 1.Set Time Schedules:Decide a particular time for yourself where you can read,start basic with 15\u201320 mins on daily basis.Make sure you follow it without any fail.Try reading it at night before sleeping. 2.Carry Book Always: I always do this and trust me it works. I understand we dont get time to read books when in office or we go out to hang out with friends.Think about those times when we are travelling in metro or waiting somewhere we can use books as savior. 3.Avoid TV/Internet: I know it can be difficult for many people including me as well but we need to do it.But each and every minute saved from TV/Internet can be used to for reading. 4.Make a list: Just the way we make TO-DO list this is the same way as this list.Make a list of books you want to read .When you started a book or when you finish it.It will give you an idea that how much time you investing. 5.Read to kids: This habit i want every parent to follow that they should read to their kids so that they can pick this habit.Make it a ritual for them in this way you also get through the way. Reading is a gradual process that takes time ,make sure you read fun and pleasurable books. \u201cTo acquire the habit of reading is to construct for yourself a refuge from almost all the miseries of life.\u201d \u2014 W.

You could also read the book version of any movie or tv show that\u2019s based on a book that you liked in the past. Do you have a favorite movie or tv genre? Horror? Drama? Love Downton Abbey? There\u2019s probably a book equivalent, if not a book the tv show or movie was based on. Just pop onto amazon and start searching for a book. Sure, you could go to your local book store and support them, maybe shop around for a while, ask them for some recommendations and they might have something that interests you. ",

Ian Fleming\u2019s James Bond books are very well written (& will surely appeal to most boys). Mark Twain\u2019s Tom Sawyer is action, action, action. Louisa May Alcott\u2019s Little Women will probably appeal to a lot of girls (& with luck, Jane Austen when the girl becomes a woman). I enjoyed Agatha Christie as a teen (but stick to Miss Marples and Poirot: avoid Tuppence and Tommy like the plague). Be wary of those touted as the \u201cbest ever\u201d\u2026they tend to be promoted by people who don\u2019t like novels at all, and are supposed to gbe good because they\u2019re more like \u201chistory\u201d.

Is it the act of reading itself that you don't have passion for? Have you tried listening to audio books? I have found that listening to an audio book while doing repetitive, boring, or tasks that don't require much thought is a great way to get through books that I would never in a million years have time to actually \"read\".Do you have trouble reading? So people just haven't found their niche, and when they do, they become voracious readers. But, many people don't like to read because they have difficulty reading. They have a learning disability that makes reading slow and they can't retain what they read. There are ways to compensate though, and professionals who can help improve reading skills.",

But if I get into the book even 20 or 30 pages and it's boring I put it down it's a waste of my time. As time is going on all these years my tastes have changed, I usually just read out of my Kindle and there's a lot of fabulous independent authors that you can meet and just get to know their work and after a while I got excited about what I was going to read that night. If the cover looks exciting give it a try. Or if there is a library you can go to, that might be better that way you aren't giving up any money on a book you might hate. ",

Once you start a book, read few pages (10\u201330 pages), if it doesn't interest you to continue reading it, go ahead and give it another shot with a different book, maybe of different category. Once you find the category/book that you like, IT will motivate you to read more. You can also try make it a habit to read every day, few pages at some specific time, I do that myself. I read few pages in the early morning right from my bed just after I open my eyes, and in the evening also from my bed before closing my eyes :p It worked for me, today I started a new habit of taking the book I\u2019m reading with me wherever I go, and whenever I have some free time, instead of hitting the social media, I open my book and read few pages/paragraphs. I hope it\u2019ll work! ",

A good narrator makes the story alive - assuming you prefer fiction. But audiobooks are a good alternative for non-fiction as well. Try going over the table of contents first. Some books don't need to be read in a specific sequence, and you can skip the chapters that seem less appealing. As you discover what topics or genre pique your interest, you will begin to devour books. And remember: one of the greatest gifts for readers is that they are rarely afraid of loneliness, as there\u2019s always a good book nearby. Best of luck! ",

Newspapers articles are very small, you won't loose interest and moreover you would get to know the NEWS of course. 2) Pick up short stories or story books of your interestRead small story books for children and short stories of your interest to get more involved with reading. Word of caution, don't go for the Novels, as novels are lengthy and it takes more involvement on the readers part.  3) Make it a HabitOnce you have started reading, make it a habit, make a point to read at least something everyday. And your HABIT in long run will turn into your PASSION. So, Good Luck. Happy Reading. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Ask yourself first why do you want to read ? Have you come to this thought on your own or were influenced by someone ? If you have been influenced by someone I would just add a caution here , never start reading with a book that has been recommended by someone else especially by someone who is a frequent reader. While it might be really good , you might loose interest and never pick up again. So on this context I won\u2019t be recommending you a book at least not now. First , finalise what genre you love the most. This can be easily inferred with the type of movies that you like . Once that is finalised, browse the books under the same category and try with a small one. If you are loosing interest after a couple of pages , don\u2019t just drop it instantaneously . Give it a couple of more shots . Often people loose interest in books because they don\u2019t have patience for that. Developing that is a gradual process so as suggested by some previous answers start will blogs and articles . Just remember one thing , everyone would love to read . What would differ is their interest. Find your interest and you will find the book to keep you going. ",

            "answer_text": "I started reading books / novels when I was 12 or 11. Arousing your interest in books depends on how you look and imagine about the things written in the books. When I read a novel, pictures start building up eventually in my mind and my interest arises. Firstly, stop thinking and just buy some books that you think can interest you. Like for me, they are always fantasy , horror or romance novels. Start with reading books with easy language so you don\u2019t get bored on your very first attempt. Try to divert your mind from other things and concentrate on whatever you\u2019re reading and trust me, you\u2019ll soon find yourself lost into the story, the plot and characters of the book . Read the book as if a movie is going on. This is my way of reading, I connect myself with the characters, incidents and all that is happening inside the book. I get so much interested in the book that I read it till the end in one go. Well you can consider my opinion but I don\u2019t quite have much experience. I\u2019m just 16, you see but to a reader, age doesn\u2019t matter. One more thing, if you\u2019re not interested in buying books and want books with easy language written by normal people and not \u2018authors\u2019 , you can use this site : Wattpad - Where stories live So Happy Reading!

Think of all those personalities who succeeded by reading books ( Steve jobs , Bill gates , Mahatma Gandhi , swami vivekananda , ALbert Einstein, Our present P.M shri narendra Modi and many more great personalities were and are bookholic ) If you want to read to increase your knowledge in any field then 1st search on Google about the best books in that field . And if you want to read as a leisure activity then analyse and find your interest , it may be science and non- fiction , fantasy , spirituality , tragedy etc . start with that which attracts you a lot and with simple one if I have just started reading as a hobby .

I am assuming you do want to read books but don't get inspired to do so. Probably you read for a day or two but unable to make it a habit. Becoming a member of book clubs/reading clubs might help. You would meet like minded people and you would be surprised to find people who were in your shoes some time in their lives. Go to a library and give yourself a chance to meet like minded people. Ask them for book suggestions in your area of interest. Meet them over and over again and discuss the books you read. ",

For readers they are attracted to books like bees are attracted to flowers. But, this doesn't mean that I am telling you, you cannot read books. I just mean to say you cannot force yourself to read. No matter how interesting the book maybe or no matter if the book is of your subject of interest, it is just not going to work. I'm sorry, this answer is not going to help you a tiny bit but I am just sharing my own experience. I have tried to develop a habit of reading so many times. Occasionally, I would read through a whole book but it is rare and most of the times I get bored at the first few pages.  I do have mini library built for myself and all of it was me trying to make myself to read. Alas, it never happened and all the books are now doing is making my closet look beautiful.  Sorry!!! ",

If you are bored by reading, Develop some patience to read the book. Because i have seen some people as not patient enough to complete the book. 4) Try reading the books while listening to music. As far i know, You will not get bored of silence and music will increase your concentration power. 5) Most of all, select a book or environment that suits you more. Never select a book or an environment for the sake of others. Thank you. ",

Try and figure out what genre interests you.. Firstly, do you prefer fiction or non-fiction? Do you have a vivid imagination?You won't believe the ocean of reading material you get to choose from in Fiction! If you don't want to start with entire novels there are authors like Jeffery Archer who have written collections of short stories too.. maybe try that n see what kind of story piques your interest ;) Or do you like something more relatable to what happens in real life? Non fiction books would probably keep you more interested then. Picking out a book from a genre that keeps you hooked is important to develop your reading habits.. Since you are just starting out, check if a book has good reviews before you start .. Goodreads is an excellent source to get reviews on books you may want to read. A book that has you turning pages right to the end will make your day! ;) hope that helped.. and hope you start reading soon! ",

Then move on to some of the books written by famous authors  and what you have to make sure in this step is that you read all the books till the very end. I would advise you try john green or Paulo cohelio or harper lee or read the harry potter  (even if you have seen the movies)  by j.k. rowling. You can go for other authors too. Now the books yiu like the most. Choose that author and read all his books.  And then do it all over again choose some authors find the writer you like and read all his/her books. Good luck ;) ",

Your knowledge database increases. You will try to make a link between these two sectors. You will try to find how to get monetary benefits from different ideas. What we can induce from history that will be useful for let us say trading? What is the science behind a particular subject ? After going through biographies of world historical persons , you realize how difficult was for them to achieve the task within specified time, with limited resources, etc. then you realize your difficulties, your insecurities are nothing in front of them. Short & simple answer , because knowledge works as compound interest.  Keep reading. . :) ",

The more you read the easier it will be to read, and the more you can get into the story and ignore the media.Find your preferred genre and practice on that.

Juglar Vein by Jug Suriya in the TOI is a good option for Political Satire. If Bolloywood interests you, there are newspapers full of the hot gossips of B- Town.And then start with small novels. Ravindra Singh's \"I Too had a Love Story\"... Chetan Bhagat's \"2 States\" are fine love stories to begin with... move to fatter novels later and always choose novels of your field of interest. Jeffrey Archer is one of my favourites. Khaled Hosseini's books make you feel that you are living the narrative... So,  ",

I'd suggest trying out the Harry Potter series. It got millions of kids reading big paperback books before the movies ever came out. If you've seen the films and enjoyed the story and characters, you will be more inclined to enjoy the activity of reading and hopefully develop it as a habit! ",

The fight scenes are epic and I remember, to this day (I was probably sixteen when I first read it and I\u2019m 32 now), the opening chapter because it was simply on another level to anything I had ever read.

Start with what you enjoy the most, maybe comedy, mystery, an auto-biography or even comics.

Once you find a book that you think you will be interested in, practice your power of will by making yourself read for, say, 10 minutes a day. Sometimes it will be hard to just sit down and do it but if it is a good book for you, then you\u2019ll won\u2019t be able to put it down. Good luck and enjoy! ",

After i chose the subject, now it is time to look for a book. Generally, i prefer a book which covers the entire subject. For example, i wanted to read about World war 2. So, i got the book by Antony Beevor \" The Second world war\". It covers the entire story from beginning to end. I won't have to read any other book. The second reason is, the book should be easy to read. Not many fancy words. I don\u2019t want to spend a big chunk time on finding the meanings. I Never read something just to pass the time. So if i don\u2019t like a book, i simply move on. Ebooks are pretty good for it, otherwise, you are stuck with a book even if you do not like it. Everyone has a different idea about choosing a book. This is mine. ",

But sometimes, I find myself in a reading slump, and am just not interested in reading books for short periods (sometimes long) of time. For me, I always read short story collections. Mainly, Stephen King. I love Stephen King, but sometimes I just can\u2019t motivate myself to read a full novel. Short stories, not only by Stephen King, help me get my reading fix when I don\u2019t have the motivation, and they help me through my reading slumps. Just remember, always pick what you like to read, because nobody wants reading to be a chore. ",

            "answer_text": "What are your interests? Try and find a book that aligns with things that you enjoy. The best way to motivate yourself is to make sure that reading is a rewarding experience for you. It may be hard to begin, but if you commit to dedicating 10\u201315 minutes each day to reading an interesting book, you may find that immersing yourself in a different world becomes appealing. The only thing is, you have to REALLY commit. No skipping a day or two because you're too busy, or too tired. Maybe you could start with a short book; when you finish it, you'll have a feeling of accomplishment (again with the rewarding feelings), and hopefully be more motivated to finish another one. On the other hand, maybe you'd prefer to start a series. In my personal experience, when I read the first book, it's very hard to stop without getting to the end of the series. You'll find that you planned to read one book, but ended up reading seven (*cough* Harry Potter *cough*). Hope this helps :) ",

Then once you get used to it, pick up the simple and golden classics like tom sawyer, oliver twist, invisible man, treasure island, robinson cruso, agatha christe, etc. Mind you these are serioys books and are a solid foundation for any reader. Once this is done, my friend you will be ready for more. ",

Was this needed? What this character is thinking? And other numerous of questions. And then search by your own all the answer. Where you will get those answer? In the same book dude. The day you will ask question, you will be curious to know your answer and you will do everything with that book for your answer. And even then you won't get anything, you have Quora for that. (Apart from this, start from short stories and novels. You will find it easy to understand is you are a beginner) P.S. - You might find my answer quite brainless.

Very little makes me unhappier than spending money on something (not just books) that I discover I don\u2019t like. Checking out a mistake from the library is free. And librarians, in this mid-sized MN city anyway, are generally well read and happy to talk about books and make suggestions. Then advance to used books; which are cheap if not free. And as you become more confident about what you like and develop favorite authors and subjects, then advance to new books. At independent book stores. Some times new and used can be found in the same store. ",

Read reviews. Read books that are very well written, but not beyond your understanding. Listen to books on tape while you\u2019re driving. Join a book club. I\u2019m sure others will give you more suggestions. Once you have read some books that have grabbed your attention and that you have enjoyed you\u2019ll start being more interested. Also, bring books with you. If you have down time (waiting rooms for the doctor or dentist, DMV, train rides, etc.), you will appreciate having something to do. Good luck! ",

We should always read the reviews written at the back of the book and it also gives the idea and the contents of the book sketchily, which also grows your interest towards reading the book. It also maybe if you can read random books to grow your interest on different subjects not fixing yourself into one topic. There maybe other ways also to grow your interest but these are the most highlighted points of the concern. ",

They are both fun to read, class-A comedy works that can be taken up, read for a short while, and works that will bring you back to them, increasing your reading time naturally. I would suggest Wodehouse to start with, because Adams kinda requires a bit more retention than PGW does. ",

It is good to ask a lot of questions and also to question things in a constructive manner. If you are absent for some reason, remember to ask your classmates what was done and discussed. Ask them to clarify what remains unclear \u2013 this helps them to learn at the same time. Attending class has its benefits. It\u2019s normal that things don't always go well during your studies. If you fail an exam, you just have to live and learn: what will I do better next time around? Avoiding difficult subjects is bad strategy. Be especially active in courses that seem difficult or unclear. Be bold and ask questions. Most likely you\u2019ll be doing a favour also to other students, as it is probable that you are not the only one who doesn't understand. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know something and ask, I remain ignorant for only a moment. If I don\u2019t ask, I will remain ignorant also in the future.\u201d Sometimes you might lose your study motivation. That\u2019s quite normal too \u2013 and then it is good to go at it one step at a time. Once those course completions start piling up, it will once again be easier to get motivated for the final push.
