            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t. You have to stumble across them. Why do you want to run this search? Is it because you\u2019re marketing services to indie authors? I think there\u2019s still a stigma attached to self-publishing left over from the bad old days when it was just vanity publishing (before eBooks). Perhaps Amazon doesn\u2019t allow such a search to protect indie authors. Or perhaps Amazon simply feels this is a way to sell more books overall. To tell if a book on Amazon is self published you need to look at a sample so you can see the copyright notice. It will most often tell who is the publisher. If you go on Smashwords on the other hand it\u2019s easy. ALL the books on Smashwords are self published. ",

But some self published authors have created publishing companies now, so you might find something else there instead of Amazon. But then sometimes you can spot them by bad book covers, bad book descriptions, and bad reviews. ",
