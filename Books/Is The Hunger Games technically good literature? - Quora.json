            "answer_text": "To measure the Hunger Games series' literary merit, we must establish some kind of criteria. I'm going to walk into a literary firestorm, full of English PhDs sending ballistic missiles at each other. I am, however, a brave woman. So, I'll take a few shots. For me, the essential elements of \"good\" literature include: Prose - the prose must be a few steps up from pedestrian. No LOLs or MYOBs in my books, por favor. Prose elevates a book from a mere rambling to an artistic work.Storylines - good literature begins with storytelling that provokes and sparks the imagination. Storylines do not necessarily need to be provocative and scandalous, but they must resonate.Character Development - no literary work is complete without well-crafted character development. As a reader, the character encompasses the entire book.World-Building - good literature--even non-fantastical ones--crafts a beautiful and vivid world for the reader to fall into. This is a necessary but not sufficient element of good literature.Themes - Storylines and themes aren't the same thing. Storylines pertains to plot. Themes evokes grander issuers that are not explicitly addressed in the book.Now that we've established some kind of criteria, let's stack up Hunger Games against other YA classics. (It wouldn't be fair  to compare a YA book to David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest, would it?) The barometer for good YA literature should be books such as: Harry Potter, Lords of the Rings, and Wrinkle in Time. Let's see how the Hunger Games  performs: Prose-wise, the Hunger Games is mediocre. Collins has a snappy writing style, but it's far from memorable. Kristin Cashore blows Collins out of the water in raw prose talent. Now, this isn't a deal-breaker. Many examples of good literature do not have Hemingway's lyricism or Austen's wit. Harry Potter accompanies the Hunger Games in this category, so all hope is not lost.The Hunger Games series has vibrant and compelling storylines. Tyranny, reality television, totalitarianism and revolution. Oh my! More than mere shock factor, the Hunger Games endeavors to say something about these topics. In some ways, the Hunger Games is a modern 1984-type attack on modern society. The Capitol bears an eerie resemblance to American society.On the character development front, the Hunger Games stumbles. I love Katniss; she's an unusual female heroine. She's neither a hero or an antihero. She's just a girl making the best of what she has. Still, I can't ignore the lack of Katniss' growth. She never moves beyond her hard-scrabble, revenge-laden mindset from the first book.Panem elevates the Hunger Games above many of its contemporaries. For me, the construction of Panem--brick by brick--dazzled my imagination. I couldn't stop asking questions about its political structure, control tactics and hierarchy. The idea of a nation built on the tenuous foundation of gladiator-like arena challenged my assumptions about humanity. It's a rare book that does that.The Hunger Games themes speak to the fascinating moral ambiguities of war, modern society and death. Like the world-building aspect, the series' themes make readers question the world around them. Good literature exposes truth for all to inspect and judge.So, according to my calculations, the Hunger Games series meets three out of five criteria. Is that enough? I'm not sure it is. The failures of Mockingjay, in my opinion, prevent the series from reaching the level of \"good\" literature. The last book failed to tie all of the themes, story lines and character development together.  In sum, the Hunger Games comes very close, but isn't quite good literature because of Katniss's incomplete character development and mediocre prose. ",

            "answer_text": "I can't top Cristina, Monika's or Jen's analysis.  They're all great and reflect my problems with the trilogy as it went on.   While I don't think it's technically good literature, it is a good read.  At least the the first two books anyway.  I just had too many problems with Mockingjay  I think the first book was great as stand alone work.  The characters were old enough that it worked well as both YA and adult fiction.  That's what drew me to it. But as the trilogy went on, to me, the themes got to big for the scope of the books. This was especially true of Mockingjay.   It seemed like there was just too much black and white in Ms. Collins story telling.   There was no debating or discussing the themes of the books between the characters.  There was not enough 'grey' area.  Take Gale and Katniss's views on what is acceptable to win the rebellion.When either would question the other decisions or thought process, each would get defensive or upset and just walk away in a tizzy.   There was no discussing why each felt the way they did.  We were just left to infer (is that the right word?) why each felt the way they did.   By the time we reach Mockingjay, all the characters are pretty much adults - we're not talking about thirteen year olds.  No one ever discussed what they were feeling in the last two books.  No one asked questions as to why the different characters made the choices they did.  I mean wouldn't one person ask Katniss why she killed Coin? I also though Katniss' POV, the plot contrivances, and the amount of 'reading between the lines' the reader had to do was a problem.    The character development, in my opinion, was almost non-existent.  Take Peeta for example.  He only comes to realize Katniss's flaws because he was 'hijacked'.  He should have realized Katniss wasn't perfect on his own, not by having his brain chemically altered.  And Katniss just seems to devolve completely as a character - from the strong young woman in the Hunger Games to a shell of her former self.  I get what Ms. Collins was going for but it doesn't make good reading.   So I guess what I'm trying to say is that for me, good literature has it's plot evolve naturally and it's characters grow naturally.  Things that need explained are explained )why did Prim's mom let her go with the medics?)    Characters actually talk about important things.  They share their feelings and motivations Most importantly, I don't want to feel I'm being preached to.  I don't mind a message but when things start to get heavy handed, the author loses me.  Lay out the opposing viewpoints and let me make my own conclusions about the message. The Hunger Games started out with all of these things but as the books went on, I felt all of the good things about book one were lost. ",
