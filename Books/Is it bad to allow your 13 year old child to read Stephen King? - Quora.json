            "answer_text": "That depends on you, if your child is ready for the mature content, then I would say sail that ship. Though, if they\u2019re a little late to the party of what is acceptable and what is not, then I would wait a few years. I read Christine when I was eleven, and it was the first full book I had ever read, which subsequently, made it my first Stephen King novel. Did it make me read any further, no, I didn\u2019t pick up another book until I was in the eighth grade. The reasons for me not reading were because I though it was boring, I hated using my brain. Then a couple years later, Rick Riordan got me back into reading with his Percy Jackson series, which I didn\u2019t read in order. I picked up Christine again, and fell in love with it, becuase I sort of related to Arnie. Then my next book was also from Stephen King, The Stand, I treated that like it was my own personal bible. I loved the plot, the characters, and the setting. I had to put the book down, just to think about what I was reading. There was a post on here about Stephen king not being the best writer, but he has to be one of the best story tellers. That is the full truth, Stephen King won\u2019t be hailed as this remarkable literary genius, but he will be looked as the master storyteller of all time. I since read almost all of his books, and cherish them deeply. ",

            "answer_text": "Neil Gaiman said it best: \u201cChildren tend to be really good at self-censorship. They have a pretty good sense of what they are ready for and what they are not, and they walk the line wisely. But walking the line still means you will go over it on occasion\u2026. There were things I read as a boy that troubled me, but nothing that ever made me want to stop reading. I understood that we discovered what our limits were by going beyond them, and then nervously retreating to our places of comfort once more, and growing, and changing, and becoming someone else. Becoming, eventually, adult.\u201d That said, he goes on to recount: \u201cAnd, of course, I learned the wrong lessons from this. Because I loved adult fiction as a child, when my daughter, Holly, developed a fondness for R. L. Stine\u2019s Goosebumps books at the age of eleven or twelve, I dashed down to my library and returned with a paperback copy of Stephen King\u2019s Carrie. \u201cIf you like those, you\u2019ll love this,\u201d I told her. Holly spent the rest of her teen years reading books in which cheerful young heroines traveled in covered wagons across the plains, and in which nothing conceivably nasty ever happened to anyone. And, even fifteen years later, sometimes, when Stephen King comes up in conversation, she glares at me.\u201d (from What the [Very Bad Swearword] Is a Children\u2019s Book Anyway?) ",
