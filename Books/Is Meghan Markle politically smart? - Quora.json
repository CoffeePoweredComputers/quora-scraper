            "answer_text": "Good Lord, she\u2019s hardly finished mucking up being a member of the Royal Family and already the official whisperers are out and about planting little seeds that she could have a career in politics hoping they\u2019ll germinate in some gullible quarter. Really? If M was so smart - Mexit would have been a smooth and uncontroversial affair. If she was so astute, she would have realised that maybe leaking pathetic tittle tattle to the press and causing divided opinions wasn\u2019t so clever - before doing just that. If she was so politically minded she would have taken care to lay her path carefully towards her goals and not alienate potential allies. If she fancies herself a great political punt as a candidate\u2026.who'd want to back someone who demonstrates time and time again that she has no staying power, no real commitment and no credibility? Seriously, considering this attention deficient, social climbing, career snob as a political entity can only be a last gasp from the camp of a woman who has exhausted every other avenue in her bid to be a \u2018global force.\u2019 It is, if possible, even less credible than the Archewell nonsense.

Perhaps she\u2019s gifted and painting fresco on chapel ceilings, but I haven\u2019t seen that indicated, either. I hear she is good with calligraphy and anything involving bananas. Doodling on bananas, baking things with bananas, etc. ",
