            "answer_text": "Well, you can get paid either by per hour or claim a royalty share. Royalty shares are way more profitable because you will gain money forever. Royalty share means you get a 50% commission of every audiobook purchase. Make sure to narrate for a book that is going to sell though. The speed varies depending on your skill level. A 10-hour book from my research takes about 1 or 2 weeks for flawless audio. I would suggest starting out with shorter books. You don't need to spend a lot on equipment or have any prior experience to get started (however taking classes and/or working with a vocal coach is advised if you want to improve your skills over time.) NO formal voice-over or acting training, so if you have a background in either of those areas you already have a leg up. You can probably start out with a basic computer and an inexpensive microphone that's bought on Amazon. Audiobooks are now the fastest growing form of media in the world. Last year more audiobooks were downloaded than ebooks. Authors are racing to get their books into Audible as fast as they can to take advantage of the growing market. Right now there are more than 2500 titles on ACX alone that are looking for a narrator ASAP! ",
