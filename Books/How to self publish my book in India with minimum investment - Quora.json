This will help you get done with publishing affordably without major investment. They also pay 100% commission on the sales of your book. A traditional publishing house is also an option, but in the end you would get oy 25% of commission on the sales of your book. Lastly, an online publication, where you are required to do everything I.e. proofreading, editing, cover design etc. They only serve as a market place for your book. I would suggest you to consultant a expert in the publishing domain and then make an informed choice. You can also reach out to me at Betagram Publishers a self-publishing house I'm a co-founder of.

            "answer_text": "For first time Authors publication is a big issue since no publisher wants to take the risk. Unless you are a celebrity in your field. The usual process is to pay the cost of publication along with proportionate cost of publicity. Self publication is pretty difficult as you might not know the suppliers of papers, printers etc and also do not know how to market your copies. ",
