            "answer_text": "World War II was the direct result of the consequences of Word War I. Practically every single justification and provocation for the Second World War was intricately entwined with the First. I will list the how\u2019s and whys. Germany was put in a stranglehold for War reparations form WWI which it could never repay. Hitler gave the people hope to break away from the debt bondage.The Stab-In-The-Back theory postulated that it was the Jews which betrayed Germany and lost them the war. One main reason Hitler used them as scapegoats and leveraged power to the Nazi\u2019s.Communism appeared in the First World War and was seen as a direct threat to Fascism, they were essentially mortal enemies. Hitler used the threat of Communism to leverage more power.WWI provided the roadmap for much improved warfare (known as Blitzkrieg in Germany) to prevent trench warfare. These new techniques of warfare had a devastating effect on populations and societies.After WWI the allies re-drew the boundaries of several countries, and particularly Germany, in an effort to weaken the Germans. Hitler used the German minorities in the surrounding countries as a pretext in \u201cliberating\u201d them from their oppression.Germans were a humiliated people with little hope in the future economically and socially. This was a disaster waiting to happen, it was almost a foregone conclusion that a strong-man dictator would inevitably arise and promise them renewal.There was an enormous number of former soldiers roaming around Germany after WWI, Hitler was one of them. These former soldiers were a powder-keg of energy as an under-current within the German society. They felt like their sacrifice and the death of their friends was in vain. They felt like they wanted vindication and revenge for the wrongs of the First World War.It should be of little surprise that the concepts of Fascism arose immediately after WWI. Fascism was essentially a mix of Left-Wing Socialism and Far-Right nationalism. Fascism promised people a financial social safety net and the return to the former glorious nation and people.Simply put, without the First World War and the mistakes resulting from it (primarily from the victors), the Second World War would in all practicalities be an impossibility.

            "answer_text": "In order to answer this question, we kind of have to go nation by nation: Germany: Meet Adolf Hitler, a young promising boy who was hardened in the trenches of World War I. His primary job was carrying information from trench to trench and ensuring orders were received. This was one of the hardest jobs to do, as you had to run through No Man's Land under extremely heavy fire (artillery, mortar, entrenched machine guns) and sometimes barbed wire. Anywho, after World War I, Germany was sucked dry economically, and jobs were about as hard to come by as they are now, only much, much worse. Young Adolf took a job of identifying local anti-government activists, and stumbled upon the National Worker's Party of Germany, which he infiltrated easily. However, after listening to several sermons, he began to sympathize with them; within months, he would become their propaganda secretary. Eventually, Adolf would attempt to start a coup, which was mildly successful until he tried to storm a government building, where policr forces shot and killed several of his comrades, and took him into custody. In prison, he wrote \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d and the rest leads into his government positions and takeover. Italy: Prior to WWI, Benito Mussolini was a newspaper writer, often speaking out about the policies of Italy's king at the time, instead claiming that Italy should \u201crise to the glory of the old Roman Empire.\u201d When the Great War broke out, Benito tried to flee the conscription, but eventually joined the war, becoming an excellent marksman. After the war, he came home and continued to write his propaganda. Unlike Hitler, however, Benito's coup was much more successful. And\u2026you know the rest. Great Britain: Great Britain had suffered from severe war fatigue following the First World War, with no one eager to join another one. Neville Chamberlain was one of these folks, and as Prime Minister he intended to keep it that way. Winston Churchill, however, knew what the war was fought for. Having suffered a massive failure in the Gallipoli campaign, he joined the Western Front himself, living in the trenches in an attempt to regain his dignity. Once the war was over, he knew the old Prussian Empire wasn't done yet. United States: Nothing much to say here, except two words: undisturbed isolation. The stock market crash of \u201929 and the Great Depression destroyed the US economically, and the primary focus of the nation was rebuilding its economy. The only real military building was the National Guard (because the US was still sore about Mexico because of the intercepted telegram that brought them into the war into the first place) and the US Navy, of which FDR was secretary of during World War I. Behind the scenes, our old friend George S. Patton, a genius officer which brought the US into an age of mechanization, started created new ideas for tank divisions to prepare for a new war (he'd had plenty of tests in World War I, riding tanks into battle to get a glimpse of their viewpoint of combat). France: Not much to say about France except Charles de Gaulle's unheeded warning about the Maginot Line not being big enough to hold off an impending attack. Japan: Finally, we have our Pacific rivals, the Japanese. Japan's influence in World War I was minor. The only records were primarily a few volunteer forces joining the front lines in the final push in 1917 and 1918. Japan, however, was infuriated, claiming they should have had some say in the Treaty of Versailles. However, they were outright ignored, and they planned on making a huge say in how they operated. I can't recall the name of the family they ousted from power, but that finally allowed Hirohito to steamroll through China and the split provinces. ",

By definition, a world war is a war between many big nations and their respected allies and where most of the world is involved in some way. That being said WW1 involved 32 countries and WW2 involved even more still. Secondly, both wars started by rising tensions between two nations and allies followed to help the country they supported and so on until many countries were involved. In conclusion we can say the way they connect is simply by the scale of the violence and participants and the wars origin. ",
