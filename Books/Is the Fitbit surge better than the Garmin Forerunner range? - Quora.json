            "answer_text": "You are comparing two different types of products. The forerunner series is primarily a GPS watch used for running, cycling and swimming. Whereas, Fitbit surge can be classified more as an activity tracker (although it has gps). Also, I have heard not so good reviews about its GPS accuracy in our running groups. So, if you more into activity tracking, you would prefer Fitbit Surge. But if you are into Running or other sports requiring GPS, you should go for Forerunner series. Hope this helps. ",
