            "answer_text": "Study with a Voice Over Coach One of the best ways to improve your performance as an audiobook narrator is to study with a coach (one who focuses on audiobooks would be ideal). Just search for \u201cvoice over coaches\u201d and then read up on coaches you are interested in studying with. To find a bunch at once, here\u2019s a link to a directory of voice over coaches and their specialties. Listen to Award-Winning Narrators Something else you can do is listen to top narrators to hear what makes them successful. Once you know the genre you want to read audiobooks for, find narrators in that category whose voices you appreciate as role models for your own audiobook narrator career. Become Familiar with The Audies There is an awards show for audiobook narrators as well as other distinctions that they receive, so locating narrators who have been recognized for their work is easy. The Oscars of the audiobook world are called The Audies. The awards are given out during the Audio Publishers\u2019 Association Conference (APAC) each May. The event coincides with BookExpo America. Locating Audie Winners One of the easiest ways to hear award-winning narrators is finding a list of Audie winners and then listening to their work. AudioFile Magazine is an excellent source for industry news and is helpful in recognizing these award winners. You\u2019ll be able to find samples of these narrators and their award-winning reads wherever audiobooks are sold. Much of voice work is actually listening, being observant and then finding ways to add those insights to your performance. Reading Aloud This may go without saying, but reading aloud whenever you can will help you to develop your reading skills. You may also experience a great deal of joy when reading aloud. Additionally, reading aloud provides excellent opportunities for you to practice, explore your voice and get to know what you like to read best. Making Audiobook Demos If you\u2019re wanting to make an audiobook demo, there are thousands upon thousands of books in the public domain that you can read excerpts from. If you\u2019re really ambitious, you might even consider publishing your own audiobook. Get started quickly by choosing a book in the public domain whose copyright has expired. You can also join communities as a volunteer to read audiobooks or read for the blind through organizations like AIRSLA or CNIB. ",
