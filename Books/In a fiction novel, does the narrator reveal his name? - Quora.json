            "answer_text": "In one of the best first-person narratives: Rebecca, by Daphne Du Maurier, the narrator is nameless throughout. (The Rebecca of the title is the first wife, the narrator is the second wife). She is called \u2018my love\u2019, and \u2018dear\u2019 by her husband, and known as \u2018the second Mrs de Winter\u2019 by others - but her first name and maiden name are never revealed. Usually though, the narrator\u2019s name is revealed in narrations of dialogue, eg, \u2018She said to me, \u201cJimmy, that\u2019s just not good enough,\u201d etc. If you don\u2019t reveal the name, it should be for a very good reason: in Rebecca, Du Maurier did it on purpose, because Rebecca was such a strong and powerful personality that even dead she overshadowed the narrator.
