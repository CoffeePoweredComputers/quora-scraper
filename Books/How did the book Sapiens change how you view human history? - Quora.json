            "answer_text": "The whole book is highly informative and fascinating. Every page you learn something new or are presented with a unique point of view. But the following three things really threw me off track. Whenever I think evloution the first image that comes to my mind was of the standard linear progression from a chimpanzee to Homo Sapiens. Well, that changed. From the book you learn that actually different species of Homo genus existed at the same time. I think for me that's the most important change in my thought process. Evloution wasn't linear. For as long as I remembered, I always thought Agriculture was one of the major achievements of our species collectively. It meant civilization, settling down. But this book gives you a very different take on Agriculture. I mean it's debatable and there is absolutely no way of finding out how will it be if agriculture wasn't discovered. So we are stuck with the consequences of Agriculture but it's very interesting to see the other POV. EVERYTHING we take for granted now especially the important things meaning money, God, religion, jobs, institutions everything is just made up. I mean for people who have studied anthropology, this might not seem such a shock. But for me it really was absurd when the author brings it up for the first time. But when you really think about it, everything is made up and we so strongly believe in this that we can't even imagine that it's all made up. Let's consider the money in your account. You can check your balance on your phone or from a computer. Even if you visit a bank, they will show you the balance on the system and you are expected to be reassured. Let's face it. You are reassured even if you can't touch or feel or see it. Please invest some time and read it. Even if you don't agree with everything the author says, it's still a very interesting point of view.

            "answer_text": "Sapiens is one of the best books I have read in recent times. I would recommend everyone should read it once. History as I have mostly read as a part of my study curriculum is more of a propaganda. The text books are more of opinions and not facts. The books do not give you the liberty to make your own opinions about whether a particular phenomenon in history was good for human kind or a disaster. Yuval only states facts in his book and gives us the most unbiased view. It has completely changed the way I perceived various events (like agricultural revolution, industrial revolution). If I it were to me, I would make this book a part of school curriculum. History as described in this book, also helps us unravelling some of our own behavioural patterns. Why do people cheat, why we crave for sugars and many more. ",
