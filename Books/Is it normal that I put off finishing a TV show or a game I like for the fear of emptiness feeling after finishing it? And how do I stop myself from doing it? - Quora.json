I try to buy extra so I have back up and can finish something knowing I have another waiting. As far as tv shows go, maybe find another show that interests you so you can finish one and start the new one. I\u2019d try the same thing with games. If you have a new one to look forward to, it\u2019ll be easier to finish the one you\u2019re on now. You can also go back and replay a game you like and watch reruns of the shows. Or record the shows so you can watch them again. ",
