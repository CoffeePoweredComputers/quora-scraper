            "answer_text": "No, I would say that makes you a very stereotypical slash/yaoi fan. The overwhelming majority of writers and consumers of slash fic are female, and the demographic tends to skew young, so if you\u2019re 21 or younger that\u2019s even more in keeping with it. I don\u2019t know any straight males who admit to enjoying slash/yaoi and not many gay ones, either. (In fact, one admittedly-very-opinionated gay acquaintance actively hates most of it because it rarely to never is written by anyone who actually IS gay and/or male and in his opinion almost never includes believable sex.) Personally, not my kink. (Okay, two guys AND A GIRL isn\u2019t so bad, but I can\u2019t think of many fandoms where that\u2019s popular.) Give me m/f dom/sub or dubcon any day if I want to go looking for smutfic. ",

Personally, I like all kinds of romantic fiction (hetero, gay, lesbian, and bisexual), but that\u2019s me. Possibly, you\u2019re a bit uncomfortable around women in what could be construed as romantic or semi-romantic settings because of lesbian or bi feelings under the surface. Then again, it may be something else entirely. As some of the answers indicate, you may like gay fanfiction simply because it\u2019s guys and you\u2019re a girl. You don\u2019t really say whether you\u2019re straight, lesbian, or bi. ",
