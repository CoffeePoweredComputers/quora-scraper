            "answer_text": "Apostol Volume 1 and 2 were used in my Freshman calculus sequence. I am quite mathematically innocent and had a rough time constructing rigorous proofs on my own.  This is what worked for me:  1. Read How to Prove It: A Structured Approach, 2nd Edition: Daniel J. Velleman: 9780521675994: Amazon.com: Books. For many, Apostol/Spivak are the first introduction to formal, rigorous mathematical notation and reasoning, and most beginners just don't know how to think that way. It is entirely learnable however. Velleman shows you how.  2. Carefully and slowly go through the solved examples for each chapter in Apostol. Take notes on each step (yes, each step), asking yourself: Why did he do that? What does it accomplish? If you have a different step in mind, jot it down and see if it does/doesn't work and why (Knowing why is the single most important question when learning mathematical proof-making, IMHO).  Then put the book aside and use your notes to reconstruct the proof. Compare against the book. Then, finally, after a few days when you've forgotten the proof, put your notes aside and reconstruct the proof entirely on your own.  Importantly, don't memorize the steps; just take note of the heuristics used (i.e. certain proofs use epsilon-delta arguments, certain proofs need induction, certain proofs use bounding arguments, some situations call for finding counter-examples etc.) You will be stuck in the beginning, but after a few weeks it will come a lot more naturally as you've built-up your problem-solving tool-kit.  3. Go through as many of the chapter exercises as feasible. Attempt the easiest odd-numbered ones (I think these are ones for which solutions are in the back of the book). Check your solution after attempting every exercise, and make a note on what you did or didn't miss. Keep a log of all the \"interesting\" approaches to solving a problem (these are all the heuristics like I mentioned above).  For better or for worse, almost all the exercises in Apostol are solved by someone somewhere on the web. This makes it easy to check your attempts, but of course you can also cheat yourself out of learning the material by just reading over someone else's solution without mentally exerting yourself first.  It definitely gets easier -- take it from someone who sucked incredibly hard at formal math. Edit: I also wanted to link a post from Cal Newport's excellent blog where he talks about how he used the same approach in his undergrad (Case Study: How I Got the Highest Grade in my Discrete Math Class) ",

Therefore, you might want to read an easier bibliography on the subject so you can get familiar with it - in my case, I used Stewart's Calculus and I was able to grasp it quite fast. Apart from that, I also used a book that involves more rigorous mathematics, as mentioned in Abdul's answer - that book is  amazon.com\nHow to Prove It: A Structured Approach, 2nd Edition: Daniel J. Velleman: 9780521675994: Amazon.com: Books. It is reallty great and does the a greater job you could ask for: it teaches you learn how to learn. So learning how to learn math is more important than knowing facts and theorems; you get to know how to USE them, MANIPULATE them, which is way more important. After these recommendations, you might be able to read Apostol's book just like you read a novel, with a much better reading flux. However, don't settle if you think you understand - learning maths is just like watching Discovery Channel: you understand it quite well as you go if you know the words he is talking about, but  after you're done watching, you can't remember a thing. So, another tip: not being a math major, always have a pen or pencil and paper with you so you can rewrite what you read in a way you understand, and later on you'll be able to write it quite formally.
