            "answer_text": "Since, only 2 months are left for NEET and your selection is very important, and it can achieved only if you strictly follow NCERT for these 2 months as NTA mainly focusses on NCERT. For BIOLOGY, NCERT is the key to score 320+ and this can be achieved only if you had studied it efficiently. By efficiently, means you have understood it properly not crammed it. Revise daily atleast 1 chapter of Biology for these 2 months. Go beyond NCERT for GENETICS,CELL BIOLOGY, Human Physiology from your class notes or any coaching material. For CHEMISTRY, to score 150+,study Organic and Inorganic completely from NCERT and practice Organic from any good book like M.S Chouhan. For Physical Chemistry, practice as many numericals as you can. Don't study this from NCERT. Last bot not the least your MIGHTMARE, PHTSICS: \u201cFor this never go for NCERT\u201d. To score 130+, following are some tips:- 1)Study Physics from your class notes only. 2)First take high weightage chapters like Modern Physics, Semiconductor, Current Electricity, Wave Optics, Gravitation,Thermodynamics, Wave theory etc. 3)Practice mcq's from NCERT EXEMPLAR, NEET previous year questions and if you have any coaching material,do practice them also. Hope you have found your answer. Thanks for reading KINDLY UPVOTE ",

Moreover, I suggest you to Practice Mock Tests and Past Year Papers of NEET. For Physics, NCERT is not enough. You need other reference books for Practice numericals. Physics needs lots of practice because it consists lots of numericals and formulas which needs understanding. You need reference books for Physics for practice and Must Give Mock Tests and Chapter wise tests and previous years papers. In Chemistry, NCERT is enough for InOrganic Chemistry. Organic Chemistry, NCERT is not enough. You can go with Selected Problems of Organic Chemistry. Must Practice Mock Tests and previous years papers of NEET. Physical Chemistry: Narendra Awasthi for practicing reactions Hope this will help you. ",

Concept wise also I won't recommend NCERT. Books like S.L Arora is good for explanatory part. Numericals are also nicely explained, but more for boards preparation. HC Verma, no doubt, it's best. But, I don't think numericals are need to he solved. They are usually meant for JEE preparation. If you have any coaching modules, then I'll recommend those books, because concept are nicely explained and numericals wise, I think questions are made keeping last year NEET papers in mind. ~All the best.
