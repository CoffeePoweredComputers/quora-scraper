            "answer_text": "Hi. I recently enrolled in the Data Science Career Track at Springboard. It has been only a few weeks since the course started (August\u201918 cohort), so my opinions will be about what you can expect in the first few weeks. First of all, I was assigned with a mentor who had a surprisingly similar background to mine. After getting his PhD degree in Biomedical Engineering, he also participated in a bootcamp before finding his first job as a data scientist. So, I feel like his experiences and suggestions will help me a lot. In terms of the learning process, you should be prepared to read articles, watch tutorials, and practice coding online. Some self-discipline and time-management skills are needed to keep up with the curriculum. As far as I understand, Springboard\u2019s system is designed around a feedback mechanism. There are many ways to receive feedback, your mentor, your peers, student advisers, career coaches, etc., only if you want to engage. No body is going to force you to learn data science, but they will be there to guide you and help you if you want. For example, it is your job to find project ideas for your capstone, but you can discuss your ideas with your mentor, post them on the forum and ask feedback from everyone else, and update or change your overall approach accordingly. Is Springboard worth it? It depends on what your expectations are. I am assuming that your ultimate expectation is finding a job upon completion. Well, the bootcamp comes with a job guarantee. Here is the tricky part: You also promise them that you will study hard, find interesting project ideas, complete your assignments, polish your credentials, do job searches and submit a certain number of applications every week when the job hunting phase starts. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclosure: I am a mentor at Springboard. The answer depends on your current situation and what you want to do in the future \u2014 so there isn\u2019t a \u201cgeneral\u201d answer to this question. While most online reviews are positive and team is focused on customer satisfaction, you might want to spend some time thinking through how these courses help your career. Here\u2019s a framework that might help - It has two steps: ROI of the course that you are planning to takeComparative analysis to see if something better\u2019s out there#1. ROI of the course that you are planning to take So Let\u2019s say you are planning to take the Springboard course. Add the Tuition Fee + Opportunity cost (Time investment) and let\u2019s say the total of tuition fees and opportunity cost is $3,000 for 3 months. Do you think can you get back that $3,000 later? Do you expect to get a better job? if so, what\u2019s that worth? Do you think Springboard can send you referrals and help with placements? (Check out their Data Science career track btw if this is important to you) Do you expect to get a promotion? If so, what\u2019s that worth? Do you expect to transition your career? If so, what\u2019s that worth to you? It\u2019s a little data analysis exercise too. If you enjoy thinking like this, you will enjoy your courses too. #2. Comparative Analysis to see if something better\u2019s out there. There\u2019s a bunch of options but fall into three categories: A. Online Trainer/Mentor Guided (Springboard, Udacity Nanodegree) \u2014 Mid-range cost B. Online Self paced (Edx, Coursera) \u2014 Low Cost C. In-person (General Assembly, Local University) \u2014 High Cost You can do the ROI analysis of each of these options too and see which one gives you the best ROI. Also, check for reviews and eliminate one\u2019s that don\u2019t have good reviews (Tip: Don\u2019t look at their website but go to a vendor-neutral location for reviews) Then rank it by ROI and Review Rating to pick the best considering all the factors that are more important too. if you decide to enroll, I have a $750 OFF discount code, contact me through https://insightextractor.com/contact/ Good luck!
