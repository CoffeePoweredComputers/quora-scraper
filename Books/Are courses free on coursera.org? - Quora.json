            "answer_text": "Many of Coursera\u2019s courses are still free. Edit (March 2020) - update fourth category to \u201cCoursera Plus,\u201d update the cost-benefit analysis to reflect new pricing scheme Edit (August 2017) - added a fourth category of Coursera\u2019s offerings These include the very popular Machine Learning and Learning How to Learn courses, which have taught millions of students to date and will likely teach millions more for free. But there are also many courses that aren\u2019t free, as you\u2019re aware (but even these you can get for free depending on your circumstances\u2014see below). Since this question comes up quite often, I\u2019ve put together a small outline that describes the differences between t\u0336h\u0336r\u0336e\u0336e\u0336 four main categories of Coursera\u2019s offerings and their respective pricing plans: Free coursesGain access to all of the course materials. Pay nothing for these courses unless you want a certificate.Limited free coursesGain access to most of the course materials; some materials like quizzes, assignments, exams might not be available. Only pay if you want full access and/or a certificate.SpecializationsA series of courses that usually ends in a capstone project that teaches you a subject in great depth, think of this as a mini-degree. Finishing one means you\u2019ll likely (if you mastered the topics) come away with employable skills and knowledge. This one\u2019s a bit complicated since Coursera seems to tinker with new ideas and experiments, but in general, you have:Fixed fee: pay a set price for each course (e.g. $79/course) or purchase the entire specialization as a set from the get-go (usually with a x% discount)Monthly fee: pay a monthly fee that gives you access to the entire specialization as long as you\u2019re subscribed. You can sign up for a free 7-day trial, which gives you access to everything except the capstone. In theory, you can cram an entire specialization into 7 days and pay to gain access to the capstone, but I\u2019m not sure how well that would fly in practice.Unlimited Annual Access (Coursera Plus)Coursera now has an unlimited plan available. Previously, this was priced at $49/mo. The monthly is no more. Instead, we now have Coursera Plus, which grants unlimited access to Coursera (including Specializations) $399/year. That\u2019s quite a savings over the old monthly plan, which would have cost $588/year!Quick Cost-Benefit Analysis The monthly fee options (3b) and (4) are really only worth it if you have time to double up on courses. Since most courses take about 8\u201312 weeks to complete, you end up paying between $68 and $92 per course using the monthly fee option if you only take one course at a time (this applies to most people). Unless you\u2019re constantly moving through courses or you\u2019re taking multiple at a time, you might better served paying the $79 to own a single course outright. Getting cost information for courses OpenCourser (*plug- this is my site) gathers information on pricing for online courses that makes it easier to compare key information like pricing on a course. It\u2019s frequently updated. You can also get pricing information straight from the source by visiting each course page on Coursera separately. To find out if a course you\u2019re interested in is free, semi-free, or paid, look for visual cues from the \u201cenroll\u201d buttons on the site (note: you may need to login first to see these differences):  In this image, the button on the left shows a monthly fee trial for a paid specialization (Type 3b). The button on the right is a free course (Type 1) that you can audit in its entirety without charge. Financial Aid Coursera also offers need-based financial aid, which can offset most or all of your costs for a paid course or specialization. If you think you qualify, try submitting an application. It takes about 10\u201315 minutes to fill one out during which you\u2019ll be asked to provide identifying information and details (e.g. income) that let Coursera determine your eligibility.

            "answer_text": "There are 3 types of paid and unpaid courses on Coursera: Type 1 : courses that come with Full-Course, no certificate options: this is the majority of the courses on Coursera, believe it or not, they are the majority. For these courses, you can choose to pay and get the certificate, or just do the full course for free while still enjoying all the experience.Type 2 : the supposedly 'premium' paid courses. For these courses, they don't provide full experience if you choose to do it for free. Meaning, you can still have access to everything, except the ability to submit the assignments for feedbacks. These courses hence, have 2 options: Audit Only (free + no access to assignments) and certificate (full experience + certificate). What happens if you really want those courses, but cannot pay? Financial aid is available, and it's very generous (they allow a maximum of 1 course at a time).Type 3 : courses that are purely for learning, meaning, totally free, there are no certificates offered, even if you want to pay, and there are no restrictions to the course experience. These courses are usually from Stanford and Princeton.Personally, I think the implication of this is that we have to exercise greater discretion when it comes to choosing courses. If you're expecting learning on Coursera to be a free buffet party, then you definitely should only focus on Type 1 courses. I think it is pointless to go in the forums of Type 2 courses and complain why they are not free and not the same as the Type 1 courses. We should understand that those courses take a very large amount of effort and money to create, so either they are chargeable, or they don't exist at all. Also, we should remember that, there's always a large number of Type 1 and also a small number of Type 3 courses for people who purely love learning and don't need the certificates. Hope it helps you\u2026\u2026. ",

Old technology is old , book reading is still preffering for world\u2019s best reader as paper books not eink or edevices tablets pc reading that\u2019s why intelligent students go less in lecture and they will always first in exam.Because of source they found is book , and they do.t need any instructor.But in prsctical work , you will need instructor because of you\u2019re experiementing something. I advice you dont pay for littlebit money for online courses , because of when someone tell you things on board and books are telling you something and it will takes little time for understa ding properly from books , because of we are practised from kidage for understanding things from paper and ink.You know i bought avout 22 books online and i read it on apple\u2019s leptop everyday.Now i habutuated from.books and if i see coursera vedios online i felt like it was so slowly snd they are wasting precious time like if you understand i topic from book in 30minutes while that same subject they are taking 1 hour+ in online.

Although you will still have access to all course materials but if you purchase the course you want to complete then you will get a certificate too. There are two options when enrolling in any coursera courses (Purchase Course 49 USD) or (Full Course, No Certificate), you have to select Full Course, No Certificate option and you are good to go and you will be enrolled in the coursera courses for free. If you want to get coursera courses for free on daily basis then visit the website below to get newly released coursera courses daily. I hope my answer was helpful. Good Luck ",

In a Research , it has shown that whoever takes any course from MOOC which has been made free of Cost never gets completed by the course taker. On the other hand, when one paid for the same course it was found that the course gets completed by the course taker in time bound frame or at least the couse gets done completely. Performing the Research on Mass proved how to effectively the course can be provided so that one who Enrolls should comolete it in proper time and get most out of it. Otherwise the motive with which the MOOC provides the courses may never get fulfilled. Hope I have made it clear to you. If we\u2019ve never meet before. Hi! This is Rahul. ",
