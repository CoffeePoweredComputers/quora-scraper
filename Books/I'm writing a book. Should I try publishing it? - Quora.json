Harshly! If more than two-thirds of the readers \u201ccouldn\u2019t put it down\u201d then you might have yourself a gem. Get it edited professionally again.

Watch out for what I refer to as The PoD People. These places refer to themselves as \u201cpublishers\u201d but they\u2019re essentially printers who charge you a ton to edit (and not all that well either) and then print your book and mail it to anyone who purchases it. Some of The PoD People (not all!) take your money and run \u2014 although I think they\u2019ve clamped down on these people in the last few years. But be wary. Best to get a referenced editor and designer through a writing organization. Cost? I\u2019m a former editor so know things to watch out for so do a good job to start with but still have my books professionally edited by someone else; and I design books for indie authors so don\u2019t have to pay for that part as I can do my own for free. Costs vary as does quality. I would suggest you finish this book first, starting a new one shortly before you do. Work at the new one while your first \u201cbaby\u201d is out to your editor and critiquers. :-) And start making a To Do Pile of future ideas for books and stories and poems and screenplays \u2026 Sherrill Wark, How to Write a Book: Park It, Get to Work: Sherrill Wark: 9781987491340: Amazon.com: Books ",

            "answer_text": "If you want it published, go for it. But anyone suggesting the first step is to finish writing it probably hasn\u2019t published a book. You could finish it and \u201cshop it around\u201d but the process has become much more business-like as publishers look to reduce costs and the risks of publishing a book no one will buy. If your intent is to see your book in hardcover or paperback form, available to a mass market, with a bar code on it and everything, the first step is to find a publisher. The Beatle\u2019s Paperback Writer to the contrary, the process is not that you write an amazing work and then show it around to publishers. The reality of today\u2019s market is that the process is to find a publisher who wants to publish a title like yours and who will commit to the costs of doing so. The market for printed books is tough. Many publishers don\u2019t take unsolicited manuscripts. You might need an agent to approach some publishers. Others have a process. If you contact a publisher, they will start by letting you know what kind of books they are looking for, for example, fiction/non-fiction, historic, poetry, business, self-help, etc. Most publishers specialize. If you\u2019ve found a publisher who prints books similar to the one you are writing (or want to write), you\u2019ll have to do a book proposal, which includes an abstract on what\u2019s important about the book, what makes it different (and therefore attractive to buyers), who should read it and why you are the one best qualified to write it. You\u2019ll also have to provide a table of contents (for a non-fiction book) and/or a sample chapter. Once your book is accepted, the publisher will provide you with an agreement that establishes the working relationship, what costs the publisher will bear, how long you have to finish the book, who earns the rights to the finished work, etc. There are many alternatives to having a publisher pick up your book. For example, there\u2019s \u201cvanity publishing\u201d in which you pay a publisher to print some quantity of your book for you. You send them the manuscript and a check and they print 250 copies and send them to you. They don\u2019t need to \u201caccept\u201d the book. There\u2019s also print-on-demand where you upload your manuscript and people order one at a time from a third party. And there\u2019s digital-only publication, which can be done through a publisher or independently. But for actual physical publication in the traditional manner, unless you are a celebrity or politician writing a memoir that is automatically in demand, you would almost always have to find the publisher first and then write the book.
