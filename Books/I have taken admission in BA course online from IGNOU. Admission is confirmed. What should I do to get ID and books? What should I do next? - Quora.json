            "answer_text": "When the admission is confirm you receive a letter and an email with the conformation. This letter contains the details about your Regional Center and a Study Center. An allotted Study Center comes under Regional Center. You Identity Card will be mailed to your correspondence address followed by the Study Material. If you have not received the Id card yet you can visit the Regional Center and check with them. If there is no proper status available, immediately apply for Identity Card, you will get the form at the RC. In the letter they also mention about the scheduled induction session to be held at the Study Center. This induction lecture is very important and should be attended. If you missed it, you can contact your Study Center coordinator who will guide with all the details regarding the course you\u2019ve applied for. Last but most important thing, in any correspondence with IGNOU mention your Enrollment number and Course applied plus your current semester. Memorize your enrollment number like your mobile number for the next 3 years :-) All the Best. ",

            "answer_text": "Go to your regional centre and get the ID. You will get the books at the regional centre, in some cases at the study centre, after 1 month (approximately) of your admission. Do not wait for something to be delivered to you. Some previous answers say that you will get ID and book slip through postal your address. I personally have had a very bad experience with IGNOU regarding their postal communication. I never got the book slip.Got the document asking for second year registration 6 months after my first year term-end exams.Basically, almost everything delivered was late (minimum by 2 months).I at the time of my admission got the contact number of an official at the regional centre after a short friendly communication. Things were easy thereafter. ",
