            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, yes- but you can find some sale titles for less at B&N and B&N also publishes its own books which are often great quality and good price. I\u2019m a big fan of B&N\u2019s classics series, and their special editions are almost all really well done with premium binding fit for gifting. However, if you\u2019re just buying mass market paperbacks or such, then Amazon is going to beat them on price 90% of the time. ",
