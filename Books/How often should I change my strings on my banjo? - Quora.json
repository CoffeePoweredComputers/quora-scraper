            "answer_text": "It depends how often you play and how pernickety you are, also the quality of the strings. I try to make time to play for a couple of hours most days, and may end up playing for five hours if there\u2019s a jam or our regular monthly market gig. For my main instrument, I change strings every 3 months or so. For instruments I play less frequently, maybe every six months, maybe even longer. I use D\u2019Addario NY Steel strings on my main instrument, because they have the bright, crisp tone I like on that banjo. They\u2019re expensive but they last longer. I use Deering strings on my second banjo because they bring out the bluesy growl I want on that one. Some brands are notorious for corrosion. Never use strings that show any sign of corrosion when you take them out of the packet. They must be smooth and bright. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s time to change if: You notice the tone of your strings is a bit \u2018off\u2019 and tuning doesn\u2019t help. You may hear the tone a little sharp on the attack then flat on the decay, for example. You know your instrument best, so trust your ears. (Although you can get acclimated to gradual changes.)The strings feel rough or gritty and you\u2019re getting a lot of pick noise, indicating corrosion. Check that your picks aren\u2019t the problem, though. You should probably lubricate your strings with a proprietary string lubricant like String Fuel every time you play, btw, unless you have very oily skin.Suddenly you just can\u2019t get that darn string in tune! It infuriatingly goes from sharp to flat without being in tune! Okay, even more than usual for a banjo \u2026 If it\u2019s just on one occasion, it may just be atmospheric conditions, if it happens all the time: new strings, or your electronic tuner needs a new battery.I hope this helps. Keep on pickin\u2019! ",

            "answer_text": "Changing banjo strings depends on a lot of factors. They lose their \u201cmusicality\u201d so slowly that sometimes you don\u2019t notice a problem until you change them, and the instrument sounds bright and clear again. That being said, keeping the strings clean helps them last, and this can be simply wiping them down after you play. Some of us exude more oils and sweat when we play; both hasten the demise of strings. And strings will eventually physically show signs of age; you\u2019ll see stains and corrosion on them. Professionals may change as often as every gig; we amateurs, only as often as is affordable (although decent banjo strings are not that expensive). Regarding the actual change process, the movable bridge on the banjo can complicate things. Unless I\u2019m cleaning the fretboard in conjunction with a change, I change the strings one at a time and use a capo to keep tension in the new string so that the loop end stays put on the tailpiece while I anchor the other end, at the tuner.
