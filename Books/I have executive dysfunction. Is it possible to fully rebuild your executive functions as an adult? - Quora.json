            "answer_text": "Sure. You just take it one step at a time. It's very similar to the approach you might take if you were agorophobic, or with anxiety disorder. You have to set yourself attainable goals, and don't expect it to be easy. If you can get some help from a mental health professional who is conversant with this issue, that would be ideal, because they can help you to set those goals, and be someone who you can check in on with respect to your progress. You might want to start with making a list of the things you want to do with yourself. If you have no idea (which isn't unusual) then start from the other way around - what is it that gets you down? Set yourself small tasks - like going for a walk each day for 10 minutes for a week. Or doing your washing once a week for four weeks. Always put a boundary around what you do. By saying 'this number of minutes per period' and 'this many times in total' for each goal, you know it will come to an end, and you have a choice about whether you want to carry on. You have achieved your goal, and you can either not do it anymore, or set a slightly more challenging goal and limit it in a similar way, so you can keep checking in on your progress. Pin up those goals with days of the week on your wall using post it notes as a reminder. Don't ignore them. Take them in. Not too many - just enough to remind you of the most important things. If it gets to be too many, take some down and put them in a drawer, where you can go through them at some later date - maybe once a week. Most important: Do not set yourself too many goals at once. You need to give yourself the chance to succeed, so don't go big even if you want to get there quickly. Succeeding with small goals is a much better habit to get into than failing with large goals.
