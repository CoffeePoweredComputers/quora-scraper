            "answer_text": "Diamonds are not typically cut with lasers. Diamonds are cut now the same way they have been for centuries\u2014with other diamonds. The first step is CLEAVING the rough stone to reduce it in size and shape to something that can be worked with, Then it is SAWN into its initial shape with a soft iron wheel coated with olive oil and impregnated with diamond dust. From there it is sawn into its final shape, step by step, with the same process. The final level is polishing the stone in its finished shape with a soft iron wheel coated with olive oil and fine diamond dust. Lasers would not work well with gem quality diamonds because the light beam would simply pass through the crystal. ",
