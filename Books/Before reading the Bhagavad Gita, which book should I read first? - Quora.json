Merely listening will purify the senses. Understanding will transform your life. For English, I recommend: The Concise Srimad Bhagavatam: Venkatesananda, Swami: 9780791401491: Amazon.com: Books Also, the kindle version of the Mahabharata for the backstory and context of the Gita: Amazon.com: Pictorial Mahabharata eBook: Raghaveshananda , Swami: Kindle Store Once you are hooked, I suggest learning Sanskrit and get the original \u201cas it is\u201d unembellished by translational errors:   Reading of the Bhagavatam fulfills the critiera that you read Bhagavad Gita with bhakti. The Bhagavatam instills bhakti which will orient you with the right attitude when approaching the Bhagavad Gita, for maximum benefit. \u201cBut, those who carp and cavil at My teaching and do not practice it, consider them as ignorant of all knowledge, senseless, and lost.\u201d ~ Sri Krishna paramatma  ",

Bhagavad Gita is set within the greater history of Mahabharat which is the setting for the jewel that is Bhagavad Gita. It\u2019s a big book and a great story, but there are editions by Puranprajna dasa and Krishna Dharma dasa that present it as prose and not simply a translation of the individual texts. If you are interested simply in the philosophy of Bhagavad Gita then it would be good to chose a small book by Srila Prabhupada that will be based on the core elements of Bhagavad Gita. Any Iskcon temple you contact will have copies and be able to recommend one.

Of course, translations and good explanatory books are available, but this path helps to understand the meaning truly and also there will be self realisation. ",
