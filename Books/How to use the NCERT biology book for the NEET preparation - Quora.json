            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, Long answer but in my opinion it's worth reading. As everyone knows NCERT is best book of biology for NEET preparation.This is the book which I read most number of times in my whole life.Here i will try to make it simple and pointwise. Moreover i will try to make it enjoyful. During first reading,i read it for understanding basic concepts again(actually i reffered first to reference then ncert for better understanding) that i had read from reference. I remembered some basic things but not all profoundly.After about 2 readings generally most students involved in coaching are given a test for same.. Atleast for 2 chapters. After giving tests,i realized that each and every line of NCERT is important and nothing can't be ignored.I also realized the above mentioned point when after reading chapter i used to solve mcqs from MTG NCERT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.In subsequent revisions i used to learn from my mistakes, from incidents(mentioned below under my experiences) and remembered eaxh and everything of NCERT that you will get to know after reading My experiencesMoreover i used to write some important extra concepts aside of the text in free space in second or third reading.I get to know important concepts by my teacher and somewhat by solving previous years(1990s).This helped me to revise important extras alongwith NCERTsI'm mentioning here some of pics of my NCERT    These are some pics, Don't try to understand what i have writtten,i know my writing is totally disastrous,it can be understood by one and only me. These are just to show you how i write the concepts in NCERT. Eveytime while i solve mcqs for the first time-:My experiences-: I will tell you how i realized the importance of every aspect by describing my experiences. For example one mcq is Which nutrient deficiency causes kwashiorker? Ans-:Protein Me-: \"Oho! Ye to pda hi nhi, isme se(supplementary material mentioned at end )bhi questions aa skta h kya\u201d (E. T. - Oh! I left this one, i can't believe question can also arise from this) Realized importance of supplementary material. Another mcq Which receptor on cell facilitate the glucose transport in cell? Ans -: GLUT 4 Me-: \u201cOho! Vo biomolecules ke tables pdna to bhul hi gya,shayad us me se h,text to sara pd liya\" (e. T. -I forgot to learn tables in biomolecules,probably question is from tables,as i have read full theory) Realised importance of tables. Another mcq Who won triple crown of biology? Ans-: Ernst mayr Me-: \u201cOho! Unit ke starting me tha ye naam to! Uski description thi, usme hoga, vo to pdi hi nhi\" (E. T.- This name was mentioned in starting of first unit. Description was also given,i haven't read that) Realized the importance of description of scientists. Another mcq What is India's share in global species diversity? Ans -:8.1 percent Me-: \u201coho! Itna data to maine yad hi nhi kia, shyd ncert ka data h... Yad krna pdega\" (e. t. - I haven't learned much data,i think it's from Ncert, i have to learn it) Realized the importance of datas. Now i am going to mention the last two most exasperating ones,these were my reaction with my teacher. My teacher is amazingly amazing with over 20+ years of experience. He made these two questions of test to make us realize the importance of aspects of ncert. I'm very thankful to him. 1)mcq is P1542 is variety of -: Ans -:pea It was in test of chapter\"Strategies for enhancement of food production\u201d I rushed to sir and asked Me-: Sir! Sir! Ye to Ncert me khi nhi h.. (e. t. -Sir, this not mentioned in ncert) Sir-: (smiles) Beta kabhi images pe bhi dhyan dia kro. Ncert h kuch bhi aa skta h. (e. t. -also focus towards images mentioned in NCERT, question can arise from anywhere in NCERT) He then opens the book and shows Image  Sir-: Dekh ye ncert me hi hai I was like feeling ashamed and thinking that i am damn fool\u2026.But learnt a lesson. 2)Another one Mcq The theory that every complex phenomenon of biology, can be explained by analyzing the simplest, most basic physical mechanisms is Ans -: Reductionist biology. Again i rushed to teacher with 100% confidence that even term is not mentioned in NCERT. Me-: Sir, ye dekho out of NCERT h na ye? Iss term ka naam tak nhi h NCERT me. Puri NCERT chan mari, khi nhi h ye. (e. t. -: See sir, it's out of ncert, it's not mentioned In NCERT, i scrolled all pages in NCERT but i can't find it) Sir(this time laughs out) -: Beta NCERT ki term h, kabhi free time me book ka preface bhi pad lia kro, jruri nhi sab kuch chapter texts me ho. (It's definitely mentioned in ncert,in your free time you should read the preface mentioned in starting of book,it's not necessary that everything will be in text). He opened preface of book and showed me this term. I was speaking to myself\"Man,this is totally insane. It's now happening over, I'm now frustrated, who the hell will read this.. Totally insane\u201d Whatever i spoke to me and my freinds, was this... But my mind knows reality. It was that these all incidents taught me important lessons of not neglecting anything. I know you will find some of above questions useless, i thought the same initially but soon realized that teacher was never wrong, he taught to read ncert in way in which i could have never read if i have done self study. He is one of best persons in my life. Still i remember these words to exact extent... And i will never forgot his lessons. So i conclude Learn from your mistakes.. Learn from your incidents... Trust me. Incidents are best rememberance. Don't make useless reactions on your mistakes. Don't neglect anything. Thank you! Hope you enjoyed the answer:) All the best! ",

Our zoology teacher at Allen made us pledge (literally) that we\u2019ll devote 1 hour for biology NCERT everyday and it works !! ",
