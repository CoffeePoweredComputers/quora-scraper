            "answer_text": "There are two ways to self publish a book on Barnes & Noble. First you can submit your manuscript directly to their Ebook converter. There\u2019s information on their website about how to do this. Second you can submit your manuscript to the Smashwords Ebook converter and select that you want to have them distribute your book to all the retail sites you select, including Barnes & Noble. However, since you have already published using KDP Select and, since their TOS states that your book may not be sold on any other retail site in order to be in the KDP Select program you may NOT publish on Barnes & Noble at this time, period. Another answer also told you this but I can tell you that if you violate the KDP Select program\u2019s TOS, Amazon will take your book down after first asking you politely to un-publish it. Also yes, just use Amazon\u2019s paperback creator. It\u2019s way better than CreateSpace which they also own anyway. However, if you do decide to leave the KDP select program, Createspace will distribute your paperbacks to Barnes & Noble. Decisions, decisions, right? ",

            "answer_text": "CreateSpace is an Amazon company and will distribute paperbacks to other stores. Forget about them for now. You can use KDP to start your paperback. There are a few places where you can publish free and get wide distribution of ebooks. Try Ebooks from independent authors and publishers I also published directly on B&N and Kobo, but keeping files updated in too many places can become onerous. Smashwords distributes to B&N and Kobo, plus a few dozen more sites. Including Amazon, I might add. Remember, if you\u2019re in the KDP Select program you cannot publish your ebook anywhere else. Amazon has exclusive rights. Remove the Select status, then you can publish your books anywhere you want. ",
