            "answer_text": "I am very sure that you cannot get rich by merely reading the best stock books. It is not the reading - it is actually learning about how to invest. If you read the books like some story books then you will not learn. Learning is about understanding what you have read, practicing what you have learned through case studies or paper transactions and then reviewing the experience. You repeat the process to accumulate the knowledge and skills Then when you have mastered it, you actually invest with real money and hope that the power of compounding ie consistent returns over a 20 to 30 years period will make you very rich. Remember that while there are tons of students all over the world reading many books, only a handful make it to universities and even a smaller number graduate with honours. They all read the same books. ",
