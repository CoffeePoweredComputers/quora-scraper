I am highlighting syllabus because thats the thing which matters the most while preparing. Second most important thing is \u201cwhat is not to be studied?\u201d \u2026.Yes, you should always keep in mind what has to be focused and what is to be ignored. Keep limited books n study them only\u2026 Revise them several time.. Do not come up with new book for the same subject everytime\u2026 Basically\u2026 one has to start preparing for mains because thats where base is created.. Start with NCERT books n then moving on to standard books. Please do not underestimate NCERT\u2026 you will see many questions in prelims directly from NCERT (Very very important). Choose an optional WISELY n start with that\u2026 Optional has to be a subject of your field of interest so that you can efficiently dedicate 2-3 hours per day to it without feeling monotonous.Read a newspaper everyday n make good notes of it. PLEASE dont copy the whole paper\u2026 notes should always be such which could b easily memorised n revised in shorter time..More like synopsis.For GS\u2026 pick up subjects seperately like Polity..economy.. history..Geography..enivornment etc n develop a strong base.Make a seperate notebook n pick atleast 2\u20133 topics every week\u2026 study those issues.. google it.. study from magazine or any authentic source n make good notes on these topics. This will help in essay writing or may b used in GS paper.Test series is the utmost important thing so please join one. It will help u maintain discipline n consistency in your studies. Secondly, There is no point of studying if you cannot solve questions so Keep analysing yourself with every test. You vl get to know where you stand n what else has to be done for your improvement .Make sure that by the end of february..you finish your optional n GS so that march onwards you can focus entirely on prelims preparation. You will have to be thorough with your current affairs.Budget, Economic survey, all the important laws etc has to be focused. Revise all the subjects.. important issues n solve as many questions as you can. When you prepare for such exams.. Do not publicise much that you are preparing for it because sometimes it really takes more time than we actually plan n social pressure will demotivate you for sure .. So just isolate yourself from negative people.. stay with those who motivates you n helps you in every possible manner. Best of luck.. \u263a\u263a",
