            "answer_text": "You only need to stop if it\u2019s negatively affecting you, your life, or other people. For instance, if it\u2019s taking up the time you\u2019re supposed to do homework, chores, or socialize, it\u2019s mentally unhealthy, you need to be doing a variety of things, and making sure you\u2019re doing stuff that helps your future. If you\u2019re simply masturbating once or twice a day, that\u2019s normal, to be honest. 20 times a day at 15 minutes a time? That\u2019s taking up time you could be doing productive things. To be honest, though, it\u2019s mentally and physically unhealthy to stop masturbating, because it fulfills a natural mental and physical desire that is unhealthy to suppress. If you think it\u2019s sinful, think of this for a second: is it harming anybody? Jesus, for instance, had nothing to say about masturbation. The Old Testament may have, but many of those rules are impractical, unnecessary, and unhealthy, especially mentally, to follow. Enjoy the masturbation, sex and sexual pleasure are a beautiful part of life. ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest mostly teenagers will not follow your instruction to stop masturbating if they choose to partake in the activity they will regardless of what you've said. However to set your mind at ease it is absolutely normal , and healthy especially in the teenage years. It's actually a normal and healthy activity in life also for males and females. And as a side note if you would like to look at it in this way ,\u201dwould you rather have your child partake in intercourse unsafely at an early age especially during these times? I hope this helped answer your question and hopefully set your mind at ease however I understand everybody has their personal opinions about certain subjects although medically even professionals will tell you that it is a healthy natural activity. I wish you luck I understand raising children is very hard to do. Stay safe and healthy! ",
