            "answer_text": "Just the other day I had a huge revelation; I discovered what my entire life had led up to, what it all meant! It was an eye opener. I recently purchased a house on a small lake (more like a glorified pond, only 10 acres). It has a lovely large wooded lot and a gorgeous view (no matter the weather, time of day or night [at night the people across the lake have lights on their docks that reflect, along with the moon, on the water giving the ripples from the wind a beautiful pattern]) of this sweet, small, quiet, duck and geese populated pond. I keep finding myself wasting hours upon hours just sitting on the porch rocking in my lawn chair looking out across the lake. I can literally sit there all day and later, when the sun sets, wonder what happened to the time. You see, I have always been a wanderer. I left home to go to college, left college to join the military and have not stopped moving ever since. Here is the statistic that defines my life since I graduated High School; I have not lived in one house (one address) for more than 3.5 years since 1981. Scary huh? Most of the moves were at the one year mark, but many were after just a few months. Some were military directed, others were after the military and the job just was not a good fit, I was in temp quarters while I looked for a more permanent abode, my partner/roommate decided to change things (or I did), and a plethora of other reasons to cause me to pack all I own, move, and unpack it all again. I have moved so many times that I have it down to a science; I know the bare minimum I need to survive for a year. I can put those items in a few boxes and if I know the next move will also be temporary I only need to unpack those few boxes to survive. I know to make an inventory of each box, put a copy in the box and keep a copy for myself; this helps when I need to locate something. So, what is the big revelation? What is the purpose of my life? Many of my moves, after becoming a civilian, were to get better jobs. I have always kept my eye on the fact that I need to retire at a particular grade as that drives my annuity. I need a certain level of income so that I can manage my bills, maintain a level of life style (I am simple so I don't need that much), and to pay for or maintain the homes I rent (I am not a \"landlord\" by trade and I won't throw people out just to sell a house, as long as they are good tenants I will let them stay and I will just suck it up and deal with the maintenance and taxes, everyone needs good housing). So, all this packing, and unpacking, all the searching for a home, all the resume building and job applications all the searching and searching for home and jobs and for what? To establish a grade that will provide for me in my retirement. Am I there? No. So, what is the Revelation? That all my moves, all my searching, all my work as been so I could find a house on the side of a small quiet lake where me, my cats, and the ducks and geese can commune. That is all it is for; a place of peace with a bit of calm and quiet attached. Nothing more, no great celebratory life after all of the work, just a bit of peace and quiet. I never expected to find a home so calming, so peaceful that I would give up the pursuit of more retirement income and just sit on the porch and watch the sunrise or set. I had no clue that this was all I had been looking for all this time. Amazing. It all seems so simple and, honestly, a bit anticlimactic (until the geese get to squabbling, but that is another story for another time). ",

Unconditional love doesn\u2019t exist in this world yet to strive for it is all life is worth living for, the most gallant of endeavors. I am not perfect but I do my best to do everything I do in the spirit of love. God is love. God is oxytocin\u2019s lie made true. To love God is to love indiscriminately, to love until it hurts. ",
