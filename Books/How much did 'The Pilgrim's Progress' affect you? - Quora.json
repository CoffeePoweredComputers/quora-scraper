            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t recall that it affected me all that much, simply because it merely illustrated what I already very strongly believed. I am an atheist now, but when I first read a child\u2019s illustrated version of Pilgrim\u2019s Progress years ago, I was very much involved in the kind of church that believed pretty much the same things as the book\u2019s author. I do remember being moved at the courage and perseverance of the religious believer who submitted to being burned at the stake for his faith. It hadn\u2019t been all that long since I had read Foxe\u2019s Book of Martyrs, a copy owned by my grandfather. You may know that Pilgrim\u2019s Progress and Foxe\u2019s book are two of the most popular religious works ever published in English. Anyway, I took it as a given that their outlook was the right one. I do remember being irritated at the author\u2019s censure of Mr. Talkative, who joined the pilgrims on their journey for a short time and remarked that an effect of grace in the heart was to cause a great outcry against sin. Well, in a Christian context, that is perfectly true, but the other pilgrims found his declaration insufficiently pious and censured him as trivial and unfeeling. That struck me as a meaningless quibble and, though I probably did not realize it at the time, reflected my growing discomfort at the undercurrent of anti-intellectualism that runs through that kind of religion and of which I was slowly becoming aware, even if not at a fully conscious level. I reread the book again years later, as an adult; I think I was still very much involved in church, though of a more liturgical type than I had been in previously. In any case, I still admired the book for its religious viewpoint. I still appreciate it as a classic of English literature, though of course I no longer agree with its basic outlook. For any who haven\u2019t read it, Hawthorne\u2019s witty short story \u201cThe Celestial Railroad,\u201d is a satire on Transcendentalism, based on the imagery of The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress.

            "answer_text": "The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress is religious science fiction and it profoundly affected me because it is a very imaginative, symbolic, metaphysical interpretation of the Bible. The author, John Bunyan, is as talented as William Shakespeare (my view) or Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in Wonderland (my view). Pilgrim\u2019s Progress is told as a dream. ",
