It's the 1st ever novel I read and I enjoyed reading it. And in comparison to the movies, I'll like to say the books are a million times more fun. The movies don't seem to be luring you into the franchise. In a general view the movies are really fun and enjoyable, but if you ever read the books you'd know how stupid they are. The books have a rich description of how each event is happening. The details put into them can't be seen in the movies. The greatest example's the chapter \u201cThe Prince's Tale\u201d. The movie did a great job on that but the vibe is not the same as in the books. You'll truely feel every loss in the books. Those pages you turn with a heavy heart knowing that someone is going to die. So Yeah go get them ",

            "answer_text": "If you are someone who loves to read books in general, Harry Potter series is something that you should not afford to miss reading in your lifetime. It's not only the Harry potter series, any book that has been filmed will miss out something or the other. For those who straightly watch the movie, it may be wonderful and satisfying. But when you read a book and watch the same movie, you'll know how much the movie misses out. The book order of phoenix was bigger than the deathly hallows book. Deathly hallows had 2 parts in the movie, because they cannot finish it in a single movie. Whereas the order of phoenix was as single movie, because they chose to leave out a lot of detailing. And they modify certain parts that they think would reduce the screen time. For example, Hagrid only takes Harry and Hermione to meet his brother Gawrp the first time in the book , since Ron will be playing Quidditch. In the movie, the entire sequence of Ron playing Quidditch, the famous \u201cWeasley is our king\u201d chants would have been ignored. However, the core plot was delivered to the audience. That's how the movies work. I'd suggest anyone to read the Harry Potter book series for this very reason. There are wonderfully small detailings included in the book by J.K.Rowling. Try it and you won't regret it \ud83d\ude04 #WeasleyIsOurKing ! ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry, didn\u2019t know they were ill. But if they were, I would certainly hope they are better. Better than what: films, blogs, Pinterest? They are an excellent series that depict a coming of age story and juxtaposes the \u2018battle\u2019 of between good and evil. There are a few glitches/errors in the universe that JK Rowling created but altogether an enjoyable read at almost any age. They do cost money and for my part would suggest reading library copies first. I only purchase books that I would want to read more than once, (unfortunately that\u2019s a lot of books), but have discovered the joys of Kindle for keeping those re-reads from needlessly cluttering up my shelves.

            "answer_text": "The books are way more detailed, fun, exciting, and have much more content than the movies. If you have watched the movies, then reading the books will be much more fun and easier, This is because while reading, we can simply paint the picture of teh scene inside our head and it makes it easier to perceive as to what is going on. I highly recommend you to give them a try. If you liked what you read, kindly message me and I could provide you the link to buy them. Would not affect you but would help me out a bit. :) Regards ",

To me, that ruins a book. It\u2019s a good thing she wrote for children/youth, who probably hadn\u2019t read any of the books she \u201cborrowed\u201d from and so didn\u2019t care. Admittedly, she appeals to a lot of youngsters. ",
