            "answer_text": "Parents can only do so much. Years ago, we had an old encyclopedia. It was way out of date, and my young sons wanted a new one. My husband and I could no way afford an actual brand new set of encyclopedias, so we watched on Craig\u2019s List for someone selling a set that wasn\u2019t too old. Lucky us, we found one that was only a couple years old. A mother had purchased the set for her son, but he wouldn\u2019t use it. When we came to her house to look at the encyclopedia, we brought our kids. They ran to it, and were super jazzed that the set looked new, and had been published only a couple years before. I was glad to buy the set, it had clearly not been used. The gold leaf on the page edges made that satisfying crack sound, every volume I picked up. The mother asked me how I got my kids to be so happy about an encyclopedia set. I looked her right in the eye, and said, \u201cTo learn to get excited about an encyclopedia, they have to see the parents using it and being excited about it, first.\u201d That kid wasn\u2019t the only one not using that pristine encyclopedia.  When my sons were little, both were interested in math. We had all kinds of math manipulatives available for them to play with, picture books with math themes, math flashcards, calculators, math puzzles\u2026generally, math was never held separate from the idea of fun. One of my sons was clearly good at math from a stunningly young age. The other son was so into math he preferred math flash cards over a story or song at bedtime. I did not do anything different with those boys. But one had math ability, and one had a deep love of math.  Parents can make learning fun, by having fun learning. Parents cannot make their children engage in something the parents themselves will obviously not engage in. Opportunity to engage in learning (math or anything else) and roll models of enjoying learning hard things is a necessary but insufficient part of the process to help a child learn to love math or anything else. Kids who do come to love math, got there because they had the opportunity when they wanted and needed it, but also felt a natural affinity for it. Many people in my family loved sports when I was growing up. And almost every member of my family came to love sports\u2014playing sports, watching sports live, watching sports on TV, following sports in the news\u2014but not me. I can appreciate the work that goes into sports, I can appreciate the grace and drama, the dedication, the camaraderie, I understand the rules of most common sports. But I don\u2019t love sports. I enjoyed watching my husband and my sons play when they did, but only because it was them. I literally don\u2019t remember any particular game they won or lost. I remember the time one of my sons made a double play after being hit in the mouth with a baseball, and rushing my bloody son to the dental surgeon to fix the damage. No, I don\u2019t love sports. And nothing anyone ever did or said was going to change that. Parents cannot \u201cinstill\u201d love. They can only provide the option to love. The rest is up to the kids. ",
