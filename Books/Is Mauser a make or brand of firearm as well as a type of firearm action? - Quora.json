            "answer_text": "Mauser (the company) has been making guns since the 1870s (still in business). One of their more popular designs was the Mauser 98, which is a rifle originally made in 1898. Its innovation was the locking method of its bolt, which was more secure and safe than anything else in its day. They patented it, and licensed a bunch of other manufacturers to use their design, thus the term \u201cMauser action\u201d came into common usage. ",
