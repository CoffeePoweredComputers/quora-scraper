            "answer_text": "It is kind of curious/funny, because I often hear that when people take Psychology courses, especially psychopathology courses they often think they might have some mental disorder. This is most likely what is going on with you, however, you might also have some kind of mental distress or disorder. You should probably seek out a counselor in the very least. Now, there is a good difference between actual voices that are heard and thoughts that interrupt you. Hearing voices is somewhat more unusual, but even if you hear voices it doesn\u2019t mean you necessarily have schizophrenia. There are a lot of other things that need to go wrong for that. I guess the problem is that we don\u2019t know enough about your situation to really comment very well. I\u2019m assuming you are fairly young, since you are in college (although a lot of older people go to college too). Anyway, the late teens and early 20\u2032s is when a lot of mental illnesses develop, so if you are actually hearing voices, it is possible that it is the beginning of a mental illness. Please, just try not to panic. The very best thing you can do is seek out help. Maybe you just have some anxiety and speaking to someone may help. As a student of psychology surely you understand the importance of getting help. Also, if you do happen to have a severe mental illness, the best thing you can do is get treatment early so you will have a better overall outcome. Maybe start with your college counseling department and go from there. Good luck, and try not to be too worried. I know that is probably the hardest part! ",

            "answer_text": "Doubting the reality of your own experience and desperately seeking reassurance that what you are experiencing is real are common problems experienced by people who grew up in very neglectful or invalidating environments, where it was really hard to get parents and perhaps other family members to mirror or validate the child's thoughts and feelings. Sometimes these parents consistently tell the child that their thoughts, feelings or experiences are wrong; in other cases, the parents themselves may behave in ways that seem totally fake to the child, to the point where the child wonders if anyone is really \"there.\" Other times, the parent simply disappears or otherwise abandons or betrays the child, leaving the bewildered child to wonder if anything about the previous relationship was real at all.  You are not crazy, but you may want to seek psychotherapy to address some of the life experiences that may still be plaguing you and shaping your anxieties and fears. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I don't think so. It's extremely common for students to question their own sanity while studying abnormal psychology. You start giving tentative diagnoses to yourself and everyone around you. At some point, when you've learned a little more and your understanding has increased, that stops. It's easy to understand why it happens when you realize so much of psychology has to do with where you fall on a continuum. As I so often say, psychology is generally \u201cmore or less\u201d rather than \u201cyes or no\u201d. Even if you have a few symptoms of a certain disorder, it's typically not enough to qualify for a diagnosis. If you want to see what I mean, just take one of the many personality disorder online quizzes. You'll get results that show how much your answers match up with each of the personality disorders, sometimes even displayed as percentages, instead of check marks next to the ones you supposedly have because everyone falls somewhere on that continuum for a particular trait and the quiz is simply measuring the amount to which you may have those tendencies. Obviously, if your symptoms persist or get worse, go see a professional. In the meantime, just be aware that nearly all abnormal psychology students experience similar doubts. It just comes with the territory. ",

There is no way, anybody from the Internet could diagnose you properly (especially not based on 1 single message posted). You need to get yourself to a proper doctor/psychiatrist who, hopefully, will spend the time required to talk to you and then maybe give a diagnosis and outline possible treatments. I am a moderator in a pneumothorax forum where people have fairly clear symptoms like eg. shortness of breath, a certain, almost typical type of pain, etc. but even there we would not do a remote diagnosis...your talk to a doctor/psychiatrist here is like the xray that is needed there...a way of getting a proper diagnosis.

            "answer_text": "Natalie's answer is a very good one. Without more information, and you should really see someone, it's hard to say. But I very much relate to her answer. Your childhood can indeed cause real problems in determining what is '\"real\" - not because there's something wrong with you, but because you had to hold on to \"real\" without any support or reinforcement. As children, we believe what we are told and think that things are normal, when they simply may not be. So naturally we are skeptical of what we hear from others, because deep down inside we always thought something wasn't right, because it wasn't. And, as pop-psychology as it sounds, we do internalize our parents in our heads, and that message (I have no idea what I'm talking about, nor am I capable of knowing) is something that becomes part of us. I'm 53 years old, and am just now coming to have more faith in myself than in that Greek chorus. Everybody kind of has a dialogue going on their heads as you describe, that's totally normal (who is that we are talking to when we talk to ourselves?). Yours may just be louder and more convincing to you that the average person. It's good to find out who those voices belong to. ",

And when we had our abnormal psychology course almost all of us felt like we suffer from something or the other. 90% it's just a feeling caused by too much thinking. If you're really bothered just go see a doctor. But it's mostly nothing. A good way to always check is by examining your social circles, if you're someone who enjoys social company and you're an active person with whom people reciprocate a lot actively in a stable manner, you usually don't have anything to fear. Also, are you getting enough sleep? Are you sacrificing sleep to study? ",
