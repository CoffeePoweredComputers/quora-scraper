            "answer_text": "Nakula, the fourth of the five Pandavas and one among the twins. Nakula and Sahadeva were born to Madri with the help of the boon from Kunthi from the Ashwini kumaras. Nakula is the handsome guy among the five Pandavas and married Draupadi and begotten a son, Satanika. After the demise of Pandu and Madri, Madri\u2019s brother Shalya intended to make Nakula and Sahadeva as heir to the throne of Madra, his kingdom. Nakula refused the offer stating that they are not the real children of Madri as they are offered as blessings by Ashwini Kumaras to Madri. However Shalya convinced Nakula and Sahadeva to be his heir but under Sahadeva\u2019s one condition that they will continue to be with other three brothers in Hastinapur. This shows how Nakula was deeply in love with his step-mom Kunthi and her sons! When Yudhistra lost the game of dice, Nakula vowed that he would kill Shakuni who was the main cause for their hardships. Like his brother Sahadeva he is also well versed in astrology but he would forget the predictions once it is said. In Mahabharata war, Nakula desired Draupada to be the Commander-in-chief for Pandava army. However Yudishtra chose Dhristadhyuman to be the commander-in-chief. Nakula with his war tactics defeated many warriors in the Mahabharata like Dussasana, Shalya, Shakuni\u2019s son Ulook, and slained Shakuni on 18th day. Apart from warfare, Nakula has mastered horse breeding, treating illness of horse, a good charioteer, and an expert in Ayurveda. Nakula is known for his sword fighting and is said that he would ride his horse and he would deflect every rain drop with his swords and would emerge completely dry. After the demise of Krishna, Pandavas retired to Himalayas along with a dog, Yama himself. Nakula was the third one to die in the expedition after Draupadi and his brother Sahadeva. It is said that he died because of his prudence that he is the only handsome in the world! ",
