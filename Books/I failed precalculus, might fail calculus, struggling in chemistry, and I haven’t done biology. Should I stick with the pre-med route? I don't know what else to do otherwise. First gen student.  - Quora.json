            "answer_text": "From what you tell me, you may not be the best candidate for medical school. Unless you put in the time, you will not likely do well in calculus. I know a lot of people who are not good at math. But failing pre-calc is not just a bad sign, it\u2019s a horrible sign. The American medical system looks at this as a sine que non of entry requirements. It\u2019s not to be whether one can master calculus or that a practicing doctor really needs this level of math on a regular basis, it\u2019s just that you should understand the principles so you can understand physics for example, which is basic to F=ma. Calculating the rate of change in velocity is what acceleration is. This will make sense to those who have the intellectual capacity to go and learn physiology or rates of decay. You just have to have some logical capacity to understand the underpinnings of radioactive decay or rates of excretion involved in achieving steady state equilibrium of drug infusion or glomerular filtration by the kidney. You use some complex math statistics, which are integral in most publications in drug efficacy studies: p values and standard deviation curves. So, what it has to do with med school hopefuls, they use metrics to compare candidates and keep high standards for those candidates which will be judged by medical school entry. It\u2019s GPA and MCAT scores and the courses everyone has to take which are required for entry are what committees look at. Would you want anybody and everybody who applies to become a doctor to be a doctor? Being a doctor and the degree that is given would lose meaning and credibility. The medical profession is smart in that it only lets a certain number individuals achieve this. Because you have these safeguards, the system produces a product that has standards. In law it\u2019s quite the opposite. There are \u201cx\u201d times as many people with JDs running around because there are \u201cx\u201d times more JD spots. For those attaining a JD each state has a bar exam in order to control excess supply. Anyhow, you should consider why you want an MD. In most cases, there are different routes to the same goal. There\u2019s nursing school for RNs and RNPs. PAs have to practice in conjunction with an MD and do much of the work of an MD; I am treated by an PA (physician\u2019s assistant) on a day-to-day basis. And I occasionally need a specialist for a new problem with my health (like when I passed a kidney stone\u2014painful). Once you get a firm idea of what you want you can make informed choices. GL. ",

            "answer_text": "Responding to A2A.I am confused why if you failed precalculus you are IN calculus.Chemistry is essential to medical studies as is biology.Assuming you are at a university and not a community college.What science and math did you take beforehand? Those courses do build on one another whereas some courses it does not particularly matter. Could be you simply did not have a proper amount of preparation and have been poorly counseled about what courses you should take instead of getting someone who\u2019s willing to shoot it straight.With fewer than 50% of applicants being accepted into medical school, to be blunt, this does not sound like a good career choice for you.You may do some other manner of healthcare work if the field attracts you. If it is direct patient care\u2014EMT to paramedic might be good. Could potentially go into healthcare administration or such. EMT route is community college which is great news: faster and less expensive. With experience you can then add on to become a paramedic. Healthcare admin could start at a community college but will require at least a bachelor\u2019s so back to overpriced university. You need to have a passion for medicine. You need to have excellent abilities in sciences. Math integrates with science. If those are not areas you are good in, it\u2019s completely unrealistic to believe you\u2019ll be admitted to medical school and are better served by finding a better fit for your abilities. Suggest a visit to the Counseling department to have aptitude testing and possibly some career exploration. If you\u2019re struggling at the pre-med level, med school and residency are not for you. Some PCer will come along and say that\u2019s harsh. However, best to deal with reality because you likely have student loans and unrealistic expectations. Those are not going to get you into med school and will shape many years of your life all so someone can feel good about being \u201cnice.\u201d You don\u2019t need nice, you need honest. You need a better fit before \u201cnice\u201d people BS you into tens of thousands of dollars of unnecessary debt. ",
