            "answer_text": "Hey, I can share with you something which gathered from my friend who is currently pursuing his Master second year at VNIT Nagpur. Now He is in the second year of materials science but his graduate degree was in Mechanical Engineering. I asked him once we had the launch time then he replied that we are in huge competitions in outside perhaps there were more work load as well as if we pursue the master's degree in IITS or NITS . and If we pursue the Master degree in best colleges then there are very few seats were left so we are in large number who qualifies the GATE every year and If IITS and NIT\u2019s welcomes the opportunities of few seats then it would be very difficults for us to get the master degree. Coming to another point he said that in materials science very less course and we can prepare for the other competitive examination like IES/GATE/UPSC etc simultaneously. Coming to job prospective path you can apply only mechanical related jobs if any notification comes through any degree From B.E /B.Tech but if anything specially mentioned you required the materials science in masters then you can apply as the master's degree. I hope it makes sense. Thank you. ",
