            "answer_text": "Science has established that homosexual behavior is found in virtually every species studied. That is not necessarily \u201cgay\u201d. It means vastly different amounts and likely different intents to the behavior as well. Will we ever find a pair of rabbits who are of the same sex and living together in sin\u2026err, living like they were a couple\u2014 beyond doubt, we just have to look hard enough. The Kinsey Institute has some great porcupine gay porn \u2014 err, film of a porcupine that only responds sexually to other males. Can rabbits really be far behind? My foster kid had two male rabbits who were humping all the time. 1,500 animal species practice homosexuality\"To turn the approach on its head: No species has been found in which homosexual behaviour has not been shown to exist, with the exception of species that never have sex at all, such as sea urchins and aphis. Moreover, a part of the animal kingdom is hermaphroditic, truly bisexual. For them, homosexuality is not an issue.\" Kinsey hits all the right spots. ",

I don't think you can necessarily call animals \u201cgay\u201d, but you can say that they exhibit homosexual or bisexual behaviours when it comes to their choice of sexual partners. These two rabbits are very clearly exhibiting some damn fine lesbian behaviour. ",
