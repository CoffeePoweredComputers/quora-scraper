            "answer_text": "Hi there, Disclaimer First: I am one of the founders @ Notion Press Publishing. If you have already written your book, you have a few options. 1. You could approach traditional publishers like Penguin, Harper Collins, Hachette etc. who are all renowned names in traditional publishing, and submit your manuscript for a review. However, traditional publishers get bombarded with hundreds of manuscripts and take a long time to even go through them ( if at all they do ). More often than not, they also reject first time authors such as yourself due to a perceived risk of publishing an unknown name. 2. You could subsequently approach any self-publishing platform similar to Notion Press and work with a team of book experts who will take care of the entire publishing process and bring both the print and eBook version of your book out to the market. In this guided publishing model, you will own 100% of the rights to the book and take home 100% of the profits from book sales. Notion Press has published close to 4000 first time writers so far in the span of 6 years. To know more about how this works you can check out the website link given above. 3. Your third option would be to publish it by yourself by using platforms like Kindle Direct Publishing or Createspace. These are essentially do-it-yourself platforms which would essentially require you to take care of every aspect of publishing ie. cover design, interior formatting, editing etc by yourself. Once you have all these things in place, you can just upload it onto the platform and they will compile it as a book and you can start selling it on online stores. Such platforms are mostly free to use and take a commission from each book\u2019s sale and pay remaining profit as royalty. ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t really need any formal qualifications to be a published author (unless you\u2019re writing an academic text or a self-help book. For fiction, you only need to be a good story teller with an interesting book.) I\u2019ll be talking about traditional publishing (where you approach an established publishing house) a work of fiction. One can self-publish if they like, but I\u2019m not well versed with that. There are pros and cons to self publishing as well as traditional publishing. So make sure to do your research first. Alright so, the steps\u2014  You write a book, duh. You edit it to the best of your abilities. You make sure the plot is well structured and the characters are well-constructed. Also keep an eye out on the genre and the length of your book and research a little. For instance, Contemporary Romance novels are generally 60,000 to 90,000 words in length. Make sure to find out a little about the ideal length for your genre and try not to exceed it too much.  Scope out publishers. Of course, we\u2019d all like to get published by one of the big publishing houses but it\u2019s not that easy. So to be on the safe side, look up some smaller publishing houses too. Check out their websites (don\u2019t trust publishing houses that don\u2019t have a decent and informative website, in my opinion.) See the kind of books they\u2019ve published in the past. Check their ratings, sales and reviews on amazon and goodreads to get some idea of their success. If you\u2019ve written a science-fiction novel, pay attention to their scifi books. How well did they perform in the market? Read a sample on amazon if it\u2019s available to figure out the level of writing this publishing house seeks. Another thing you should try to find out are their marketing strategies. Look up their social media handles. See how they\u2019ve promoted books in the past. Have they held any events? What are their techniques. If the publishing house seems to have a good marketing strategy and has had decent amount of sales for books in your genre, you should consider it.  Next, the procedure. You can find manuscript submission guidelines on the publisher\u2019s website itself. They might differ from publisher to publisher, but usually all of them have similar requirements. They either have an in-built form for manuscript submission or they provide an email. Some of them actually demand physical copies instead of soft-copies. Some of them (usually the big ones) do not accept manuscripts from writers at all. Instead, they demand the author should have a literary agent who pitches the novel first (this is rare in India though.) Basically, read the submission guidelines. It\u2019ll give you all the information.  What you\u2019ll generally have to do is write an email to the publisher. Every publisher has their own requirement but usually you\u2019ll have to write a synopsis for your novel, a summary of the novel and attach a designated number of chapter (3\u20135 usually.) Some publishers directly ask you to send the whole novel. Basically, read the submission guideline carefully and follow it up properly otherwise your email won\u2019t even be read. I won\u2019t get into giving you tips to write that email, I\u2019m not experienced enough. But it\u2019s basically you marketing your own book to the publisher. You must be able to convince them with your synopsis or pitch (which is basically a 30\u201350 word long para that accurately describes what your book is about, that your book is worth reading and that they ought to give it a chance. This is extremely important with big publishing houses who get lots of manuscripts and emails, so they cannot read all of them.  If your book is rejected, you might get an email stating so in a few weeks time from small publishing houses. The big ones might not even reply. The publishers usually mention a time period on their website, stating if you don\u2019t get a response by then, you can assume your book was declined. In case you are accepted, someone from the publishing house will contact you and ask you to send the rest of the manuscript so they can do a close reading of it. Now this doesn\u2019t mean your book has been approved. But it means they are interested, that they found your book marketable and it appears to be well-written. If the rest of your book is as promising as the first few chapters, you\u2019ll probably get a publishing deal. Now publishing houses are very adamant about one thing\u2014if they\u2019re doing a close reading of your manuscript, no other publisher should be doing it. They don\u2019t want to waste their energy on reading your book only to find out you rejected them later for another publisher. So you\u2019re expected to inform them at this point if any other publisher has also shown interest. In the rare occasion that you have more than one publishers interested, you\u2019ll have to make a decision and say no to one. This is why it\u2019s not advised to send your book to too many publishers at the same time, especially if you\u2019re dealing with larger publishing houses. Also tip, don\u2019t immediately send out your first email to your number one publisher. Start with a smaller house. In case you get rejected by them, you\u2019ll know you need to work on your book or improve your pitch (you could ask them for feedback/review.) In case you\u2019re accepted, you can either go ahead with them or take a risk and send your work to a bigger publisher.  Big publishing houses usually take six months to read your manuscript closely. Smaller publishing houses might take lesser time. You can inquire from time to time, but don\u2019t pester them with emails. Let them take their time. Unfortunately, you could still get rejected after six months of waiting and then you\u2019ll have to start all over again with other publishers. In case you\u2019re accepted, they\u2019ll offer you a publishing contract. Make sure to read it very carefully. Do your research and don\u2019t be afraid of asking them questions and clarifications. You might be able to negotiate the contract with smaller publishing houses, but don\u2019t even try with the big ones. Once you find everything to your liking, you can sign it and you\u2019ve gotten your contract. But there\u2019s still a lot to be done!  They\u2019ll probably provide you with detail feedback for your novel. They might request you to re-edit your book or make some changes, after which your book will be sent to an in-house publisher who will edit it further and then probably send it back to your for a final look-over. Your work load from here will probably decrease. Since it\u2019s the traditional way, just sit back and relax a little. The publisher will figure out when the book can be launched, they\u2019ll figure out marketing tactics and the cover (they might ask for your input in this but they\u2019re not obliged to.) They\u2019ll even set up your website or Facebook page if you don\u2019t have one.  Once everything is planned and ready, they\u2019ll get ready to launch your book. They\u2019ll hold some promos and marketing events if they have enough resources. You might or might not have to be a part of these events, it depends on their strategy. They might even give out pre-published copies of your book for free to select reviewers to generate discussion around your book in media and to generate reviews on amazon and goodreads to further promote sales. They might hold a book launch event if they\u2019re a big publishing house.  Once your book gets launched, you don\u2019t have to do much. They\u2019ll handle reviews and advertisements. You might be asked to post stuff from time to time or engage with your readers. Once your book generates the decided amount (stated in the contract) through sales, you\u2019ll be eligible to get paid. You might be paid once or twice a year in bulk (this varies from publisher to publisher.) I guess that\u2019s about it! Hope this was helpful. Just make sure to do your research. Don\u2019t get too excited and jump into a publishing deal.  ",

            "answer_text": "Its complicated. You will get various types of publishing processes when you Will come across the web. But I don't want anyone to be in such trouble in which I was. Traditional- Penguin, Roopa, Srishti. These are few publishers which will first ask for your book's summary and few sample chapters and then Will take some months or weeks. Penguin takes 6 months while others take few weeks. And If they will be interested they will ask the whole book from you and then they will review it and tell the final decision l. And its completely free if approved. You even get advance. Self publish- In paperback- Free and paid both are there but truly there is no free option yet. Notion and white falcon are two of such publishing house. They will definitely publish your book If you will choose a paid publishing package. It ranges fron 25k to 1lakh. Ebook self publish- In Indian companies I don't have quite good knowledge but smashwords is the one and easiest way to publish your book for free remember its ebook. You have ro sign up there and fill the required form like synopsis and about the book fillings and your main file and cover page. Within a minute your book will be on web. A better option will be kDP. Its a free service by amazon and a bit liberalized too. Same process as Smashwords but it takes 1 day to be available on web. You can pay a fee to promote your ebook. Print on demand- Again kdp is the option for your book will be at lwleastast od price 5 dollars to you and your reader. Its free but not good for sales. Freeself publish its a website which may help you. Remember it may. So these are some suggestions by me from my personal experiences. My ebook is available in smashwords and Amazon. Since u have gained entry in the premium catalogue of smashwords its available in some more platforms. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, this is one of the most asked questions all around the world. That how can I become an author? How can I publish my own book? No publishing company wants to work with me\u2026\u2026. and so on. The reason why all the publishing company or let say few of them don't want to work with an amateur is that they don\u2019t know the reaction of the readers about that particular author. Similarly, in our Bollywood, you have to work hard to make your place similarly is the literature world. Either you have a great fan following on social media or you are a well-known writer of the century then only the publishing house wants to gamble on you. So, the question is how I can publish my own book without going to a publishing house and the answer for you is to go for self-publishing. Now the case is that you might be the best storyteller in the world and I believe you are. But you can\u2019t be a one-man army, what I want to say is you can\u2019t be your own editor, beta-reader, book cover designer, book interior designer, social media marketer, and so on. Suppose you have finished your manuscript and you know what you have completed it because you love the storyline since it was in your mind you think that the story is believable since you wrote it you think there are no mistake because it\u2019s human nature that we cannot point out our own mistakes. Am I correct? Yup, that is what human nature is. So, first of all, go for the beta-readers, you can find them on Instagram or any other social media platform, or else you can higher them from Fiverr or any other freelancing site. After beta reading you should go for editor, you will find lots of them who are willing to work and can find out the mistake and improve them at the same time. Once you are done with them start looking for someone who can format your book for KDP, Createspace, Lullu. These all are the self-publishing platforms where you can publish your book without any hesitation. Also at the same time ask a graphic designer to design a cover for your book as per the industrial requirement. Hire a social media marketer to do marketting of your book on social media because \u201c\u091c\u094b \u0926\u093f\u0916\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0935\u0939\u0940 \u092c\u093f\u0915\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\" Upload the details on the website on kindle or Createspace or any of the self-publishing platform that you like. Hit publish and you are done. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I have seen many writers aspiring to self-publish their book which is really great to see. But the major drawback I feel is that none of them ever know the true method of self-publishing. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that because, when it comes to self-publishing, the first results which the google would produce are all the vanity publishers, who claim to publish your book by offering some fancy packages (Which aren\u2019t really fancy) and few worthwhile services. PLEASE NOTE, THAT IS NOT THE ENTIRE CONCEPT OF SELF-PUBLISHING! They are what you say the middlemen who\u2019d help you with all the services you require in return for your money and also royalty on every sale! Want to know what is REAL SELF-PUBLISHING? READ ALONG. A self-publishing author or more commonly known as an Indie-Author would finish his manuscript, Find an editor by himself, find a cover artist by himself and then instead of approaching any publishing company he/she would approach the PRINTING PRESS. Any local as well as well-known printing company will offer to print your books at reasonable rates if you order in bulk. I\u2019d say they\u2019d offer you between 500 copies, 1000 or 2000 copies. Print on Demand (POD) would be too costly for you. By far I am guessing that since you are opting for self-publishing your book that means you\u2019d at least have a budget of around 1 lac rupees which is more than enough and which could be easily recovered in the 1st or 2nd month of your book release (If you have good sales, that is if you have a ready made audience or marketing plan). That\u2019s it! Once you make a deal with the printing company. take care of all other requirements such as Typesetting your book and ebook creation (Generally a professional would offer both things hand in hand at a reasonable rate). Next step is to get copyrights which is easy if you just google it and lastly, ISBN number which can be obtained for free as well. And there you go! Get your book printed, start an Amazon seller account, boost your sales through pre-orders and follow your marketing plan lead. Once you have a decent sale on amazon, you can approach the local book stores as well who\u2019d be willing to keep your books as far as it is returnable*. THIS PROCEDURE IS THE REAL WAY OF SELF-PUBLISHING. For some of you it may sound as a lengthy or a tiresome process but trust me if you really believe in your story and the years/months of hard-work which you have done for it, then this approach would be one of the best experience for you and WAY BETTER than those vanity publishers who claim to be NO. 1 publishers. Look at the reality, how many authors have fallen for their traps and almost given up on their writing careers. Things are really different in India when it comes to the publishing industry, so beware, look for the right things, right approach. I\u2019ll soon post an article on my website about this matter. I hope whoever reads this, it helps you and trust in yourself and your story, You can do it (: ",

If you are looking for an Indian company to help with publishing, Self Publishing and Print on Demand in India (free service if you can provide fully formatted content) or Book Publishers in India (paid service) could be considered. Royalties on KDP, the largest marketplace for eBooks vary from 35% to 70% depending on the pricing of the book, the country in which the purchase is made and also based on whether you enroll in KDP Select (where you have to keep your books exclusive to Amazon). Details are available at the link provided above. Royalties on other platforms vary from 30% to 60%. There are no legal issues that I am aware of, other than the fact that income from royalties will be taxable in India.

            "answer_text": "A few years ago, I had an idea for a novel. Well back when I was 16 years old (now I'm 18) I was in Film School back then. I decided to publish it myself and market it myself. I wrote a 70-page marketing strategy involving everything from online advertising to real life advertising, printing books for a minimal cost and selling them to stores. Basically I decided to start my own book publishing house, and run it from my computer/tablet and my brain. I had a well planned to out strategy to make my novel a bestseller. The only problem? I never finished the novel. I couldn't. I became fascinated with screenplays instead and found them to be more interesting then those boring novels with endless descriptions. I became more comfortable with visual storytelling, and spent my time making short films and screenplays instead of novels. But if you manage to finish your novel bro. I'll help you publish it, I'll invest in the printing and the advertising. Not I'm not kidding. It's been my dream to start a book publishing firm. But I can't write a novel myself. I find it amusing that there are ambitious youngsters out there like me. I was often ridiculed, when I was in film school for dreaming to make a feature film before I was 19. Looks like that's gonna come true soon, because I already got the funding and writing a script. You can DM on Quora about your novel. I'm serious. I'll help you publish it bro. ",

            "answer_text": "To Publish a book on your own, you must first get a license for publication.Self-Publishing process involves a number of steps including editing, formatting, cover designing, proofreading etc. So, either you need to hire someone who is expert in this field and then after getting a copy ready, approach a printing press to get it printed under your Imprint. This is basically the gist of Self-Publishing process. However, there are a number of self-publishing agencies that charge you or sell you a package including a few services associated with the processes mentioned above and get your printed. These agencies act as the mediator and this doesn\u2019t make you a self-published author. You get published under a self-publishing company. Might seem confusing but self-publishing actually means getting your published under your own publication house. In India, there are many self-publishing agencies. A few of them charge hefty sums and provide services of book publishing and a few can do it for free but in that case, you\u2019ll have to prepare your book in the print ready format along with the cover. They will do nothing but give it an ISBN and put it on sale under their imprint. You can also get your book published in E-book format and for that, I\u2019d suggest you to opt Amazon Kindle. The platform is easy to use and you won\u2019t have to face much troubles. But for paperback, you can either start your own publication house (Which of course is another BIG deal) or go for any of these middle agents. Caution: Choose your publisher wisely as many of these vanity publishers are the scavengers on hunt. Feel free to drop in for any other query. All The Best! ",

The task of choosing the right publisher therefore is a crucial step in ensuring that your book reaches the reader's platform the right way with the right message. And for that to be possible, you need to be well versed in the various factors and criteria you should be putting your attention to, while choosing the best publisher for your book.Researching publishers is an important step in the entire process to choosing a good publisher for your book - It helps you keep tabs on the requirements, marketing strategies and ethos, book contacting terms and conditions, the various steps to publishing in different publishing companies to be able to calculate on your own the suitability of a particular publisher for your book. The editor's compatibility with the vision of your book, the publisher's track record with similar books, the financial terms and conditions including advance and royalty considerations are important aspects to be examined before settling on a publisher for your book. It is therefore really necessary that you do your homework and research well before deciding on a publisher for your book. 105 Views \u00b7 View Upvoters \u00b7 ",

Unless an idea is worked on it has no value. Finish the book and then send it to publishers and keep sending them till it is accepted. Or hire an agent who will guide you accordingly. You can self publish it but again any Tom dick and harry can self publish it in today\u2019s time, it is your business/money the self publishing company is getting. There is no guarantee that the book will sell. I know a lot of people who have their printed books sitting at home and no one is willing to buy them except friends and family out of courtesy. So finish the book and then seek help from the right people. Seek advice from published authors or people in this business already. Goodluck. ",

            "answer_text": "You can purchase an ISBN either from an organization like Bowker or from a self-publishing company (see How do I obtain an ISBN Number? and How can I get an ISBN number in India? How long does it usually take? Are there any good agencies that will get it done for me?). There is a difference with where you buy your ISBN from. If you buy your ISBN from a self-publishing company, they own the ISBN typically. This means that you can only print your books through them. I caught by this myself, and it forced me to switch ISBNs. It's much cheaper though ($10 US typically).If you buy your ISBN directly from Bowker, you will pay a lot more for it ($250 US). But, you'll have a lot more flexibility with it. You can then take your book to anyone to print -- or to multiple people at the same time.Once you have an ISBN, you can print the book from a self-publishing company. In India, Abhaya Agarwal's company Pothi.com is fantastic. I've had a great experience with them. You can print on demand, so you don't have to pay upfront for large print runs. They can also help you get your book up on websites like Flipkart.com. Within the US, you can use CreateSpace, which will help you get your book up on Amazon. That's it. There's no special legal work or anything like that to go through.

            "answer_text": "There are multiple ways to publish your books. First of all you need to be thorough with your storyline, the first draft & the synopsis of your work. Once, you are done with it. You can start working on approaching traditional publishing houses. You can literally make a list of these houses and approach them to get your book going. It might take some time & can have difficult to reach to their editor\u2019s/reviewer\u2019s desk. So, an alternate way is to do it a self publish way. With the eruption of so many budding authors & development of publication industry in India, there are lot many platforms providing self publishing & print on demand(POD) services that you can approach. Most writers & authors have a hard time working on their novels at the initial stage itself. They are confused as to what proper software or writing tech they can avail in order to craft their drafts into final manuscripts. MS Word has been a great companion for authors in this dire time. However, it does not provide an exposure of how readership might perceive their books. So, VoiceVerso has come up with a 2D curl based book writing & publishing technology(one of it\u2019s kind), wherein writers can interact with their initial book drafts by immersive & interactive book writing canvas. The basic idea for the same can be explored here. It gives you a digital experience of writing & publishing your book that reciprocates the physical handling of a book. This can be an experience for authors & publishing houses to publish their books too. Disclaimer - I am the founder & CEO of Voice Verso ",

There are two ways to get your manuscript published. 1. Get a traditional publishing contract - Make a list of publishers who publish books in the genre you have written, visit their website to learn their submission guidelines, submit your manuscript and other information in the format they require and then wait... Alternatively, you could also pitch your book to literary agents who could then represent your book to publishers. 2. Self publish your book - You could contact a self publishing company like Notion Press to have your book edited, designed and published. Most self publishing companies also offer marketing services. This approach is faster and you could collaborate with our experts to first publish a really good book and grow your reader base. ",

            "answer_text": "Amit, It depends on what you define as \"book publishing\". In my (uneducated) opinion, a book today can have seven incarnations: a. Print book (no surprises here)b. e-Book (pick the format you prefer: kindle/ epub - google play- if they open up for new publisher registrations, Kobo, Newshunt, etc..)c. Audiobookd. Serialized form online- Wattpad, Scriggler, Table, blog posts, etc..e. Serialized form- audio (say through iTunes) - or upload it on Librivox or a similar sitef. Video (narrate it on Youtube!) g. Combination of the above Typically, print books might account for 90% (even 95% of the distribution as the preferred type of publishing), all other forms combined account for the rest.  Depending on the path you choose, you have multiple options. For print and e-book, as others have noted, the courses are quite well known. For the rest: one only has to look up some of the sites I mentioned. Note that I do not have any affiliations with any of the sites mentioned above, I self published my book in print and e. Best wishes in your publishing journey. ",

            "answer_text": "You can self-publish, it is all the rage nowadays. Kindle Direct Publishing might be the best way to do it. It offers great royalty and is quite easy to do once you have editing, formatting and marketing planned out. The drawback is, you will inadvertently spend more money and time on Marketing than you'll do on actually writing your book. Marketing is probably the most difficult part of publishing. Also, you'll have to spend time editing and formatting your book - from the grammar to book cover - you will be responsible for all. I suggest hiring editors and graphical designers for it. You can try Fiverr for that. If you are ready to shell out money, you can try Vanity Publishing Houses, they will take a lot of money from you but will perform all the functions I've mentioned. It can be riskh though, you must choose the Vanity Publishing House with utmost care because there are several ready to rip you off. You can try maybe StoryMirror for it. Traditional Publishing is another route you can take. But it won't be on your own. If you want to have full control over everything regarding your book - go for self-publishing on Kindle. Set your own price, do your own stuff and control the entire process. Hope this was of help. All the best of your book! ",

Though the answer can be quite complicated, there are a number of things you can do to get your book published. I have got my book published on The Write Place and it is the destination for authors to come up with a raw manuscript and see it being converted into a finished book. Not only the prepress services are taken care of, the write place also takes care of design, production, distribution, marketing, logistics and sales at most of the online bookstores in India. I am a story writer, but the write place helped me turn my story into a book. Therefore, I will strongly recommend the write place for aspiring authors for online book publishing to get their stories transformed into a finished book. ",

I have extensive traditional/and self-publishing experience and these pointers may help you make an informed decision. I have dealt with several major self-publishers both in India and overseas. In India, before deciding on any particular publishing company I did some homework. I found Blue Pencil Publishers pretty clued up, prior to actually publishing the translated books. .

You would need to send them some information. A summary of your book, the number of words, the theme, etc and a little bio about yourself. Sometimes they require a few lines on each chapter ",
