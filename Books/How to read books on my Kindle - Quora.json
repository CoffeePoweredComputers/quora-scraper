            "answer_text": "You can purchase books in Kindle version from Amazon. You let your Amazon account know you have a Kindle, then the books will be downloaded to your Kindle. There are also some online sources of free books in e-book format (mostly older stuff, but lots of classics). Getting them into your Kindle isn\u2019t quite as direct, but you can probably figure it out with info from the source sites. I have downloaded them to my computer, then connected my Kindle to the computer via USB. The computer sees the Kindle like an external drive, and you can copy/paste the free books onto the Kindle. ",
