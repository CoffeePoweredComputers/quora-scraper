It\u2019s 650 pages of someone wresting internally with himself. It is SO slow and spends far too much time simply talking in circles. I am the kind to read a book every two weeks or so (I also have a toddler to take care of so I don't spend a lot of time reading), if its something I am really into it can take a few days to a week\u2026.this had taken me almost two months to slog through and I still have 200 pages left! I would highly recommend skipping this one. ",
