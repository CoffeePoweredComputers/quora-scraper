At first glance it looks like they have a great selection, however most of them you will need to pay a fee to watch. I feel it\u2019s a bit deceptive, so I cancelled my Prime subscription. I think you\u2019ll be better off exploring other options, such as Hulu or Netflix. Even VUDU has a wider variety of free movies, way more than Amazon. ",
