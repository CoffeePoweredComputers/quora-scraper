            "answer_text": "He is a legitimate banjo player; it is not just some quirky ongoing joke. He is probably a much better banjo player than he is an actor, but perhaps that's getting off topic. In terms of technical proficiency, there's little evidence that he could be considered a virtuoso or even above average at playing the instrument. The 5-string banjo has become synonymous with the extremely fast styles with which it is regularly paired. When played in the 3-fingered \"Scruggs\" style, even beginner banjo tunes are played as fast as anything Martin has ever recorded, and intermediate tunes already churn through notes faster than most classic rock guitar solos from the likes of Zeppelin or AC/DC. Steve has never shown any aptitude for playing faster than a beginner. Instead, he has two very prominent strengths, as follows: First, creativity. Martin prefers writing his own compositions to playing the work of others. This stands out in the field of banjos, where most musicians and fans prefer to hear and play classic standard tunes. What's important here is not just that he's original, but that he is actually good at being original. Usually if you hear of a new artist who writes their own folk or bluegrass music, it's the calling card of someone too lazy to \"do it right\" and learn the standards. Perhaps it's because he's had a few decades to internalize the standards, but Martin has a rare talent for writing songs that are sentimental, folksy, silly, and classic all at once, allowing him to scape the \"lazy folk songwriter\" trap. Second, versatility. Martin plays in both of the two most prominent ways of playing the banjo, the 3-fingered style and the frailing style. These two ways both have their devotees and are featured in slightly different musical styles. Often great players will master one style and completely neglect the other. Steve uses both. Overall, I think the best word to describe Steve Martin's banjo playing is \"legitimate.\" This seems to answer most people's underlying (and ultimately unfounded) concern that he's just pulling the whool over people's eyes by playing an uncommon instrument. He is every bit a real banjo player. However, it is probably wrong to call him one of the world's best banjo players--he's just one of the only banjo players most people have heard of. In most peoples' minds, being truly great at an instrument is mostly an issue of playing fast and knowing a lot about music in all sorts of genres. Martin falls quite short on those issues, refer instead to players like Bela Fleck, Alison Brown, and Tony Trischka. ",

This might surprise many people, who know him primarily for his acting, comedy and writing.  A few years ago, he established the Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass, which comes with a $50,000 award.  Nominees for the prize are selected by a board that includes other notable banjo players, such as Earl Scruggs, Pete Wernick, Tony Trischka, Bela Fleck and others. ",
