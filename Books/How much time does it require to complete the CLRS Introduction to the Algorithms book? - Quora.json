            "answer_text": "I have ordered the book previously, right after I have studied an algorithm course centered on CLRS. Now, before talking about CLRS, my suggestion will be attend a lecture. There are a lot of mathematical notations. As much as mathematical notations offer clarity, I don\u2019t think they offer intuitions, which is paramount in algorithm design. Indeed, you need to prove an algorithm with clarity. However, without a theory or an inspiration, you can never apply proof techniques. Now, true advice aside. I would say it depends on your level. Forgive me for not having statistics to back my theory. Personally speaking, after studying the course, it still took me some time to understand advanced topics such as red-black tree, amortized algorithm. Sometimes, if mathematical notations do not hit intuition, then it could take up to hours for simply a page of proof. Be mindful, CLRS is a book of proof. TLDR; If intuition doesn\u2019t hit you, you may need hours at worst to even understand a page. That\u2019s the big-oh amount of time I can offer for a page. For the entirety of a book? Gosh, I can\u2019t even phantom without the aid of any experienced teachers. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven't read it yet, just ordered the book couple of days back. I don't think you can put an estimate on how much time it's required to finish the book. It's not a story book or a magazine where you just surf through it and finish it. You have to read the book and understand the concepts. You have to practice each topic and also might have to refer other sources of information. This takes time and it really varies from person to person. ",
