            "answer_text": "Meg could and can be more powerful than Percy. Let\u2019s just have a few categories: Physical Combat: Jason is about the same level of swordsmanship as Percy and Jason was completely awed(and bested) by Meg. Apollo also said that Meg was the best dimacharaeus he had ever seen. So a god, who has seen empires rise and fall, calling you style the best\u2026 Experience: They are both pretty experience. Meg has trained since 4 while Percy has has lot\u2019s of quests. I\u2019ll say they are about the same or Percy is better here. Powers: Powers is hard but I\u2019m inclined to believe that Meg\u2019s powers are just as powerful as that of a child of the big three. Her powers are actually very similar to NIco\u2019s. Death and plants dude. How are they similar? Bear with me but Meg can summon karpoi like Nico reanimates skeletons, Meg can teleport with plants like Nico shadowtravels, Meg manipulates plants like Nico manipulates bones, Meg \u201ccommunicates\u201d with plants like Nico communicates with the dead, etc. Meg\u2019s powers also take about the same amount of energy as Percy\u2019s anyway. Magic Items: They both have their swords but Meg also has her magic seeds so I\u2019ll give Meg the win here. Intelligence: Meg rarely thinks anything through first(except in battle) while Percy occasionaly comes up with a bright idea. ",

            "answer_text": "As far as I remember, Meg is still quite a mistery. She\u2018s younger than Percy in the first books and yet way more powerful and aware of her powers than he was at that age. That said, plus her early missions/training and past with the Triunvirate, I believe she can become as powerful as any daugther of Demeter can ever become. Comparing her to Percy is difficult because she is too young yet and Percy is the son of one of the big three, so you\u2018d naturally believe he\u2018d be more powerful. One thing I noticed tho is that Meg have more control of her nature-related powers than he has, being able to do more than Percy before knocking-out tired. If you want to go deeper in that discussion, Demeter is quite an ignored godess in Riordan\u2018s earlier works, but I recently read that, being an agriculture godess she was one of the most worshipped godesses of Ancient Greece since the people mostly relied on agriculture and their fields to, you know, survive. I believe that, since the god\u2018s powers rely on their worshippers perception of their worth/value/significance in their lives, Demeter would be for most common people what Zeus, Athena, Ares and Poseidon are for the ones who needed their guidance in war, politics, etc. With that in mind I am inclined to believe that Demeter\u2018s children would be as powerful as any of Poseidon\u2018s.

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 No. I think this is a misconception because Percy only uses his full powers a few times, whereas Meg is constantly using what I take to be her full potential. If you remember, Percy is able to hold back hundreds of enemies, summon oceans and oceans of water, breathe underwater, communicate with horses, control water, beat gods in fighting sometimes\u2026 and Meg\u2026 She can fight, sure, but she can\u2019t do any of the above. Her most useful power probably isn\u2019t even a power (not including Peaches and those tree spirits, BTW)-it\u2019s her double-scimitar skills. Plus, Meg is more like Piper, Leo, and Frank. She\u2019s unusually strong for her godly parentage, but still not quite as OP as the big three kids. ",

She\u2019s still young and so struggles with choices that could affect her in a fight. Percy\u2019s like 18 now so he\u2019s pretty much seen and done it all. It doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m pretty biased towards him tho. ",
