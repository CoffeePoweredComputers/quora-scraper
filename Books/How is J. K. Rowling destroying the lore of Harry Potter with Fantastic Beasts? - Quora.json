            "answer_text": "I'm going to go out on a very precarious limb here and say that she isn't, she's building on it. I'm going to say this because: A) I don't for one second believe Credence is Aurelius Dumbledore. I don't know WHO he is, but I think Grindelwald is a very manipulative lying liar who lies, and there is a reason he's telling Credence this and it has something to do with the blood pact. I suspect this, because JK loves red herrings. B) While I must roll my eyes at switching Dumbledore to a DADA instead of Transfiguration Professor, and McGonagall being a teacher in Crimes of Grindelwald when according to Pottermore she hadn't been born yet, I can't say it destroys the lore. They are far to small an issue to destroy the whole thing, and sometimes to build greater worlds you need to change things slightly. I think if the fandom can bear with some minor canon changes we could end up with a great new series, and possibly more after it. But I'm one of the people who love the new Star Wars films and the Star Trek retcon. I'm an eternal optimist. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s mainly down to McGonagall: according to the books, she was teaching for 39 years in 1995, meaning that she started teaching in 1956. That itself is decades after the events of Crimes of Grindelwald. Assuming that she started teaching when she was of an age that would be considered mature, she would have been about 25\u201330. Crimes of Grindelwald was confirmed as taking place in 1927, so really according to the books and her own statement, she would be either a toddler, or growing in her mother\u2019s womb. Aurelius Dumbledore makes no sense either as the timelines and the detailed backstory of Albus Dumbledore in the seventh book makes the existence of any other sibling of the headmaster\u2019s impossible. However one can, at this point at least, write that off as a lie told by an evil megalomaniac to manipulate a vulnerable young man (because why would Grindelwald tell the truth?) The blood oath thing is one other sticking point: after all, how would Dumbledore and Grindelwald duel each other if they had long made a blood oath not to kill each other? Ariana wouldn\u2019t have died if that was the case\u2026 ",
