            "answer_text": "Writing a book and getting it published is a time consuming exercise. You need write to write the book, get it edited, find a publisher, work with the publisher for cover designing , creatives , blurbs etc. If you really want to write and publish a book in a year then break down your work into task lists and timelines.. Give yourself 6 months to compose the best script ever. 1 month to find a publisher (sometimes it takes months ) and the rest of the time to pre-production stuff and creating an advance reader base. It took me 8 months to have my book \u201cThe Lady in the Mirror\u201d published after finding a publisher. But each to his or her own. All the best ! ",

            "answer_text": "Writing a book wouldn't take much time, provided you have your basic story in hand. A rough draft of the book too makes sense. Ideally it takes 6\u20138 months of writing a decent book and another 3\u20134 of publishing. Publishing a book is not the end result, ones your book starts making sales, is the time when the process is considered complete. If you are an amateur writer, Writing Challenge | Writers' Block For Beginners | Writers the mentioned blogs would be of great help to you. Steps to overcome them too have been mention.
