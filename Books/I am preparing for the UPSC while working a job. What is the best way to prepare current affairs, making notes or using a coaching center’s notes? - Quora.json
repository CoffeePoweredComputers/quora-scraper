            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. To begin with, please accept my congratulations for your decision to pursue the preparation along with a job. It was something I did not have the courage to do. As mentioned in the question description, current affairs, henceforth CA, has become imperative and all the more important to CSE. And rightly so, given that as a District Collector you must be aware of the clauses of Ujjwala Yojana, for instance, to rightly identify the beneficiary. Following would be the minimum resources that one HAS to cover. No escape. Newspaper: the Hindu or Indian Express.Vision IAS monthly CA bookletPRS legislature Monthly Policy ReviewAIR news update. Spotlight and Weekly CA. Download the app SoundCloud. It gives you a notification for every new broadcast by AIR. The discussions as also available on Vision IAS website.In addition to these, I would recommend the following if time permits. However, I must mention that the time spent on the below resources should be limited. PIB updates. You can subscribe to them and receive them directly in your inboxChronicles Magazines. The Science and Tech section is comprehensive but mostly covered in Vision bookletRSTV debates. Recommended when you want to unwind. Helps to develop a balanced view on any topic.Livemint. Good articles. Primarily for GS III.Given the comprehensive list, I would advice to make notes from newspaper, preferably in shorthand. Cutting clips from newspaper is the worst thing you can do. Be assured, you will remember nothing. Make notes from the top mentioned 4 and keep bookmarks, shorthands of the immediate above resources. I must also mention that given the trend from past two years, the commission has a tendency to NOT directly put words in your mouth but want to hear it from you. For ex, in GS II paper 2016 there were two questions on surgical strikes, treatment to be rendered to security forces, and related issues of border security. now here they did not ask specifically about the tension building up at the Indo-Pak border but if you're well updated with the CA, you are informed enough to mention of Uri attack, Pathankot airbase incursion. Writing such facts, I believe, would render credibility to your answer. Facts prove that you're not pulling a bluff. And facts will strike you only when you make notes or do answer writing. Hence, CA is the MOST critical part of your preparation. Try to develop a penchant for reading. And most importantly, look up the terms you do not understand and gain a background of topics you're not aware of and pen them down in your notes. To give you an example, import cover was a term frequently mentioned in The Hindu. It was only that after I looked up the meaning of the term did I come to know what it meant. And the question did feature in the Prelims. Be inquistive and trust me you will enjoy it. Best of luck. ",
