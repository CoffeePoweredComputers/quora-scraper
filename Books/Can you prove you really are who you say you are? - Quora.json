Now I'm older, I've done some good things in life, but also some inappropriate things. I no longer regret the past, nor wish to shut the door on it. I'm a good person that will entertain a liar instead of hurting him by calling him a liar to his face. Ii help people in need when I have the ability to do so. I also judge other people only to the degree of whether I should keep company with them and I treat people with all the respect and kindness I have. Even when I have had to get people to back off by telling them not to mistake kindness for weakness. I consider myself sweethearted, but tough fisted. ",

You can instead say I am more like everbody and everthing than I am like myself. There is no proof that I am myself. My DNA shortens everytime I grow. What was once my original DNA is now a part of the original DNA. My harmones are not what they used to be. I used to be able to digest milk (lactose) as a kid, now as an adult I have lost that ability. I am not who you think I am, but it does not bother me. I dont think myself as a person. I am a combination of chemical reactions. I am subjective. ",

You\u2019ll always get the same hash from the same data set. So in order to prove it you\u2019d just let the other person sample your DNA from several random places on your body and they could hash it to get your ID number. It\u2019d be hard to steal someone\u2019s DNA and put it in those random spots for it to be sampled. You\u2019d have to change the DNA of a ton of cells in your body which is hard to do and maybe is even impossible. You then connect the hash to any other data in a secured database for that specific service. ",
