            "answer_text": "Here are some classic novels from the 19th century (in order of publication) that I believe have staying power: Pride and Prejudice (1813) by Jane Austen \u2014 a breakthrough in romance fiction that continues to inspire artists more than 200 years later.Jane Eyre (1847) by Charlotte Bront\u00eb \u2014 a deep dive into the first person inner life of a heroine. Bront\u00eb writes with the sublime realism of human egotism against a background of real history.Notes From Underground (1864) by Fyodor Dostoevsky \u2014 a first in the brutal honesty of blunt realism.Far From the Madding Crowd (1874) by Thomas Hardy \u2014 a long-term portrait of a complex love story featuring an independent woman.Anna Karenina (1877) by Leo Tolstoy \u2014 a first in multiple, complex romantic relationships including the defiance of social approval in pursuit of love.The Time Machine (1895) H.G. Wells \u2014 a science fiction theme that is still imitated 125 years later, with no end in sight.",

            "answer_text": "Oddly, yes. Many of the early nineteenth-century novels turned on the question of individual reputation, meaning that even a whisper of scandal, impropriety, or bad behavior could result in the ruination of an individual\u2019s personal reputation and character, whether the actual bad behavior had actually taken place or not. Vindictive rumor, twisted reportage of past events, false claims that could not be disproven, only disputed, were cause for many a character\u2019s anxiety and often the undertaking of drastic and sometimes genuinely ruinous measures. From Jane Austen through the Brontes, George Meredith, George Meredith, Thackeray, Trollop, Flaubert, Stendhal, Tolstoi, Charles Dickens, William Dean Howells, Mark Twain, Harold Frederick, Theodore Dreiser, and on and on, hundreds of novels turned on this very point. Today, we see the concerted attempt to ruin individuals, particularly those who have either power and money or celebrity and fame, as well. Some charges levied are certainly genuine; some, though, are merely assertions, allegations, impossible to prove and outside the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution. In many cases, the victim of such vindictive and often unwarranted actions was vindicated, although the alleged offense actually may have occurred, at least in point of fact. Today, though, vindication is rare; more often, ruination is the result. Some might say that we have lost our moral compass. There is a difference between guilt and regret and suppressed injury and serious and lasting scars. We\u2019ve not discovered where that border lies. ",

            "answer_text": "Many of them are, very much so. A novel deals with human nature\u2014characters are built on the observations of the authors. Many of them remain relevant even though they are rife with outdated cultural stereotypes, because in spite of all our \u201cprogress\u201d, many of those stereotypes rear their ugly heads today. Many of them are relevant because from them we can get a true picture of what people were like and how the society was in that day and age that we cannot get from modern \u201chistorical novels\u201d because writers of the latter simply do not have the same mindset as the writers of the time. And many of them are simply beautiful to read. ",
