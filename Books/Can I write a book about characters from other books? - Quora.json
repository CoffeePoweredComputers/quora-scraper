            "answer_text": "How old are these books? Because here\u2019s the problem. If the books are out of copyright, you can do anything you want. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies? It\u2019s been done. If the books are still copyrighted, you need a contract with the right holders if you want to publish and make money off it. Or, you can write it and share it on a fanfiction website, like Archive of Our Own or FanFiction, but definitely without earnings. Double check your nation\u2019s rules, though - Netflix got in trouble because they thought Sherlock Holmes was public domain\u2026and in many places he is, and even in USA (mostly), but his latest stories aren\u2019t, so they got sued for using \u201ccharacter development\u201d from these stories.

Not sure if that makes a difference. There are numerous James Bond and Sherlock Holmes books by other authors. You may need permission from the estate to write in the style of the original rather than to use them as incidental characters. ",
