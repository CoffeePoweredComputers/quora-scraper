            "answer_text": "First of all, it all depends on three factors: Grasping level: If, according to your past performance, you think you have a good grasp over new concepts then you may give both groups together. However, since the IPCC Syllabus is very vast which encompasses lots of new subjects as well as new topics that ,in turn, comprise of unique jargon and whatnot, you must honestly assess whether you have this quality or not.Confidence: The second sphere that you need to look into is weather you have the required confidence that you can and will pass both the groups together. The CA Course puts your mind to test in many ways other than intellect and understanding, which includes, among other things, your self-confidence and motivation levels.Capacity to sit for longer hours: The CA Course inherently requires a student to commit religiously to the curriculum and requires an unconditional willpower to sit for longer hour. A typical student attempting both groups at IPCC level need atleast 13\u201314 hrs of studies in the last 2 months.At the end I would like to say that you are your own judge. Using the above guidelines you can assess your own qualities and downfalls. In the end it is your own decision, commitment and will power that will make you successful. Note: This answer is not intended to demoralise or demean any individual by saying he/she is not competent. This is more about taking a feasible option to ensure success. ",
