            "answer_text": "The best way to combat book piracy is to never release the PDF files from which they are printed. Once these files are sent to the Copyright Office or to the Library of Congress, for example, they are available for FREE upon request by anyone. We can thank the Freedom of Information Act for this government-sanctioned release of our long, hard, private work, rather than protecting it. Send print copies, instead. Few pirates want to go to the trouble of paying for individual page copies or scanned pages of these books from government agencies . However, traditionally-published books also are pirated. There is no sure bet. Getting priated copies taken down largely requires the time-consuming, costly effort of professionals assigned exclusively to this task. It is virtually impossible to deal with this myriad of pirates. Sites offering \u201cfree\u201d merchandise often are quite popular. \u201cFree\u201d merchandise generates traffic, which improves site rankings. The owner actually pays the price, with potential loss of sales/royalties. However, a click on these offerings may be malware bait for the person in search of \u201cfreebies\u201d. I hope this answers your question. Best wishes. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s very little you can do about it. Sure, you can threaten them with taking legal action, but very few people have the time or the cash to chase down every website or pirate that\u2019s going to offer your book for free. - The major movie studios have tried that and haven\u2019t had any success doing it. The thing you\u2019ve got to keep in mind is that anyone that\u2019s going to rob a copy of your book from an illegal site, was never going to pay for your work, or anyone\u2019s for that matter. (That\u2019s why they hang out on pirate sites.) - So they\u2019re the worst fans you can have. If they\u2019re not willing to support you and your craft, they\u2019re not worth a minute of your time. Focus instead on the people who do support you, and focus all you time and effort there. Anything else is going to rob time that you could be focusing on your business. - I know this only too well, after having some of my digital training courses robbed and sent to every corner of the Internet.
