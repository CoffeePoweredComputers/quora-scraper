            "answer_text": "I had the same question when I first started reading comics; really, it\u2019s a question that everyone has, and it\u2019s often something that deters people from ever starting. The universes of DC and Marvel are so huge that it makes people worried that they will have to read multiple series\u2019 beforehand to understand anything. Of course, recent series\u2019 will reference older ones, but everyone has to start somewhere - it\u2019s a natural process. I would recommend finding the right series with minimal lead-up, and use that as a gateway/entrance to the entire, unique, beautiful universe. For many series\u2019, there is such a thing as \u201cReading Orders\u201d. And, while these are extremely useful for reading up to a massive event, they can often feel like homework, which is why I personally keep my use of reading orders to a minimum. With that said, I cannot stress how much I believe Batman: Hush is the best story for anyone that wants to start reading Batman. It\u2019s as if it was designed for first-time readers.  It introduces you to: Reoccurring Batman villainsBatman\u2019s morals/beliefsBatman\u2019s romantic relationshipsBatman\u2019s friends and alliesAnd Batman\u2019s personal problems/quirksWhat more could you want? Not only this, but it is seriously one of the best comics I\u2019ve ever read. Action, mystery, and more. Try not to get spoiled, like I did, but none the less I enjoyed it thoroughly. On the Marvel side, I really enjoyed Thor: God of Thunder.  Much longer than Batman: Hush, this series is great for diving into the more fantasy-based elements of the Marvel universe (as in Asgard/Other realms). I don\u2019t remember having to read anything beforehand or even google anything during, so I would say this is a good jumping on point. Even better than that, House of X and Powers of X are really great series\u2019 that concluded recently. Lot\u2019s of people say you don\u2019t need to read anything beforehand - which I didn\u2019t. According to Wikipedia, it redefines \u201cX-Men as a brand and its place in the Marvel Universe\u201d, meaning now is the best time of any to jump into X-men story lines. (Beware, though, that these series\u2019 are trippy, featuring time travel and jumping between points in time. This increases suspension of disbelief, but can be confusing if you\u2019re not paying attention. Also: read the info pages!)   Of course, these are merely my recommendations. In a perfect world you can jump into any series you\u2019d like, but that can often lead to confusion, and then deter readers. In the end, find a series you like, stick with it, make sure you understand a fair amount, and most importantly: have fun. That\u2019s what comic books are all about. ",

            "answer_text": "Your inquiry is a good one. But that isn\u2019t the same as just the right question. If you hang around the comic book shop, you\u2019ll get as many opinions as you could wish for. The problem will be that you\u2019ll likely get mainly get recommendations for current series of comic characters. To confuse the issue, many times the current series for any given character, or storyline, is today\u2019s version of something that goes way back, often decades. Characters have had any number of \u2018reboots\u2019, where the basics of the story have been endlessly changed. If a run of a particular character is good, then that\u2019s often a short-term thing; sometimes, it\u2019s a product of some team of writer and artist. Then when it\u2019s over, the storyline may end there, or will simply take a different direction. For people that enjoy comics in the most usual ways, it would hardly matter where you started. You may just pick up a variety of comics that catch your eye. If the content interests you, go out and purchase the \u2018back issues\u2019, to see how the story got to the current point. For the less usual comic aficionado, the kind that\u2019s a tough critic, nothing less than the history of comics will do. These are the \u2018fans\u2019 that simply have to know how Spider-Man and The Flash started out. But that history of the comic medium is often a drag for those that simply want enjoyment. Of course, we\u2019re assuming here, the basic super-hero comic here. On that note, it\u2019s just a matter of personal taste- for most, The Incredible Hulk isn\u2019t \u2018better\u2019 or \u2018worse\u2019 than Batman. Just appeals to different people. What I would not waste money on is anything based on a movie or television show. (\u2018Tie-in\u2019 merchandise) These are boring rehashes, of what people already got. It\u2019s just using the character as a brand name. Decent comics are all about someone trying to do the best job they can, by taking the art in their personal direction- that\u2019s what new comics should be about. I would also avoid blowing a wad of cash on some old \u2018collectible\u2019 comics. Usually, it\u2019s a poor investment. However, there isn\u2019t anything wrong really, with purchasing reprinted collections, of past comic runs that you may enjoy. ",
