            "answer_text": "For traditional you drop a chapter or two at their website and wait for them to reach out to you. Different publishers have different policy, read them at their websites. For independent you can go look-up at what fits you the best. I suggest Smashwords or KDP. Read through their policy and guidelines to see which fits you the best then it's all simple all you got to do is upload your cover, MS, fill in the necessary fields, enter keywords and hit publish and wait for some hours for your book to be available at their websites. There are third kind where you pay to publish your book and they will publish anything for some money. I don't recommend it but there are plenty out there if you want to go that way. P.S it's kinda expensive. Research around to see what fits you and good luck on your book. ",
