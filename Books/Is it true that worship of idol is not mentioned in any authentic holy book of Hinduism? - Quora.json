            "answer_text": "The answer to your question depends on what ' holy book\u2019 means in Hinduism. Unlike the Abrahamic religions, there is no one book that is regarded as holy. Again the concept of ' holiness' has a different connotation in Hinduism. Rather than the emphasis on holiness , the overriding concept in Hinduism is purity vs pollution. Everything in Hinduism is a projection of the Divine Brahman and is therefore holy.' Holy book' in taken to mean as divinely authorative in Abrahamic religions. Such authoritativeness is alien to Hinduism. The reason is Hinduism has no particular origin in time and space. To say this in plain English, you cannot pinpoint a particular geographical location or a a time in history. Please note the use of the word ' particular' .Though Hinduism developed in the area around the Sindh river of Pakistan around 1700 BCE, the deities, religious concepts , mythologies, and the practices of Hinduism show origin outside Sindh and the time frame of 1200 - 1000 BCE. Scholarly evidence shows affinity with several races belonging to Aryan races which originated outside the Sindh area.Hinduism refers to its ' Holy Books' by the name Vedas. Vedas is an omnibus term. It means different depending on the context. Since everything is holy, Hinduism is very liberal in according exalted state of holiness to most writings without difference between secular and religious. Therefore, they call scientific or linguistic treatises or commentaries on religious texts as Vedas. This will be confusing to a non-hindu. The closest anology is calling the Bible and the writings of Martin Luther as biblical. Or like calling the Quran and the Sahih- al-Bukhari as Quranic.By and large, the term Vedas refer to the four Vedas Viz. Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atherva. The divisions of the Vedas are Samhitas, Brahmanas Aryankas and Vedantas, composed over varying periods. The Samhitas are the oldest and the Vedantas are the latest . This observation is again to be qualified because some Vedantas are far older than the Brahmanas of other Vedas. different divisions . The latest of the Vedantas were composed as late as 500 BCE while the oldest Rig Samhitas were composed as early as 1200\u20131000 BCE .The short answer to your question is that there was no idol worship as we generally understand , during the samhita period of the oldest Rig Veda. The reason is the worship consisted of animal sacrifice and the burning of the sacrificial animal was believed to take the offering and the prayers to the Divine, fire being the Agent. Hence the exalted position to fire which was elevated as Agni, one of the supreme deities..For the subsequent periods of the four Vedas, it cannot be said with certainty that there was no idol worship. Certain objects were substituted for the actuals in the sacrificies due to passage of time and ,changes in procedures.",

            "answer_text": " The question should have made it clear as to which authentication they talk of. Starting with vedas followed by purans and then agamas are prominent ones. However there are others too as like upavedas , upanishads and epics followed by samhitas by many sages. All these are considered authentic sources in hindu culture. Lets dig in to vedas first. They are full of hymns devoted for fire rituals dealing with wellfare of king and his people. Among the four vedas , yajurveda is one which belongs purely to rituals. It deals with shanti mantras, mantras for ashvmedha yagya and many others. This is why majority of hymns for worship have been picked directly from it. There is a particular hymn in yajurveda which says Na tasya pratima yasya nam mahdisha| Hiranygarbha itsesha ma ma hisith itsesha yasmanjatah itesha|| This means that there is no idol of one the mahadeva who has been refered to by hymns of hiranygarbha, ma ma hisith, and yasman jatah. This hints there were idols for others and these must have been used for worship too. However the mahadeva was not idolised by worshipped via formless worship. An act still persistent in shaivism where linga represents the sakal and nishkala form. The purans are also filled with examples of idol worship. Lets take rukmini haranam from srimad bhagvatam. It says The bride protected by guards left the inner palace and went to the temple of Ambik\u00e2. Going there on foot to see the lotus petal feet of Bhav\u00e2n\u00ee, ( canto 10, chapter 53) Also , the agni puran is filled with description of how to make idol for different dietis like durga, rama etc. Even the buddha idol popular has its mention as to how it should be. Then we have chandi mahatmayam speaking of surath and vaishya worshipping earthen idol of goddess durga on banks of ganga. These are on tips examples. There are many more. As far as agamas are considered. Asking them about idol worship is like asking sum for brightness. They mainly deal with rules of temple and idol worship. Thus we see that agama nigama and itihasa , all provide us with evidrnce of idol wprship. Thus is the question answered. ",
