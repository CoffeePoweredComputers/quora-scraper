            "answer_text": "Yes, in fact they definitely would have different ISBNs. Each publication has its own ISBN. This means two different printings of the same book have different ISBNs, two different publishers publishing the same book have different ISBNs, and different editions of the same book have different ISBNs. Different forms of a book have different ISBNs (ie Paperback, hardcover, and electronic versions of the same identical book by the same publisher each have their own ISBNs, as do deluxe versions, leather bound versions, large print, Braille, etc.).

            "answer_text": "Each book is issued with a unique ISBN which should result in the second of the two publishers using the same ISBN as the first once after they have obtained the right to publish the book. A different ISBN is assigned to different formats of the same book i.e. hardback, paperback and ebook will each have their own unique ISBN. That said, human error can creep in and there are different books out there that have the same ISBN. Once detected the second book to be published should be issued with a revised ISBN to correct the error. ",

            "answer_text": "Not only \u201ccan\u201d you, but yes, you must. Different versions (different trim sizes, different bindings, like the difference between hardcover and paperback) must have differing ISBNs, whether they are published by the same publisher or different publishers. Additionally, as another answer advised, different publishers have different ISBN identifiers. For example, you want to print the exact same book, once in paperback at Amazon, once at Ingram in hardcover. Same trim size (let\u2019s say 5\u2033 x 8\u2033). You could and would use the exact same PDF\u2014but you\u2019d change the ISBN on the copyright page for the interior and you\u2019d change the ISBN in the barcode on the cover. So, in short: yes. ",
