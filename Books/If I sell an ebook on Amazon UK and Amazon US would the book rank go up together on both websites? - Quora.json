I sell well in both the US and UK. I only have 1 version of the books. Choose to either use UK words and spelling, or US words and spelling, based on who the characters are, and stick to it. Release worldwide. Ranks on each site depend on the sales on that site. So you can get wildly different ranks from site to site, depending on how well you sell there. Some people find they sell well in a single market, and have real trouble getting any traction in the other markets. Others sell well everywhere, but because the markets are different sizes, the ranks vary a lot. You have no control over the rank mechanism. Just submit the book for worldwide distribution, and then market according to where you think needs a boost. ",
