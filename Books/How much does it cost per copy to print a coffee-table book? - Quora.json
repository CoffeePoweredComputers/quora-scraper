            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you are also looking at coated 70# paper and paper over board or hardcover with dust jacket? Domestically, my guess would be in the neighborhood of $1.75-2.25 per unit, including freight. We recently did some paper over board hardcovers that ended up costing about $2/unit at only 7,000 copies, though not quite as large as you are looking at. Still, I would think that you could find a comparable price with such a large run. At 25,000 units you would likely be maxing out domestic commercial pricing other than a few printers who specialize in 50,000+ units. For a run so large, stay away from Lightning Source of any digital printer. They will have the worst pricing for a job like this. If you\u2019re serious, I would start with Taylor in Dallas. You\u2019d be amazed at their domestic pricing and you are supporting real American labor instead of overworked children! ",
