            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. An antagonist is the one that\u2019s the story counterpart of the protagonist, so they can\u2019t be the same person. Villain What can be done is that the protagonist is the villain, the bad guy. Some stories will actually tell you from the very beginning that the protagonist is a bad guy. Heists are often those kind of stories, as the protagonist actually robs people. That technically makes him a bad guy, no matter how much you justify his actions - although he will be more sympathetic if the heist is done at a company that robs other people. Dexter, the serial killer from the TV series might classify as a villain, but I\u2019d rather brand him an anti-hero. After all, he only kills bad guys when he feels he has to kill someone. He can\u2019t help killing people, so he goes after the people who deserve it - in his eyes at least, as he does have a sense of justice. In that sense he\u2019s no different from The Punisher or even Venom. There have also been stories where at the end it\u2019s revealed that the protagonist you\u2019ve been following throughout the story turned out to be the villain. Exception The only exception I can think of is when you\u2019re writing a story about a protagonist with a Multiple Personality Disorder. That way your protagonist and antagonist occupy the same body, although they\u2019re different people. I hope that answered your question. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say no. Because of the meaning of antagonist but in real life that\u2019s how it is for EVERYONE. Though I believe that maybe you can create this situation with a protagonist with DID (or MID). And you can create a protagonist/antagonist that is (kind of) the same person. Or you could just do it with clones or you know evil future self from a different timeline or some shit like that. ",

Dexter was a serial killer, but he was \u201cprogrammed\u201d by his adoptive father to kill only other serial killers. So, he was the hero killing the dragons\u2026 \u2026but he was also still a dragon! And, while I don\u2019t want to spoil it for you if you haven\u2019t watched it, I think most people who were into the show knew that it wouldn\u2019t end well for him or those close to him\u2026 \u2026and it didn\u2019t!
