            "answer_text": "For simplicity you want to arrange the books in height order shortest to tallest and not jammed too tight together. If there are not enough to fill the length then use bookends and space those evenly in from each end of the shelf and place books between them as above. More complex would be to do as above but arrange them by category as well e.g. gardening, DIY etc . ",
