            "answer_text": "Aberforth certainly knew about Dumbledore\u2019s army since this is their hideaway/secret entrance. He probably got all the information needed from Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley and perhaps a little bit from his brother Albus Dumbledore. When Harry needed help escaping Malfoy Manor, Aberforth Dumbledore sent Dobby to apparate them out of there: ... the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of brightest blue - Dumbledore\u2019s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. \u201cHelp us!\u201d he yelled at it in mad desperation. \u201cWe\u2019re in the cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us!\u201d The eye blinked and was gone.(Deathly Hallows, Chapter 23, \"Malfoy Manor\") Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come. Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.(Deathly Hallows, Chapter 24, \"The Wandmaker\") He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue. \u201cIt\u2019s your eye I\u2019ve been seeing in the mirror.\u201d There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other. \u201cYou sent Dobby.\u201d The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. (Deathly Hallows, Chapter 28, \"The Missing Mirror\") So, when Harry begged for help, how did he know to send specifically Dobby? Why Dobby?Dobby is a FREE house elf. Something very rare. The other one known is Winky but even if she is in condition to help, she has plenty of reasons to dislike Harry and will most probably refuse to do so. Dobby, on the other side likes, Harry a lot. All other house elves in Hogwarts hold their allegiance to Snape who is the enemy at the moment. Kreacher would be a good option too but most probably he is out of reach for Aberforth.Dobby used to work in Malfoy Manor so he knows his way around.How did Aberforth know about Dobby?Most probably Albus told him. A house elf on salary is a very rare thing so it is plausible that Albus shared that with his brother. Another option is that he knew it from Neville (no cannon source that Neville and Dobby knew each other though).2. How did Aberforth contact Dobby? By just calling him? Remember how Dobby came along with Kreacher when Harry called him (Kreacher) to ask him to follow Draco Malfoy? So it is possible that a house elf might come to aid when called if he wants to.",

            "answer_text": "I assume Aberforth Dumbledore was quite informant on the doings of Harry Potter, throughout his quests, through local gossip and informants (pictures on walls?). Since a part of Sirius\u2019s mirror was with Aberforth, he knew quite a lot of everything they knew. Then when they were stuck in Malfoy Manor, Aberforth knew about it, and arranged to have them escape. The reason he sent Dobby to Malfoy Manor, was to save them, and Dobby being a house elf can apparate anywhere, he would have the most likely chance of saving them and getting away. We also have to remember that though Aberforth is probably a powerful wizard being a Dumbledore, he is not nearly as close in ability to his over-performing elder brother, and would most likely have gotten killed if he attempted a rescue mission. We can\u2019t forget the fact that he is also old as well. ",
