            "answer_text": "Cognitive psychologists and Neurologists have probably worked out a speed of intake/uptake in this area. That being said, the answers here are rather just opinions than technical facts. For example, pilots versus your average joes, probably have a better uptake of visual data than most. Pilots need to sort out more incoming visual data than a person not flying, and a Military and commercial pilot need to sort out a lot more incoming data. There was a commercial advert in the last 5 years in the States, which had a audio commentary, a text commentary, and a butterfly moving around on the text. The advert was for Pilots in the Military, and the gist of what they were saying is that if you could not sort out the three layers, you were probably not suited to the Military pilot task.I used to know someone who read a 400-600 page book in 2-3 hours. She was quite a phenomenon, since her recall was like a regular reader. She did not read like some speed readers where they place their hand under blocks of text as they go, and read like that ( a common speed reading technique). Anyway, that kind of speed reading, both my friend, and the \"block of text\" style, suited those people. If it does not suit you, find your own reading speed and stick with that, since , to paraphrase Ian Gilan, no matter how fast you read, there is always someone faster, no matter how slow you read, there is always someone slower. At any rate, if AI keeps on developing, the possibility of an implant in your eye to allow faster reading or \"data input\" may very well become an actuality, but just how enjoyable that is with a nicely printed page, is rather debateable, after all, how fast do we experience things, and do we want some things to go faster, or sometimes to have things slow down so we can drink in the experience. It might work well with technical books to read super fast, but a delicious historical romance? Do we really want to read books we enjoy at a super fast rate? ",

            "answer_text": "Reading speed varies from person to person, and for a lot of different reasons. Like a lot of other things that some are slower, faster, or average, the numbers tend to fall out in a Bell Curve (big heap in the middle, fewer outliers). \u201cIf top readers read at speeds of above 1000 words per minute (wpm) with near 85% comprehension, they only represent 1% of readers. Average readers are the majority and only reach around 200 wpm with a typical comprehension of 60%.\u201d There\u2019s a website Speed Reading Test Online where you can self-check on how fast you read that uses these numbers as their introduction. The common measure here is not in pages per minute, as pages come in very different sizes and density, but words per minute (wpm). Of course, comprehension (and retention of the ideas you\u2019re reading) are as important as how quickly you get from page to page. There are a number of websites teaching speed reading, with comprehension as an important part, even if they start with sprints where you don\u2019t worry as much about comprehension as getting through material quickly. This reminds me of when I decided to take my typing up a notch, and would do a series of five minute drills; four for perfection and one for utter bang-it-out speed: the methods work. I like the various methods informally introduced and compared over at The Truth About Speed Reading on the LifeHacker website. ",
