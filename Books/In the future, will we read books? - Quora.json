            "answer_text": "We will. As long as \u2018we\u2019 remain biological consciousnesses, we will be reading books. The modes of reading will change, as is inevitable. More and more we will read books in digital formats, but for a long time the paper copies \u2014 hardcover and paperback \u2014 will remain, if only as collectors\u2019 items, objects to be possessed. That said, the process of reading as we understand today might one day change (hundred years ago the idea of audio-books would have seemed absurd, and today we do not just read a book as we traditionally have but we listen to it, which is also reading), if we, as a species, undergo major transhumanist changes and our biological/neuronal consciousnesses become ontologically entangled with non-biological structures and/or substrates; in such a situation, the entire notion of reading will change. But for a long time to come, though, we will be reading books, in one form or the other. ",
