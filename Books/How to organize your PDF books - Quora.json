            "answer_text": "Get an Evernote paid account and you can upload up to 200mb per note. This will cover most text only books and many short and mid length books with graphics. For PDF's larger than 200mb, you will have to split them. Once in Evernote you can annotate, flag, and add notes to your hearts content and you will be completely platform independent. I do this with Android and Windows, but it will work the same with iOS and Mac.  A great part of doing this in Evernote is the whole text will be searchable from within EN so you will not even have to remember what book you saw something in to find it. ",
