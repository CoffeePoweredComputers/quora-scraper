            "answer_text": "No, it cannot. What you are essentially asking is if a self-published author can replicate the work and put in the same amount of time on a product as a large mainstream company can. From a purely idealistic standpoint, sure, this is a possibility in terms of mechanics. From a more realistic standpoint, no, a single person is not going to be able to manage all of the aspects of marketing, distribution channels, and finance that a large company is capable of. Now, people are probably thinking it is possible to sell the same number of books at a large publisher through a print-on demand service. Well, those print-on-demand services like Kindle Direct Publishing, Ingram Spark, and Lulu Press are in fact large publishers. They are essentially large scale book packagers / publishing companies. So anyone who publishes with them, even under the title of self-published author or independent publisher IS using a large publishing company to sell their books. Try imagining yourself dealing directly with the printers, vendors, distributions, books stores, online stores, shipping services, orders and payments, accounting and book-keeping, returns, marketing schemes, advertisements, and warehousing yourself. That is what a real self-publisher does. Self-published books these days are rarely actually self-published. I can probably count on one hand the amount of authors who are truly in a realistic sense self-published. And no, they do not sell as many books as a large publisher is capable of. It basically comes down to muscle, and a single individual behind a self-published book is never going to match the likes of Penguin Books or Hachette Livre. That\u2019s just a fantasy. Do most of the \u201cself-publishers\u201d today even know what happens to their books after that manuscript is sent off to some online service for POD service? No, not a clue. They just know that if they order their books from a POD, it arrives in the mail at the expected date. For example, if I set up Lulu account for a client and they order their books, those books usually come directly from some anonymous printing company in New Jersey (in this part of the country). How did your electronic manuscript end up in the hands of some printer in Jersey after you sent it to Lulu? What deal does that printer have going on with UPS or Fedex to deliver your books to customers? How is money collected and accounted for by these separate entities? These are things an actual publishers should know. We use the term \u201cself-published\u201d today like we used to use the term \u201cdoor -to-door\u201d salesmen back in the day when grandma and grandpa used to get a knock on their door and there would be some \u201cindependent businessman\u201d standing outside making commissions on these products that they choose to waste their lives selling on the road. The mechanics of it has changed a little, though. Door-to-door salesmen sold other people\u2019s product for the lesser share in profits. Self-published authors sell their own product for a greater share (and sometimes that isn\u2019t even true). And unlike the companies that used to enlist the aid of independent salesmen, if you don\u2019t make a profit, it\u2019s all on you, not the companies who now make their money on production (the cost of producing each book) rather than how many customers buy your book. So what can we take away from this: 1] Real self-publishers who handle every aspect of their books\u2019 production can never match the manpower, money, and reach of a large publisher; and can never sell as many books without help from a large company even if they wanted to. 2] Faux self-publishers are a bit delusional about just how much \u201cself\u201d in really involved in the publishing they do. Probably because they aren\u2019t old enough to remember what it was like self-publishing back in the 80s and 90s like us old-timers. Oh, how the internet makes us believe we are actually working hard for our money these days! 3] Large publishers and POD companies are passing themselves off as direct to print companies to give clients the ability to fool themselves into thinking they are actually self-publishing when in truth they are more accurately self-managing their publications which are going through an actual publishing company, doing things they cannot even begin to fathom as faux-publishers. 4] How many books you sell will still come down to marketing efforts, whether you do it yourself (not great results, statistically speaking) or hire an proven marketing company to do it for you (better results, but more money), regardless of if you are self-publishing, REALLY self-publishing, or publishing with a traditional publisher accepting solicited or unsolicited manuscripts. If you book sells as much as it would with a large publisher, you have undoubtedly either hired the right companies to help you publish your book and market it to the right consumer base, you have worked your ass off to market and popularize your own book through a publishing service, or you are just one lucky bastards who has a big enough fan base to drives sales without you having to put in much effort at all. However, in all likelihood, you didn\u2019t actually sell those books on your own as a self-published author. You just let yourself believe that. Which is fine. We all need our minor delusions to make it through the day. But we should at least be cognizant of what is actually happening when we represent ourselves as self-published authors. ",

            "answer_text": "It definitely can. The vast majority of authors with traditional publishers are still expected to do most of their own book promotion, so having the publisher\u2019s name behind your book is becoming less and less critical to your success. Also keep in mind a lot of publishing deals also mean you give up the rights to your book, the ability to determine your own pricing, the ability to determine your own categories and keywords, and the list goes on. If an author wants to explore the traditional route they need to be very clear on the benefits and restrictions. At the end of the day I\u2019m a big fan of self-publishing because it gives you so many more options when it comes to promoting your work and managing your brand. ",
