            "answer_text": "Yea, respect is a difficult word to apply to comedians because you basically fall into three groups: TOTAL OUTLIERS JOKE TELLERS GIMMICK GUYS The total outliers are guys like - Andy Kaufman, Richard Pryor, Rodney dangerfield, Don Rickles - NO ONE else can do what they do. They are unique and untouchable. It can be subtle like Bob Newhart with his cadence and long pauses \u2026 Jerry Seinfeld falls into the joke teller group. What can cause jealousy and envy & respect even is that he the most professional joke teller of all time. He has literally sat down and broke down every word in what order and what noises, pauses and cadence to make it funnier. He is like the Apple of comedians. We will take everything that is readily available to anyone and make it better. So while comedians might be jealous because unlike Don Rickles, you cannot hope to ever even be Don Rickles Part II, in theory you can be Jerry Seinfeld. He stakes no positions, no gimmick position (like Lewis Black or other angry yelling comedians) and just tells really well crafted jokes and deliveries them in the best possible manner to get the most out of that joke so of course, that can engender jealousy and envy because every \u201cjoke teller\u201d comedian can be him but they cannot put the 2+2=5 that is Jerry Seinfeld. But there were/are other guys like him that work or worked like that \u2026 Jim Gaffigan, Ray Romano and Jay Leno in his prime \u2026 it just takes a lot of work and a lot of time spent staring at your one punch line and figuring out if it\u2019s funnier if you insert, NO or no or noooo at the beginning. The BIG difference is SEINFELD, the TV show. It was not only a massive cultural phenomenon but because as a professional, he signed the best deal possible - owning a piece of the action. And a part of it is that he was not a great actor - but again, he did what he needed to do professionally \u2026 \u201cnot an outlier\u201d as an actor or personality. AND the show was not the SOPRANOS where you entered some otherworldly setting, it was just a sitcom with not a lot happening but very ordinary things that people in big cities did \u2026 So, you could say jealous/envy but that\u2019s part of being on entertainment - there are only so many jobs out there and only so many that: you can be the Top moneymaker as a comedian (arena tours) you get a TV show that runs for 7 years you hit the syndication jackpot (the only thing left is to be a huge movie star but since he appears uninterested, you can\u2019t really count it against him). The closest in sports is TOM BRADY - he was/is not particularly a physical specimen. He beat you with his brains, a little luck and working at his craft (which was football) including examining every morsel he put in his body \u2026 so are other NFL players jealous and envious, yes, but in reality - are they willing in to put in 19 hours a day solely devoted to being an NFL QB or in Jerry\u2019s case (telling jokes?) \u2026 it is hard \u2026 and it\u2019s not hard.

            "answer_text": "Jerry Seinfeld stands out as one of the only comics to have successfully transitioned from working the road and doing 5 minutes on Johnny Carson and David Letterman\u2019s shows to developing a wildly popular TV show which he was able to create and end on his own terms. In the late 80s, during the height of the Stand-Up Comedy Boom, dozens of comedians were offered development deals by the networks, but of all of them, Seinfeld became a new standard for sitcoms. Whether fair or not, much of \u2018the industry\u2019 also judged all other comedians by Jerry\u2019s career arc and the impact of that only served to make WHAT is a \u2018Successful\u2019 comic more rigid. After all that, is Jerry Seinfeld respected by his colleagues? Well, I think that for older comedians who have wanted Jerry\u2019s career arc as their own, yes, he is highly regarded. However, this is no longer universally true. In the last few years, here have been more young comedians publicly expressing resentment for Jerry Seinfeld. Comedians like Christian Finnegan and Amy Schumer have both said mocked and even dismissed Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s success as simply being a product of him being an \u201cold white man\u201d who is deciding who is funny and who is not by who he has on his interview show, Comedians in Cars getting Coffee. Jerry responded to criticism about so-called \u2018lack of diversity\u2019 on the show that Amy Schumer brought up on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast by pointing out that he\u2019d literally went from his college graduation party to doing an amature night on stage and had made a lot of friends along the way and it just seemed natural to want to invite his oldest friends first. The young comedians seem to be acting like, because he\u2019s treated like an expert \u2018Elder Statesman\u2019 of Comedy after of the success of his TV show, Jerry never really \u2018struggled\u2019 or really was a real stand-up comedian who spent years refining his style and establishing a voice. In fact Jerry was doing Stand-Up on the road constantly since he first bombed on stage at Catch a Rising Star in 1976. ",
