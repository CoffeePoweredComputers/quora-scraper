            "answer_text": "(I\u2019m relatively young) Chapter 1: When Life was a Collection of Hazy Memories This would be about my early childhood of growing up in Connecticut: digging for biscuits in sand boxes, playing with friends and going apple-picking. Chapter 2: Hot Air and Flying Metal (Age 4) Me moving to Hong Kong. I remembered being nudged awake by my parents, boarding some giant metal thing, landing a long time later in a big building, stepping outside and going \u201cWow, it\u2019s so hot!\u201d Chapter 3: What the heck are you saying? My attempts to learn Mandarin at an international school, then moving to a Mandarin-Immersion school, and still having trouble with Mandarin. This would be Pre K-1st grade. Chapter 4: Two Lone Wolves in a world full of pack animals 2nd-3rd grade. My friendship with this girl (let\u2019s call her Kathy), and all that we had to go through together: prejudiced teachers, defense mechanisms, mean kids who turned the entire class against us. All while dealing with our own drama! Chapter 5: Life is a Song you Sing and Dance To 4th grade. Struggles as I began to hit puberty, started realizing the bad things that happened in this world. I also met another really nice girl, and our experiences together. Oh, and me taking part in my first production and dancing! Chapter 6: The Girl who has Everything 5th grade. I had a lot of friendship drama this year, involving a girl who was really nice then turned on me, calling me a b*tch and I had to sleep with her for 3 nights on a school trip. It would also get into my second production and my crush on a boy. I call it this because on the outside, and to my classmates, I seemed like I had everything: Great academics, talents, won a year-end award, nice parents\u2026..I\u2019m very, very grateful but the one thing I was lacking was a good social life. It all turned out ok in the end though. Chapter 7: Cleanse and Start Over Me moving to Southern California from Hong Kong. This would be my 6th grade year, and my experience adapting to American life and becoming a competitive pianist and writing. Oh and some boy stuff.. Chapter 8: Life is a Dangerous yet Fun Game to Play (In progress) My summer bonding with people, and my 7th grade year. I don\u2019t have much to say about this chapter because it\u2019s still in progress. This is where we leave off for now. Novella/Bonus: Voyage and Return My travels: China, Japan, Korea, Cambodia, Maldives, Italy etc. All my best experiences in different countries and adventures. Regards, Sarah ",

            "answer_text": "The book would be of the comedy genre. Chapter One: Life\u2019s not a bitch but she was. When I was born, the woman that delivered me took it personally! It was a matter of professional pride for her. You know, like chefs in the kitchen. If the cake doesn\u2019t look pleasing, chuck it and start again. She went to my mother and said: \u201cthere was a problem with this one, how about I recycle it and you try for another one\u201d. (I was born disabled, and she didn\u2019t like that) Chapter Two: Hold on will ya? Throughout my childhood, my mum was the butt of the joke! Every time someone suggested something that might help with my illness, off she went. We went to every holy place. Every hospital. And she tried everything she could, in hopes of improving me. She took me to this hospital, I clearly remember it. The wall was half blue and half white. This doctor, asshole if you ask me, told me to hold on to the wall and he went to fetch a ball. By the way, do you want to know my favorite Albanian joke? Here it is: A young lad is standing by a wall. The local town policeman walks by and asks the youth \u201chow\u2019s it going\u201d The young lad answers: \u201cis going fine officer, but my father has left me to hold this wall for a really long time. He told me that I had to hold the wall till he comes or else it will fall. But it\u2019s been hours and I\u2019m hungry. Officer, would you please replace me in holding the wall as I run home to get a sandwich?\u201d When that asshole doctor told me to stand there I felt I was being tricked into holding a perfectly solid wall. But he came back with the ball. He passed me the ball and told me to pass it back. But I waited for the ball to arrive at my feet, then (slightly unsure whether the wall was steady) I let go of the wall, and I leveled the ball with my hands and then put my hand to the wall again and I kicked the ball back. I must have been really young, at that time I couldn\u2019t walk, just stand. The idiot was shocked! He, remember a doctor, they are supposed to be clever, he told my parents that he had never seen such a playeeer! Apparently he tried that trick with all his patients but when they saw the ball coming towards their feet, they\u2019d all try to kick it right away and fall as a result (yep, I was worse than the policeman, I was his lab rat). There\u2019s a saying in my neck of the woods, \u201cnuk ma ha qeni shkopin\u201d (something about how no one makes a fool out of me) Chapter Three: The mug is on the wall. After years of homeschooling (or just mum, the same restless mum, teaching me whatever came to her head), I was finally accepted in school. Albanians didn\u2019t want football players, like yours truly, in public schools. But one of the teachers happened to be a distant relative and she took me in. She was a shit teacher though! Beggars can\u2019t be choosers I hear you say. So I\u2019ll leave it at that. But I was the best in the class. That\u2019s right, a football player and a good student. that only happens in books (wink, wink). So the teacher placed my ugly mug on the wall of honor. (Blank page where the picture would be, but for marketing reasons, we couldn\u2019t risk it, we wanted you to actually recommend this book. Move along) Chapter Four: Remove your heels, this ain\u2019t a dance floor. Vlora, 2000. We are about to hop onto a rubber boat to sale from Albania to Italy. The driver (I think he was a pimp) couldn\u2019t stop shouting \u201ceveryone with heals on, remove them or you\u2019ll sink the boat\u201d. It was rated five stars. Chapter Six: How the fuck can I be going to Albania? I\u2019m not sure why but a lot of people speak down at disabled people. I don\u2019t care but they sound as though they are with the problem. I was in Sicily. Walking home from the park. On my way I meet with an Albanian. If you use the internet I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve come across people going on about how friendly Albanians are. So this guy was one of them. Friendly to the point of becoming a pain in the butt. He asked me questions where the answer was of one-word responses. As a guy with a speech problem, I like this: \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cfine\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d, \u201chaha\u201d. But then he asked me where I was going. Now, why would you ask that? Aren\u2019t questions about the bloody weather enough? Why the fuck did he care where I was going? Anyway, I told him that I was going home! Note, in Albanian, the word \u201chome\u201d is \u201cshpi\u201d, and, in hopes of not ruining the punchline, the word for Albanian in Albanian is \u201cshqipni\u201d So, the guy asked me where I was going (in other words, where the fuck was I walking to). I replied with \u201cI\u2019m going home\u201d and he thought I said I was going (walking) to Albania! And he repeated it as if he was checking whether I am retarded. Back then I was insecure, if this happened today I would have replied: \u201cyes, so fuck off I\u2019m running late\u201d. Chapter Seven: Normally people take things out. If someone said \u201cI went to a car park full of trucks at night and I broke into one of them\u201d you\u2019d expect them to say they took something from it. But we actually broke into a truck and went into it! The journey to England. Chapter Eight: Thank fuck it wasn\u2019t the middle finger. When we arrived in England, the truck was surrounded by the police. We were scared. We were told that the \u201clucky ones\u201d would get out of the truck before the police came. A policewoman opened the truck door and gave a thumbs up. And it actually turned out more than OK. Chapter Nine: We have come all the way from Albania to be pranked? They relocated us to Manchester and the house they gave us was better than anything that we could have dreamed of. Chapter Ten: Why the fuck are you speaking English Shqipe! At my first, all disabled, English school I met the first Kosovan person, and the first \u201cshqipe\u201d of my age in England and he could not speak! He\u2019d speak through a machine (like Stephen Hawking). I\u2019d talk in Albanian at him and he\u2019d reply in English. His name was Besnik. Another Albanian joke: An Albanian in England doesn\u2019t know English. He buys a bike and then the saddle gets stollen. He walks into a bike shop, without knowing any English, and tries to buy a new saddle. The shop assistant, beautiful woman, doesn\u2019t understand what the Albanian wants. The Albanian goes to his other Albanian friends and tells them how stupid he felt at the shop. To top it all the assistant was beautiful. So his friends write down what he wants. The Albanian goes to the same assistant and gives her the slip of paper. She reads: \u201cCould you please give me a kiss\u201d The assistant smiles and gestures as to where our Albanian might want the kiss, she points to the cheek or the lips. The Albanian instead points to his ass. That Albanian was like me, I\u2019d ask Besnik to translate and he\u2019d take the piss. His laughter would give it away though. The little shit. Chapter Eleven: Selam Aleykum Brov! At my other school, I found that Islam is a big deal. And that apparently my religion made me brothers with people that I had never met. Chapter Twelve: Can\u2019t be bothered continuing. So much more ",
