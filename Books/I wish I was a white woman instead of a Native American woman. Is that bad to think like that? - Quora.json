Is that bad to think like that?\u201d It is not bad to think like that, but it can be tiring, even exhausting to think like that often. You don't need to change your thinking. about this , but if you can, I suggest that , when you find yourself thinking like this, that you try to distract yourself and try to think of something useful and practical or something pleasant and enjoyable. Please don't be hard on yourself or blame yourself . There is a famous prayer which may help you if you recite it or pray it often: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change; the courage to change the things I can; and the wisdom to know the difference . I also suggest to you that in the eyes of God, you are special and of inestimable value and that no one else in the history of the world has been, or ever will be exactly like you . ",
