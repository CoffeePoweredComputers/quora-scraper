            "answer_text": "Publishing a book on Kindle is a pretty easy process if you already have what you need: manuscript (edited and formatted), cover, title, book description, and keywords are musts. For more info, look up KDP jumpstart. Will it sell is a more complicated question, and it usually depends on what genre you write in. If you write in romance (assuming you have a decent manuscript and cover), you are more likely to see those first sales start to trickle in. This may also happen if you write in a niche genre that you already know fairly well. Niches that aren\u2019t crowded have devoted readers who can\u2019t wait to get the next book that suits their likes, but finding a niche to write in takes a lot of research. So yes, a new writer can have success, but it\u2019s not easy to do so. It\u2019s highly unlikely that you will be able to publish your book and see a satisfying amount of sales quickly. I\u2019d recommend research into specific strategies for the type of book you\u2019ve written. And always, always have someone else edit your manuscript. I\u2019d recommend Joanna Penn\u2019s website if you\u2019re new to ebook publishing. ",
