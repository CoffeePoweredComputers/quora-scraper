            "answer_text": "Hi. Yes, I am working on the principles I learned from The 4-Hour Work Week (4HWW), they work, and they are likely to serve me well, long after 2020. To be honest, I have combined the principles learned from other places with 4HWW, which is usually how people succeed in this area. Indeed, the principles of the book are a fantastic starting point. My working hours have been drastically reduced. I am close to actually working 4 hours a week.  First I want to be clear because the times have changed a little. There are actually a lot of people out there only working roughly 4 hours a week. But not in the way the author describes. These are barely-employed people, usually older or very young and fresh into their first employed gig. They might have some kind of task they can do for someone once a week, such as a yard work, or they have an online gig that only offers them enough work to do 4 hours. And it pays better than a 4 hours half-shift at a coffee shop or whatever, but make no mistake, this is not what Tim Ferris teaches. That is just under-employment. So yes, working for very little hours is not that uncommon, but the real goal, what I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering, is whether anybody works only 4 hours a week and makes a real livable wage. The answer to that is absolute yes. One of the early concepts 4HWW discusses is the Pareto principle, also known as the 80-20 rule. Basically, most people only get results from 20 percent of what they're doing. So if someone has an office job, they only really need to be there for about 20 percent of the workday, and the rest is busywork and just being in the office out of protocol. I think anyone could agree that we waste way too much time at work. But the Pareto principle goes beyond avoiding waste and into capitalizing on that 20 percent. If 20 percent of your daily activities as an entrepreneur is what actually net you a profit, you need to redesign your lifestyle so you are spending ALL your work time on that 20 percent, and eliminating or outsourcing all the rest. In other words, it\u2019s actually very possible to work only 4 hours a week and make a major living. Any top-level freelancer would concur. First, in my opinion, you have to get out of an hourly wage arrangement. Traditional 9-to-5 jobs don\u2019t pay you for results. They pay for your time. Get paid for getting people results, such as in freelance, and suddenly time becomes a lot more flexible. This stuff is all very possible and is becoming more common over time. The caveat is that it isn\u2019t easy to get to that point. It takes work. The easy route is to continue working as you usually do, which is what most people are more comfortable with. You do have to have an entrepreneurial spirit, a drive to really see your life change drastically. Put simply, you have to have a real reason to cut down your time spent working. If you just hate working, and that\u2019s your only motivation, the book can\u2019t do anything to help, because there\u2019s nothing inside yourself to make you commit. Having a goal as an artist, wanting to spend more time with family, things like that are what determines whether a person succeeds at this lifestyle-design stuff. You have to be willing to put in work, step out of your comfort zone, and embrace new ideas. 4HWW basically teaches everyday small business owners and mid to high-level employees the lifestyle secrets that only the 1 percent really know about and employ. Largely those secrets boil down to: Focus on what\u2019s most effective at making money and get other people to do the grunt work. The book is highly focused on virtual assistants. I have implemented VAs myself and couldn\u2019t recommend them enough. After hiring them, now I have time for bigger tasks and get the same amount of important work done without putting aside time for my other life goals and for free time. Imagine a fresh workday where you have planned to do research for a new business idea, which you want to get up off the ground as soon as possible. As you are about to start, you see a customer service email for your current business that takes a lot of your time. Ultimately, you end up not finishing your daily goal and this disrupts your schedule and creates more problems. In such a case, hiring a virtual assistant for customer service matters and email management can be of great help. Of course, that\u2019s just one example, and the book itself offers plenty more. 4HWW can be one of the best guides for anyone who wants to be an online entrepreneur because it reminds people that this online money making stuff is supposed to be fun. It\u2019s supposed to be liberating, allowing us to make money passively and for only a little bit of work at a computer. With many inspirational stories, it teaches the concept of financial independence better than any other book I know of. Honestly, 4HWW has been a life-changer for me, and I'm not alone. That's the reason it's still my topmost recommendation to anyone who wishes to be an online entrepreneur or is stressed out with his/her typical nine to five job. The book's ideas are still valid in 2020 and hopefully well beyond that. The reason I have used the word \u2018hopefully\u2019 is that with technology, everything is moving and changing, but I still think now is a better time to get into this stuff than ever. I have a detailed review of the book on my website. If you are interested, you can check it out. The link is in my profile. I appreciate your choice of reading 4HWW. It's a must-read. I would suggest you start to implement its teachings as you proceed further. I know firsthand that this stuff works. Please feel free to reply to me if you need clarification. Good Luck!

            "answer_text": "I am a big Tim Ferriss fan and changed a lot for the positive in my life after reading 4-Hour Work Week (2007 book). To answer your question directly, I doubt anyone is living comfortably while only working 4 hours per week. Surely some are only working 4 hours per week, but I suspect not by choice. That might be the right word to use to describe what Tim Ferriss is trying to teach his audience: CHOOSE. Choose how much you work, choose how to work smarter and choose to live a different lifestyle than what we are all taught. Maybe the first lesson is to define work. So let\u2019s start there and then let me break each of the others choices. Define \u201cwork\u201d or \u201cworking\u201d: I LOVE GOLF! I get to play quite a bit of golf each week and still look forward to playing a good round with good friends. I have often dreamed of playing on the PGA Tour. In reality though, I doubt I would love the game as much if I had to get up at 5am every day, 7 days a week, hit 500 golf balls, practice putting for 2 hours and then work out with a trainer who kicks my ass for another 2 hours and then had another 3 to 4 hours of commitments to the media, my sponsors and fans. At that point, GOLF = WORK! Just because you love something or because something is easy for you doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t work. The question the book challenges the reader on is; could you automate the things you hate about a task and only do the things you love? And if so, could you get that level of effort down to the smallest sample size possible, maybe even down to 4 hours? I do believe that Tim did at one point in his life and it drove him to write the book. Choose how much you work: Personally, I have a very fulfilling life and work more than 40 hours each week, but much like Tim teaches in the book, I truly work to live and do things with my family that we want to do! I could probably get away with working a lot less, maybe as few as 4 hours, but the lifestyle would have to change DRASTICALLY and my goals to \u201cretire before 50\u201d would have to change as well. More on that below\u2026 So I work harder and longer to make more money to do the things we love: vacation together, golf and fly planes. Choose how to work smarter: This is probably where Tim spends most of his time in the book. Quit doing things because others think you should! Be smart about what you work on and where you work from. Two quick themes from the book. Work from anywhere and outsource as much as you can. Tim worked around the globe while running his businesses and still seems to today. It begs the question: Are you working if you are on vacation 100% of the time? The other theme is to outsource everything. Many of my friends disagree with this, but it has changed our life a bunch. I believe Tim\u2019s formula is that if you can pay someone less than you make per hour to accomplish something you don\u2019t like to do, you should pay someone to do it. I literally have someone that does EVERYTHING for my family and it costs me much less than anyone could imagine. For that spend, I promise you I get about 30 hours a week back for me and my wife. Does that mean we work less than 40 hours? Not really, but it means we are very happy. Tim recommends AskSunday who I used for a while to help and now I have an assistant who works directly for me (She just poked her head in my office and she was leaving for the day. She arrived at 5:45am, cooked us all a hot breakfast, did laundry, made our bed, straighten up the kitchen and more. It\u2019s only 8:15am, that is only 2.5 hours a day!) Choose to live a different lifestyle: (than what we are all taught) This is the part of the book that confirmed a lot of my thinking from my mid-30s. We are taught at an early age to work hard, save money and look forward to your glory years. What if you don\u2019t make it to your glory years? My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago and this was all reconfirmed. Why am I working so hard for a future together that we might not have. She is cancer free and we are both healthier than ever, but it did wake us both up. Are you doing what everyone has taught you, working for retirement? Tim says screw that, don\u2019t live the deferred life plan! Live for the present moment and go do what you want to do now with some calculated planning. If you want to go to something big (attend the Master, the Olympics, visit another country, etc.), build out a plan and go do it. Do all this good stuff while you are more than able physically!! My personal opinion is I will do that and if I make it 60+, I will go put in some hours greeting people at a big box retailer to make a little money (if needed). Back to retiring before 50, it\u2019s possible! But since we are talking about \u201cworking\u201d, I will clarify that I don\u2019t plan to stop \u201cworking\u201d at 50! I want to leave a daily schedule, a corporate email account and work on my own at the right level of effort to engage in what I love. That might mean I consult for 10 hours a week, teach people how to fly or find a new passion that affords me the things I need and want! That lifestyle will be my choice! After reading the book and implementing a lot of what I learned, I can honestly say I don\u2019t feel like I grind week in and week out \u201cat work\u201d. While overachieving for my employer I have found ways to outsource a lot of the activities and things that I don\u2019t enjoy (both at work and home) so that my family and I can spend more time doing the things we love! No longer do I subscribe to the deferred life plan and we go do what we want to go do! I work just enough to do that and a lot of weeks that only feels like 4 hours, of what I call \u201cwork\u201d!
