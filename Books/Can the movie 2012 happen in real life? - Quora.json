            "answer_text": "The temperatures on the Earth\u2019s surface are clearly rising with every year and it is quite evident that this is not something that can be ignored. Particular animal species are going extinct without our knowledge and the food chain is being imbalanced. How does this affect global warming? Well, it does. But to answer the question in a single shot, Yes, it can happen, but not in the next few years at least. Maybe after a century, because such disastrous events take time. They build up at a tortoise\u2019s speed but leave a mark too dark to not notice. Fun trivia: After a few years (2 or 3), sit with a young child who was born after 2012 and watch the movie. Tell them you survived all that and see how amazed they will be. ",

While a catastrophic earthquake like the ones shown in the film would happen (surely when someone lives an event like that we are really sure that we will not see such a show, probably we will end behind the rubble of a building), something like a long and painful chain of earthquakes sound impossible. It takes a long time to the continental plaques to move several kilometers to have the effect shown in the film (technically creating a new continent by sticking all the continents together). So, in real life it would happen but it will take thousands of years to see the ending, if any human survives all that time. ",
