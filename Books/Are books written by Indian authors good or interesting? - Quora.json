            "answer_text": "A few years back, I was catching up on some of the bestsellers by Indian authors. I realized that I had a story to tell which was much more interesting and entertaining than a lot of novels that were out there and I believed that I could do a better job at writing it up. While attempting to write this story, I had plenty of self-doubts. I wasn\u2019t sure if portions of it were grammatically correct and if how I wrote would make sense to a majority of the readers.Around this time, I attended a three week \u2018Just Write\u2019 Fiction writing workshop with authors Anil Menon, Anjum Hassan and Rimi Chatterjee which helped enormously in honing my story telling skills, gave me lots of answers and dispelled my self-doubts to a large extent.The narration style of the story I wrote, ended up being very unique. The story is told through emails and first person accounts of events. This format emerged from the story I had to tell. I tried different narration styles, but they weren\u2019t telling the story the way it needed to be told. It had to be how it ended up being \u2013 emails and first person accounts of events by different characters in every alternate chapter.I learnt how to and designed the cover, did all the formatting and self-published my Novel- And We Remained a little more than a year back. An excerpt: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u201cIt is a risk to love. What if it doesn\u2019t work out?Ah, but what if it does.\u201d\u2013 Peter McWilliams December 1998, BangaloreI had flunked four.My body went cold in one of the dimly lit, dusty offices of the Electrical Engineering department as I saw my sixth semester results in rolls of low quality printer paper. Every ounce of warm blood was draining out in a rush through my toes. I did not know how to react\u2014I had never faced such a situation in the entirety of mystudent life.The smile that Wardha had on her face as she took my note which ended everything flashed in my mind. She took the note from me without batting aneyelid, without the least bit of hesitation about me or my intent. Wardha\u2019s reaction as she took my note and all the subsequent hurt, made the decision of ending everything top the list of those \u2018what-were-you-thinking\u2019 moments in my life. Regret engulfed me. An irrepressible urge to slam my fist into the nearest wall started from within. I could only imagine alternatives where there could have been no hurt, no bitterness.\u201cHi Sahir. What happened, actually?\u201d Sandeep Gadwal, a good soul and my best friend in undergrad, asked me.\u201cI lost four,\u201d I said, as a hollow tone replaced my voice. I wasn\u2019t sure which sentiment should have expressed itself to state my dismal status.\u201cOh, fuck\u2026\u201d Sandeep said.Between us, the need for profanity did not arise often.I had always been an above-average student, had never seen a \u2018fail\u2019 against my name on any subject before engineering.I had earned my admission\u2014on merit\u2014in the prestigious Engineering College of Vidyakeerthi University (ECVU). I did not expect this from myself.\u201cYou?\u201d I asked him.\u201cI barely managed to clear all the eight subjects, got gold medals in three of them,\u201d he said. A \u2018gold medal\u2019 meant one had cleared the subject with the lowest marks possible. \u201cWhy are you purposely letting such things happen to you?\u201d he asked.I shrugged. Sandeep was not expecting a specific answer either.Sandeep and I had the same amount of interest in academics during engineering\u2014which wasn\u2019t much\u2014and shared the last bench in class. We went to class so that our names would not be on the attendance-shortage lists before the final exams\u2014we couldn\u2019t afford to pay our way out of them. We managed to clear our subjects every semester without needing any subsequent ones for doing so.The sixth semester turned out to be a huge exception\u2014for me.It was common knowledge that the sixth semester demanded the most in terms of academic workload for electrical engineering. I was also an office bearer of the college student\u2019s union, trying to discharge my responsibilities as earnestly as I could.And then there was Wardha.I understood then, that the consequences of my action had gone well beyond repair. While still in love, and knowing somewhere at the back of my mind that she felt the same about me\u2014for a little time, at least\u2014I saw her every day in ECVU withthis someone else. My heart ached. Every day after that was agony.Stories about love did not end like this\u2026 Or did they?Sandeep had a fair idea about the turmoil I was going through. He had more than a few clues about the havoc that threatened to tear me apart. There was nobody who could help\u2014neither him nor my parents. Nobody doubted my caliber or myabilities to do well in Engineering. There were different demons I was fighting and there wasn\u2019t any doubt that I was the one being pummelled into submission.I began to hang out with Sandeep from the second semester at ECVU. We shared a career ambition to head the photography division of Playboy. Neither of us could afford a camera or had got a chance to click even a set of fully clothed people until then.Like most that landed at ECVU, the two of us had little cash to spare. I never wanted to ask my Dad for money and Sandeep only had his Mom to ask money from. We watched movies sitting in the cheapest seats, usually closest to the screen and ordered the lowest costing items at darshinis\u2014Bangalore\u2019spopular eateries.Sandeep and I caught the same bus to and back from ECVU. Sandeep always managed to jostle his way into the evercrowded BTS buses\u2014our pathetic excuse for public transport\u2014 and get us seats. Footboarding was our only alternative to commute home if we failed to get seats. Overflowing buses, with people hanging on to them for dear lives, had become a common sight across the growing and bursting-at-its-seams city of Bangalore.During this time, Sandeep and I started to prefer the Sidney Sheldons, Jeffrey Archers, Irving Wallaces, (and the Playboys and the Letters to Penthouse) over the Hardy Boys and the Nancy Drews. We began listening to the Guns And Rosesand the Metallicas and shared the same taste in movies\u2014those which played in theaters and those which were legally not allowed to play in them.And both of us spent sleepless nights smitten by Wardha.Though Sandeep and I got along with everyone\u2014from the front benchers of our class who stayed buried in books attempting to do justice to engineering, to the girls\u2019 shy cricket team who lived, ate and breathed cricket\u2014we made our closest friends from our batch in the Mechanical Engineering department, Gopal andAnand.Gopal was a simpleton, easily trusting and confiding. He gorged on oodles of ghee through the delicacies his Amma often made for him. He fancied he had a talent for singing but, fortunately for all of us, managed to keep it a secret throughengineering. He was a God fearing, family guy and usually hung out with a horde of cousins outside ECVU.Anand was the intellectual kind who devoured books and had a sharp wit. Both his parents were doctors. In fact, most in Anand\u2019s family were either doctors or surgeons. Anand tried his best to not feel like a fish out of water in mechanical engineering or around girls. Women Anand\u2019s \u2018type\u2019 were a rarity at ECVU.Private engineering colleges had plenty of his preferred variety where they decked themselves with tighter and smaller clothes\u2014 which revealed more than they hid.The two of them, wanted to hang out and even attend classes with us in Electrical Engineering\u2014for a variety of nonacademic reasons. Sushmita Ma\u2019am\u2014of our Electrical Engineering department\u2014topped their list of such motives. Whenever shetaught in their department\u2014which wasn\u2019t often\u2014the classes were full. Their department did not even have the concept of attendance shortage each semester. Their students were free to walk in and out of classes as they pleased.Gopal though, had a stronger motivation for his interest in Electrical Engineering. He\u2014like Sandeep and me\u2014had more than a mere soft corner for Wardha.The three of us had perhaps ended up as a statistic in her life. But for some unfathomable reason, she was meant to remain more than that in mine.  ",

            "answer_text": "The answer for this question is subjective to the Indian author. The standards of Indian writing have come down to an extent where only a handful of books by Indian authors are really good. To name a few are the books by Amish, R K Narayan, Tagore, Ruskin Bond and Sudha Murthy (they are the authors whose works I have read). Most of the Indian authors prefer to mimic the style of writing from foreign authors and that spoils the story. Authors like Chetan, Ravinder and Durjoy try to bring in a lot of content that portrays intimacy and love between the protagonists and these writings are just to attract the young readers and achieve the clich\u00e9d 'Over one million copies sold' or 'India's #1 bestselling author' taglines. In the process of mimicking the foreign authors they end up losing their originality and earn a bad name to all Indian authors in general. ",

            "answer_text": "You are simply choosing the wrong books! Why is that? Because of the mass publicity of the books by Chetan Bhagat and the type. Specifically, Chetan Bhagat, he targets the masses, lures the non-readers by vivid soft-pornographic description and crass writing. Of course these aren't going to impress a genuine book-lover.Now there are writers in foreign countries who write such content too. The Mills and Boons publications specially caters to such fantasies, primarily of teenage girls. It would be wrong to generalize all the writers. Edit: After posting this answer I looked at the genre described in this question. TFIOS is a love story, and I couldn't remember a romantic novel by an Indian author that I loved. So I looked it up on the Goodreads and the names that came up were Ravinder Singh, Durjoy Datta and such. By a cursory glance one can assume the nature of these books (judging a book by its cover). Of course, there might be a few gems lost among these.The sheer number of such books has gone up marginally, thanks to Mr Chetan Bhagat inspiring young people to write. Anyone with a hint of imagination possessing the ability of saucy creative writing is a writer now. Good literature, decent grammar has gone out of the window. So, sadly, yes, the standard of Indian books has gone down, and that is solely because of the staggering number of poorly written books in the market.
