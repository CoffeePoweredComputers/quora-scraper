            "answer_text": "I am doing the programme, it\u2019s been 14 weeks now, so I think I am in a fair enough position to share my observations. I have done programmes earlier too, which were not very expensive but I felt that the knowledge was shallow, and I realised it only when I started learning further. When I had to choose a programme, I had several options. Having done quite affordable programmes earlier, I felt that this time, I need in depth knowledge along with a decent job placement opportunities. I chose Springboard because it was offering just what I wanted, plus a lot more (shared in the following points).A dedicated mentor was assigned for me. This mentor is not a teacher wala mentor but a mentor in a true sense. He keeps guiding me, keeps my spirits high, my attitude positive, and inspires me to broaden my thinking horizon because Data Scientists work with the unknown too apart from the known. So to become a good Data Scientist, one must learn to think like one. Also, I\u2019ve had some very valuable pieces of advices from my mentor which only a person who has been through this journey can give, I get to learn a lot from him. If learning Data Science is a map, then my mentor is the Google Maps navigation of the journey.I have a dedicated career coach who has helped me in developing my job search strategy, so that I can go out and land where I want rather than accept what comes my way. She\u2019s helped me strategise, network, and optimise my profile.Whenever I have a doubt, or maybe something I haven\u2019t understood, or maybe a technical slag, or maybe I\u2019m stuck at something, there are two TAs whom I can bother and they\u2019ve helped me sail smoothly through the process. I haven\u2019t had to google for a bit, which is a very big thing. I am a working professional, and time is of the essence for me as it is limited. So I can devote quite a bit of time to my studies. Plus there is emphasis on peer to peer learning too through an online community, which is great. There is a student manager too who helps me out with these too.Every week there are sessions on the industry use of Data Science, so there is always a connect between the courseware and the actual real life applications. Also, the course helps you build your project portfolio, which is great to put on the resume.Apart from these, the main point is the courseware, true that the study material is curated, but it\u2019s quite detailed and a lot of hands on is there, so that we can learn by doing, which is a plus. As mentioned earlier, I haven\u2019t felt the need to google stuff, the study material is great and all inclusive. I was even pleasantly surprised that I am learning Machine Learning from Harvard Lectures as a part of the course.Overall, I feel that Springboard\u2019s content is great, it is detailed and a lot of hands on and practice is there. It is a rigorous course, so one needs to be regular in studies and project submissions. But that is all for my own good so that I can achieve my objectives. I would definitely recommend Springboard.

            "answer_text": "I joined their course in Feb-2020 and about to complete the course I know everyone wants to know how worth a course is. But it depends on the perspective you see in terms of knowledge it is tremendous . Because springBoard has curated the best resources from various sources like datacamp , Cs lectures and many other sites. It provides 1:1 mentorship for 6\u20139 months based on our pace and it totally depends on how you use your mentor . Like a min of 24 calls with mentor who is working for some product based company as senior Data scientist or more powerful role than that. So if you use the mentor in good manner then it totally worth it. It provides TA to clarify doubts on assignments and projects . So you have to ask doubts and be in touch with them to enhance your knowledge. It provides career coaching who reviews resume , CV , LinkedIn profile and negotiations .who will help in applying jobs. So it is worth if you use all the features at great extent and land in a good job . ",
