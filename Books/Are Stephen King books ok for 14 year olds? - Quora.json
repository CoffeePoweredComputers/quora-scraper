            "answer_text": "Here is what I recommend to parents or guardians who ask questions like this: you have to watch/read it yourself to make that distinction. Every parent/guardian is going to have different convictions about what they allow their kid to watch/read. I cannot, nor can anyone else, tell you what is or isn\u2019t okay for your 14 year old. And in the event that this question is coming from the teen, I would recommend that you speak to your parent/guardian if you are curious about watching/reading it and see what they have to say about it. If you \u201caren\u2019t allowed\u201d to watch/read it, and you do it anyways, just know that you will have to deal with any repercussions of that action. Everyone has a different standard and different opinion on things like this, and I always recommend that the adult in authority read or watch it carefully before they decide. That way, if there are issues, they can potentially address them with their teen in a mature conversation rather than simply hearing something about the movie or book and banning it altogether, or allowing things to be watched/read out of ignorance that could damage the child/teen. I, personally, loved It in every form. It\u2019s one of my all time favorites, and I think that someone at the age of 14 could handle the more graphic and mature material without issue. But that\u2019s my opinion-- and in this case, my opinion doesn\u2019t count because I\u2019m not the adult in authority. ",

            "answer_text": "I read it when I was 13 and if someone had prohibited me from doing so, I may not have found my love for books. It was the first big novel I ever finished and I learned an important lesson about setting and accomplishing a difficult goal. That would be the groundwork for hundreds of books that I would go on to read over the next 25 years. It may have been the first catalyst that put me on a path to achieving a 4 year degree. Sure there\u2019s some scary stuff, foul language and sexual content in it, but don\u2019t let the micro content of the work stand in the way of opening up a world of books to a young person. I went on to consume every work by Stephen King and many other books by many other authors. Reading recreationally as a teenager provides a distinct advantage in reading comprehension and writing composition skills. The content of the books that a 14 year old reads is far less important than the fact that they want to read something at all. if you\u2019re a parent, you can\u2019t control what your children are exposed to and when it comes to literature, you shouldn\u2019t try. Encourage them to read anything that interests them, but make sure you\u2019re talking to them about it, so you can help them interpret what they\u2019re reading. ",

The fact that your child wants to read an actual book is already a good thing. I say, let him or her read SK if he/she wants to. Some of the stories may contain graphic violent scenes, but in my opinion, not as bad as what other authors write. If you\u2019re introducing your child to SK, I suggest to get these first, and let them decide if they want to read more later on: The Eyes of the DragonPet SematarySalem\u2019s LotThe Talisman (with Peter Straub)InsomniaThese are my most favorite novels of SK as well. I guarantee that your child will love them. Happy reading! ",

If you\u2019re like me at 14, then you in no way want to get near anything horror, especially books as I find them even more terrifying due to their ability to make you create your own images. In fact, if you\u2019re like me at any age, you want no part of that. But otherwise if you feel that you\u2019re up to it, then go ahead. I would advise slowly getting yourself into horror novels though, perhaps ones more appropriate for \u201cbeginners\u201d and then building your way up to King. I hope that when you do read him, you enjoy the experience. ",

The book gets much more graphic about the murders as well as some other aspects of the story that were not included in Part 1 of the new movie version. The TV version edited out much of the more violent parts but left enough for the imagination. I\u2019d ask a parent about this. I\u2019d say 13 or 14 might be a bit young for Stephen King. I could not have handled \u201cIT\u201d at 14 but my son could have (I\u2019m easily scared by some horror stuff) with no problems. I would say wait until 16 or so. Yes, that is not what you want to hear but trust me. The book will still be around and will be much richer than the movie. ",
