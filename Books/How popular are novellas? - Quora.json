            "answer_text": "Novellas are very much popular, perhaps more popular than Novel and Epic or full-length drama. Because, a novella comes between a Short Story and a Novel. A novella is not as big as a novel is; and, it is not short as a short story is. A reader would prefer to read a novella when he/she doesn't like the voluminous pages of a novel. A reader would prefer a novella when he/she doesn't like the shortness of a Short Story. Some of the most popular and influential greatest works of Literature are some novellas. They're Animal Farm (by George Orwell), The Old Man and the Sea (by Ernest Hemingway), Metamorphosis (by Franz Kafka), Lord of the Flies (by William Golding), The Stranger (by Albert Camus), Siddhartha (by Hermann Hesse). These are all Novellas by the Nobel Prize winning authors and these novellas were specifically considered when these authors were conferred with the Nobel Prize. Moreover, most of these novellas are studied at the colleges and universities as part of the courses in English language and literature throughout the world.
