            "answer_text": "1984, more than anything else, is a story about the abuse of \u201ccontrol\u201d. I was born in the spring of 1960. Much of my memory construct is based on television, then later, reading. I recall seeing JFK assassinated. I was only three but I knew something really bad was happening. I knew, even as a toddler, that something good was destroyed and a bad dream replaced it. I saw wars on television, then a saw glimmers of hope, for all humanity with man landing on the moon, and television shows, such as Star Trek, offering some little hope for the future of mankind. I recall The Fugitive and the desperate attempts at an innocent man being convicted of a crime he did not commit but nonetheless hounded by police who did not care about the morality of crime, but only the implementation of the law. I also learned in The Fugitive, that America was a fundamentally psychotic place, that wherever Richard Kimble went, whatever town, or farm, or city he had passed through, the people were far from being the open-hearted, loving and Christian people they pretended to be. In 2019, there now appears to be a huge mind-shift to questioning everything we have taken for granted to be the truth. Conspiracy Theories, many with overwhelming evidence, question what we have been made to believe, within my own lifetime. History does not matter because it happened long ago. The New World Order becomes a euphemism to constructing a world Feudal System, with the control completely being in the hands of the Elite with the rest of the world living in servitude to them. Today, and 1984 are not too far from being identical. Innocent people are daily being hounded by the police while criminals are being permitted to run that same agency, as-well-as run the government. The pretense of being a warm and loving and ultimately forgiving people, based on the Christian ethic, has become a global joke, and the current POTUS has become nothing more than its punchline. As for the technical aspects of 1984, there is not one aspect of life, anywhere on the planet, that is not in some manner, surveilled by someone, be it government, or businesses developing a global demographic to sell stupid people items they cannot afford, much less actually need, for their survival. The greatest similarity we have today, to that of life in 1984, is that of truth. Every day there is an attack on the truth and the attack is being moved by those same people in the last 60 years of American Television serials who have only self-interest, and the dirtier they are the more they seek a scape-goat to point their finger at, to distract from their own criminality. Someone who just committed a major crime, even a murder, and yet is seen as a pillar of the community. What to do? Praise God Almighty Hallelujah, Richard Kimble comes along. POINT THE FINGER \u2014 and today, \u201cI can go out on 5th Avenue and shoot someone, and get away with it!\u201d POINT FINGERS AT MEXICANS AND ISLAMICS, AND GAYS \u2014 can\u2019t have people see the real corruption, so fill up the swamp with more leeches. I won\u2019t even get into the details of surveillance on every single living person on the planet. It was said that during the time of Herbert Hoover, that he had a file on every single man and woman in the United States. With revelations coming forth by whistle-blowers such as Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, there is no one on the planet that it not being surveilled. Both of these men could easily be modern constructs of disillusionment, representing Winston Smith. As with 1984, the heroes become the villains and the villains become the victims of the heroes that point out the corruption of those same villains. The news is labeled as fake and propaganda as the truth - 1984 reaches its focal realization. ",

            "answer_text": "Since China is using it as a playbook, it\u2019s significant. China is increasingly leading the world in technology. That will expand its influence. I like that part; the US only seems to pursue moonshots as a nation (i.e. long term thinking about technology investments) when another nation threatens to attain supremacy in that space. Major powers vying for technological leadership benefits humanity as a whole, with one major exception. All technologies can be used for good or ill. Orwell focused on the ill side of things. He believed that people should have certain inalienable rights, which is a commonly held Western value; not so much in the East. For those of us who cherish that value, the coming tsunami of technological unemployment should cause great concern. Already, with relatively little job displacement, authoritarians have gained power in many Western nations. When the tsunami gathers force, I expect outright fascism to be on the ascendancy. (Most people will eagerly trade liberty for security, ignoring Benjamin Franklin\u2019s warning.) This is why I advocate frequently for a viable, sustainable UBI. While I have doubts that Andrew Yang\u2019s approach is viable (i.e. can actually get adopted), if Democrats massively gain power in 2020 and 2022, it\u2019s possible. Also, the Republican response has\u2014so far\u2014been generally muted and even positive. I prefer Michael Haines\u2019 (and Robert Heinlein\u2019s!) MOUBI proposal, which\u2014once understood\u2014is easy for any nation state to adopt on a trial basis, anytime, anywhere. Longer term, we need evolutionary societies based on systems of sustainable technological abundance. My book describes one such model society. Others are also possible. I see them as the only alternative to Orwell\u2019s nightmare. ",
