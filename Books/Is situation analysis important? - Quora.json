            "answer_text": "There are several aspects to this, depending on when it occurs. Here are some examples: At my former school, we in the CS Department observed that a couple of other departments were benefiting in numerous ways from having graduate programs. We looked around some and realized there was a population of potential CS graduate students who were not being served at all by grad programs in the metro Atlanta area: Working professionals who wanted a MS degree for career advancement and needed to go to school part time and on an evening/weekend class schedule. We did the market research, developed a proposal for an MS program, got its first year of operation funded by a local division of IBM, and started it up. The situation analysis there was twofold. First, finding a cohort of potential students with the background to succeed and the need to earn the degree. Second, designing a curriculum suited to the needs of these students. Almost all of them were interested in an MS degree for professional advancement, not as a steppingstone to a PhD program. We therefore tailored the curriculum to non-thesis students, and provided either extra coursework in a specialty concentration or a non-research, industry oriented project as a substitute for the thesis. As our MS program grew and thrived it became known internationally, and we began to get a larger percentage of students who were there for the more traditional, thesis/project oriented degree, so we re-evaluated the situation we were in and altered the curriculum to some extent, providing more structured concentrations in areas like information security, distributed systems, and so on. Another example comes from the undergraduate program. We are a part of the University System of Georgia, and a long term goal of the system was to provide complete interoperability of core curriculum at the thirty or so schools in the system. These schools ranged from community colleges to flagship research universities like Georgia Tech. Thirty five years ago interoperability was more a goal than a reality. Any student transferring from one USG school to another was guaranteed to have all the core courses they took transfer, but the credits frequently ended up as free elective credit rather than core because the schools used *specific* core courses as prerequisites for major courses in some majors. An example of where this could be a problem was when a student took sociology at one school, then transferred to the Industrial Engineering degree program at my school, where there were major courses in industrial psychology that had general psych as a prerequisite. The student who transferred in sociology got credit for the area of the core that had social sciences in it, but then had to take the general psych course to get into the advanced psych courses in IE. This gave them more core hours in that area than were required to complete the core, so some of it was effectively useless. About ten years ago the USG got serious about transferability of usable core courses, and representatives of the various schools spent two or three years meeting and hashing out a new core curriculum that would satisfy each of the majors at each of the schools. There were some very creative things done, but in the long run we came up with a usable core curriculum that fit any situation of student progression, whether they transferred or not, and mostly whether they changed majors or not. Finally, I will mention a general approach to situation analysis in college curriculum development that I first heard from a colleague who was chairman of the Math Department. He started by describing what he called \u201cthe college in the woods\u201d, where the campus was isolated, not in a major metro area full of distractions; where all the students lived on campus and no one commuted fifty miles to come take classes; where all the students were full time, and no one had a family or a job to worry about. Having that baseline, what would an \u2018ideal\u2019 curriculum look like, both in terms of content and in terms of scheduling? We could, for example, do block scheduling and coordinate the content of specific class sections because we would know the students were taking both the courses at the same time. We could do far more lockstep coordination of labs with their associated classes because all the students are right there and available and nobody has schedule conflicts or off-campus responsibilities. You get the idea. Now, admit that we don\u2019t have that situation. Where are we willing to bend on the ideal curriculum to accommodate students who don\u2019t fit our mold? Well, the first example of bending is to start offering classes on a MWF schedule together with other classes on a TTh schedule, and try to coordinate the offerings each term so that a student could make reasonable progress toward graduation and not have to come to campus five days a week. Another example comes up in regard to online classes. Some classes work well online and given budget constraints we actually eliminated all in-class offerings of them, even for students who live on campus. Other classes may require attendance for one or two class days at the beginning of the term, then go online completely after that. And so on. ",

            "answer_text": "Very Important! I\u2019m writing this in a student\u2019s perspective. I was in 12th, it was January ending and Board exams were a month away (March). I had fucked all my Pre - Boards, wasted my time in studying things that I already knew, and that was the I\u2019m fucked moment in my life. Had I continued the same I would have gotten about 81% marks. Final Marks were 90.2% with 95s in 3 subjects 96 in 1 and 72 in the last. How? One day I in the last week of January I sat down and wrote down all the statistics that I had up till that moment and also wrote down my target of 95% and listed down all the topics I knew, topics that needed work and finally those that needed to be started from scratch. Then I made a list of the subjects (in priority) as per the sample papers that were released, as in CBSE a lot depends on the way the sample papers are. MathsChemistryPhysicsEnglishEconomics (Blunder! The sample paper was application oriented and the final paper was theory oriented)In the order I prioritized. Then I divided all the time that I had and made a week by week plan, setting daily to weekly targets. First up, I sat down and attempted all the sample papers with the preparation that I had, the results were ALARMING!! It took me 4 hours to do the maths paper, 3.30 to Chem and Phy, 2.30 to do Eco and 2.30 to do English, and all the marks were in the 80s That\u2019s when I realized that I needed to solve more papers, but before that I needed to study. I started practicing all the available models of questions, I even went to my teacher\u2019s house to clear the doubts. I sat down and read the entire Physics Textbook twice understanding the logic behind the topic.Then went through each and every exercise questions (except inorganic, which I hated from the bottom of my heart) in Chemistry.English Core was relatively easyEconomics read all the concepts and understood all the applications! At the end of February I was fully prepared for all subjects as per the sample papers, and I was more surprised than anyone since I finished all the portions in 1 month\u2019s time! Finally my results Maths- 96 (When the entire nation caused an uproar on a lengthy and a fucked up paper) Phy, Chem, Eng - 95 (Chem was a pleasant surprise as I never touched inorganic) Eco - 72 (Rudest! All theory questions, and mugging isn\u2019t my skill =P) Finally had I not done a situational analysis I wouldn\u2019t have performed so well. ",
