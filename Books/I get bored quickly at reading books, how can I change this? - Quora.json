            "answer_text": "I can offer my perspective. Problem: There are obvious reasons which makes reading a boring activity: Books take effort and time to read which induces stress or fatigueWe need a fairly good vocabulary to appreciate the content of good booksOther reasons include: Novels: Novels get into picturesque details about the setting of a plot or the character background and other descriptions. We want the plot to move effortlessly like we are watching a movie. Non-Fiction: We get bored at Non-Fiction because it is a lot of theory about abstract concepts and we cannot relate to the content of the book. Solution What did Napoleon Do? He compiled and read 1000 books as small book reports  Napoleon was hailed as a Voracious reader of books. When we can\u2019t read one book, he read numerous books. He did so by having a set of librarians curate and compile a Book report of various volumes of books and read it. The following excerpt was from his secretary: Louis Bourrienne The Emperor wants a portative library of thousand volumes in 12mo., printed in good type, without margin, and composed as nearly as possible of 40 volumes on religion, 40 of epics, 40 of plays, 60 of poetry, 100 of novels, 60 of history, the remainder, to make up the 1,000, of historical memoirs. Can we afford librarians? NO, but we have wikipedia! If you are interested in a Novel, read the wikipedia page of the book, read book reviews and analysis of the book and a movie if that book has been made a movie. If you are interested in non-fiction, the author places a recap of each chapter at the end of the chapter. Actually Non-fiction is very easy to read this way. In case you want to enjoy reading a book from cover to cover, it takes much time. If you want to get the takeaway or the core concept of a book, it is pretty simple and takes 15 minutes at the most. Happy Reading ",
