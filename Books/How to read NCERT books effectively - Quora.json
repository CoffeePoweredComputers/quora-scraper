            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a great question ! Reading NCERT text books is the most important thing one must to do score well in boards as well as to get a strong hold of basic concepts for jee and neet ( Particularly Chemistry ) Never skip the introduction : This is a mistake that most students commit. The text books are designed in such a way to evoke the interest for the topic. Start with the intro and read it line by line slowly as a story book. In Chemistry sometimes application based questions are asked from the intro and the end.Go page by page : Another mistake that students commit often is counting the total number of pages in that particular chapter . DO NOT SET A TARGET ! never fix your mind that you have to finish certain pages in a fixed time limit. This puts unwanted pressure on you, and you tend to skip few lines. Hence, never count the number of pages , instead fix the time for which you have to read and go line by line. Eventually you will reach greater heights than your targets.Do not skip information in boxes : These things maybe important for jee and neet. After all, you come to school to gain knowledge.Take notes while you read : Underline things which you feel is important, try making a mind map (This in itself is a great skill), make short notes, etc. These things make sure that you are completely focused in reading the text and to avoid being physically present and mentally absent. Mark my word , you will thank yourself for the notes while you revise for a test/exam.Do not skip the in-text questions : or do not try to read them after the end of the chapter. Go by the sequence. These questions make sure that you are on track, it makes sure that you learn the formula/concept (solving questions is the best way to set the concepts to your memory).Take a break if you are bored : And yes , this is possible only if you start early, you won't have time for breaks if you are reading this few months before exam. There is no point at reading further if you are bored , instead take a break for few minutes , give time for new neuron connections. Less time spent in a productive manner is far far better than spending hours without productivity.Use the exercise questions for revision: I do not mean that you should solve them few days before your exam. Solve these questions 2\u20133 days after you complete reading the chapter. By this time you would have forgotten a few concepts, and when you solve the questions now you are revising and building strong neural connections, This makes sure that you remember the concepts for long.Go through the revision notes / Underlined points occasionally: Even after point seven , you will forget the concepts if you wait long enough. Hence it is important to stay in touch with chapter. That\u2019s why I insisted on making mind-maps / revision notes while you read the chapter. Obviously you won't be happy in reading the whole chapter again in the name of revision.The Above points are highly efficient if you fall in love with the chapter , do not read the chapter just because you have to. Tip: If you go through the chapter before the teacher teaches you , Things would become extremely easy after the lesson ( If you pay attention to your lessons , And that is Highly important ! ). Some chapters might be extremely boring , spend more time to such topics and focus more on practicing and never skip point 2 for such chapters ! THAT\u2019S A HUGE Mistake. In case your teacher is not up to the mark, try searching for online videos. High quality content is available for free in YouTube these days ! Make the most out of it. This is my first answer on Quora ! Critics are welcome. Kindly Upvote if you found this useful. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m too sleepy to properly answer this question but I remember studying those books religiously and I can tell you from experience that the most efficient way to skim through them is as follows: Read the chapters as if your final exam is tomorrow and you\u2019re cramming for the test. Convince yourself that this is your situation.Take notes as you read. Take an A4 sheet of paper, fold it in half and write in the smallest font-size that you can easily read and understand in the last minute.Don\u2019t just write the headings in these notes, write the points too. You don\u2019t have to write full sentences. Your goal is to cram as much information onto a sheet as possible. If you want, mind-map.Always do all the excercises in the back of text. You won\u2019t believe how tough some of thos questions really are. Don\u2019t wait for your teachers to tell you to do it, just do it. Don\u2019t waste time!If you ever get stuck on a question, ask your teacher. If their answer doesn\u2019t satisfy you, search the internet. Maybe Quora knows.Always research into the things you don\u2019t understand. Learning to understand new words will help you become a better student.Take new notes every time you read and compare the new ones with the old. Compile the best points together to make decent study material, full of diagrams and equations needed to ace the exam. Commit that information to heart.When you\u2019re done with your academic year, donate your books to those in need. Shere this advice and if you\u2019re notes were good enough, typset it using LaTeX and sell it to students who need it.Hope this advice helps. Best of Luck! Study Well :) ",
