            "answer_text": "Hopefully you will gain something positive from the book. I write several genre\u2019s. I have written about characters that got involved in drugs, and I had to clean them up, make them productive members of Society, provided them with lucrative jobs, those are the type of lives that some people are struggling with. What I am conveying is, please do not get involved with drugs, they can ruin your life, and hopefully once you have read my book, you will abstain from a lifestyle such as that.. I write real life anthems, no topic is too degrading for me to tackle, I write them all! Regards, Author Dia Stone ",
