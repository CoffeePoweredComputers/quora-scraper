            "answer_text": "Throughout the history of this planet most books had been written without the help of Computers. Back in the day anyone who wished to be a writer really needed to have some basic spelling and grammar skills. Vocabulary and style had to be increased basically via study and practice. All things were written by using a pencil or pen on a paper tablet and then by around the 1860\u2019s the typewriter happened and made the entire process easier. Writers still had to hone their spelling and grammar skills but much of the actual plan and design of a story was done by the writer using pen and paper. Very few writers cold wrote their stories, meaning starting at Chapter 1 page 1 and creating every aspect of the story, making it up as you went along. This is the most difficult way to write and mistakes riddle the continuity and almost every other aspect of the book. Today we have personal computers and laptops, and even cell phones, where people can perform the actual act of writing. We do, however, still must design and plan-out our books, if we wish to write something of value that would have future staying power. If you wish to get a detailed examination of how to write \u2014 and especially how to write literature, I would recommend my text book available on Amazon\u2014 Creative Process for Writers: A Reference.

            "answer_text": "I write a lot by hand, actually I seem to do better when I write in a notebook instead on a computer. By the way you can get tablets from Dollar Tree for a dollar. With a computer you tend to stop and correct your mistakes, when you are writing in long hand you notice the mistakes and simply tell yourself \u201cI\u2019ll catch it on the edit.\u201d You spend more time on creating rather than correcting. On more than one occasions I have derailed my train of thought because I went back to correct something I didn\u2019t like. When you are unsing a pin you stay more focused and your creativity tends to flow better. ",
