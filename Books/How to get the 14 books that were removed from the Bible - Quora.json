I think you are talking about the deuterocanonical texts that you\u2019ll find in Catholic and Orthodox translations. That\u2019s easy; pick up a Catholic translation. The NAB is probably the most commonly-available here in the US. My favorite Catholic translation is the New Jerusalem Bible, but you might have to order it online unless you\u2019re near a university, Catholic bookstore, or large public library. If you\u2019re a KJV person, the 1611 version did contain the Apocrypha, and this looks like a place to find it: Read the King James Version w/ Apocrypha Free Online Just as a note, those texts are also deuterocanonical in the Hebrew Bible. That is, they\u2019re part of the Jewish tradition, but don\u2019t hold the weight of authority found in the Torah. ",

            "answer_text": "You can read any book or periodical you want. The question is, is it expedient to do so. The 39 books of the old testament (or Tanakh to a Jew) and 27 books of the New Testament were accepted by all. There are some books called Apocrypha that are accepted by some. There is the Pseudepigrapha which are writings rejected by all. If you read any/all of them, anything outside of the 66 books are not to be taken over the 66 books for doctrine. Some may disagree with me because their church may base many of their doctrines from writings outside the 66 books of Holy writ. The expediency relates to your intent. Only God knows your heart and purposes. You are accountable to God, not men. Jesus said: Luk 21:33 KJV Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. and Rev 22:18-20 KJV 18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. 20 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. Hope that helps. All Scriptures are from the King James version of the Bible. ",

It is the Bible that Jesus and the Disciples quote from, and it contains all of the books the Protestants removed during the Reformation. It is the version used by the Eastern Orthodox Church. Most Protestant Bibles are based on the Masoretic text, which was done by a group of Jewish scholars between 700 and 1000 AD. There is a Septuagint on line, But I prefer the translation of the Orthodox Study Bible, and the notes are very extensive. It is available in both hard and electronic formats.
