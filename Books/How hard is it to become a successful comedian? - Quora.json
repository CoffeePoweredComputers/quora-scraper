            "answer_text": "I imagine it would be more difficult than most other performing professions. Comedy is extremely subjective, more so than music. It is not easy to make people laugh, and to do it on a stage in front of a large crowd takes guts. A lot of people think Will Ferrell is hilarious. I find him mildly amusing at best. It's impossible to make everyone laugh and impossible not to offend people, someone will always find your jokes offensive and in this day in age they have a bigger soapbox to stand on. All that being said, if you are thinking of becoming a comedian I say go for it. Just remember, funny people say funny things, comedians say things funny. ",

            "answer_text": "It is very hard to become a successful comedian, meaning, your sole income is made from performing in comedy clubs and colleges across the country. If you work hard at the art of standup, as in write and perform locally several times a week, and you study the craft of joke writing and performing, after 8 years you just might be ready to headline a small room. Think about what you have to do: You are writing a 50 minute play and you are the only character in that play. You have to write and perfect every joke, every bit, every routine. And that takes time and commitment. Is it hard? Yes. But it\u2019s a lot of fun. Good luck! ",
