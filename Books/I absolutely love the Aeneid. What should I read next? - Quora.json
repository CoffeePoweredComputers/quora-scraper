            "answer_text": "Did you read it in the original? If so, you might want to explore the rest of Vergil. The English Poet Laureate John Dryden, who translated the Georgics in the seventeenth century, called that \"the greatest poem by the greatest poet.\" But another, perhaps even better, recommendation is that you should proceed immediately to Ovid's Metamorphoses. For the first half of the work you may find yourself perplexed as to why I recommend this, though you will be unspeakably delighted by what you find (it was Shakespeare's favorite book for good reason). But in the second half we find ourselves in the Trojan War, and we get the first full-blown major revisioning of Vergilian mythopoeia in the Latin language. The vates meets the smiling destroyer, the vatic anti-vates. For a Latinist, especially one sensitive to allusion, this is like a big party. Also, for a really fascinating adventure, try your hand at the Epicurean didactic poem Vergil borrowed so much from: Lucretius' De rerum Natura. That's an experience you'll never forget. The opening 110 or so lines will sell you on this poem right away -- and the account of the cattle plague in Noricum toward the end is killer. And then there's also his amazing Epicurean advice about sex. And the great metaphor of poetry as the sugar on the rim of the cup that helps the dogmatic medicine go down. This poem is a favorite among learned atheists, by the way, because is positively blasts religious superstition. In fact, it's commonplace to translate appearances of the word religio in this poem as \"superstition.\" The interrelationships between Vergil and Lucretius are rich and strange. And there's a host of Roman epics that follow. Lucan's Bellum civile rethinks Vergil in fascinating ways. And there are the poems of Silius Italicus and Statius and others. None of these are serious rivals to Vergil or Ovid or Lucretius in purely aesthetic terms, though.  What are some authentic rivals? If you aren't afraid of other languages, though, let me name four other poems you will like at least as much, either because Vergil drew on them or because they draw in astonishing ways on Vergil and his contemporaries (and in the English case, his antecedents). These four world-beating poems of the West are: The IliadThe Odyssey (both of these in Greek!)Dante Alighieri, La Commedia (ineptly retitled The Divine Comedy later on; in Italian terza rima that is the strongest poetry I've ever read in any language)John Milton, Paradise LostPlease note that you need not be a Christian, or even like Christianity, to appreciate the latter two: they are above all fascinating interventions in the epic tradition. Let me also mention that between Homer and Vergil there is a great Hellenistic mini-epic that influenced that latter a lot: Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautika. There are also a lot of Renaissance epics you might find tonic as well -- these poems are under-studied, which is a shame. These, too, are to be read in the original languages, and all show the influence of Vergil and Ovid and Dante, intermixed with other Romance-language authors and the grand tradition of European Romance, which gives us the great bodies of story about Arthur, Charlemagne, et al.: Boiardo, Orlando InnamoratoAriosto, Orlando FuriosoTasso, Gerusalemme LiberataSpenser, The Faerie QueeneIf you like these, you should also play around with the poetry of Boccaccio, Chaucer, du Bartas, Trissino. In a more classicizing, Romance-free mode, you can also read Latin poems like: Petrarch, AfricaVida, ChristiadSannazaro, De partu virginisFracastoro, SyphilisRonsard, Franciade (a noble failure)Camo\u00ebs, Os Lusiadas Milton, Paradise Regain'dAnd this is, believe me, a very incomplete list. Last but not least, don't deprive yourself of what writers like Alexander Pope were able to do with both the larger and more miniature derivarives of Homeric and Vergilian epos (epic and epyllion, archaic and Alexandrian). Check out Pope's The Rape of the Lock (read first Catullus' Latin version [Carm. 66] of Callimachus' fragment on Berenice's hair [from his Aetia]). And above all, read the Dunciad and you'll laugh out loud. For two very different turns on the Vergilian legacy in the 19th century, you might want to conclude this ambitious program with Wordsworth's The Prelude and Byron's Don Juan. Byron's is probably the only long poem in English as funny as The Dunciad. That should keep you busy and happy for a while. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Have you read Homer's Iliad? That's what Virgil would have been brought up on, and is the original behind a lot of his riffs and tributes in the Aeneid.  If you want something similar but different, Ovid's Metamorposes is his tongue in cheek 'epic' poem, which is by turns tragic and comic, (and sometimes highly tedious, as with many long works). Both of them are definitely translated into Dutch. If you want something classical but closer to a modern novel: 'Metamorphoses' of Lucius Apuleius - lots of weird supernatural stories linked together by a bizarre narrative. 'Leucippe and Cleitophon' by Achilles Tatius - a more wholesome, rollicking Dan Brown style novel from the 1st millenium. 'Daphnis and Chloe' - Longus, a slow-burning romance novel, recommended by Dante as a book that should be read once a year. Enjoy!  ",
