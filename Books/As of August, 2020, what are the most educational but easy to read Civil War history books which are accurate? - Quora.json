            "answer_text": "Like Nuclear Physics, the American Civil war is neither a short or easy subject to understand or discuss with with both meaning and understanding. So I will offer the advice to visit a good used book store or website to find: Joseph Allan Nevins\u2019 (American historian and journalist, known for his extensive work on the history of the Civil War) greatest work, Ordeal of the Union. 8 Vols., New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1947. This eight (8) volume work was and still is the touchstone of comprehensive history of the coming of the Civil war, and the war itself. (Nevins died before he could address Reconstruction, and thus his masterwork ends in 1865). His work remains the most detailed political, economic and military narrative of the whole of the Civil War era. Some historians say its written with a slight but perceptible pro-Union bias, but Nevis\u2019 last two volumes jointly won the 1972 U.S. National Book Award in History. Buy it used on-line, Take a couple of years to read it through. It will be the most educational, and easy to read and the most accurate (what did they do, and when did they do it?; and what did they know, and when did the know it?), disquisition on the war, the peoples, their countries, and their world.

            "answer_text": "As of August, 2020, what are the most educational but easy to read Civil War history books which are accurate? I endorse the suggestions from others about Battle Cry of Freedom, and the three volumes from Shelby Foote. To those I would add multiple works by Bruce Catton: the Army of the Potomac trilogy (Mr Lincoln\u2019s Army, Glory Road, and A Stillness at Appomatox). his two books on Grant (Grant Moves South and Grant Takes Command, which are follow-ons to a book called Captain Sam Grant by another author), and his centennial history (The Coming Fury, Terrible Swift Sword, and Never Call Retreat). As Mr Charbonneau said of Foote\u2019s three books, these are not short, but neither was the war. There are also excellent books focused on single battles or single campaigns. Among the best of these is Landscape Turned Red, about Antietam by Stephen Sears, and his book about Gettysburg. There are many, many books about Gettysburg. This will earn me some enemies, but Douglas Southall Freeman wrote a long biography of R E Lee and then a multi-volume history called \u201cLee\u2019s Lieutenants\u201d which is full of information but is written in what is to me an annoying and difficult style. He won at least one Pulitzer Prize so my opinion might be a minority one, but if you are looking for easy reads even if long, I\u2019d come to his books only after reading a lot of the others. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s MUY cool that you want to delve into such a subject. My favorite is a book about situations pre civil war where Jefferson Davis petitioned the US Govt to uphold provisions in the Hidalgo Treaty and so build up the Army which had fallen into disarray in order to control the Comanches. He used it to hand pick graduates from West Point (ones sympathetic to the South) and harden them in order to get a jump on an imminent war. There are tacit editorials such as the fact that JD imposed a purchase of Grey Kentucky race horses (all of the same size) as the new cadres\u2019s mounts. They, however died in droves since they preferred soft Kentucky blue grass and sweet spring water to tumbleweed, cactus and tequila. I cant remember the title though, sorry. There was also a book which discussed the history of Texas which anyone growing up north, east or west of it just doesn\u2019t understand. Why are so many road names of German or Irish lineage ? Why so many blondes with \u201cbig hair\u201d, why do men wear such decorative shoes. Why are street names with Spanish or Czech names butchered so badly? Etc. Why are there towns that have yodeling contests and use German as the language of business, even today. Why didn't the Comanches attach Fredericksburg Tx ? Why is there a road named after a family member of Robert E Lee. Again can't remember the title. There was one abut the guy involved in research and development of a submarine and how he almost got caught. He was shot but escaped and when clear of danger noticed that a coin that his girlfriend mailed to him acted as bullet armor and deflected a bullet. SO SO Many. I do look forward to reading this one : The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government \u2026 and how Jefferson Davis had second doubts. ",

They are historically accurate novels and the first 2 made into movies by Ted Turner. I also recommend the memoirs of U.S. Grant, and Jefferson Davis. The are both long but very interesting. You should read the biography of Robert E. Lee by Korda. He is such a compelling person to read about. ",

Though it\u2019s about 900 pages long, it\u2019s a book that can be read and enjoyed by someone with a high school education. I couldn\u2019t recommend it more highly. ",
