            "answer_text": "I am 10th pass student with 90% above marks and I would suggest you to go with your NCERT only. You need no reference book to study your science or social science. For maths I would suggest you R. D. Sharma. That\u2019s all you need for your boards. Read only ncert. For phyics numericals, you may go for MBD or H. C. Verma. Just practice maths and phyics numericals. And for theory read NCERT. Your NCERT is you best book. I bet you\u2019ll do nice if you\u2019ll only read NCERT. References will only confuse you and they have extra stuff that you have to read in 11th. So don\u2019t waste your time start from today onwards. Boards paper is easy but checking is really strict. My favourite line: read one book 4 times other than reading 1 book four times. Thank me later! Best of luck for your boards. You can follow me on quora so that if you have any confusion regarding boards, I\u2019ll answer you with best tips possible because I gave 10th just in March\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, let me tell you 10 boards is not as tough as it is said to be. You can score very well if your basics and the concepts are clear. The best book for science is the NCERT textbook itself. You don\u2019t need to refer any other book. NCERT have the theories very well explained. For the numerical, try to solve previous years\u2019 papers. They have it all covered. Solve all the textual questions and read the chapters thoroughly. For practice, you may try to solve questions from OSWAAL QUESTION BANK. They have all the types of questions which can be asked in the exams.  You can buy these books from the website of MyPustak for FREE. MyPustak is a philanthropic organization that delivers you the books at your doorstep absolutely FREE OF COST.
