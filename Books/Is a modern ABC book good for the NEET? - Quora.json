            "answer_text": "Hey! NO, I really dont think modern ABC is the appropriate book for NEET prep\u2026 Though it can help you with the 12 grade exams. For NEET-UG, 1st, For the KNOWLEDGE part -primarily you should go for NCERT first surely and after that for extra knowledge Allen packages or Trueman\u2019s for biology would be more than sufficient. 2nd, For the APPLICATION part- buy sample paper books of previous years question papers to practice ,after retaining the theoretical content. Apply ur knowledge in the questions\u2026!! ",
