            "answer_text": "The publishing bit is the easy part. It\u2019s a simple matter of following the guidelines at Amazon KDP (Kindle Desktop Publishing). Very easy to do since the documentation is excellent. In my own case I produce the book as a MS Word docx file. You can submit that directly to Amazon if you wish but I first convert it to an epub file in calibre ebook management program. That gives me more control over the finished appearance. What\u2019s NOT so easy are the other parts of publishing: Editing the manuscript is a tedious chore in which you will get sick of reading it through again and again to make improvements. You may think you know what is required but it\u2019s a skill which takes years to acquire. This is probably something best left to an experienced professional and it can be expensive.Formatting the manuscript for print and ebooks is easier BUT you need to know what to look for. Do you know how to vertically align the front matter pages? Do you know what front matter pages are? Do you know what styles are used for the body text? For example paragraphs are normally first line indented but the first line after a heading or text separator is not normally indented.You\u2019ll need a book cover. It will have a major effect on your book sales. Can you design an eye catching one? Do you know what makes it eye catching? It has to work at thumbnail size. You have lots to think about from complimentary colors and contrasting colors, a layout which tracks the reader\u2019s eye, typefaces, rule of thirds, golden ratio. Do you know how to trigger emotion and expectations using these?No one will ever see your cover unless they are able to find your book among the millions of other books. You\u2019ll need to research keywords to help with this. Amazon ask for \u2018up to seven\u2019 but the reality is you need about a thousand and you\u2019ll need to put them in appropriate places - the book description and first three chapters for example. Getting the keywords right - especially the seven Amazon asks for - will make a huge difference to sales.You need a book description. The keywords allow your book to be found. The cover attracts the eye but the description is what sells the book. You can enter up to 5,000 characters but by far the most important are the first five lines of it. (Four if you use any HTML in it). Your description has to be engaging enough to get the reader to click that \u2018Read more\u2019 which Amazon will place at the end of those five lines. The whole description has to leave a \u2018Wow! I have to read that!\u2019 impact.Finally, you need to think about price.As I said the publishing bit is easy but publishing well is not. Once you have clicked the Publish button your really hard task begins. It\u2019s much harder than writing, editing, cover design, formatting and publishing. It\u2019s marketing your book. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are my tips for publishing on Amazon:   NAME IT WELL Did you know that Stephanie Meyer named her book \u201cForks\u201d before it was picked up by Little Brown and Co. who changed the name to \u201cTwilight\u201d? While the first title is the name of the town in which Twilight was set, if you didn\u2019t know that, \u201cForks\u201d is an awful title\u2026 and the publishing house knew that. If you are having difficulties in finding a good name for your work, check out the A/B testing site PickFu. What you can do with this site is put up two different titles and people will vote on them so you can see what a random selection of people think. Not bad, right? Keep running tests on your titles until you get it narrowed down.  DRESS YOUR BOOK FOR SUCCESS I\u2019ve stressed this many times before, but authors need to understand that the cover is so very important to the books success. It is the face of your book and people willjudge it by that cover! Just as in business you need to dress for the title you want not the title you have, you should also think this way for your book. Want it to be a best-seller? Dress it like a best-seller! So\u2026 how the heck do I do that? First of all, take your cover seriously. Please don\u2019t just slap some royalty-free images together on Canva and call it good. You will have to invest some money on this unless you are more than positive that you are a stellar graphic designer. If not, do not do it yourself. Seriously, just stop it! Great\u2026 I have to spend money\u2026 Yes, you do. Fortunately, there are options here, depending on your budget. **I can afford the very best right now ($300+) Perhaps you have money to spend on a great cover. There are several designers that I recommend that will knock it out of the park: Damonza.comPaper and SageBespoke Book Covers**I have a bit to spend, but not much ($75-$250) This isn\u2019t a bad situation to be in either. There are several designers that pre-design covers which you can select from. The process is easy\u2026 pick a design, send them your cover info and voila! Your cover is done. Go On WriteThe Cover CollectionCreative Paramita**I have a very limited budget. Please help!! ($25\u201375) My only recommendation here is to check out Fiverr. It can be really iffy looking for a designer here, but if you investigate the reviews and look at their work, you might be able to find a steal.  WHAT\u2019S IN A BLURB When publishing your book, you must describe your tale so that it\u2019s interesting and making the potential reader want more. Do this, and your golden. Don\u2019t and your lost to oblivion. Not sure how to craft a worthy blurb? Remember that success leaves clues. Check out the best-selling books in your genre and have a look at their blurbs. How are they written? What do they provide and what do they tease with? Follow their example and craft yours in a similar fashion. Another tip is to utilize plenty of sensory words. You want that potential reader to \u2018feel\u2019 your story.  KEEP CURRENT CUSTOMERS ON THE HOOK It is far easier to keep current customers than to find new ones, so make sure you are giving them a reason to stick around. In order to do this, you\u2019ll need a email list. **Setting it up I like Mail Chimp but there are many more out there. This is free up to X many subscribers, so it\u2019s great for people just getting started. Simply set up a list and then a collection link. **Collect Now that you have a sign-up form, you can take that link and put it into the front and back of your books and say something along the lines of: \u201cSign-up here for news, short stories, and contests from the author!\u201d  MAKE FRIENDS WITH BOOK BLOGGERS There are tons of blogs on the net these days, and there are a lot of sites dedicated to reviewing/praising books in specific genres. Why not network with these bloggers? People read their blogs for advice on what books to read\u2026 think of the impact it could have to your book! Word of warning\u2026 please don\u2019t spam these folks. That will make them ignore you faster than you can blink. Be conversational. Talk to them about books that you like (not your own!) and see what they think. Get to know them. Once you\u2019ve established that relationship you can casually mention your works. Yes, this will take some time, but imagine where you\u2019ll be in three months of nurturing that relationship! ",
