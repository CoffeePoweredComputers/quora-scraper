            "answer_text": "Yes, I\u2019d think that one could read Introduction to Algorithms in a day. You wouldn\u2019t understand much of it, however. If you want to read and understand the book, then I recommend that you read it on Venus. On Venus, one day takes 5832 hours, or 243 Earth days. That should be doable. If you really apply yourself, you might be able to read the book in one day on Mercury: 1408 hours, or 58 2/3 Earth days. The only other planet in our solar system whose day takes longer than an Earth day is Mars, where a day takes 25 hours. That won\u2019t be enough to read and understand Introduction to Algorithms. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not possible for most people to read Introduction to Algorithms in a day, let alone comprehend or retain it. The 3rd edition is 1312 pages long, with a word count slightly over 400,000 words. Typical English readers read 200 words per minute. The fastest readers read at 1,000 words a minute with some comprehension. At 200 words a minute, It would take 33 hours to read every word in the book, longer than a day. At 1,000 words a minute you *could* read it in just under 7 hours. I don\u2019t believe the reader could comprehend much of it at that speed, though. The only thing sillier than your asking this question is my bothering to look up the data to answer it. ",
