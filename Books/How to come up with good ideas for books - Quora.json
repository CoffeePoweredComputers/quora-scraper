            "answer_text": "Book ideas often start as very simple concepts that, through further exploration, you realize has the potential to becomes something more. As an example, Annie Duke, former world poker champion and author, has explained her process for incubating book ideas: I started speaking to business and professional groups about decision strategy in 2002. Since 2012, after I retired from professional poker, that\u2019s been my main work. Those speeches were the starting point for the ideas in Thinking in Bets. The conceptual themes of different speeches overlap, but I want my approach to always be fresh. I\u2019d get bored giving the exact same speech I was giving in 2002\u2014or even repeating the exact speech I gave a month ago. So I am always trying out different ways into the material, new narratives to bolster the concepts, fresh ways to organize the material. Doing this in front of an audience, piecemeal, as I\u2019m giving different speeches, makes generating new ideas much less daunting than having to develop an entire book\u2019s worth of material in one fell swoop. Trying out new ideas and approaches to material through the speaking process acts like a workshop for those ideas. In terms of Thinking in Bets, I certainly had developed a lot of these ideas over the course of many years through my speaking. That being said, there are a lot of windows into a book on uncertainty, bias, and how to be a better decision maker. Finding the best window into the topic was a process that required a tribe. I had a tribe for Thinking in Bets. First, the audiences I\u2019ve spoken to acted as part of the tribe. Seeing how those audiences responded to differing approaches into the material helped me immensely in the development process. Second, my literary agent, Jim Levine, was a key part of the tribe. The process of writing the proposal forced me figure out how to translate material that I had mainly delivered in a spoken word format into the more linear format of the written word, which changed the framing in significant ways. Jim\u2019s input sharpened and refocused the material, taking the proposal in new and unexpected directions before we went to publishers. Third, Niki Papadopoulos, my editor at Portfolio, was tremendously helpful in guiding me toward \u201cthe betting window.\u201d In the book proposal, thinking about decisions as bets was a prominent theme but she made me see that as the headline. And, of course, all the amazing thinkers with whom I\u2019ve had the privilege of interacting were invaluable in helping to develop the ideas. Just as feeling out how audiences respond is important to developing the material, being really open minded to how the really smart people around me saw the material was helpful in terms of figuring out the window through which I should be looking at these issues. The practice of work-shopping an idea in front of an audience and gauging feedback is an essential part of the book writing process. You don\u2019t have to be a professional speaker to do this. You could do it online, for instance, but some version of this process will help you cull the bad book ideas from the good ones. ",
