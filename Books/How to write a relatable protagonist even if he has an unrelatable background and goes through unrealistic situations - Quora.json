            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to mention three characters that I could relate to although we have absolutely nothing in common. Then I\u2019m going to explain why I think these characters worked. They are Harry Potter, Arya Stark and Forrest Gump. Firstly, Harry Potter grew up as an orphan, slept in a closet under the stairs, and he was a wizard, which allowed him to do almost anything except bring his parents back to life. Lord Voldemort, on the other hand, seemed to return from the dead at will in almost every book. Then there is Arya Stark, the girl who really wanted to be a boy. She was born a Lady and grew up in a castle, loved by her Lord father who was best friends with the king. Then she loses everything and manages to escape disguised as a boy, living though hardship, being treated like a common peasant. But she learns to fight better than most men and becomes a trained assassin \u2014 not an admirable job in most societies but for some reason we all adore her. Why? Lastly, there\u2019s Forrest Gump, the dimwitted hero who the doctors said wouldn\u2019t amount to much due to his mental retardation. Yet his mother refuses to give up on him and he ends up achieving more in his life than most people ever will. Yet there is that one thing he cannot get. Love. He\u2019s childhood friend, a young girl who is abused by her father, grows up to be a wreck. Yet she is the one who Forrest loves the most and he simply cannot get her. All these characters have one thing in common. They want something that they simply cannot get. Love, to bring back lost ones, to fill some kind of empty hole in themselves that simply cannot be filled. That is what we find in these characters that we can relate to. That is something we all have in common. I think it is important to think of the base needs of any human and to take that away from your protagonist. Start with the most basic needs and work your way up until you find something you can work with. Physiological needs, safety needs, social and love needs, esteem needs, and the need to be the best we can be. Deprive your character of what he/she needs on an emotional level. Emotional needs are the same, whether you are a wizard or an idiot. ",

            "answer_text": "By making them flawed. Readers feel connected to characters who are like them because they are not perfect. And that\u2019s what makes it interesting; the conflict your character experiences because they struggle with their imperfection. One example is \u201chubris\u201d and you may have heard it before. It's the overconfidence in oneself. You don't have to use that example but give your character something to struggle with. This will help make your character relatable; the inner struggle with whatever flaw(s) they have. So no matter what background he/she has or situations he/she may encounter, your readers will better relate to, sympathize with and connect with your protagonist when they see that he/she struggles with hardships too.
