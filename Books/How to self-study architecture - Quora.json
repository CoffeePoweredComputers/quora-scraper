            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by architecture. If your talking about the history and theory of architecture then you can find that information in books at a library. An Architecture library at a university that has the major has enough books to make your head spin. Once you read up on general history and theory then you will start to develop \" favorites\" like gothic or post modern or deconstructivist. Once your at that point you should gear your vacations towards experiencing those types of buildings and seeing the spaces you've read and learned about. If your talking about the trade of architecture. Thats a different story. The only real way to learn how to effectively draw construction documents and communicate with a contractor and the motley crew of consultants is through practice. You will really need a mentor that takes you under thier wing and even then, it takes years. I would say 10\u201315 years depending on circumstance before you can really run a project with out anyone helping you and even then its good to have a network of people with alot of experience that you can go to with questions. Every project you do will have things you've never seen before and it helps to surround yourself with \"gurus\". ",
