            "answer_text": "I'm not totally sure whether you are curious about how researchers actually do this, or if there are tools to help them do it better or in a more tech-savvy way. First, Dena is right. Researchers nowadays make extensive uses of photocopiers, scanning-to-PDF [and then maybe indexing using something like Zotero] or they just keep the book around on the shelf with some general notion of what's inside it that they've highlighted. Other slightly more effective ways including copy/OCR into something that organizes research for you. I've seen people who write fiction using Scrivener or other writing tools for this. I've seen people have their TAs or other assistants do this. CastingWords has become a popular way of doing transcription but I don't know if they do this sort of thing.  http://castingwords.com/ I've seen people just copy it out themselves. Really if you type 90 words per minute sometimes just typing the stuff out is the simplest way to go about it. And yes, DRM is limiting for people who want to copy things out of eBooks but again this limitation is surmountable depending on what you are actually trying to do. Many epub formats have DRM that is trivial to defeat and researchers who are just making a copy for themselves that is keyword indexable aren't likely to get in trouble with the copyright police. So, the general answer to how researchers do this is: they consume a lot of paper and keep an awful lot for things indexed in their brains. I, too, would be curious to see if there are new models that are more useful in their application than they are onerous in their ease of use. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question and it may very well turn out to be a learning opportunity for me. As far as I know most researchers still extract information from books the old-fashioned way, via photographing, scanning or photocopying. I am guessing the lucky ones have assistants to carry out the process. I hadn't looked into Mechanical Turk before you mentioned it. Looks to me like you could probably use them if you photographed or scanned the books pages, but then I'm not sure how much time you would end up saving.  A handheld pen scanner might be another reasonable solution for books, but I don't think that helps you with eBooks. I hadn't noticed until a second ago that Mahmoud had already suggested this, but I will add that a quick look at some Amazon reviews confirms that some academics are using this method successfully. A few seem to have difficulty with the technology, but they are in the minority. In the case of eBooks, it does seem as though you can only copy and paste if they are not DRM-protected. It looks like the iPad may have a workaround for this, but I've never done it myself. ",
