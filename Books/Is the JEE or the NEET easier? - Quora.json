            "answer_text": "Well I appeared in both NEET and JEE Advanced 2018, so I think I am eligible to answer this. I cleared NEET with an AIR of 28k. I got a state rank of 826 and thus could get a seat in a govt medical college in West Bengal. Now coming to my JEE ,I cleared JEE mains with a rank of 22k. I got a rank of 10,904 in jee adv. It was not enough to land me into one of the iits. I got a rank of 258 in wbjee and have currently joined Jadavpur University with electrical engineering. Now here is the important thing I studied for jee advanced for 1.5 years. Still I could not get into one of the iits. But for me NEET came as a by product. I studied biology for only 1 week before the exam and got pretty good marks in bio. I donot want to hurt anyones feelings or compare medical with engineering. But I would say that for me NEET was way easier than jee advanced. The main reasons are: NEET is conducted by CBSE so you can be sure that at least 80% of the questions would be from NCERT. On the other hand you know from where jee adv questions come( Leave alone questions no one can ever predict the paper pattern)The competition is a lot harder in jee advanced. Iit has only 10k seats in total.I know this point will create a lot of debate but I am still including it. Iitjee tests your concept clarity,your presence of mind and many other things through different kinds of questions like matrix match, integer types etc. On the other hand NEET does not test you on so many grounds. I would like to say that in the medical world AIIMS is equivalent to iitjee.Thank you for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "If we talk about the level of question paper then JEE is tougher than NEET. But one should not compare an exam on the basis of level of question paper rather the exam should be compared on how difficult it is to get a seat in the respective engineering or medical college by appearing in the exam. Let me describe - JEE is conducted by IIT's and NEET is conducted by CBSE.To get a seat in any IIT you have to clear both JEE Mains and Advanced.JEE mains includes one paper of three hours duration and JEE advanced includes two papers of three hours duration.NEET includes one paper of three hours duration.Physics and chemistry are common in both JEE and NEET.The third subject in JEE is Maths whereas it is biology in NEET.Biology is further divided in Botany and Zoology in the question paper.There will be 45 question per subject and a total of 180 questions. In JEE mains there are 30 questions per subject and a total of 90 questions.The pattern of JEE advanced is not fixed and the no. of questions and type of questions changes every year!In NEET you will score 4 marks for each correct answer and will loose 1 mark for each wrong answer.The same pattern follows on JEE mains. The negative marking in JEE advanced is sometimes higher.Now if we talk about the toughness level. Then it is easy to get a seat in an NIT (which we can get by clearing only JEE mains) compared to getting a seat in a medical college,whereas it is tough to crack JEE advanced and get a seat in IIT. JEE preparation requires a decent IQ whereas NEET preparation requires hard work. You should not choose JEE if you are interested in only maths but you should choose it if you are interested in physics(as you have to study physics a lot in engineering) and choose NEET if you are interested in medical science. If you will choose according to your interest you will definitely clear any exam. Thank you! ",
