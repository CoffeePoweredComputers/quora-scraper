            "answer_text": "Even though digital influence wasn\u2019t around back then, the basics of human connection remain the same as in 1937: How you choose to connect with people (online or offline) influences your business. When you win influencers and friend people you bring your A+ game to the (poker) table. This allows you to: Gain new insights into your industryHave funWin new business along the wayIt\u2019s like getting dealt the joker in every play. But not everyone is so lucky. It takes charisma and wit to get the joke(r). And the stats prove it: Crowdtap, a company that helps businesses run influence marketing initiatives, polled 1,000 people to share how they were influenced to make a purchase in the past three months. Their research found that 92% of consumers trust recommendations from peers over all other forms of advertising. According to Branderati, marketing-induced consumer-to-consumer word of mouth generates more than 2X the sales of paid advertising. Offers shared by trusted advocates convert at 4\u201310x higher rate than offers sent by brands. According to studies made at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, 85% of one\u2019s financial success is due to skill in human engineering\u200a\u2014\u200ato personality and the ability to lead people. And \u201cleading people\u201d\u009d is Dale Carnegie\u2019s 1937 term for \u201cinfluencer marketing\u201d (he just didn\u2019t know it at the time). It\u2019s all about engaging people within your niche, building solid relationships, and shaping buying behaviors in an authentic way. When you use your authenticity, you set a strong foundation for your content marketing strategy, and you empower your consumer to tell your brand story. This allows you to always play the winning hand to set your business up for future success.  Here are some ideas for how to win influencers and friend people in real life if you\u2019re running a business: 1. Create User-Generated Content One of the best ways to hit the trifecta at Vegas is to create User Generated Content (UGC). Or as I like to call it: Undeniable Glorious Connections. Here\u2019s why: Millennials are spending over five hours a day consuming UGC. It\u2019s this content that influences what they buy. When you make UGC the center of your content marketing strategy, you create content that acts as memorable experiences for your brand. The bonus is that UGC is 40% more trustworthy than traditional media sources. But don\u2019t just keep up\u200a\u2014\u200akeep honest. Dale Carnegie would file this concept under basic \u201crelationship management\u201d\u009d because it\u2019s this type of trust that keeps your customers coming back. He describes it as \u201cthe legal tender that all souls enjoy.\u201d Mmmm\u2026.legal tender. 2. Come to the (poker) table with a (soulful) strategy. The best influencers and content marketers (and dare I say it, growth hackers) have a pre-established audience who are already receptive to their ideas and recommendations. So you\u2019ll want to align with those who have similar values to your brand. Don\u2019t collaborate with someone because he or she is \u201cinsta-famous.\u201d Instead, strive for a meaningful collaboration so that you find the right influencers to mutually benefit from the relationship. Always position yourself in the seat of your customers to create the most meaningful strategy. But don\u2019t just \u201cadd more stuff\u201d to your strategy. Create minimalist content so that you can live a life that\u2019s an authentic expression of your Truth. It\u2019s from this space that we can create content with context from your unique perspective (preferably one with a view of the strip!)  The above photo was my view the last time I was in Vegas, taken from the 61st floor of The Cosmopolitan during CES (I think I\u2019m still recovering from this trip!) With a good view, you can build the best user experience so that you can\u2026 3. Focus on the entire user experience. Despite the scene of Vegas, content marketing is not just a wham, bam, thank you ma\u2019am approach. It\u2019s more meaningful than a one-night stand, so you\u2019ll want to think about what happens after the act of publication. Yeah, that (the fun stuff!) Keep in mind that 90% of Millennials are brand agnostic. So here some questions to consider. How will your content help your customers: LearnEntertainBuyAnswering these questions shows that you have a genuine interest in your customers\u200a\u2014\u200awhich helps not only their success but yours too\u200a\u2014\u200aregardless of what hand you play.

            "answer_text": "The advice in the book is obvious, but it\u2019s the stories that really show you how you can use it in real life. Here\u2019s one of my favorite stories in the book: Are you being ignored? Then find a better incentive: Andrew Carnegie (not related to Dale Carnegie) had nephews who were bad at keeping in touch with family. Their parents would write them, but no reply. Naturally, their parents were disappointed and upset. Carnegie knew how to get a reply from the boys. He wrote each of them a letter asking how they were, just as the parents did. But he did something different: he mentioned that he enclosed money in the letter, but didn\u2019t include the money! As he expected, now that he had created an incentivize to reply, both nephews wrote back to their dear uncle Andrew. The advice (\u201cgive a strong incentive\u201d) is obvious, but it\u2019s not until you see the story that you can see how to apply it. You can apply the story above in a zillion ways: Writing cold emailsGetting the attention of journalistsAsking someone out on a dateMore stories from the book here: How To Win Friends & Influence People: Summary with Stories ",
