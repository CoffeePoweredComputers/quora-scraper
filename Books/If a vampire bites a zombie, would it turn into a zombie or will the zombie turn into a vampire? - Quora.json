            "answer_text": "Realistically a vampire would never bite a zombie because they can\u2019t partake of dead blood without poisonous repercussions. Only the blood of the living, a freshly dead human still possessing the traces of a life force, or certain living dead creatures such as other vampires. In addition vampires find zombies to be absolutely disgusting on all levels. Their stench makes them ill, and their blood is quite repellent acting as a potent poison. We only know the effects of zombie blood on vampires due to historical accounts of small amounts being slipped to them while mixed with other blood along with modern cryptozoological laboratory research studies. A vampire drinking zombie blood, that is if he could withstand the wretched taste, would fall immediately ill for several hours as his body fights off the zombie virus. During this time the vampire is greatly weakened, and vulnerable. However he, or she will easily survive since their demonic based DNA, and the vampire virus within their bodies, are more powerful than any strain of the zombification virus. In addition there will never be a vampire-zombie hybrid even if a vampire went through the process of trying to transform one. The two paranormal physiology\u2019s simply aren\u2019t compatible. What Happens When A Zombie Bites A Vampire? If a zombie bit a vampire you have the introduction of the zombie virus into the vampires body. Again the vampire would weaken for some matter of hours depending on their age, and what generation they are. However the introduction through zombie saliva is much less devastating as opposed to the vampire actually ingesting their putrid blood. The zombie would be mashed to bits within seconds of biting the vampire. That is if the vampire themselves weren\u2019t so powerful that the zombie couldn\u2019t chomp through their dense supernatural flesh. Also no zombie-vampire hybrid would occur. Just a temporarily sick vampire, and probably a dead zombie. It\u2019s doubtful that even an entire hoard of zombies could destroy a vampire. If the vampire was incapacitated, and they kept biting him, he could not die from any amount of the zombification virus. In fact too much ingestion of vampire flesh, and blood by a zombie would probably cause it\u2019s final death through the superior vampire virus that would devastate an inferior living dead body. Since a zombie is a rotting pile of flesh they really don\u2019t get sick so it\u2019s either business as usual, or final non-animated death. ",

            "answer_text": "A zombie lacks a circulatory system. The bite is not enough because a vampire has to slit their flesh and offer their blood to the victim. It is called \u201coffering / Accepting the Dark Gift.\u201d Willing or not, once they drink that contaminated blood, the victim will change - IF they are simultaneously drinking and being drank from. Mutuality is the key.A zombie has no \u201cfree will\u201d - no power of choice. Within living blood, there is the soul, or so the ancients believed. A zombie is undead - corpse animated, though brainless, with no powers of reasoning, no power of choice.A victim needs to have the blood of the vampire flow throughout their bodies. Again - zombies have no circulation. There would be no effect.Please understand that where there is the blood, then there, too, is the continuance of the vampire\u2019s existence. He or she could gain no sustenance. It would be like you sitting down to a bountiful meal not of meat but of the hair from the animal. Vegetarian? Not spared there either - enjoy your tree bark. Among the Dead, including the Undead ~ there are rules set which are not to be dissuaded. Undead are a blasphemy among the living, an abomination among the dead. The undead - a corpse animated by a spirit essence which grants mobility, limited intelligence to brilliant, former life, IQ are motivated by a variety of factors. Yet foremost - they are not likely to mix among each other. An exception . . . yes. Only one who was in life and continues beyond life, practicing foul necromancy - then they may continue. A zombie would be a guard-dog, perhaps walk a treadmill which circulates fresh air in an underground area, or some other basic, repeatable function while chained. Otherwise - a zombie is a decomposing walking contagion of over a dozen dangerous diseases. Vampires need to hunt outside their manse, or lair - though there are some who have kept \u201cfood on the hoof,\u201d namely to imprison and feed well their kidnapped victims whom they feed from. A zombie would be kept away or spoil the blood which they would sup from. No. There would reasonably be very little point in a vampire associating with a zombie. What minimal benefits it would provide as a captive mindless staggering thing of decay and rot . . . a human wishing immortality would be better. These humans are called \u201cThralls\u201d and have the primary function of being \u201cFixers\u201d - of doing preparation and secretarial duties, to provide access to daylight hour essentials of daily living, to be the one to show ID for rental, purchases, driving and the myriad other functions of keeping the Vampire current with the world. As long as that human drinks the vampires blood daily / nightly - they cease aging. So the vampire uses this as the proverbial \u201cCarrot on a stick.\u201d As long as the vampire is supplying the Aqua Vitae . . . the servant will not deteriorate. The \u201cDark Gift\u201d being withheld is a bargaining chip. Thralls are expendable but usually there is a specific master-servant / dominant-submissive relationship, rarely yet sometimes resembling mutually cooperative roommates. The dynamics can be basic - with threats or complex when you combine comradery and very, very rarely for there to be sex. Yes, a male vampire can redirect their reservoir of anatomical blood . . . even \u201csouth of the border\u201d and be capable of intimacies. Females, too have this, though obviously arousal with them taking less focal concentration. No birth control needed, as Vampires are corpses - their seed / eggs are dead as coffin nails. I digress \u2026\u2026.. Vampires are usually aristocratic because they can accumulate money. Looting the victims, using threat or hypnosis & making victims forget they drained their accounts through ATM withdrawal, money in the stock market and collecting higher yields over time. Perhaps even (so it is said) selling quantities of their blood to remove decades from a wealthy patron customer\u2019s span of years. So between zombies and vampires - theirs is a house divided. ",
