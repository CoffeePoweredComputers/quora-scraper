The question how to read it so that we can remember each and every bit of it without forgetting disturb everyone , But it is very easy to do . What you all need is just a strategy : Read the whole book ( both for 11th and for 12th) atleast twice. And in these two round of study all you need to do is try to memorise each and everything.While reading second time practice questions as well with every chapter , this will help you to get an idea of what is important for MCQs.Start reading these books for third time. This time you need to mark what is important for MCQs and what is not. Underline or highlight important things.After completing 3 times start 4th and last round , read the whole book again with special focus on what you marked as important.After all this you just have to practice question , that will help you to know what things you forget more oftenly. Make flash cards for them. And memorise them all.2 months before exam complete your one page notes for all chapters. read and revise this note max time you can.And one thing more focus on memorising not understanding.Thanks for reading \u2026.
