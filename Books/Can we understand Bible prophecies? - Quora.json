            "answer_text": "Can we understand Bible prophecies? Yes, we can, in most cases. But we have to understand the times they were written in. When you are solving a crime, you need to find out the motive. And when you are trying to understand why someone would want to publish a vague prediction which usually misses all the important details, you need to find out what made him do it. I am afraid the video referenced in this question does not do that. For example we find that many of the Bible\u2019s prophecies were about the countries that Israel was at war with. And they usually predict a good outcome for Israel and a bad one for its adversaries. For example, in Isaiah 7 through 9, we see a prophecy about a newborn prince who would become a light after a period of darkness. Once you understand what went on during the life of Isaiah, and how the Bible labels Ahaz as a bad king and his son Hezekiah as a good one, it\u2019s easy to understand what the author was referring to. In Micah 5 we see a prophecy that a king from Bethlehem would avenge Judah against Assyria. Reading it in context we find that this prophecy was made while Judah was surrounded by Assyrian troops. Bingo! Other prophecies were nothing but rants against the enemies. Tyre was supposed to be destroyed and never built again. Similar schadenfreude prophecies were issued against Moab, Egypt, Babylon, and others. What did all these have in common? They all surrounded Israel and all had conflicts with them. You don\u2019t find any prophecies against India or Australia or Japan! Most people completely ignore what the authors had in mind and interpret the prophecies from the perspective of what they believe today. Which is nothing but circular thinking. Many even apply these prophecies to situations after they occur instead of before they do, which is like predicting what you are going to eat yesterday. When Israel became a country again, when 9/11 happened, when Covid-19 struck - all such events sent many self-described biblical experts into a frenzy of The-Bible-Told-You-So! But, of course, none of these after-the-fact know-it-alls saw these events coming! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes we can. We just have to know one thing about Bible prophecy, and that is; The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy. (Revelation 19:10) Having this in mind makes us know that hearing and doing what Jesus says is the most important thing if we want to be right as Biblical prophesied events start unfolding. Here is a great video on how to Study Bible Prophecy;  The testimony of Jesus is found in the records by Matthew, Mark, Luke ad John. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The first thing to understand; \u201cprophesy\u201d is not a prediction. A prophet is not somebody who predicts future events. A prophet might warn for consequences of current behaviour or affairs. Many prophets in the bible give warnings about worshipping other gods, selfish behaviour. Prophets tried to encourage people to have faith during hard times. In Isaiah we read that the prophet encourage the king not to despair reminding him that the queen is pregnant, keeping the line of the dynasty. (Is. 7:14)So it is important, in order to understand the prophets one must know the circumstances, the time, the location, the audience of the prophet. Again prophets did not speak about a certain future, they warned how to avoid a catastrophic future. ",

Isaiah 11:12 \"He will raise a flag among the nations for Israel to rally around. He will gather the scattered people of Judah from the ends of the earth.\" (NLT) Isaiah 43:5-7 \"'Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will gather you and your children from east and west and from north and south. I will bring my sons and daughters back to Israel from the distant corners of the earth. All who claim me as their God will come, for I have made them for my glory. It was I who created them.\" (NLT) ",
