            "answer_text": "This is startlingly simple to do. That is to say that the start of anything is always simple. The saying of course is, \u201cThe journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\u201d The \u201chow\u201d behind this is also fairly simple, and that is that you have to have a story idea that will sustain, and will sustain for a loooong time. It need not necessarily end up where you wanted it to go. Stories have a way of taking on a life all their own, as in Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThis tale grew in the telling.\u201d What I mean by \u201csustain\u201d here is that it must be somewhat of a twisting and winding path. Along the way, it must must must entertain. It must challenge. The characters have to be real and they have to evolve throughout the story\u2014that is, the story itself has to change them, how they think and react, and how they see the world. Also, you have to have a whole huge cast of characters. Just two or three likely won\u2019t do for it the story to stay interesting and sustain. No, I think you need dozens, and possibly hundreds. The exception to this is, for instance, a mystery series. You can get away with having the same basic set of characters over and over again, and have them there for books one, two, three\u2026all the way up to ten or twenty. But some will fall to the wayside along the way, and new ones will likely come on board. But, I personally find those series that are unchanging\u2014as far as the characters are concerned\u2014are usually not worth reading. They are \u201ccookie-cutter\u201d stories, and while it says it\u2019s a series right there on the cover, all you generally have to do is change the place names and settings and copy everything else and paste it in. And who needs that? If you\u2019ve read one of those in the series, you\u2019ve read them all! I prefer a series or a trilogy that compasses a journey of some kind. It can be an actual journey, but at a minimum it should be a journey of the characters themselves, even though in some instances they never leave the same space station (for instance). You can and may lose a lot in the planning of such an undertaking. This is why I advise not overly planning it. Just set your sights on getting a series done, and then do it. My first series is not yet complete. It is, thus far, sixteen books, with book seventeen coming out hopefully within the next couple of weeks. I titled all those books (there were about 21 or so titles when I started out) on the same day and on the same sheet of paper before I even sat down to write. I didn\u2019t even know exactly what those titles meant, just that I liked them. They seemed like something I could work with. Raw meat for my imagination, if you will. Then I simply wrote them. Along the way I wrote as many other books separately as I wrote on that series, but the series remains unfinished. Oh, I\u2019ll finish it someday. Why? Because it\u2026sustains. The characters change, just as I changed as I wrote them. Don\u2019t discount the author in all your planning. The old saying is, \u201cYou can\u2019t dip your foot into the same river twice.\u201d How could this be so? Well, when you plunge your foot into those cool waters a second time, even though mere moments may have passed, well, fish have swam upstream or downstream, some fish have eaten other fish, pieces of the bank have fallen in and added to the silt. It\u2019s no longer the same river. And you, a year from now\u2014and especially, five or ten years from now\u2014won\u2019t be the same you. So, plan your series. Definitely. Shape it and mold it and splurge on creating it. But at some point I believe you will find that it has played a large part in creating you.  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. You definitely need lots of characters. You have to do a proper world building as well as have a character sketch for all of them. You never know when it might come handy. My suggestion is, when you begin, try to keep a theme aside for every book. Say, you wish to write a military fantasy series of 5 books. It can follow a pattern such as this: local rebellion, civil strife, war with a nation leading to temporary peace, a sudden plague or smth that makes the nation break the truce, a world war with different countries involved in it. Also as somebody has already mentioned, giving titles to all the books in your series definitely helps. Because it provides half of the inspiration for the plot that you might forget otherwise in the course of writing. Hope this helps and good luck! ",
