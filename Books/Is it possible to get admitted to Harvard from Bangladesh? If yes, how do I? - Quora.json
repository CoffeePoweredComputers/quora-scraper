YES, but you should be an exemplary holistic profile, as only about 1% of international students do get admitted. How do I take admission in Harvard University? will guide you further.

But being able to look this stuff up yourself is an important skill. If you can\u2019t figure this type of thing out, you\u2019re probably not Harvard material. ",
