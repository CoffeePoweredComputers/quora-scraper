            "answer_text": "Superman, is one of the strongest characters in fiction. But, what would happened if he punched you in real life?Well first, to take away your sorrow, let's say he's holding back 99% of his power. What would happen? Let's find out. (Heavy Calculations coming at you at Super Sonic Speed).  But first, I would like to talk about something. Superman\u2019s power has varied from writer to writer. He went from collapsing Galaxies to collapsing entire Timelines. He also went from traveling the speed of light to matching the Flash's Speed. Superman has flown from Vega to Earth in just minutes.  Vega is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. At magnitude 0.03, it shines as the fifth-brightest star, surpassed only by Sirius, Canopus, Arcturus, and Alpha Centauri. Vega \u2014 like similar stars Fomalhaut, Sirius, and Alpha Centauri \u2014 is a main-sequence star whose brilliance can be attributed partially to its close proximity to us, astronomically speaking, at just 25.05 light-years away. Based on how far Vega is from the Earth, as well as long it took for him to get there. Superman has to be traveling at least: 2.99792458 \u00d7 1014 m / s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Over 1 Million Times The Speed of Light. He also was strong enough to lift 200 Quintillion Tons with 1 hand.  In case you didn't know, the number quintillion has 18 ZEROES. 1 earth mass = 5.972 \u00d7 1024 kilograms. After a billion, of course, is trillion. Then comes quadrillion, quintrillion, sextillion, septillion, octillion, nonillion, decillion, etc. Here's Superman bench pressing the earth's weight for 5 Days.  Which means Superman is bench pressing 5.972 \u00d7 10^24 kg\u2026\u2026For 5 Days. Also, I would like to remind you, that these are not even Superman most impressive Strength and Speed feats (Yikes). But back to the question, lets just say Superman is holding back 99% of his power, the hit will land directly on the face\u2026.So. (Get Ready).  BANG!!! His fist would be traveling so fast that it would be a whopping 4 trillion degrees Celsius, 250,000 times hotter than the center of the sun. Hell, Superman has broken the speed of light without even trying. Which means even if it's 99% of his power, it would still be moving at 2.99792458 \u00d7 10^13 m / s, Over 100,000 thousand times faster than the speed of light. Which means, you won't be even seeing it coming. Hell, you won't feel it AFTER it already hits you. In other words You'll be dead before you can even feel it. But from the fist perspective since its moving 2.99792458 \u00d7 10^13 m / s or 100,000 times the speed of light. It will literally OBLITERATE your entire body. Superman won't knock the snat out of you, He would knock the Atoms out of you. The Atoms, The Protons, The Neutrons. EVERYTHING would get obliterated. His punches can destroy entire planets, which means if anyone is near or close to you, when Superman punches you. The impact would be so devastating, they would be sent FLYING OUT OF THE EARTH AND INTO SPACE. Like, enoiugh to send 1 BILLION + PEOPLE outside of earth and into Space. Which is the equivalent of 100 trillion nuclear bombs. So if Superman punched you in the face while holding back ninety-nine percent of his power. The answer is obvious, You will be dead.

            "answer_text": "A normal human punch has about 150 joules of energy science.ca View question #821. Let\u2019s take as a lower limit Superman\u2019s ability to move a planet like Earth. According to Frank Heile\u2019s calculation elsewhere on Quora, that would take 4.457\u00d710 to the 32nd joules. (see How much energy would it take to shift the Earth from its orbit around the Sun and propel it out of the solar system, and are there any processes, natural or otherwise, that could achieve this?.) So, if Superman punched you with just one one-hundredth of his force, that'd be 4.457x10 to the 30th. That would be like 29,713,333,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 regular guys all punched you at once. This is unlikely to be an experiment you\u2019d want to try. However, if you just metaphorically meant to ask if Superman could hold back enough to punch you like a normal guy, then why not? If he couldn\u2019t restrain himself to that extent he\u2019d vaporize every door he tried to open or glass he tried to sip from, and people would think there was something funny going on with this Clark Kent guy.
