            "answer_text": "Many people will be saying that NCERT is enough for NEET but according to me, it is not. Definitely, NCERT is the most important book for IIT JEE and NEET but it is just not enough to get a good rank at least for questions asked in exams now. For example, If you train yourself in driving a Maruti 800, can you drive a Mercedes that easily? No right? You will have to train yourself in the Mercedes too, to drive it easily, but only after getting trained in the 800. That is what exactly students should do! Get the NCERT(Maruti 800) and solve each and every in-text question and exercise, read line by line and get yourself accustomed to the context. Once you are expert, solve questions of some other books like Arihant or Cengage and ace that too. Then solve mock tests and keep a track of your score, identify weak areas and put effort on that. Looks easy on paper, equally difficult when performing. In case you don't have the books I mentioned, head over to the website of MyPustak. You will find thousands of books for every subject and the best thing is that you can get all FREE OF COST. You will only be charged the shipping fees and books will be delivered to your home. I hope my answer helped you! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes absolutely NCERT is enough for NEET and it's good to learn for the exam because it uses easy language to understand every concept clearly. Each and every student refer these book for the preparation so to score high you have to refer other references as well It is important that one starts his/ her preparation with NCERT books and moves towards the reference books in the advanced stages of preparation. NEET preparation must be NCERT-focused and it must always be treated with utmost importance, but it is difficult to get great results if one relies solely on these books. Also, you can find these books with a solution on Toppr website / Application just search on google you will get free PDF for each and every book so just go and check out. I hope my answer will help you. Thank you \ud83d\udc4d All the best!! ",

            "answer_text": "NCERT is more than enough for cracking NEET . You can score very good marks just by studying NCERT textbooks for classes 11 and 12 they cover the whole syllabus of competitive exams . All you need to do is go through each and every page of the book. Even the small details and examples . 80% of questions are asked directly or indirectly from NCERT. So if you read it thoroughly line by line, it should be sufficient. Also refer to NCERT exemplar. You don't need to get expensive guides for that. However, to be on the safe side and to ensure a high score that guarantees a seat, you must refer to some other advanced books that provide detailed and in-depth explanation of all the concepts in the syllabus of NEET.   To buy any books of NEET preparation , NCERT and any genre books you can try MyPustak. This website is known for the great quality of Free Second Hand Books .  ",
