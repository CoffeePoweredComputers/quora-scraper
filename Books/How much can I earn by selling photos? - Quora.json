            "answer_text": "Shutterstock Shutterstock has been a popular site for over 15 years to buy stock photos online. They have over 200 million images, videos, and music tracks for folks to purchase royalty-free, which also means they have millions of purchasing customers. As a photographer, you can earn great money with this marketplace in the long run. According to their site, sellers on Shutterstock have made over $500 million worldwide! Shutterstock allows you to keep your copyrights protected, so it\u2019s up to you to set the rights on your photos. Shutterstock also gives credit to the image\u2019s owners, which is a major plus that protects your ownership and markets your brand. Once you become a site contributor, you begin earning money every time someone purchases and downloads your content. As a contributor, you can make anywhere from 20% to 30% of whatever your image sells for, which Shutterstock pays out monthly. Like Adobe Stock, Shutterstock doesn\u2019t force you to use their marketplace exclusively. You might even consider selling on Adobe Stock and Shutterstock at the same time! Alamy is another a great platform on which to sell stock photos, because it doesn\u2019t have any hard and fast rules. The site may not have as many buyers as Shutterstock and Adobe Stock, but it\u2019s still a great contender and another great option for revenue. Photographers can upload their photos to Alamy without licensing or any other copyrights issues. To date, Alamy has made $180 million in payouts to photographers. Alamy\u2019s rates are competitive, too. The marketplace pays photographers 50% of each sale, which is significantly higher than some other competing platforms. istockphoto This site has been selling stock images since 2001. Since it\u2019s been around for a while, it has an extensive network of contributors and thoroughly vets new applicants to make sure they\u2019re a good fit.

            "answer_text": "There are 3 billion photos being shot everyday across the globe which speaks about two things - high potential, high competition. However, only 0.01% of them are on sale. So yes, you can earn money through various means if you have the right reach and use the right channel. For now, I\u2019m sticking to the basics and talking about the most common channel through which pictures are clicked today - through a smartphone. Mobile stock photography has grown hugely over the last few years and is only going to grow further. An app that enables users to sell their pictures (taken on smartphones) to companies across the globe is Draagu Pictures. Draagu currently is only on Android but basically, all you have to do is download the app, create an account and when you have images on your phone that match the request of clients, you receive a notification and can decide whether you want to submit those images or not. You don\u2019t have to upload your images anywhere, the app does everything for you. You might want to give it a try :) In any case, don\u2019t let your photos rot on your phone! They have a lot of value and you should capture that value! Disclaimer: I am currently employed at Draagu. ",
