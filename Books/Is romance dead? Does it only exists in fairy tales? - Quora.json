            "answer_text": "No, romance is not dead. It\u2019s rare, of course, but the reason why it\u2019s so hard to spot it is because most romantic people reserve the romances to themselves, not to social media. It\u2019s something private and intimate that romantic people wouldn\u2019t like to share it to the world\u2026 Or\u2026. More romantically, wouldn\u2019t even remember to share it, because their minds were only thinking about their person of interest. ",
