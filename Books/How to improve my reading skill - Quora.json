            "answer_text": "Comprehensive reading requires lots of patience, attention, concentration, focus and vocabulary to undetstand. While reading, be sure that you are not hungry, thirsty or anything else, this means there are no unnecessary interruptions. Use lead pencil to underline the words you fail to understand and consult dictionary later to know the meanings of the same. But, never take the help of dictionary at the time of reading as it affects your study and decreases your comprehension power. Besides, give yourself a try to realize any article with guess power which will enrich your confidence level and fill yourself with positive attitude. Pressurise on each and every word separately, observe their positions, functions in the sentence. Last, but not the least, complete reading passages, never finish them. I believe you understand the difference between completing and finishing. Always try to aviod subvocalization which seems a common problem among readers for decades, here I am providing some of most popular techniques to decrease the effect of the same 1. Use Your Finger to Point Your Eyes While Reading Keep on emphasizing the importance of using your finger out and guide your eyes. It\u2019s a central principle to all speed-reading techniques and it\u2019s something that will help you minimize subvocalization. Using your hand to guide your eyes will also help you grab groups of words while reading, helping you avoid another common reading habit, fixation. 2. Distract Yourself To minimize subvocalization, try distracting yourself from saying words in your head. How should you distract yourself? There are a couple of ways to do it. One way is try to chew gum while you read. If you chew gum while reading it will distract you from saying the words in your head. You can also distract yourself from saying words by occupying that voice in your head with another voice. Try counting from one to three while you are reading the material (example: \u201cone, two three\u201d line-by-line). While you are doing this, try fixating your eyes somewhere at the beginning of the line, somewhere in the middle of the line, and somewhere at the end of the line. While you are looking in those three places you want to be counting \u201cone, two, three.\u201d By doing this you will also be fixating on three groups of words, rather than each and every single word. You can count \u201cone, two, three\u201d out loud (maybe whispering) or in your head. Either way, you\u2019ll distract yourself from saying the actual words you are reading. With some practice, you\u2019ll find it easier to avoid saying all the words in your head as you read. 3. Listen To Music While Reading This will not only help you minimize subvocalization, but listening to music may also help you concentrate better. However, keep in mind that not all types of music are going to help you concentrate. You want to avoid listening to music with lyrics or anything with a strong beat because it is going to throw off your concentration. You may also want to avoid listening to songs that remind you of other things (your high school sweetheart, a fight scene from a movie or anything else that might further distract you). Listen to something that is instrumental. Classical music usually works best. That will help you to improve your concentration and it will also help you to minimize your habit of subvocalization. 4. Force Yourself To Read Faster Than You Normally Would Let\u2019s say you normally read 250 wpm. Try going a little faster (maybe 300 or 350 wpm). If you force yourself to go a little faster than you normally read, you\u2019ll minimize the amount of words you say in your head. In addition to minimizing subvocalization, you\u2019ll also improve your focus because you have to pay attention more when you read a little faster. Again, the more you practice pushing yourself faster, the faster you will get. Hope it will cope up with your problem,.......... ",

Writing can also help you to enhance your reading skills. Reading and writing are mutual, and supplement to each other. More you read more your become good writer and vice versa.Good vocabulary also help you to become good reader. We often leave the reading in between and loose interested only because we are not good at vocab.Consistency. Read daily. Be in touch, if not 100 pages daily you can read but certainly few paragraphs, be regular.Re-read. Read the same article again and again, it help you to understand he collocation and word structure slightly better, that can make you good reader.Memorize. Try to remember what you have read recently and how it was articulated.Practice. After reading an article try to write same article in your own words. It helps you to retain word.Love/Date. I fell in love with a girl not because she was beautiful. Not because she was intelligent and wise. Not because she from the top art stream college. But only she used to write very well, and love to read. Her choice of words was amazing!",

            "answer_text": "Read anything, starting with the topics or authors that you find easier to read and digest. Focus and concentration take time to build. Don\u2019t be too hung up on reading books a certain way I.e start to finish. Feel free to skim, pausing on topics that interest you or reading randomly from between. Pick a format that is convenient for you. Do you want to read while using public transportation? Figure out if headphones could dim background sounds while you read on your Kindle or physical book. The hardest though is this : don\u2019t read books for social approval and don\u2019t feel compelled to read best sellers . Though these are generally good guidelines for choosing a book that\u2019s already been vetted by thousands, it does rob an element of freedom and discovery when you read what everyone else is reading. Don\u2019t stress about yearly or monthly goals. Also try reading at bedtime. Reading fiction before bed is said to switch your brain from problem solving mode to storytelling mode, which is quite relaxing and appropriate for sleep. You might start to enjoy reading for it\u2019s joy. ",

And, after having completed a page, I would re-read the page to get the complete joy of reading where I could understand the author and flow of the words completely.

            "answer_text": "Reding isn't a skill it's just a habit. You can develop your reading speed and comprehension by simply reading more. Eventually you will develop something called as spatial reading, where you read chunks of text together, instead of single words and sentences. Read everyday about the topics of your interest. In some cases people don't enjoy reading or find it bothersome because they think it takes them away from productive work. In such a state the question comes down to usefulness. If you are one of such a reader then read about the topics in which you want to become an expert. Not merely technical but cultural in nature. You should understand the language of that world effortlessly. Conclusion You can start with newspapers, a few short books or a single huge book. Reading quality blogs online is also a good habit. You remain informed about the topics of your interest regularly. ",

In a band/ jazz band/ church/ orchestra/ musical/ wedding or casual gig if there is a \u201cbook\u201d and you can NOT accurately sight read it you will NOT get called back for more gigs.
