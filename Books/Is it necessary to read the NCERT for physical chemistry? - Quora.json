            "answer_text": "Ncert is absolutely mandatory for inorganic chemistry .But for physical chemistry practicing mcq and numericals must be the priority. And as far as \u201creading\u201d is concerned as ncert is the \u201cBible\u201d so all the information and examples in ncert should be kept in mind specially for chapters like solid state ,surface chemistry , solutions etc\u2026 or say the secondary cells in electrochemistry .. even one should go through the lines of ncert once .. so that one can efficiently solve theory or statement based questions.
