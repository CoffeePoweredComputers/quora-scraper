You should know that the story is an autobiographical parable. The events in the story are based on his real-life experiences. He did crash-land in the desert. The little prince is the characterization of a child he observes in \u201cWind, Sand, and Stars\u201d, an autobiography. The faithful lamplighter represents a man who survived a crash in the Andes mountains, and heroically survived due to his duty to his wife and children. The snake was a \u201ccharacter\u201d he encounters as a dinner guest in South America. I\u2019m sure that there are more parallels that I don\u2019t remember. The Little Prince is an extremely distilled essence of his life. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a bit short for a novel, but it does offer a complete story arc, unlike most short stories. Le Petit Prince is a modern fable, set in the most beautiful prose, which offers a clear and heart-rending view of existential angst and hope. It takes the form of a children's tale, and there is much in the story for children. But it is very much more important than that. ",
