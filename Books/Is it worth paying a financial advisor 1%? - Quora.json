            "answer_text": "This response is strictly my opinion and based on my past experiences I\u2019ve had and articles I\u2019ve read. It\u2019s not unreasonable to pay a CERTIFIED (completely Fiduciary) Financial Advisor 1 % of \u201cAssets Under Management\u201d (AUM) for the INITIAL meeting(s), portfolio assessment, analysis/documentation of alternatives, recommendations on how to invest your retirement accounts and any \u201cafter-tax\u201d accounts. It takes a lot of initial time and energy by your advisor getting to know you, your personal goals and current financial status. Arguably, this initial meeting(s) should also result in a printed copy of probabilistic outcomes of how long your Retirement savings are likley to last using a Monte Carlo simulation. Many online investment firms (Fidelity for sure) offer a free simulation model to its members to play with. The problem I have with the 1 % business model is having to continue paying it year after year. As one article said \u201cit\u2019s like building a house. Lots of money to build it initially but smaller expenditures for following years for \u201cupkeep\u201d. You are NOT rebuilding the house from the ground up each year so the fee should reflect this. I\u2019ve got a great Certified Financial Planner (CFP) in town that I use. I explained these feelings to him. Instead of a fee-only yearly amount of 1 % of AUM, he agreed to a flat fee (retainer) after the initial work was done. I would have preferred an hourly rate like I pay my CPA (like $150\u2013200/hr) but his disclosure statement didn't allow this fee option. Hourly rate is clearly the best. As the auto insurance commercial says \u201conly pay for what you need\u201d. This flat rate and hourly option usually works with the smaller one/two man companies since the larger stalwarts (eg Edward Jones, Raymond James, Ameriprise\u2026) are not as flexible. You always have the option to use the online brokerage companies (eg Fidelity, Schwab\u2026) \u201cfree\u201d financial planners for advice. My feelings based on my experience and those of other family members is that it is \u201cOK\u201d advice. These advisors however are not generally not credentialed CFPs or Certified Financial Analysts -CFAs. They are salaried and not working on commissions like many people out there masquerading as \u201cfinancial planners\u201d. They are well intentioned advisors but they have many people to serve besides you so the relationship seldom prospers for the long term. So in summary: Find a Certified Planner you trustHave he/she analyze your situation and propose optionsGet a long term probabilistic model of where you are likely to wind upNegotiate a fee only relationship (hourly, fixed yearly amount but NOT % of AUM)Have him/her invest your assets to maximize your best interest (not theirs)Schedule quarterly meetings to analyze your portfolio\u2019s performance against mutually established goalsAdjust the plan based on individual investment results and strive to maximize returns within your risk toleranceEnjoy life knowing you are doing the right thing and paying a fair price for the services you are receiving",

            "answer_text": "The answer to if a financial advisor is worth a 1% fee really depends on several factors. 1- What do you want to get out of working with an advisor? 2- What kind of service are you expecting for a 1% fee? 3- What is your level of investing knowledge? 4- What\u2019s the size of your portfolio? First, let\u2019s look at the cost of a 1% fee. For example, if a client had a portfolio valued at 200k that would be $2000 at 1%. That amount would not likely be the total amount the advisor makes. An advisor would get paid out according to their agreement, which might be something like 50\u201390%. Independent advisors usually make more because they pay their own expenses. For an example fee let\u2019s use 90% of the total 1% fee on a portfolio. That comes out to $1800 going to the advisor. Someone that has a 200k portfolio might get one yearly review and possibly a few phone calls. The equivalent of a few hours work each year. That equals $900 per hour. Does this sound good to you? Looking at the cost of a 1% fee is by no means inexpensive. To make this cost actually worth it to someone let\u2019s get back to the original questions that you need to ask yourself. 1- What do you want to get out of working with an advisor? The truth is a lot of investors that work with an advisor believe their main role is to get above-average market returns on an investment portfolio. This is only further from the truth. Most financial advisors and even actual mutual fund managers do not beat the market over 80% of the time within a 15-year period. Yes, there are advisors that will beat the market, but they will not do it consistently. Also, if they do beat the market by the time their fee is added it is likely going to be the equivalent of market returns. If you are looking for someone to beat the market averages year in and out, a financial advisor at a 1% fee is going to be disappointing. 2- What kind of service are you expecting for a 1% fee? If you are an investor that wants to talk to your advisor regularly, you had better have a very large investment portfolio. For an average investor, you will get a review or two a year and a few calls. Unless you are an \u201cA\u201d client with an advisor, don\u2019t expect first-class service. Financial advisors are in the business of sales, relationships, and accumulating assets. If you do not have a sizeable portfolio, do not expect a lot of attention for a 1% fee. 3- What is your level of investing knowledge? Are you an average investor with a good amount of investing knowledge? Do your investments require any complicated products or strategies? For someone that is an average investor with only something like a mutual fund account and an IRA, a financial advisor might not be worth the 1% fee. This is particularly the case with someone that has some investing knowledge. A simple mix of investments with index funds could prove to be much better than paying an advisor a 1% fee. Remember most advisors do not beat the market each year. An index fund with lower fees could be a good alternative to having an advisor. An investor that wants a little help but lower fees could also optionally use what is commonly referred to as a Robo-Advisor. This is computer software that will help manage investments. The truth is most financial advisors have had the help of Robo-Advisors for years. Now, this same software is available to more investors. Why pay someone to just make investment transactions? 4- What\u2019s the size of your portfolio? Back to the size of someone's investment portfolio. A wealthy person with a busy schedule requiring complicated investment strategies for a lot of diversification might be able to benefit from a financial professional. Affluent people also have more of a need for tax-advantaged investments. For someone that has a lot of money, a financial advisor could prove helpful and might be worth a 1% fee. The reason is they will be working much more for that 1% fee. The amount of the fee will be much higher, but the right advisor will also be available more to a wealthy client as well. People with money have all kinds of people managing their lives. CPA\u2019s, lawyers, and financial managers are common. When you have a lot of money it becomes more challenging to keep track of it all. Paying taxes and ensuring investments are running the way they should is very important. Bottom line\u2026There are people that can benefit from a financial professional. However, most average investors won\u2019t get their money\u2019s worth out of a 1% fee.
