            "answer_text": "\"Where there is a will, There is a way\" this saying would have been appropriate. But when it comes to reading books, one should not consider it as a duty. Only when you embrace novels as your non-living soulmates will you find time for the same. It's comparable to this situation:- You wish to meet an old buddy of yours, any other task obstructing this meeting will take a back seat. The only reason being you desperately want to meet that person. Similarly if one has the urge to read novels, he will surely find time for the same. And of course...compromising a bit on sleeping hours or having a proper schedule for the day, will help us find time for reading... :) ",
