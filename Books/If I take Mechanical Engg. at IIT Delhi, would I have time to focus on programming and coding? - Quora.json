            "answer_text": "Yes. But you must be diligent. I personally know a student from IIT Ropar who self studied Fortran and Python (apart from Professor-taught C and C++). He did coding in Fortran while he was working on a research project on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as an intern at a Geman University. Working on a research projectin CFD as an MS student at a US University, currently he is coding with Python. It\u2019s possible with an investment of time. Certainly not possible with a life style of 4 hours academics and rest 20 hours fun and sleep! ",

            "answer_text": "I have attended interviews for some Multi National companies.The first thing we have to take care of is a good logic.whatever you do on paper is the same what you do in programming or coding . So if you are able to think about the suitable logic for the given problem statement then your job is half done. The second half is about syntax, I dont think placing your logic in a computer language is that difficult.So,for this reason,Interviewers ask about the logic first and then the syntax. I think joining IIT Delhi won\u2019t affect your programming or coding because logic is always dependent on your problem solving skills. Hope i have answered your question. ",
