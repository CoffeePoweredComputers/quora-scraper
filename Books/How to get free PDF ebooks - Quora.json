            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t other than by scanning the book, borrowed from a library, and making a PDF copy yourself. That word \u2018any\u2019 in your question really makes things difficult. You shouldn\u2019t because PDF is not a format designed for reading onscreen. It\u2019s a format designed for printing. It makes terrible files for reading on an e-reader because the text doesn\u2019t flow when you enlarge it. Instead you need to do a lot of page scrolling. The best ebook formats are EPUB, MOBI or AZW3. PDF files are often available at pirate websites and frequently infected with malware. You may also be breaking the law if you download them. You may also be stealing from the author. You don\u2019t need to because there are millions of free ebooks available, without breaching copyright, already at ebook retailers and other organizations in multiple formats. See this post. ",
