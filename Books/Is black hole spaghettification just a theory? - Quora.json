            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not something we can observe with a telescope - and it\u2019s not something we can reproduce in a laboratory - but it is a mathematical certainty. Normally, if you fall from great height towards a gravity source, it doesn\u2019t really matter how strong the gravity is because all of the atoms of your body feel essentially the same acceleration - so you\u2019re in \u201cfree fall\u201d. But that\u2019s only APPROXIMATELY true. If you jumped out of a spaceship and fell, feet-first towards a planet like Earth - then TECHNICALLY, your feet would be a meter and a half or so closer to the center of the planet than your head\u2026and because gravity gets less with distance - then there is a TINY amount of extra pull on your feet than on your head. Not enough to notice. But with a black hole, the rate of gravity change gets crazy high - so even over a meter or two, the intensity of the gravity changes dramatically - pulling your feet strongly away from your head. The closer you get - the greater the DIFFERENCE in gravity becomes\u2026and ultimately anything that falls into the hole is stretched until it disintigrates. It\u2019ll be shredded to atoms - and then the atoms themselves will be pulled apart. This would be a horrible death - but don\u2019t worry - you\u2019d be cooked by the radiation long before that happened. ",

            "answer_text": "Is black hole spaghettification just a theory? Even gas clouds falling towards planets are spaghettified, so apaghettification is an observed process. Would it be more extreme near small supermassive objects? Most certainly it would. Wood solids be spaghettified? Almost certainly not - they would melt or evaprate first. Do small supermassive objects exist? Most certainly they do. Are these objects black holes in the sense that matter and light actually penetrate an event horizon? I don\u2019t know - everything I have seen is analysed in \u201cproper time\u201d which I believe truncates until the evaporation of the black hole - and I don\u2019t know whether the theoretical penetration happens before or after that truncation. Does it matter whether these objects are black holes in this sense? Only in a theoretical sense or to a pedant, I would suggest, because we have no way of telling whether the material penetrates or not: the black hole would still look exactly the same to us. ",
