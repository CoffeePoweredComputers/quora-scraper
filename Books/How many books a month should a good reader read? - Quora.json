            "answer_text": "There are all kinds of opinions on how many books people should be reading, as well as what kinds of books they should be reading, and what length of books should be chosen. But I\u2019m here to say that maybe there shouldn\u2019t be a certain \u2018formula\u2019 or stigma about how many books you do or don\u2019t read, especially for a certain time frame, like a month. Everyone is different. There isn\u2019t a set formula for how many movies or tv shows or songs we should watch or listen to in a month, and I believe that there shouldn\u2019t be with books, either. It\u2019s different if you have, say, a reading list that you need to complete for school, or a certain number of briefs or emails to read for a job. But let\u2019s say we\u2019re talking about reading purely for enjoyment or your own research. First, for enjoyment:If you want to read for enjoyment, congratulations! You have already committed to the idea of books being fun! Let\u2019s keep it that way, shall we? I\u2019m not going to tell you you should read five or ten or twenty or sixty or ninety books in a month. Because what if you don\u2019t want to read that many? What if you like to soak in what you read, going back over sentences and paragraphs so that you can laugh over them again or simply clarify what you read? What if you want to read more? What if you can\u2019t find that many books that you like? What if you go to the library and none of them are just calling you? (Which I think is a very important part of the reading process, personally.) These are all problems that could occur with anyone trying to find a book to read, along with: MOST PEOPLE WHO READ HAVE A LIFE. You heard me. Just because you\u2019ve made the decision to read doesn\u2019t mean you need to sacrifice your life. In fact, everyone should take that into account! So if you\u2019re someone who literally can only grab a few minutes a week or month to read a book, then so be it. At least you\u2019re reading! So my advice is this: read when you want to. If one month you\u2019d rather binge watch your favorite show whose new season was just put on Netflix, then do that! Reading should not be a laborious process where you\u2019re trying to meet a certain deadline. That\u2019s work! And unless you\u2019re an editor, then reading books is most likely not your job. So don\u2019t make it one. 2. Now, for research or other purposes that aren\u2019t enjoyment: My advice is to divide up the quantity and then divvy it up between the days you can read, and how much you think you can read in a day. If you have ten books you need to read in a month or two, divide them up by pages and which you think will take you the least amount of time to read, and then make sure you read that many pages a day. The point of all of this is that there isn\u2019t a set amount of books or pages or words you should read in a month. There\u2019s only what is right for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Read enough books each month to the extent that you can still: Easily comprehend and retain the content without being or feeling rushed as you read the material. If you are filling your time reading Tolstoy and Karamazov, then 1\u20132 books a month will probably be your max.Have the time to take notes whether it\u2019s in your Moleskine, Evernote, or wherever you keep notes. From The Bonfire of the Vanities, to Great Expectations, to The Great Divorce, to any book by Deming or Don Wheeler, I take notes. This helps me to better understand the content not to mention remembering it. My reading experience is not complete until I\u2019ve finished writing my notes.He doesn\u2019t say it in the clip below, but Charlie \u201cTremendous\u201d Jones said you will be the same person in five years as you are today except for the people you meet and the books you read.\u201d  I\u2019m confident Mr. Jones would say to slow down (your reading) if you are not getting to know the the author well enough because you cannot comprehend or retain the content. As others have aptly stated, focus on quality, not quantity. The numbers will be what they are. If you are a goal-driven person, then go ahead\u2014add an extra book per month to your reading program. But dial it back if comprehension, retention, and note taking suffers. Listening to Books Still concerned your monthly average book reading is low? I easily get through about 2 Audible books each month. As I write this, I\u2019m listening to Monash: The Outsider Who Won a War, a biography about Australia\u2019s greatest general. That book will knock down my 2-a-month audio books average. Doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m meeting a new hero, and I\u2019ve even taken time to read other articles about him across cyberspace. In short, with strategic use of your time, you can nearly double your reading content through audio books. Sidebar | Note Taking and Fiction In case someone asks, I don\u2019t take notes on what I call feel-good pulp fiction. For instance, I did not take notes for The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (cute book by the way). But for works like Crime and Punishment, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, or The Killer Angels, I took lots of notes. ",
