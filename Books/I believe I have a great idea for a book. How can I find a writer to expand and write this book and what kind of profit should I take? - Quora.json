            "answer_text": "You can hire a ghost writer or a co-writer--these people make their livings writing books that are conceived by others. But there are a couple of things you need, if you want to hire a writer. You either need to pay the writer up front to write your book as a work-for-hire project--and then the book is yours and you sell it and you keep the profits, or you offer to split the profits with the ghost writer or co-writer. The only way you'll get a writer to agree to do the work up front and wait for their money until after the books start selling, is if they are sure the books will sell. So you'd have to have a big platform--be a nationally known speaker, or . . . you'd have to have such a great idea that the writer believed the book would sell well.  It is not uncommon for people who have lived through some traumatic or miraculous event to hire ghost writers to write their stories. However, those books are usually paid for upfront and the person who lived through the events of the story is given credit as author and the book is his and he makes all the money off of the sales. Usually.  Bottom line? You can hire someone to write your book for you pretty easily. But unless it really is a great idea that is sure to sell a bazillion copies, you'll probably have to pay the writer up front ",

            "answer_text": "Any self-respecting writer who is serious about their career will tell you the same thing.  \"Ideas are cheap, and I already have too many ideas and not enough time to turn them all into books.\"  If you love your idea so much, you should be the one to write it. The thing non-writers don't seem to understand is that the hard part of writing a novel (if that's what you're talking about) is not coming up with the ideas. It's the actual work of writing it. Ideas truly are cheap as dirt and are worth absolutely nothing by themselves.  Professional prose takes years and years of practice to acquire, as does every other aspect of writing a publishable novel. Not to mention that a novel is so much work, takes so long to write, and may never net you a cent if you're not already published. And even if you are, if that's a side novel that hasn't been bought yet, it may never be bought even if you have been published before. You really need to have passion for what you're doing to create a quality product under those circumstances. That means nobody is going to use anyone's ideas but their own. Sorry. ",
