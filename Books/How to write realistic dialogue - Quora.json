            "answer_text": "There's a trap here. If you write \"realistic dialogue\", as in the way people actually talk, it will be meandering and dull. My favorite screenwriting teacher distinguished \"real\" dialogue from \"reel\" dialogue, the point being that there's an art to writing film dialogue that feels reel. It needs to be much shorter than real life. If you can still cut a word out without changing the meaning, you aren't done editing yet. \"We don't need the gun. Leave it in the car. But bring the cannoli along.\" It will not be grammatical. Lots of partial and unfinished sentences. Unless you're Christopher Hitchens you likely don't speak in sentences and paragraphs. Pretty much never let your character say what he or she actually means. (Brief exemptions are allowed for confessions.) There should always be subtext. Saying what they mean is called \"on the nose\" and it's boring. Every line of dialogue should be about what the character wants, or is trying to hide, or both. If you're writing a film, don't have any dialogue at all if your actor can convey the idea through action. Clint Eastwood famously crossed out pages of dialogue from the spaghetti westerns he did as a younger man. Make sure each character speaks with a unique voice. Too many beginners have every character speak exactly the same. (Mary Shelly did this in Frankenstein but, lucky for her, the rest of the story was so strong that this was overlooked.) Read your dialogue out loud to make sure it's not a tongue twister and that it feels right. Watch out for anachronisms. If you're writing period dialogue you have a lot of reading and research to do to pick up the music of the era. And, I think most importantly, don't confuse dialogue with story. You create characters by the choices they make and the actions they do. Dialogue is but one of those possible actions. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me throw out a couple of suggestions that I don\u2019t often hear when talking about dialogue. These might not be the most important tips you\u2019ll ever get, but I think they\u2019re things people tend not to think of. Write dialogue for the person being spoken to, not for the reader. All too often, dialogue is used to give backstory or details to the reader even though it doesn\u2019t make sense for the character to say that, because the person they\u2019re speaking to already knows it and the speaker is aware that they know it. Think of the two partner detectives who feel the need to \u201cremind\u201d each other of the most important details in the case over and over, each time as if it were new information; or the siblings talking about something that happened in their childhood as if neither of them were there for it. Yes, people reminisce about things, but reminiscence is fragmented, and it focuses on minute, obscure details because the people involved know that the others are already aware of the whole thing. Don\u2019t cram exposition into dialogue in a way that makes people awkwardly state what should be obvious to the person they\u2019re talking to - it demolishes immersion. If you have to have someone mention something that\u2019s already known to the character they\u2019re addressing, frame it very carefully so it\u2019s obvious they expect each other to know this already. People don\u2019t talk in perfect sentences, and they frequently backtrack, repeat, or try to correct what they\u2019ve said. Very few of us are able to get across exactly what we\u2019re trying to say flawlessly the first time. People stutter, contradict themselves, and often even jump back in a sentence to re-say something altogether, and we often don\u2019t fully realize we\u2019re doing this. In the same vein, people don\u2019t usually understand each other right away, either, at least not exactly. If you\u2019re going for hyper-real dialogue, there should be plenty of restatement, clarification, and miscommunication. Thankfully we tend to be really good at clearing those things up with just a few words - pay very close attention to conversations around you to get a sense of how this happens in natural conversation. People talk over each other. All. The. Time. Typically, Person 2 is actually two or three words into their reply before Person 1 has actually finished speaking. Our brains are wired to \u201cedit out\u201d the overlap, so it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re overlapping our speech, but we often are. This isn\u2019t the same as cutting people off, but it does mean we tend to anticipate how the person is going to finish their sentence and form our reply before those final words are actually spoken. Emulating this effect in prose is tricky, but if you\u2019re writing a script it\u2019s something you should definitely consider taking advantage of. Different people ostensibly conversing with one another may be talking about completely different things. Suppose you have two friends talking about Person 1\u2019s job. Person 1 might be feeling unfulfilled at work, doesn\u2019t like their boss, etc. But Person 2 has a romanticized vision of Person 1\u2019s job, and keeps trying to turn the conversation towards how awesome such-and-such must be to be involved with. And Person 1 doesn\u2019t want to sound bitchy or privileged, so they keep pretending to agree but also trying to express their dissatisfaction at the same time. The words these people are saying can very easily sound like a conversation, and they are directly responding to the words the other has said, but they\u2019re having fundamentally different conversations because their frames of reference are out of sync. And what\u2019s worse, both are going to walk away from that conversation with the sense that they haven\u2019t been heard, but neither of them is likely to really understand why they feel that way. For an excellent example of how hyper-realistic dialogue works in practice, I highly suggest Noah Baumbach\u2019s films, especially The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected). I can also suggest this video essay by Evan Puschak on the composition of dialogue in that same film. ",
