            "answer_text": "I read during most of my free time, and I\u2019m not sure whether my answer will be something I\u2019ve learned from books, but rather my life and everything combined. To answer your question, I think that reading, whatever book it is, makes you think. You train your mind as your eyes skip from one word to another, your imagination working alongside it. When you don\u2019t read, your mind keeps working and you think. Which is something most people lack nowadays, but that\u2019s a whole another topic. I can come up with creative solutions, even though I\u2019ve never been in a serious relationship, I know what it is I want. In other words, I think reading helped me to understand myself better, taught me how to analyse my feelings and emotions and filter my thoughts. Which for me is something very important. Also, I like to think I\u2019m a good listener and definitely more empathetic than I used to be. I guess this happens from putting yourself in situations of characters in books. I\u2019m happy to bring up different topics and elaborate on one during a conversation. So definitely, I think after reading for so long, I understand myself better and try to be understanding towards others. Oh, and I forgot to mention how open-minded I\u2019ve become. Life is so small and so short and so meaningless in the whole universe we live in. It\u2019s so meaningless to drown in thoughts of small problems and small sorrows. So what if some couple is gay? So what if a family lives a different way than the other. Yes, Asian culture is very different to Western but it isn\u2019t any less amazing and isn\u2019t at all derogatory because in Japan people bow to each other. It isn\u2019t weird that men in their 30\u2019s still live with their parents there\u2026 All these things are small examples but people always like to take sides and judge what is better or worse. Fights over different religions? If you ask me what I believe in\u2026 well, I wouldn\u2019t call myself an atheist but neither do I believe in only one specific thing. As I am Russian and believe in one God, from having grown up in Japan, I very much believe in Shinto where there is more than one God. As long as you are respectful, non-judgemental and understanding, we can be friends ;) ",

            "answer_text": "I find books written as a narrative fictions of someone\u2019s life or an actual memoir affect me the most. They are the most relatable and easy to find, but not easy to find one that relates to oneself and when one does, it teaches (me) which mistakes Not to make. I jump around a bit in my answer below, as my interpretation has changes and adds/expands the more time goes on. I read this book when I was 15 then again at 22. I\u2019m 25 now. For example the Great Gatsby put in words how I can relate to longing for my crush, but also that pining for them for YEARS is unhealthy. How sometimes like Daisy, you can like someone and end up with someone else due to reasons and be content enough. For example, I assume that Gatsby and Daisy had more strong feelings, BUT money is important. Then after high school I realized just how important money is, how long term relationships can make someone \u201ccomfortable enough\u201d to stick around even if at the core they are unhappy with their partner any why it could be. Most reviews that I read that didn\u2019t like the Great Gatsby, for dull characters that were unrelatable. To me, they were all relatable in some ways. As an adult, I have noticed just as these people reviews have complained \u2014some people (my mother) never grow up\u2014 some people (my mother) never FULLY emotionally mature\u2014and life and people can treat you (me) bad and there is no happy ending\u2014sometimes it\u2019s your (my) own fault. \u2014I think that is the point of the Great Gatsby as other defenders have said something like \u201cit is dull and states the obvious\u201d\u2014because life is often dull but the words to express this \u201cobvious\u2019 is not always clear.
