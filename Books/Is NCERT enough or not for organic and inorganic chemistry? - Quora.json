FOR JEE:-Here you need to level up yourself\u2026as core concepts shall be crystal clear\u2026you may reffer to OP Tandon for theory or now a days even many video lectures are available which have more than sufficient matter is you are able to extract.For solving go for any out of MS CHAUHAN or HIMANSHU PANDEY\u2026.

But if you are preparing for some competitive exams you have to study from some other sources also. Although for NEET it is said ncert is enough still try to solve questions and build some concepts from other books also. I did it from allen modules. It is all your choice from which book you have to prepare. I hope I was helpful. ",
