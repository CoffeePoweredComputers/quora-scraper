            "answer_text": "\u201cGunsmoke\u201d is set in Dodge City, Kansas which had a very short period to grow dramatically and draw a lot of trouble as the shipping point for Texas cattle driven there by large crews of Texas cowboys who\u2019d spent months on the trail. During it\u2019s 2\u20133 years of wildness it eventually had an 8 man law enforcement team (city and county officers) including Wyatt Earp, Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp, Bat Masterson, Ed Masterson, Charlie Bassett, Bill Tilghman, etc. (like the 1927 New York Yankees\u2019 all star/legends roster.) \u201cGunsmoke\u201d seems to be set in the years after the cattle drives had moved to other towns with the extensions of the railyards, particularly as Fort Worth, TX, Kansas City, Missouri, Chicago, and Denver became the main cattle markets by the 1880\u2019s. So it\u2019s a fast shrinking town, hence just Town Marshall (Chief of Police) Matt Dillon with a part-time Deputy who has other employment as well, one main saloon instead of several dozen, and very little traffic in the streets. The television series, which started as a radio drama series years before, lasted quite a bit longer than the real period, especially in Dodge City. Kansas became a backwater (my dad\u2019s family lived there from 1871 forward and were Old West lawmen, cowboys, oilmen, builders, farmers, etc. then.) The Old West lasted much longer in Oklahoma and the Texas border, well into the 1920\u2019s. ",

            "answer_text": "How many years did the Wild West really occur as it was depicted on 'Gunsmoke' the television show? Based on a TV show? I have no idea what the producers had in mind when they wrote the Gunsmoke episodes. I do watch Gunsmoke. The term Wild West denotes an uninhabited land or a land not populated by Europeans. Indians lived here for thousands of years before Europe invaded their land. The pilgrims landed on the East Coast and migrated west. As they found areas they liked they would build homes and towns and establish themselves. They kept migrating all across the US from East to West and North to South. These terms are invented by man to describe the human mentality that came with the immigrants. Like the Roaring Twenties. The Roaring Twenties described the people and not the date. ",
