            "answer_text": "I discovered my life purpose when I worked in a nursing home at age 18. I was always interested in medicine and helping others, so I took the step of entering the healthcare field early. I discovered that many residents\u2019 family members stopped visiting them after the first few months or years. I learned that a caring touch and soft word can brighten up the loneliest of souls. I learned that people can be extremely fragile and so you have to treat them with care. I also learned that most of the residents were on Medicaid once their resources were exhausted. I learned the fragility of getting old. Many residents woke up, sat in their chairs, and waited until breakfast, lunch, or dinner came. I had a patient \u2018Bertha\u2019 who was 91 years old. Every breakfast, lunch, and dinner she had buttermilk. She was the sweetest of souls and she enjoyed my random banter. She made me reflect on the kind old \u2018Mary Jane\u2019 that used to live next door to us. Our neighbor treated me and my sisters with utmost kindness. She would bake for us, paint Easter eggs with us, and buy us gifts because she knew we were poor. In all these instances, I realized the fragility of humanity and how kindness can really make a difference. If it was for Mary Jane I wouldn't have worked in the nursing home. And if it wasn't for \u2018Bertha\u2019 I wouldn't be teaching today. ",

            "answer_text": "Another report from the front lines that proves that youth is wasted on the young. Don\u2019t worry about what you want from life. That is a lifelong question that is answered as your life unfolds. Very few people know the answer to that at your age, and many that think they know discover later that they were mistaken. You\u2019ll begin to meet them at your 15th high school reunion. I know very few people who had a clear vision of what they wanted from life and made that into a satisfying career and a contented life. College is a great luxury. Tuition doesn\u2019t just pay for classes: it pays for facilities, activities, and resources that you have unlimited access to while you are a student. When you leave school, you discover how much all those things cost a la carte. You have recreation centers, pools, perhaps an ice rink, research libraries and research databases, computer centers, practice rooms, clubs, entertainment, recording studios, engineering labs, radio station, labs of all sorts, mental health counseling, tutoring, writing center, academic adviser, professor office hours. On that last one, you have access to people who are passionate and extremely knowledgeable about all sorts of interesting fields. Where else do you get unfettered access to such a resource? You also have a career development center. After college, all you have are the contacts you have made, the mentors you have found, and the alumni association to help you network. Everything else you need to pay a membership to receive an equivalent. Start making use of what you have right there. Study hard, get good grades, establish good contacts, make friends, because before you know it college is over. Whether you get good grades or not in college, you will be nostalgic for these years and the things you got to try. I assume you are likely to not have any other responsibilities: no spouse, no children, no job, few bills to pay, no taxes, no health insurance payments (USA). You are really still a stunted adult at this time. That is why college is a luxury. You are insulated in many ways from the responsibilities of adulthood. Stay loose. ",
