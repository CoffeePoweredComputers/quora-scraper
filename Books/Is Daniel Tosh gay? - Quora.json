            "answer_text": "No, I thought it was a known fact that Tosh has a GF, however leaving people guessing seems to be show biz thing to do when looking for an audience. The gay audience is a crowd that performers would love to tap into due to their expendable income is above the heterosexual norm and gay people love entertainment. If a performer manages to tap into the revenue stream by advertising that they are not prejudiced to the lifestyle, it can pretty much guarantee sold out venues. Just check out Lisa Lampanelli, Kathy Griffin, Lady Gaga and the names can go on...all heterosexuals who have embraced the gay community and they (the gays) will not turn their backs to an entertainer who makes the effort.

Having been an in the closet while in college frat boy, I can tell you that only truly straight guys are as comfortable being naked often with other guys like tosh is. If he was gay he wouldn't be so comfortable getting butt naked around other guys. Hes awesome. Lol ",
