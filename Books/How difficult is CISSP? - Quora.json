            "answer_text": "Considering the prerequisite of 5 years experience in the IT Security industry you will have skills in some of the domains covered by CISSP. For example if you have been on the operational side such as a firewall administrator or a security analyst your skills are probably very strong in the technical aspects. However, you may never have dealt with policy, compliance or risk management. My advice is to focus on the CISSP domains that you are weakest in. For me I was weak in encryption so having a developers background I built a password vault system that used encryption to store the passwords \u201cat rest\u201d. This enabled me to better understand how encryption works. If firewalls and networking are a weak point then grab an old computer and install Sophos UTM free edition for home use, set that up at home and add some firewall rules, configure a VPN etc\u2026. The great thing about the Sophos UTM for home is that its a full enterprise-level firewall - with all the features free for home use. If your weakness is on policy, compliance and risk then offer to update the security policy of your business or just review and provide recommendations on what should be included etc\u2026 I guess what I am saying is \u201cdoing\u201d is better than trying to absorb all you need to learn just reading about it. Of course you still need to study all the CISSP domains in the study guide to ensure you understand what they consider important. Finally, the best study guide for me was James M. Stewart, Mike Chapple and Darril Gibson - CISSP Study Guide (the one with the light house on the cover) - easy to read and digest. I found Shon Harris far too detailed and the sarcastic remarks at the beginning of each chapter annoying and childish. ",
