First, \u201cCrossbreed\u201d was a fanmade YouTube video with zero ties to any official Twilight anything (see answer here: Cyndy Aleo's answer to When is \"The Twilight Saga - Crossbreed\" releasing?) Secondly, the term \u201ccrossbreed\u201d is racist as all get-out so why on earth does anyone think Stephenie Meyer and/or a publisher and/or a movie producer would ever release anything with that name?
