            "answer_text": "At first i clearly say you if you're taking science for reputation , parents pressure,izzat then dont take it. we have many other good streams arts and commerce some peoples from this are more successful than science. Now second point - choice science if youre really having interest in it . You like all subjects and want to study them even by giving hardwork. Choice science if you're ready to work hard for next 2years . theres nothing like that who scored bad in 10th cannot score good in12th if you want to score you can get good score. But first ask to yourself rather than others that are you ready to work hard for next years are you ready to have that proud and happiness after results . If answer is 0.000001 percent YES! from inside take it. ",
