            "answer_text": "No doubt there are some of the universes most powerful secrets staring you in the face right now. (Most people dont even know they're there!) Here in moses lake washington at Willamette egg (owned by Michael foods, which is owned by post Inc) they actually throw away 1,000,000 chickens a year into a garbage dump. I didnt fully believe it untill I talked with my boss Dan a bit more, and true. The FDA wont allow them to be used as fertilizer for the local farms, because of possible groundwater contamination (I used to think the FDA were douche-bags, but after reading about about some real nasty chemical spills/contamination with the Air force, I began to think that maybe they are trying to do something good. I wouldn't be surprised if they were still tilted towards self expedience though) so the chickens are seemingly expediently-stupidly dumped in a land fill near/at roosevelt, near Oregon. I looked up even more chicken egg farms, all over the country, and it's my guess that if the FDA caused that to washingtons old egg chickens, then it's being done to old egg chickens all over the US. I wonder which financial books you read. \u201cthe creature from Jekyll island\"?(you should read that, if you can handle going crazy for about a week [I did]) did you know the interest system that banks charge for homes (I think it applies to all loan-interest systems, but I think bulk quantities of home loans pay them very well) exploit lendee ignorance? The interest is charged daily, and due to mathematics(power function), if you pay that monthly payment, but pay it twice as frequently the interest paid is perhaps like 1/10th of what it was before! (My german friend told me a bit about that, I thought the banking system was doing something funny, and he helped illuminate it. I still wanted more exercises/examples of that knowledge for my knowledge edification, but we hadnt quite managed to get around to it again) I had some spread sheet data, about the financial margins according to certain industries. All banking had pretty much a net of ~25%, and shockingly the gross margin (they dont even use the term \u201cprofit\", they use \u201cmargin\". It's a psychological blunting object\u2026)[they are wonderfully clever!] Is 200%! Banking is one of the best kept secrets, right in plain sight! (Liberation. That is what everyone wants. Also manifestation too.) I wonder, if someone told you a wildly powerful piece of knowledge, if you would change-act on it. You are immersed in power. (One bit you could do [but I'll bet is unlikely you'll do it] is that you could write 4-5 pages of appreciation/gratitude per day, and watch how your cognition changes. You'll see the truth that you are a super trillionaire [you really are]. It's a fact. Judging by how most people act, you're probably unlikely to do the 4-5 pages of appreciation-gratitude, and unlikely to see that I'm right that you're more than a super trillionaire, you're a quadrillionaire [or more. And you're likely to be blind and ungrateful for the immense power that you're totally immersed in]) When you become saturated with appreciation-gratitude, all the money-power that you want, will begin to reveal-give-offer itself to you.(they are right, that it's your vibration that determines what you get. They have even begun to hire physicists for banking, because even money moves like the way energy behaves. They call them econo-physicists.)(energy is a vibration) ",

This has been the most important book of my life. It has guided me for 45 years. Written in 1910. Think and Grow Rich came out in 1937. It is the other book that changed my life. It showed me how to apply the knowledge from As a Man Thinketh. Read, The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J. Stanley Commitment- \u201cUntil one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: That the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence (the protective care of God) moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favour all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamt would have come his way. Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it.
