            "answer_text": "It depends on the person with autism and the person interacting with them. If the person interacting with the autistic person knows them well they can probably read them about as well as any other person because they have learned how the autistic person responds differently and how they respond similarly to allistics. A lot of non-autistics tend to view lack of eye contact as a sign of being deceptive. Many autistics are not good at eye contact. A lot of non-autistics tend to view lack of basic social interaction skills (for example: talking over people instead of doing back and forth conversation, sticking to limited topics the other person isn\u2019t interested in, interupting, not following conversation shifts, not being competent at small talk) as rude and inconsiderate. Many autistics are very passionate about their topics and have trouble understanding that not everyone else is. Many also don\u2019t get the point of \u201csmall talk\u201d. A lot of non-autistics expect certain physical movements in conjunction with conversation as a sign the other person is engaged. Many autistics neither know nor care about that aspect of communication. Most non-autistics expect a certain level of deception in thier conversations, ie \u201cwhite lies.\u201d Many autistics either don\u2019t lie or lie poorly and often don\u2019t see the point of \u201cwhite lies\u201d to begin with. You can see, based on this, that if a non-autistic is interacting with an autistic person and expecting the other person to behave as though they are non-autistic then it would be very easy to misread the autistic person\u2019s interactions. If the non-autistic person doesn\u2019t know the other person is autistic then they will expect them to behave in the same way as every other non-autistic person they have interacted with. Autistic people who have learned to mask by following non-autistic social interaction skill can also misread an autistic person who hasn\u2019t done so. So, yes, autistic people can be hard to read for people that do not personally know them well. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the core aspects of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is social dysfunction. This can manifest in a range of behaviors, from completely avoiding any sort of personal interaction at all\u2026 to completely monopolizing conversations on a single topic that nobody other than the person speaking seems to be very interested in. There is no fixed pattern to social dysfunction, but it\u2019s almost always one of the major identifiers of ASD and often the one that stands out the most when interacting with someone on the spectrum. For high-functioning autistic individuals, these social skills deficits can be so minor as to be almost entirely unnoticeable in casual conversation. People with HFA (high-functioning autism) commonly adopt coping methods or have the ability to acquire social skills to fit in better. They are often able, with proper training (which often includes components of applied behavior analysis), to make significant progress in social interactions. Nonetheless, at some level, even high-functioning autistics almost always struggle with some discomfort or ineptitude in social interactions. Understanding the Connection Between Social Skills and Autism All of these social skills problems are rooted in some of the basic elements of ASD: Delays and difficulty in acquiring verbal communication skillsInability to read non-verbal communication cuesRepetitive or obsessive behaviors and insistence on an adherence to fixed routineOverwhelming sensory inputsThese combinations of traits make it enormously difficult for ASD patients to acquire the basic social skills that most of us take for granted. This deficit is often misread as a desire to avoid people or social situations, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth: most individuals with ASD badly want to interact with others, they simply don\u2019t have the skillset to do so easily. This, in turn, can breed frustration that only fuels the fire. People on the spectrum may have outbursts and throw tantrums or express themselves inappropriately in social contexts, essentially as a result of boiling over at their difficulty to either understand their place in a social situation or make themselves understood to others. At the opposite end of the spectrum, but equally rooted in social skills deficits, some with ASD are unable to fully grasp their own communication issues and often fail to recognize how their way of communicating can be offensive or make others feel uncomfortable. These types of social missteps manifest in obliviousness\u2014monopolizing conversations, being unable or unwilling to converse outside particular topic areas, or generally shutting out all external stimulus. Dealing With Social Skills Issues in ASD Patients It\u2019s difficult to deal with social dysfunction because social skills cover such a broad gamut of capabilities. These include: Verbal and non-verbal communicationAnalytical and inferential skillsSensory perceptionUnderstanding of context in social situationsThere is limited research on the outcomes for social skills training but what exists suggest that it is hampered by a failure to emphasize social skill development and implement it effectively. A 2007 meta-analysis by Indiana University of 55 social skills intervention programs used in school-age ASD populations found that they were largely ineffective. Not surprisingly, social skills training that took place when autistic students were segregated from the general student population was far less effective than if it took place in their usual classroom alongside neurotypical kids \u2013 as if a study was needed to figure that out. Nonetheless, school programs were found to be more effective than programs offered in other contexts, which suggests that training social skills in social environments\u2014a naturalistic approach often used in ABA therapy\u2014shows the most promise. And some therapists have suggested that most ABA therapy aimed at improving social skills simply isn\u2019t intense and immersive enough to help patients develop more socially appropriate behavior and abandon bad social habits and responses. As humans, we\u2019re all social animals to a greater or lesser degree, so the importance of being able to thrive \u2013 or at least function \u2013 in normal social settings is fundamentally key to happiness and a normal human experience. As ABAs work to address things like cognition and communication skills, positive outcomes in these areas are sure to translate to improved social skills and a better quality of life. Good luck i hope that this helps! ",

They judge autism from the things they observe, with no idea of what is really going on. They will talk to you about dysfunction and deficit when we often have unusual abilities. If you get responses from Autistics who may also be professionals, you are likely to get very different responses. Your question is a good one and the answer does not lie in telling you that autistics are socially dysfunctional. They are different and many of their unusual behaviours are being found to be functional with regard to different brain structure. So yes, Autistics can be hard for non autistics to read, just as they are hard for us to read. ",

Personally, I\u2019ve found that I am very hard for the average person to get a read on when I\u2019m not emulating typical body language. I have my own kind of body language which is very different from a neurotypical. I don\u2019t smile, frown, or have open body language. I have my own things that I do that people close to me have come to understand and learn. I imagine that many other autistics are the same way. Many autistics have difficulty understanding and responding to social cues which is another part of the reason why people find it difficult to get a reading on us. It puts people on edge because they don\u2019t know what we\u2019re thinking or feeling. On the other hand, it\u2019s fairly easy for me to get a read on most neurotypical people due to my years of studying them. There\u2019s two sides to this coin. ",

The best example of this I can think of is the popular term \u2018resting bitch face\u2019. I\u2019m told I look angry or bored all the time, when that\u2019s usually not how I feel.

Many are uncomfortable with maintaining eye and face contact from birth. Since learning to make facial expressions requires looking at faces, that's one trait that works against developing this particular aspect of common allistic society communication. Projecting honest feelings and thoughts often has led young children with ASD to be persecuted, punished, and invalidated repeatedly until they shut down or learn some way to fake it. In response, many will learn to mask everything they think and feel from showing outwardly. ",
