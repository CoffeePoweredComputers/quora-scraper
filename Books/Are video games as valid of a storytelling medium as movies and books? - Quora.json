            "answer_text": "This is a good question, and it may even rile some people up since they view video games as child\u2019s play, which should not be taken seriously. Generally speaking, yes, video games are as valid of a storytelling medium as movies and books because they connect us to something greater than ourselves and it\u2019s not just from an observation point of view. When we watch movies or read books, we often see the character, we sometimes empathize with them but we never become them. Sometimes, there are options that we can choose for the characters we see. In video games however, we get to play and to be that character. We have the choice to do what we think is right or wrong, depending on what your intentions are. This is how powerful storytelling in video games is - it allows us to become someone else, besides ourselves, who is not merely observing what happens to our environment but we end up participating and making changes to most of the things around us. As a result, there\u2019s a more personal connection, which makes video games a valid storytelling medium. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, as one who loves to read, enjoys good cinema, and can easily spend 120 hours playing one singe character or run through on a great game, yes. In fact, most games are better at telling stories than movies are. Take for instance the rebooted Tomb Raider trilogy, or games such as Beyond: Two Souls (which, in fact, stars Willem Dafoe and Ellen Page) or Detroit: Become Human. The storyline in Tomb Raider spans 3 games thus far, and it contains far too much character and plot development to fit into any maintainable run length, at least not in an equivalent number of movies. The other two games listed are completely character driven. The choices you make determine the story you experience. I dont know any movie that has effectively achieved that yet haha. In conclusion, I would have to say that video games are comparable to books in respect to their storytelling capabilities. ",

            "answer_text": "Videogame is a new medium in storytelling. It is the little brother of cinema and a great-grandson of the literature. The interactivity and possibly repetitive nature of medium on the other hand are very specific. It tells a story, but also adds a sense of presence. One can argue that a good piece of art does that too and that is true. What makes video games unique though it is the possibility of physical presence., which is now possible in 3D environment of VR.
