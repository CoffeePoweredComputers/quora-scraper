            "answer_text": "Jon can\u2019t compare to Barristan, or Jaime, but\u2026no one can (not even Jaime, at this point). One of the themes of ASOIAF /GoT is that the great heroes and warriors of the world are dead, dying, or diminished. Jon isn\u2019t Arthur Dayne; he isn\u2019t the greatest fighter in the world. But he\u2019s better than most. And he\u2019s improving, rather than deteriorating. At this point in the series, he has a fair amount of combat experience. Sure, Qhorin threw the fight. But Jon has seen a lot of fighting since then. By the time he has become the King in the North, I\u2019d say he\u2019s a bit more than just above average. And not just because of Ramsay\u2019s glib comment at the Battle of the Bastards. Jon is a lot like Ned. He isn\u2019t as fearsome as the world\u2019s absolute best in single combat, but he still walks away from fights when they don\u2019t. Ned survived Robert\u2019s rebellion without serious injury, a rebellion that killed Rhaegar Targaryen and Arthur Dayne and wounded Barristan the Bold. Similarly, Jon has survived a number of serious skirmishes and battles - and not because he hides in the closet like Janos Slynt. Jon was already better than his fellow recruits, as well as many of the members of the Night\u2019s Watch, when he joined the order in the first season. By this point, he\u2019s no longer just well trained; he has the experience of battles such as his attack on the mutineers at Craster\u2019s Keep, the attack on Castle Black, Hardhome, and the Battle of the Bastards under his belt. He has cut down wights, wildlings, and white walkers. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns in single combat, and he killed well over a dozen men at the Battle of the Bastards and walked away relatively unharmed. Jon also has the added benefit of wielding Valyrian steel, which is lighter, stronger, and sharper than any castle-forged blade. Longclaw gives him a distinct advantage in a fight. It also emphasises an important point of the larger conflict: brawn alone will not stop the Night\u2019s King. Jon is a fine swordsman, and an increasingly experienced warrior, but his major asset is his ability to see and plan for the real threat. Longclaw killed the White Walker that Jon faced at Hardhome, and as far as we know it can kill the Night\u2019s King. Jon may not ever face the Night\u2019s King himself, this being GoT which loves to upend tropes and expectations. But he\u2019s far better prepared for that eventuality than most other characters in the series. ",

            "answer_text": "A distinction has to be made here between the show and the books. In the Show, Jon progresses to become a prolific warrior and by Season 8, he is probably one of the fiercest fighters in the realm, able to go toe to toe with pretty much everyone alive at that point. In the books however, there hasn\u2019t really been much indication that he is an unbelievable swordsman, he\u2019s definitely better than average, and probably even good, but he could in no way go toe to toe with the likes of the Jaime, Arthur Dayne, Barristan, the Hound etc. They\u2019re in a different league to him. So, to sum up, in the show he is a prolific fighter by S8, whereas in the books, he\u2019s probably an above average to good fighter. ",
