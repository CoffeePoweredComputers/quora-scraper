            "answer_text": "It all depends on the requirement of accommodation of family members-so the family size. additionally the availability of funds or loans from a bank or LIC. The construction cost varies as per one\u2019s choice of material. fittings, facilities etc. third is the availability of land at a price which comes in the budget. For example, if a comfortable Indian House is to be built for say two -three-generation then 25% of the land can be left open for garden and passages separating the neighbors building. This is essential for getting Sunlight and fresh air. Our house is in a govt. plot of land of about 3000sq.ft. size. but we have a garden space- which can be used as parking of about 700 sq.ft. then we have 4ft. passages on the two sides. so the built-up area is around 2000 sq. ft and having three bedrooms an inner courtyard and a drawing room with two bathrooms kitchen and a dining space. we are middle-class people so we could invest only a sum of about 20\u201330 lakhs about 10 years back. so pl. consult a good architect and try to have the best as per your comfort.
