            "answer_text": "Like so many of us, we are being forcibly trained to constantly take in more advertising, faster dialogue, shorter scenes, unending chatter and the deeply annoying television practice of interrupting the flow of a program in mid-fucking-sentence for a commercial a total of six times an hour, but not insulting the commercial with reciprocal treatment. Not that I\u2019m bitter. It\u2019s no wonder you can\u2019t finish an article. I can\u2019t watch movies that are older than about four years\u2026they\u2019re too slow. If I watch \u201cSpartacus\u201d starring the late, great Kirk Douglas, in the first four minutes, I want to hear Tony Curtis jump up and say \u201cI\u2019M SPARTUCUS!\u201d and get to the crucifixion. We\u2019re moving quickly toward \u201cNew Speak\u201d and young people, enslaved to I-phones, can\u2019t spell, read, or write cursive. They socialize with their thumbs and slang. I knew a guy got married and was divorced with two kids and paying alimony by the time they went on honeymoon. Learn to meditate and clear your assaulted head. I\u2019m exhausted. ",
