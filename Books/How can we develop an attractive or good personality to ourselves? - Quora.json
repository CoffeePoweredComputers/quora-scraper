            "answer_text": "Q. How can we make an attractive personality? It sounds to me like you may be aiming to accomplish any or all of the following: Be successful, or more successful, at getting many dates, that might then lead to a relationship or marriage . \u2014 or \u2014Be popular, or more popular, in your school or workplace, because you want to be an \u201caccepted member\u201d of the \u201cpopular crowd\u201d, or you want to be a \u201cpremium member\u201d of the \u201cpopular crowd\u201d. \u2014 or \u2014If you are a salesperson, sell more of your items by virtue of your charming or attractive personalityI recommend that you approach this very carefully. . [Be careful that you are not slip-sliding into the territory of manipulating another person.] IMHO, I do not find a personality that is contrived, constructed, configured, \u201cmade\u201d, manufactured, molded, shaped, or artificially altered for an intended purpose, to be attractive. . At all. Rather than strive to have an attractive personality, I recommend that you approach life with an entirely different question. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 So, I am going to recommend that you ask the following question instead: Q. How can I become naturally happy? . Not \u201cpretend happy\u201d, or \u201coutwardly charming\u201d but truly happy deep down in your heart and soul? If you can become naturally happy, you can just stop worrying about needing to have an \u201cattractive personality\u201d \u2014 that problem is just going to go away, and thank goodness for that, that\u2019s a relief! Here is my philosophy\u2026 If you can become naturally happy on your own, you will not have to worry about dates with good people, they will eventually find you, or you will find them. And you can\u2019t force that kind of natural happiness, you must have patience. So now we come face-to-face with the some of the most important questions of human existence, and human experience\u2026 \u2014 THE CORE QUESTIONS \u2014 Q. What is happiness? \u2026 What is \u201cfeeling good\u201d? \u2026 What is pleasure? \u2026 What is joy? \u2026 What is contentment? \u2026 What is inner peace? Q. Are these all different, or the same? \u2026 How are they related or connected? \u2026 And especially, what causes or creates these? Q. Conversely, what is sadness? \u2026 What is pain? \u2026 What is suffering? \u2026 And especially, what causes or creates these? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 This is a large and complex subject. . I am only going to offer a short answer here. . And you will be free to accept it, or reject it, or just think about it further. When you look very closely at what makes people \u201cfeel good\u201d in general, you will see that there are many levels or kinds of pleasure, and many kinds or levels of happiness, and many kinds or levels of pain and suffering. \u2014 THE HAPPINESS PRINCIPLE \u2014 The highest and most important kind of happiness comes \u2014 slowly but surely (with much variation from person to person) \u2014 to those who act to promote the well being of others (including all forms of life), as much or more than than they act to create luxuries and pleasures in their own life.[ Please note very carefully the words that I have highlighted in bold: . happiness, act, well being, and pleasures. . I chose these words very deliberately. ] \u2014 The Happiness Corollary \u2014 You can directly create pleasure in your life, but you cannot directly create the highest and most important kind of happiness. . You can only gradually discover and gradually unfold that kind of happiness over time, by following the Happiness Principle stated above.\u2014 The Well-Being Corollary \u2014 When you act to promote the long-term well-being of someone, it may or may not \u201cfeel good\u201d to that someone [at least not at the time]. . Just ask any parent, teacher, coach, mentor, dentist, doctor, or care-giver.\u2014 The Keep-Your-Word Corollary \u2014 If you say you are going to do something that is virtuous \u2014 especially if it is a solemn vow \u2014 and you keep your word, you will gradually increase the happiness in your life.If it infrequently happens that you must break your word, for a truly good or virtuous cause, there is no substantial impact on your happiness.But if you break your word, merely for reasons of your own personal pleasure, personal gain, personal status, or personal convenience, you will reduce the happiness in your life.If you put the Happiness Principle into practice in your daily life, you will eventually be happy at the highest and most important level. . But it may not happen right away, it may take many years, you will need to have patience. There is much more to say about the Core Questions, but if you start with the Happiness Principle, you cannot go wrong. May you apply the Happiness Principle every day of your entire life. ",

            "answer_text": "The one thing I find that can instantly turn a 5 into an 8 is confidence. Someone who knows what they want in life? Who knows what they're worth, what they like, and isn't afraid to get it and look silly doing it? Absolutely. Hell yes I want karaoke in the car, and I want someone who's not afraid or embarrassed to sing along-even if they sound terrible it's the confidence and the energy that's attractive. I don't want to spend the bulk of our time together having to reassure you of everything and having to limit myself because you're too embarrassed or self-conscious to do anything. But on the same breath, I've been on dates with \u201cconfident\u201d men where I practically spent the night stoking their ego. Yes maybe you work out. And hey you're a great singer, good for you. And wow you're a model? That's great. But chances are if this date had gone well and we actually ended up dating I would've figured these things out about you myself. Case in point- Do you have any idea how exhausting it is in the middle of dinner out to listen to a man spend 10 minutes straight going on about how good of an insurance salesman he'd be? Because he's \u201cthat good\u201d at convincing people (spoiler-it didn't work on me so that part's up for debate). It's exhausting, and it was a real spirit breaker let me tell ya-this guy was gorgeous. But after three or four dates I couldn't take it anymore. He practically went from a 9 to a 5. In short-be confident, but stay humble. ",
