            "answer_text": "Yes. I assure you that you can score about 300\u2013310 in Neet bio by just concentrating on NCERT of class 11th and 12th. It is often said that some questions come from out of the NCERT texts. This is true. Some questions do come from beyond the NCERT texts. This is where the teaching material from various coaching centres kicks in and saves the day. But if you have the NCERT of both 11th and 12th thoroughly on your fingertips, you'll have a great idea of the subject and you'll be able to solve the questions that come from outside the NCERT text by elimination method or just by simple logic. NCERT is the ultimate book for bio for NEET. ",

The leftover 30 marks depends on the extra information you read in the reference books you have or the material which is provided by your institution. Focus equally on Physics and Chemistry as well(It's my personal suggestion). ",
