            "answer_text": "The hardest thing for beginners to learn is how to hold their hook and keep their stitches even without pulling too hard on the stitch.  There are 2 ways to correct this,   teach them how to use the shaft of their hook to measure their stitches, every time they make a stitch, from chain stitch on up, pull it back on the shaft and make sure it fits (with a little give) around the shaft.    How to Keep Stitches Even  and Practice.  Here is a pattern that uses only chain stitches, but then they have something to show for it at the end. Free Pattern: Chain Stitch Bangle Bracelet Once they have mastered the chain stitch then they are ready to move on to single crochet.  This is another stitch that requires a lot of practice, but once they master this stitch, the taller stitches (doubles, triples, etc) will come easier.   When you demonstrate how to do this stitch (and all stitches) try to be in a position so that they can see how you see what you are doing.  I find this easiest to do by sitting side by side with them (right handers on my right, left handers on my left.)  The hardest row is always the first row because it's harder to do the single crochet stitches into the chain than other stitches. There are different methods of doing stitches into the chain, I usually recommend telling them that as long a they get into one loop, they are okay.  Once they have mastered stitching along a chain then you can show them things like inserting the hook into the top two loops of the chain stitch or only into the back bump.   As I do the stitch I describe what I'm doing and repeat it over and over to give them a reference point.    Insert the hook into the chain, yarn over the hook, pull up a loop. two loops on the hook, yarn over the hook, pull through both loops on the hook, then start the next stitch.There are also some good videos on Youtube that teach stitches.  I particularly like Crochet Geek.  She also has videos for left handers.   There are lots of good patterns for single crochet for beginners that allow them to practice their stitches, here are a few.  Make sure that as you go you teach them how to read the patterns also.  Here is a chart showing all the crochet abbreviations  Crochet Abbreviations Master List  and here is one for symbols Crochet Chart Symbols, I recommend you print these out and give them to your students.

            "answer_text": "first of all be patient. Teaching someone new to crochet is challenging. It is hard to hold yarn and hook at the same time. I remember when I taught my first born how to chaining when he was 7, he was crying, but then managed to make chain on his own way. But later on, things get easier.
