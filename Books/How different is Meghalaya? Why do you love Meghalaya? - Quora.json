            "answer_text": "Meghalaya means \u201c the abode of clouds\u201d. This Sanskrit name is very suitable for our state. A visitor to the state during summer season will definitely witness abode of clouds from any where. I am a Khasi, original native of Khasi Hills in Shillong, was born and brought up here in Meghalaya, could judge based on my observations, the influence of these clouds The presence of rain bearing Cloud NIMBUS and other clouds like COMMULUS, STRATUS, CIRRUS, etc. make it earn a name MEGHALAYA. These clouds in turn makes one of its village Mawsynram as a record holder of the highest amount of annual rainfall received on earth. According to the Guinness Book of World Records , Mawsynram received the highest annual rainfall of 26,000 millimeters (1,000 in) of rainfall in 1985.Also, Cherrapunjee has held two Guinness world records in the past for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single year: 26,471 millimeters (1,042.2 in) of rainfall between August 1860 and July 1861 and for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single month: 9,300 millimeters (370 in) in July 1861. This clearly indicates the main difference between Meghalaya and any other states in India. Also, from the point of view of air pollution , I can say without any hesitation that it is one of the state in India with negligible air pollution. The tourists( both national and international) who visited our state have made remark on the purity of air they breathe in while travelling through the interior of Meghalaya. In general, the original people of the state are very particular on cleanliness. This makes almost all parts of the state clean. There is a village in our state called Mawlynnong which has earned the name cleanest village in Asia. The presence of matrilineal society is another point showing its difference from other states n India. There is an Umngot river flowing through Dawki village at Indo-Bangladesh border which is crystal clear and any observer can see clearly the bottom of the river however deep is the part of the river. This degree of transparency is not practically observed any where else on earth. There are still many more points to show how different it is from any other parts of India. I love Meghalaya most is the negligible influence of bad culture like corruption and theft and the sustenance of its natural beauty in-spite of modern lifestyles of people living in it. Many of the foreign tourists from England and Scotland have made their comments that this place was very correctly named as the Scotland of the east. As far as weather is concern, it is the only state in India with natural air conditioned throughout the year except in winter where we hear complaints of bitter coldness from tourists. Strange enough to find a society in modern world where women are very well respected but this is what you may find here. From the point of scenic beauty, it is excellent every where and every Meghalayan takes pride of its natural beauty. Again here there are still many more points to substantiate why we love our state so much. Sorry, I have deleted quite a good number of photograph that I could not attach even a single photograph here to support my write up. I better end my writing here otherwise the write up will become too long that it may bore a good reader like you. ",
