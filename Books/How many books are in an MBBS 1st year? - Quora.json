            "answer_text": "Roughly 2 times the number of subjects you are covering for that year. One big one, one small one. Read the small one. If there is anything you don\u2019t understand, look it up in the big one and then close that big book asap before it sucks you in forever. Some of the big books can be expensive. You do not need the latest edition. Just pick up cheaper second hand ones if you can. Do spend some time shop around for good study guides. Finding a good study guide is liking finding a good friend. It makes studying a lot more pleasurable plus saves time. Anatomy can be a little bit tricky finding a good little book. Mosby\u2019s crash course anatomy is not bad. Embryology you are on your own. There is no good book for embryology, big or small. Stick to syllabus and past exam papers. These keep you focused on what\u2019s important for your stage of training. For 1st year MBBS, they want to see you understand the big picture. That\u2019s the main thing. ",
