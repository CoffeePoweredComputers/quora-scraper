            "answer_text": "1. Geographic : You can find Bengal Tigers near the delta of Ganga river, i.e. known as Sundarban a part of Bengal. Here by Bengal I mean West Bengal State in India and also neighbouring country Bangladesh. 2. Cultural : Royal Bengal Tiger is the national animal of Bangladesh and India. In that way Bengalis are related to Royal Bengal Tiger. 3. Historical and Others : Many legendary Bengali personalities are given nickname by their fans or followers. Like Ashutosh Mukhopadhyay , noted Bengali polymath, was known as Banglar Bagh. Also Sourav Ganguly , India Cricket Team\u2019s captain had the sobriquet Bengal Tiger in his halcyon days (in addition to various other as Dada, Prince of Calcutta). Also mascot of Bangladesh cricket Team and Kolkata Night Riders IPL franchise team hailing from this region is Bengal Tiger. I am not an anthropologist, but as per my knowledge in the process of evolution humans came after tigers. So many ways Bengal Tigers have influenced cultural and other aspects of Bengali\u2019s life. It is used as the symbol of Valour, Courage and Bravery of Bengalis. I hope you understand the relations. ",
