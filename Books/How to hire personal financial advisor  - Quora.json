            "answer_text": "An excellent financial advisor is also a financial planner and every aspect of that plan is personal. I\u2019d rather see you connect with a qualified financial advisor who is fee-only (works ONLY for your instead of a brokerage firm or insurance company). Even if all you need is a very light touch\u2014 just some guidance then you may keep that relationship and as you age and your financial life becomes a bit more layered and complex, you can begin to tap into the services of that advisor who has always had your best interest and you already know him or her. A great personal finance advisor relationship is long-term \u2014 someone who has your back to collaborate and help you make smarter money decisions whether it\u2019s about your retirement, your kids\u2019 education, special needs, real estate investing or a life transition such as divorce or dealing with an estate. Check out Jean Chatzky\u2019s new tool for helping people find the right fee only fiduciary advisor. It\u2019s on HerMoney.com. This is powered by my vetting of advisors and the whole point is to help you find the right vetted professional for your personal circumstances. No brokers. No sales reps. Advisors only. ",

            "answer_text": "That sounds like a financial coach. I am one. In general you want someone who is a financial coach, or a registered investment adviser (USA). These people have a fiduciary duty to you meaning they have to make recommendations that are in your best interest. Believe it or not, most \u201cadvisers\u201d do not have a fiduciary duty to their clients because they are \u201cregistered representatives\u201d of broker / dealers. Registered representatives means they are registered to sell products from their employer (the broker dealer). The more they sell, the more money they make. They have no more duty to look out for you than the used car salesman down the street. Most of the \u201cadviser\u201d companies you have heard of are broker / dealers. (e/g/ B of A , Merrill Lynch, Ameriprise, Prudential, and many many more). Google the relevant terms and you\u2019ll find someone.

            "answer_text": "By referral is the best method. Ask around your friends and people you respect and see if they can recommend someone. Once you have found a couple contact them and let them know you are looking to hire a financial adviser and would like to talk to a few of their clients to get references. Once that is done go through the process with the top two and select who you are most happy with. Hope that helps! ",
