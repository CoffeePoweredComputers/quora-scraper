            "answer_text": "You should go for an ERP solution. It takes a lot of effort and time in creating all the required functionality in excel and sure u need to concentrate on your business instead of managing and struggling with the excel sheets. Though it is humanly impossible to do all the inventory management and accounts management in excel. Excel is not a database tool. MS Access can be used,but again u need to work alot to set it up. Also data integrity is an issue with Excel and u don't want to loose money just because one of the many excel file crashed and lost some data. You can try busywin or tally erp 9 if u want to track everything from raw material to martial in process to final goods and manage batches. To do so u need multiuser licence which costs around 30,000-50,000rs (30 for busy and 50 for tally) or if u want to manage just the basics inventory and accounts u can go for single user licence which costs around 10,000rs. If u just want to try out these softwares, trial versions are available for both. If u can adjust little bit with a few less features, cracked (pirated, free) old versions are also available online. But don't think of using excel as the core solution to do all this. Though u can use excel for analysis as a side tool but most of the analysis required for business are inbuilt in these erp softwares ",
