            "answer_text": "Econometrics is just the application of statistical analysis to economic questions. The use of econometrics in finance depends very much on the type of work you\u2019re doing. Investment banking is very much a relationship and sales business. While modeling is important, it\u2019s really limited to simple cash flow models, DCF, IRR, and NPV evaluations. There is very little predictive analytics in this space. Quantitative trading and forecasting is more of a back-office operation. This is where econometrics is very important. You\u2019ll be building predictive models that rely on historical datasets and different statistical applications. While it\u2019s been the better part of a decade since I took an econometrics class, I would suggest you augment any econometrics curriculum with a machine learning class. Learning the different predictive modeling theories and methodologies will only serve to strengthen and diversify your approach. ",

            "answer_text": "Clearly its importance varies from time to time and person to person. However in the strict sense, anyone working as a trader, broker, dealer, quant etc.. will have reason to at least touch upon the subject and more often than not will be engaged in its use quite frequently. The bottom line is that accurate measurements are essential when dealing with peoples lives, even indirectly as with money. Econometrics is just one set of tools that can help achieve and maintain acceptable degrees of accuracy in a given analysis. Sadly for the economist, trader and quant et al, the relationships between people and money, value, price, time and investments are variously transient, often interdependent and always changing. This makes them hugely complex, which is as it should be, because people are emotional sometime irrational beings, no matter how much they\u2019d like to think they aren\u2019t when it comes to money. Nevertheless such tools are important, because until something better comes along, they\u2019re all we have with which to try and find consistency and forecastability in the markets, even with the burgeoning suite of AI based tools now in use.
