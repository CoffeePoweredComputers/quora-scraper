            "answer_text": "NCERT is enough to \u201ccrack\u201d the NEET exam, however, you may not be able to score extraordinarily if you only stick to NCERT. It is essential that you have a good conceptual understanding of all topics in the NCERTs for which you will require other reference books. For Biology, you will be able to answer about 80% of the questions solely on the basis of NCERT, for the other 20%, you should use your coaching modules- Aakash or Allen or any other reference for extra information. Also, only doing NCERT is not sufficient to crack AIIMS, since it's a lever higher and does require better conceptual understanding and content knowledge for which you will definitely have to do more than just NCERT. However, your main and primary focus should be to do your NCERT thoroughly first and then move on to other books if time permits. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with this advice, since it suggests that books like trueman for biology have no relevance in this exam, but there is a flaw in it. It is incomplete. The missing part is about the way to follow it, and it is very important part as well. Let's talk about biology. While covering NCERT for it, it is very important to solve mcq's with it, since without it your preparation will never be upto the level of the competition. It is this point which i want to highlight, because this will help you cover up ncert the right way. Plus it will make your learning more efficient. But also ignore questions which are out of syllabus, believe me they won't be helping you even in aiims. You should also check previous year papers( for biology upto year 2015\u201316, not beyond that). +2 NCERT physics is very very helpful, especially in NEET. +1 ncert is ok.For physics, thoroughly analyse the NEET 2019 paper, since level of physics portion dipped considerably, so solving 2014\u201315 papers is not much required, 2017, 18 and most importantly 2019 is necessary. And i you are focussing on aiims, don't keep on thinking you need the extra stuff(for aiims do not solve previous year papers). For that you need even better grip of ncert, and for that solve questions of higher level which are from ncert, and not the extra one's. Also for inorganic, strictly follow ncert. Solving mcq's from this portion will really help you in memorizing this portion. AIIMS exam will be tough but it is not totally out of syllabus, enough portion is from ncert, which can get you a seat. Lastly never be swayed away by the people telling you that something extraordinary is required for aiims. Ncert and bit of extra efforts will do the job. Best of luck ",
