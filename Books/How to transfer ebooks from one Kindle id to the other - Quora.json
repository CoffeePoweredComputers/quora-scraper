            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t transfer Amazon Kindle eBooks from someone else\u2019s account\u2019s library to your own through the device itself, simply by receiving the Kindle device from them as a gift, with those titles on the device\u2019s memory. When someone \u201cpurchases\u201d a Kindle ebook, they agree to the \u201cdigital use of it\u201d on their account exclusively. When you deregister the device that was previously registered to someone else\u2019s Amazon account, then rereigster the device on your own account, the Kindle ebooks will no longer be available to read. However, some Kindle ebooks can be stripped of their copyright use protection by software that is available online. I won\u2019t mention their names here, or the websites where they can be downloaded, but you can look for them online using your favorite search engine. There are also some documents which may have been transferred to the Kindle device from the previous owner\u2019s computer via cable, in which case, if they are not also protected/encrypted, such as .PDFs or .MOBIs, just to name a few, then you can still read them. Further, you can hack your Kindle device, download a foreign eBook Reader application and install it, then read whatever eBooks are on the account logged into that software, including your own or the previous owner\u2019s library. To hack your Kindle device, although a definite violation of the use and warranty terms between you and Amazon, again, use your favorite search engine to look it up online. If the device was already in your Family Household, per the Amazon declarations, although registered to someone else in that same Family Household, and they gave you their device, you can reregister the device into your own Amazon account and can still read those eBooks, provided that Sharing was enabled on the previous owner\u2019s account for their eBook Library. The previous owner of the Kindle eReader device could, after you reregister it into your own Amazon account, send the eBook(s) to you per Amazon\u2019s rules about Loaning titles or Borrowing titles, the process being fully legal and described on the Amazon website. If the eBooks on the Kindle device were borrowed from the local public library or another digital library online, you will want to check their use and permissions for those titles, and instructions on how to transfer those eBooks to your own account or else re-borrow those titles. Finally, if you got a Kindle eReader device from someone else, loaded with Kindle eBooks that you want to continue reading, you can always just keep the device registered with the previous owner\u2019s Amazon account, with their permission, of course, and just read the titles until you are finished, then reregister the device to your own account, thus clearing out everything that was previously on the device. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "You would need to contact Kindle support, explain the situation, give both id\u2019s, and request they transfer the books from one to the other. It will likely require a statement from the person who gave it to you that the books were a gift, and sent to the wrong id by mistake. ",
