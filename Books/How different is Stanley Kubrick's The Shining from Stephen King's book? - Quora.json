            "answer_text": "Very. So much so, that other than the name of the Hotel and the characters, it might as well be another story. King\u2019s character development is impecable. Jack Torrance is a recovering alcoholic , who\u2019s all out of breaks. He was once a college professor but his alcoholism and anger issues killed that. His only chance now is to fulfill his job as the Winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. His son Danny has what the Hotel\u2019s cook Halloran, calls the shining. This means psychic abilities that include telepathy and precognitive abilities. But Danny is a little kid, so he doesn\u2019t comprehend this side of himself. He loves his father. Wendy Torrance is Jack\u2019s wife. She is not a shrinking violet/abused woman as in the movie. She is a woman trying to give the man she loves one last chance to get things right. She is intelligent and resourceful. Jack loves his family, truly. He\u2019s not neurotic or paranoid as portrayed in the movie. Halloran, the cook will be an essential character in the climatic section and epilogue of the book. In the movie, he\u2019s essentially there just to get killed. The hotel itself, as many or most of the places in King\u2019s books, is also a character. It needs Jack to get to Danny and his powers. In the book, Jack will be completely taken over by the hotel and its ghosts. However, his love for Danny will cause him to sacrifice himself for Danny. The movie is just about a neurotic alcoholic and his abused wife and their rather annoying little boy. So, disappointing. It\u2019s a beautiful car with no engine. ",

            "answer_text": "The main difference between the book and the Kubrick movie is the portrayal of the main characters. Jack Torrance in the book is a well-meaning but misguided man, trying to be a good husband and father, and struggling to stay sober after years of alcoholism. His wife Wendy is confident and self-assured, very much her own person. In the movie Jack is a selfish bastard, more concerned about rescuing his writing career than his family. Wendy is twitchy and overly protective of her son Danny, but too dependent on Jack to consider life without him. The book shows Jack as a victim of the Overlook Hotel\u2019s supernatural malevolence. It uses Jack as its agent to get at Danny, whose psychic powers it wants to possess, bending Jack to its will and turning him violent. Jack manages to keep enough of his wits to allow his family to escape, and sacrifices himself while destroying the hotel. The movie makes Jack the author of his own destruction. The ghosts of the hotel never take possession of him, but rather nudge him in the direction he was already leaning. He turns violent because he had violence in him all along. He does not die a hero, but as another soul for the still intact hotel. There are some plot points that differ, like the balky boiler and topiary animals from the book which don\u2019t exist in the movie. Actually I think the movie is better for dropping those. Stephen King was upset at the differences, but his own attempt to tell the story, a TV miniseries from 1997, wasn\u2019t nearly as good. ",
