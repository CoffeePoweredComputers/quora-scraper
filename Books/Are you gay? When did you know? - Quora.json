            "answer_text": "There is no one way that gay people act or look \u2013 gay people are just as diverse as straight people. Just because you are a man who is effeminate or a woman who is boyish, that does not mean that you're necessarily gay. So don't fall into the trap of thinking that your clothes, hair or attitude determines your sexuality. When looking at the signs you are gay, you might want to ask yourself these questions: Have I ever been sexually attracted to the same sex?Do I feel strong emotional bonds to the same sex?Am I physically attracted to the same sex?Have I considered having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex?Have I had sexual same-sex experiences in the past?With that being said, I discovered myself really in the 8th grade. Long story, but here we go. There was this field trip we took at the end of the year in 8th grade to a local theme park. We wouldn\u2019t come home until about 2 in the morning. My mom told me before my schoolmates left on the trip that she\u2019s fine with me staying at one of my friends houses. My gay friend (of course she didn\u2019t know that). I didn\u2019t necessarily expect anything to \u201cgo down\u201d that night. Was I worried about it? Not really. I had a girlfriend at the time. I wasn\u2019t so much attracted to her sexually, not even really her looks. I was just dating her to hide my sexuality, because I felt it was obvious that I was gay-curious. Anyway, at about 2 AM that night, I woke up to my friend masturbating. Rather intrigued, and in the position I was in, I watched him, and he didn\u2019t notice me for about 5 minutes. Of course I had to sneeze, which happened. Long story short, I had sex with a boy, which helped me figure out Im gay. I am not promoting unsafe sexual intercourse, nor am I saying that it is the only way to discover yourself. ",

And your thinking to yourself i dont get it, what is it about girls. The. You get just a little older and you realize that what your friend are taking about with the girls and what they want to do, youre thinking about the boys. I gues it sometime in high school that i knew for sure, i didnt admit it even to myself but i should have. I would only check out guys gym and showers hard, no pun intended. Ive never really checked out a woman ive only checked out guys. I mean that how you know im a guy , i get hard when i think about guys. I want to be with a guy. I can recognize an attractive woman, but when i think about who i want to be with emotionaly, physicaly sexually , it always another guy. My most erotic sexual fantasies only involve guys. Thats how know i dont want to sex with a woman at all, But i want to have sex all kinds of sex with a guy. I want to bottom, top , please him orally, reciece oral kiss him hold him make love to him. That how i know i am gay for sure. ",

A beautiful little boy, brown hair, white skin, freckles, and a cute laugh. I had these types of feelings in kindergarten but I didn\u2019t tell anyone. Only because I felt that I already didn\u2019t fit in and I was going to get in trouble for liking someone or something like that. Me and him used to put on princess dresses and wear the plastic princess heels as a joke and we used to laugh all day together. We were best friends til 3rd grade when I left the school. fast forward now, a couple months ago the same guy I had a crush on, whom I haven\u2019t seen in 5 years, texted me, asking me if I was gay. I didn\u2019t know what to say, but I denied it. Only because I wasn\u2019t out at the time, and even if we are far from each other, I\u2019d rather not have my old friends hear it. I\u2019m proud of myself, me being gay, and I wouldn\u2019t change it. There are just times you don\u2019t let everyone in on your business. ",
