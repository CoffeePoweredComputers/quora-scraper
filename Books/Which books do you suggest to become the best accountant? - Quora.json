            "answer_text": "It will depend on the country you\u2019re in and the regulations they have to becoming an accountant. This will vary from country to country. There is also more than one type of accountant, which can mean you take on different paths for different roles. In the UK, there are multiple pathways to becoming a financial accountant (Private practice accountant), management accountant (Management accountant), public financial accountant (Public finance accountant), auditor (Auditor | Explore careers | National Careers Service), tax advisor (Tax adviser | Explore careers | National Careers Service), and bookkeeper (Bookkeeper | Explore careers | National Careers Service). I would look into bookkeeping as a subject first, as you will need to understand the basics of bookkeeping in any accounting role. The best books for that would be the AAT textbooks, but you can also look at those by ICB and IAB. What you choose to progress after that will depend on your area of interest. If you have a degree, there are graduate employers who are willing to train you to become an accountant. Should you not have a degree, you can become an accounts technician before progressing onto the accounting qualification. There are specialist qualifications after you have done your accounting qualification, should you wish to specialise e.g. Certified Tax Advisor (UK tax). The US has its own rules regarding becoming a CPA: Certified Public Accountant: How to Become a CPA?

            "answer_text": "To become an accountant you really can\u2019t just read a book. You have to observe and do. When I became an accountant I did of course spend endless hours reading my text books. However, I put into practice the observations I learned from my books, whether that be during my assignment or while at work. So above all I would recommend getting work experience, enrolling in college courses and checking out online youtube resources. However, if you are looking for inspiration to join the field of accounting you could read books like \u201cThe Thief in Your Company\u201d by Tiffany Dawn or \u201cThe Reckoning\u201d by Jacob Soll. If you are looking for a fantasized version of accounting you could read \u201cThe Firm\u201d by John Grisham. ",
