Start always with NCERT to build a strong conceptual Base and then for JEE refer to reference books and solve questions from them. for knowing which books to refer use the following YouTube link:  for more Interesting answers Related to JEE visit my profile and checkout Your needs Don\u2019t read other unnecessary stuff there and save your time You can also try reading my friend Abhinav Bhatnagar Answer to this question How can I prepare for JEE Advanced without coaching?

To answer this let me know you that for some students NCERT books are really enough for jee mains. But most of the students require some kind of reference to have in-depth knowledge of concepts. In fact, The basics for most problems in JEE Mains are from NCERT textbook for Physics and all you require is to alter the arguments as required in the problem. This, of course, requires a deep understanding of the concepts, which few students find difficult to learn from NCERT textbooks, hence requiring other books. Also, you can download NCERT books pdf through the Toppr: the better learning app because it provides you complete book Pdf with the solutions with that you can also go for videos for NDA preparation, it's totally free to watch so that it's easy for you for the preparation. I hope my answer helps you. Thank you \ud83d\udc4d All the best!! ",

            "answer_text": "NCERT books sufficient for JEE Main Chemistry? One can\u2019t deny that NCERT textbooks are the most crucial material to refer for JEE Chemistry. Almost 60-75 % of the questions are directly taken from NCERT textbook for Chemistry. Major portion of the remaining requires application of concepts and mechanisms explained in the text, a trend especially seen in Organic Chemistry. Inorganic Chemistry too has most questions from NCERT. Questions from Physical chemistry, however, are easier to attend if you have learned the concepts and applications from somewhere other than just NCERT books. Importantly on the other hand, there are few chapters like Biomolecules, Polymers, Redox reactions etc. which, otherwise broad topics to learn from external sources, can be best dealt with through NCERT textbooks. All said, make sure you read every chapter of NCERT Books at least once for JEE, because it might not be sufficient but it is definitely necessary. NCERT books sufficient for JEE Main Mathematics? Mathematics is regarded as the hardest section to crack in JEE Main and make it a point that you do ample practice to be able to answer as many questions as possible, asked in this section. This is one reason why NCERT Mathematics is the best for CBSE board exams, but not definitely not sufficient for JEE Mains. Questions in this section need greater thinking and problem solving skills, and you can\u2019t expect to do that in the given timeframe in the exam hall without variegated practice. Moreover, questions from sections like Co-ordinate geometry, Complex numbers, Functions etc. require concepts and techniques that are not discussed in the NCERT book, stressing the need to go beyond NCERT books for good scores in Mathematics. Again, it is compulsory to go through problems in NCERT Mathematics because there have been instances when a problem has directly been asked from there. You wouldn\u2019t want to miss that chance, now would you? NCERT books sufficient for JEE Main Physics? Regarding physics, the answer to our question is a bit tricky. The basics for most problems in JEE Mains are from NCERT textbook for Physics and all you require is to alter the arguements as required in the problem. This ofcourse requires deep understanding of the concepts, which few students find difficult to learn from NCERT textbooks, hence requiring other books. But there have been few questions in the past which can be answered only by reading between the lines of NCERT chapters. While questions from most of the chapters lie within limits of NCERT, there are chapters like Optics, Rotational Dynamics, Oscillations, Waves which require a broader knowledge of the topics. For Modern Physics and Mechanics, the concepts in NCERT books seem just sufficient. It\u2019s noteworthy here that you should definitely check out the \u2018Points to Ponder\u2019 section at the end of each chapter. Because questions from that section were served in past years\u2019 JEE papers. overall: for jee main-for theoritical part about 80% yes for jee advanced -for theoritical part about 30% yes ",

Reasons- Not getting exposed to the tricks and turns of JEE problems.NOT able to appreciate the concepts learned in theoretical manner in a slightly problem oriented way.NOT getting the desired practice to solve the JEE questions in limited time as they have to solved in a stipulated time.Lastly, NOT able to sense the correlation among different concepts that can be assimilated in a question.It is better to go through some of the concepts from NCERT and solve questions from any standard JEE book, past years papers or if you are going to coaching centers, solve their study materials. This should do and REMEMBER the most important thing for JEE preparation is UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPTS through theory, solving questions and asking doubts. ",
