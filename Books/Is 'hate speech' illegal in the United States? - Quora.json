            "answer_text": "Is 'hate speech' illegal in the United States? According to the American Bar Association, \u201cHate speech is speech that offends, threatens, or insults groups, based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, or other traits.\u201d In a word, no. If you read on in the ABA\u2019s page on the hate speech debate, you will see the next paragraph. In this country there is no right to speak fighting words\u2014those words without social value, directed to a specific individual, that would provoke a reasonable member of the group about whom the words are spoken. For example, a person cannot utter a racial or ethnic epithet to another if those words are likely to cause the listener to react violently. However, under the First Amendment, individuals do have a right to speech that the listener disagrees with and to speech that is offensive and hateful. Students: Debating the \"Mighty Constitutional Opposites\": Hate Speech Debate There are no laws that make \u201chate speech\u201d illegal in the US. However, there are laws against hate crimes. A hate crime happens when someone commits an act that is already a crime, and their motive is in part based on hatred of the victim as a member of a particular group. If that is the case, the defendant would serve the sentence for the original crime with an additional penalty because hatred was the motive. This may be where the confusion comes in. One of the ways that prosecutors can convince a jury that a defendant\u2019s motive was hate is if the defendant said hateful things during the attack. As an example, if someone beats me up while saying \u201cGive me those great shoes,\u201d that is assault (and perhaps attempted robbery.) On the other hand, if someone beats me up while saying \u201cYou deserve to be beaten up because you are a lesbian,\u201d they would be guilty of a hate crime. So, hateful speech can be used as part of a prosecution for an added hate crime penalty, but hateful speech in and of itself is not illegal. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really, no. Or not the way that it is (oftentimes/potentially) illegal in many other countries, such as in many western European nations, or I believe even in Canada as well. This is mostly due to Americans\u2019 1st Amendment rights. Which can be essentially even wider than the rights of free speech granted to people in other mostly free \u2014 or at least let\u2019s say generally liberal and democratic \u2014 types of countries. No, there\u2019s no \u201chate speech\u201d exception to the First Amendment In fact for this reason certain hate-based groups, actually emanating out of other countries, will use a US-based web server, for example, to avoid any potential prosecution in their own country. Ironic in a sense, but: European neo-Nazis move to US for free speech \u201cEuropean authorities are facing a new challenge when it comes to online enforcement. European extremist groups are turning to US based web servers to host their content and spread their message outside the jurisdiction of local authorities. America\u2019s constitutional protection of free speech, including hate speech, means there is very little anyone in Europe can do about it. Recent arrests in Austria regarding online content and hate speech have been quickly overturned since hate groups like Alpen-Donau broadcast their web message via servers in Arizona\u2026\u201d From the first link above: \u201cTo be sure, there are some kinds of speech that are unprotected by the First Amendment. But those narrow exceptions have nothing to do with \u201chate speech\u201d in any conventionally used sense of the term. For instance, there is an exception for \u201cfighting words\u201d \u2014 face-to-face personal insults addressed to a specific person, of the sort that are likely to start an immediate fight. But this exception isn\u2019t limited to racial or religious insults, nor does it cover all racially or religiously offensive statements. \u201cIndeed, when the City of St. Paul tried to specifically punish bigoted fighting words, the Supreme Court held that this selective prohibition was unconstitutional (R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992)), even though a broad ban on all fighting words would indeed be permissible. (And, notwithstanding CNN anchor Chris Cuomo\u2019s Tweet that \u201chate speech is excluded from protection,\u201d and his later claims that by \u201chate speech\u201d he means \u201cfighting words,\u201d the fighting words exception is not generally labeled a \u201chate speech\u201d exception, and isn\u2019t coextensive with any established definition of \u201chate speech\u201d that I know of.) The same is true of the other narrow exceptions, such as for true threats of illegal conduct or incitement intended to and likely to produce imminent illegal conduct (i.e., illegal conduct in the next few hours or maybe days, as opposed to some illegal conduct some time in the future). Indeed, threatening to kill someone because he\u2019s black (or white), or intentionally inciting someone to a likely and immediate attack on someone because he\u2019s Muslim (or Christian or Jewish), can be made a crime. But this isn\u2019t because it\u2019s \u201chate speech\u201d; it\u2019s because it\u2019s illegal to make true threats and incite imminent crimes against anyone and for any reason, for instance because they are police officers or capitalists or just someone who is sleeping with the speaker\u2019s ex-girlfriend... \u201c \u2026\u201chate speech\u201d also doesn\u2019t have any fixed legal meaning under U.S. law. U.S. law has just never had occasion to define \u201chate speech\u201d \u2014 any more than it has had occasion to define rudeness, evil ideas, unpatriotic speech, or any other kind of speech that people might condemn but that does not constitute a legally relevant category. \u201cOf course, one can certainly argue that First Amendment law should be changed to allow bans on hate speech (whether bigoted speech, blasphemy, blasphemy to which foreigners may respond with attacks on Americans or blasphemy or flag burning or anything else). Perhaps some statements of the \u201cThis isn\u2019t free speech, it\u2019s hate speech\u201d variety are deliberate attempts to call for such an exception, though my sense is that they are usually (incorrect) claims that the exception already exists. \u201cI think no such exception should be recognized, but of course, like all questions about what the law ought to be, this is a matter that can be debated. Indeed, people have a First Amendment right to call for speech restrictions, just as they have a First Amendment right to call for gun bans or bans on Islam or government-imposed race discrimination or anything else that current constitutional law forbids. Constitutional law is no more set in stone than any other law. \u201cBut those who want to make such arguments should acknowledge that they are calling for a change in First Amendment law, and should explain just what that change would be, so people can thoughtfully evaluate it\u2026\u201d ",
