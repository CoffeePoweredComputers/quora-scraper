            "answer_text": "Making money as a music producer  This is a big question! Here are some ideas I have found can work\u2026 Go to rehearsal studios and get to know the up and coming bands. Offer to record them free to start. Once they come to value you then negotiate terms.Create amazing music that fits a specific target genre/market. Make the music not only fit but also have a neat twist/innovation that is worthy of comment. Then promote that in the target territory. Promote to radio\u2026. Music magazines\u2026 bloggers\u2026 on music download platforms and to online radio in your genre.If you write great songs then research emerging bands who clearly need better songs to gain better exposure. Approach them with your work.Contact management companies and explain that you are a producer creating a new sound and are looking for great vocalists to potentially record and promote. If a relationship develops this way and your product becomes valuable then the money will follow if you negotiate well.One thing I would definitely advise is to make sure your CV is impressive. Put all the names in it of the known people you have brushed shoulders with. Put all the names of the studios you have ever been in. Include all successes. If you struggle to include impressive names then send your work to all the major record companies and in your CV state honestly that you are \u201ccurrently communicating with several major record companies regarding new projects\u201d You can do the same thing with named artists and named managers. When the rejection letters arrive send new ones! That way you are still communicating as stated in your CV. Unfortunately this is a business where everyone wants to be close to the winners. Perception is half the battle. I would say that 90% of successful producers faked it in the beginning to make it! Before long your CV will gain more impressive information as the ball starts to roll and you get into interesting projects. It is a long game and I would advise you to get a job in the meantime! I hope this helps  Basil Simon musical life coach Official web site ",

            "answer_text": "That all depends on the type of Producer you are referring to. There are three types of producers in the music industry, Record Producer aka Music Producer, Vocal Producer and Executive Producer.  Record Producers that are hired by the Artist gets an Advance that comes out of the Artists recording budget funds which is a recoupable advance that goes against record points on the master recording. The Producer\u2019s advance is based on the recording project of the Producer's service's for producing an album or a song. 50% of the Advance is paid to the Producer, prior to the recording sessions and the other remaining half once the entire song is fully produced thats gone through the final Mix stage, turned in to A&R and met A&Rs satisfactory. The Producer would need to recouple its advance just like the Artist before they are paid any back end royalities on the Master Recording which is a percentage of the Artists royality points. The Producer is also entitled to a share of the Artist's SoundExchange Royalties, Streaming and Master Use License fees stated in a standard Producer Agreement. Most Producers negociate around 2% to 3% based on the PPD (Published Price to Dealer). Superstar A-List Record Producers can demand as much as 5% or 6% based on their track record of making hits. Record Producers are in charge of supervision and directing the entire recording project that typically works along side the Engineer behind the mixing board in the control room. The Producer works closely with the Vocalist, Musician's and the Engineer in the studio, collaborating on ideas, that provide technical direction and musical insight. Basically a Producer is like a director in a movie that is responsible for bringing everything togther as the finished product. Some Record Producer's are hands on in the Songwriting and Arranging process, some are Technical on the engineering side while some are completely hands off. The modern Music Producer could wear all the hats these days depending on their skill level and genre. Sean Diddy Combs and Rick Rubin are examples of hands off Record Producer's that are essentially creative directors as they aren't necessary the person that would program beats or arrange the music. They manage and control recording sessions and coach the Artist rather are a (Rapper or Singer) making sure that they are getting the right engery and performance out of an Artist. Jimmy Douglas and Syvila Massy are Technical Producer's that wears both the Record Producer and Engineers hat. Producer / Engineer or Producer / Mix Engineers are very common in Rock, Jazz, Country genres. Max Martin, Teddy Riley, Rodney Jerkins, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams and Dr. Dre are what you call Songwriter Producer's that wears two or more hats as a Record Producer that controls the recording sessions and an accompanied Programmer that works with midi sequencing, programing beats or composes and arranges the music which makes them a Writer as well. They also hire and collaborate with musician's from time to time as well as play Instruments themself\u2019s. So if the Producer, composed, arranged and programmed the music themselfs, such as the backing track, they are entitled to Songwriting credit and share of the publishing as the Co-Writer on the song. If the song was used in Film or TV, the Producer is entitled to a share of the Sync License fee as well as backend peformance royalties each time the song is broadcasted, streamed or air. Vocal Producer's falls under the Record Producer umbrella. They are some times reffered to as Vocal Arrangers, that specializes in arranging the vocals. They oversee the Vocal Production aspect of the song rather than the overal vision of the entire production of a song. They work closely with the Vocalist in the studio coaching them to get the best vocal performance and picking the right takes. Kurk Harrell is one example of a Vocal Producer. If an Artist hired both a Record Producer and a Vocal Producer, both Producer's would split their advances. Some times the Record Producer would hire an additional Vocal Producer instead of the Artist. An Executive Producer is a label employee on payroll that is paid a salary rather than an Advance in a contractual setting. They oversee the recording budget, finances, some times hire other staff or perform many of the same job functions of a Record Producer but they are more business savvy. They are generally not part of song creation process on the creative side but on the business executive level. It's not uncommon for the Artist themselves to act as their own Executive Producer that self funds the recording project. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way I\u2019ve found to make money as a producer is in licensing. Record sales and streaming is pretty difficult route unless you are working with an artist with a decent following. If you are you can make money upfront for producing their track, or you can take a percentage of the sales after it\u2019s released. On the other hand, if you get involved in the music licensing and publishing side of the music business, you have a very solid opportunity to make front end and back end royalties from music licensing deals. The best way to start doing that is to get involved with music libraries. Some of them are non-exclusive, meaning you can have your music available in their library, and submit it elsewhere. Others are exclusive, meaning only they have that track. Finally, their are semi-exclusive deals where non-exclusive libraries have terms such as you can be non-exclusive as long as you are not participating with a curtain portion of their competition. To get involved in these libraries there is generally a submission page on their website. Here is a list of library submission pages for some of the major music libraries. How to Submit Music to Music Libraries: A List of Music Submission Pages You can also check the Music Library Report and see how they are rated by other producers, so you can research which might work out best for you.

            "answer_text": "Theirs many ways. Producers in hip hop and electronic music can make money in lots of ways, especially since they play a lot of different roles too, like the artist, composers and sometimes engineer of their own instrumentals. Theirs always working with other artist and charging them an upfront fee to record to your music. Usually like a recording package that includes the track, studio time and finished mastered song. You can pitch your music to music supervisors for tv/film and video game placements. Theirs a lot of money in that. As a producer, you\u2019ll start to see where you have to do some other jobs that associate with production. Like engineering. It\u2019s good money in that too. But all of these things are a hustle and are worth it. You just have to stay consistent. I\u2019ve found more jobs as a live sound engineer than in music production. And it\u2019s nice to travel too while doing what you love. For producers who work in rock or jazz. I\u2019m not sure of the road for that because I don\u2019t work in those genres. Oh can\u2019t forget. If you make a name for yourself. You can go into selling some sounds online and/or creating your own software plugins. ",

            "answer_text": "If you can make your own music, you should start there to build your portfolio of music you\u2019ve produced on. Then, you can use that as evidence to appeal to other musicians and offer free production on a track to see how they like it. Be careful not to get used, however: only one free track per artist. Most everyone does pro bono work here and there to show that they can get the job done and only ask for experience/feedback/opportunity in return. If they like what you do, you\u2019re in. If they don\u2019t, be respectful and ask for constructive feedback. Maintain good humor and rapport with everyone involved in the business- that\u2019s an incredibly crucial and incredibly easy/passive part of networking and getting your name out there. You could technically be a terrible producer, but if people genuinely like you, they\u2019ll want you to succeed, and the path will pave itself into you being a good and successful one. You can easily talk yourself up, get some fancy business cards and advertise yourself online wearing a snazzy suit. I\u2019ve seen the razzle-dazzlers, and to be honest, because of all the hype, they usually end up failing due to an ego that has to match the hype, but skills that simply can\u2019t. Word of mouth and networking amongst peers is the best and most genuine advertisement you can get. It\u2019s as easy as retaining your soul that makes one truly shine in this business. ",

            "answer_text": "As a musician, songwriter and freelance producer, I am reminded of something a guitar player a long time ago said to me. 'You are paid what you negotiate.' Traditionally, producers are paid some money up front, points (a percentage) on the backend (sales) and in receiving credit for their work.  This was largely done when producers were different from engineers, who for that matter were different people from tape ops.  Consider The Beatles for a moment. Sir George Martin was their producer, it is quite likely he rarely if ever touched the mixing console.  That was Geoff Emerick's job.  For that matter, Mr. Emerick would've chosen the mics, but most likely not put them in front of the amps, drums and musicians.  That would've been yet another crew of engineers job.  Finally, when it finally came time to record, there would be yet another individual operating the tape machine. I say all that to say that times have changed.  In my experience, I rarely get all three of the items that producers generally receive.  This doesn't bother me much, as it's the backend that I normally don't take part in.  For my part, it's easier and cleaner to take a bit more money up front and get credit for my work rather than try to negotiate for a percentage of sales.  I personally also feel like it is a bit of good will towards the artist, who is taking the financial risk in creating the recording. ",

            "answer_text": "I can tell you how *I* make money as a music producer, and I know a few who follow this model, but I definitely don\u2019t speak for everyone. Usually, I deal with singer/songwriters. They often have just piano and guitar (or even just vocals) as the basis for their songs. So it\u2019s up to me to flesh out their sound into what serves them as an artist. Then we perform, record, and mix as needed. For this I charge a fee. Sometimes, I\u2019ll discount some of the fee in return for percentage of publishing. This creates \u201cmail money\u201d for songs that generate revenue. Often, additional \u201cmail money\u201d can come in if I\u2019m also getting on the track as songwriter, depending on how much I\u2019m messing with the song. The mail money doesn\u2019t add up to much unless you\u2019re dealing with well known artists. So most of my money as a producer comes from my upfront fees. Which can be anywhere from $500 per track for demos, and $2000 per track for full production, recording, and mixing. If you\u2019re just starting out, and depending on what facilities and your skill level, you should adjust your rates accordingly. I hope this helps, and keep making music! ",

For EDM producers, they make most of their money from: Sales from music releasedGigs - alot of them are djs and make most of their money this way.Mechandising - T shirts, hats, cups whatever you can think of to put your logo on.Selling loops and productions packs, sample packs and so on.For other industries its more or less selling your services to other artist and labels. They're a few ways to get paid: per song / per project - they pay you a flat rate for your servicespercentage of the album - everytime a song / album is sold you get part of it. It might take you longer to get paid this way.You can offer other services like: mixingmasteringrecording - if you have a studio you can rent your recording space.editing - working with ad agencies on commercials and other audio work.music composition - if you create beats you can sell your beats to artist.Those are some of the ways you can make money producing music.

Not everyone who comes around knows about music but they obviously got the cash. So take the cash and give them the best production you can and they will come back for more thinking they did it. So most of the time, especially now people listen to the beats more often and that moves them to want to know who did that and that's how you grow. It might take a while but you will make your money consistently. Because the thing about music nowadays is that a lot of inexperienced people both artist and producers are going into it, but only the best will survive. Hope it helps. And one more thing, forget about social media for now and just start with your community and you will be surprised how many talents are waiting to pay you for a 1hour production. ",

            "answer_text": "Ghost production. If you wish to make money out of your music producing skills, the quick way is to ghost produce the tracks for people. Now, ghost production is basically producing music for someone without being given the credits, i.e. the person for whom you produced the track gets all the credits. The bonus part is that you get an amount worth much more than the value of the track, since the people who will see that track won't ever get to know that you were the person behind it, hence to compensate, the client pays almost double (or more) in order to get his/her track ghost produced. There are many sites those give opportunity to young artists to make money (in order to invest in their own projects) through ghost production. But hey, think twice before selling anyone your music. Maybe that particular song was supposed to be your break ;) Hope my answer helped you! ",

You can also have a profile page with videos, photos, and demos, of tracks you have worked on in the past. Whereas, with the other two sites you have to just contact or bid on the potential clients yourself and hope they get choose you. Regardless though, they are still very useful sites and I would still recommend you try all of them.
