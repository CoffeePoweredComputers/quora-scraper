            "answer_text": "Hi! First of all - Fabulous decision. Groups can be a wonderful way for becoming aware of new books that suit your tastes. Chatting with people who share common interests is an added advantage obviously. Since you have asked me about how to join a group, I presume you have already made your due diligence about the kind you want to join. If not, make sure you look up different groups and check out how active they are. The home page of the group would list how many active discussions are going on in the group. The homepage will also show the group last activity timing. The more active the group is, the better. HOW TO JOIN A GROUP On your home page, on the top you will see a bar that will list options such as Home, My Books, Browse and Community. Click on the Community option and a list will show. Click on Groups- it is the first option in the drop down menu. A list of groups will appear. Such as the list of featured groups, the groups you have already joined, most popular groups on goodreads etc. On the right, a list of genres will be there. You can choose your preferred genre and go to it and then choose your preferred group. Once you go to the specific group page, a large button will appear right below the profile picture that say JOIN GROUP. You\u2019ve got it from here. ",
