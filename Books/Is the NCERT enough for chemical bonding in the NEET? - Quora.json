            "answer_text": "The previous years' question papers are a valuable source of information for preparation; focus on the frequently asked questions, topics and pattern. NCERT would be enough for chemical bonding for the NEET, it's about personal experience, processing and choices of how you decide to study the subject and from which book. As explained by NCERT the concept of Chemical Bonding as follow: CHAPTER 4: CHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE The Octet rule implies that the atoms tend to adjust their electronic configuration such that they are able to obtain 8 electrons in their outer most orbital. A chemical bond is any bond which keeps or bonds the atoms in a molecule. An ionic bond is a bond which binds together oppositely charged ions. This bond is formed due to the transfer of one or more electron from the atom of a metal to a non-metal. Electrovalency is defined as the number of electrons an atom gains or loses. When it gives up an electron, the atom obtains a positive charge. If the book doesn't satisfy you, you should feel free to choose after discussing with your mentors, peers and other aspirants. All you need to know for chemical bonding is condensed in a few pages in the NCERT books. Reading between the lines and mastering the in-text questions, will sort your academic woes concerning these subjects in the near future. This concise property of NCERT books makes it very handy, even during revision.The Chemistry textbooks are well-praised and the most popular among students too. With the simplicity of its explanations, tough concepts are dealt and no stone is left unturned. These should be your go-to books to clear any sort of concepts. ",

            "answer_text": "NCERT helps you for chemical bonding definitely. With that, you can also refer references as well but according to me NCERT is complete good you don't need to learn any NCERT so go ahead with NCERT. The questions from this chapter are score making. Every year 2\u20133 questions (sometimes even more) come from this chapter and can be solved easily if you have understood it. The tables and graphs in ncert are very important like the one of Shape and geometry, hybridisation, linear combination of atomic orbitals etc.  As you can see in pic Toppr helps you for more learning and more notes for that also you can solve old papers as well for the exam so that you can understand clearly what you will face in exam. Read the chapters with full concentration and then solve previous year questions. If you want to practice more you can refer to Dinesh Objective book. I hope my answer helps you. Thank you \ud83d\udc4d ",
