            "answer_text": "Validate the idea with at least 23 potential customers who will pay money for the product you are going to offer. If you can\u2019t find them now, you won\u2019t find them later and rethink if you want to take the risk. NEVER be afraid that somebody steals your idea or somebody copies you - you will learn later why it is actually important that people will copy you.With the feedback you have, look for a co-founder who buys into your vision and is willing to invest everything he or she has - like you - to make the company work. If you are the engineer, look for a business savvy partner. If you are the business person, look for the engineer.Now, while one of you builds the first MVP to be ready to show it to customers in no later than 6 month, the other is building up the customer base, observes the market and the competition, prepares the go-to-market strategy, works on pricing, business agreements, future employees, and the other gazillion things that needs to be done.Keep in mind: The initial value of an idea is absolutely ZERO. At any given point in time there are around 700 billion ideas that are all not realized because people don\u2019y know how. The real value is in that \u201cHow\u201d not in the idea itself. Execute like a god. That is the only thing that counts and that cannot be copied. :) ",

            "answer_text": "The first question is whether you actually are an inventor of an invention. In patenting, an invention presents a solution to a real world problem by applying technological concepts. An invention is not conceived by merely framing the problem nor by envisioning a desired result. Coming up with the idea of a flying skateboard is not, in itself, conceiving an invention. Conception of an invention occurs when the inventor develops ideas to solve the problem and obtain the result. Coming up with ideas of ways to make and use a flying skateboard is conceiving inventions. Conception is said to be the sine qua non of inventorship. Conception of the idea of the invention, however, is not enough to make you an inventor. In addition to conception, inventorship requires \u201creduction to practice\u201d. Under U.S. law, there are two ways to reduce an invention to practice. One way, actual reduction to practice, is for the inventor actually to make and use the invention: you build the flying skateboard and ride it around your workshop. The other way, constructive reduction to practice, is for the inventor to file a patent application having a sufficient disclosure of the invention with the patent office. The disclosure you file with your skateboard patent application is sufficient if it has a written description of the skateboard showing you actually worked out the important details of the flying skateboard when you filed the application, and you provide enough detail so that a person of ordinary skill in the relevant technology can make and use your skateboard invention without undue experimentation. You are seeking help in reducing your invention to practice. If someone merely contributes to the reduction of an invention to practice, that person is not an inventor unless they also contribute to the conception of the invention. ",
