            "answer_text": "I think in terms of vocals, EXO is pretty high on the list. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re unmatched, but they have excellent vocalists that outshine a lot of other popular groups. For example, the acapella parts in tempo and oh la la la on their new album were delightful and not something I\u2019ve heard in kpop from a popular, mainstream group before. They seem to be unafraid to try new concepts; perhaps that comes from having a loyal, long term fanbase. Number amongst them are idols who also excel at acting. Do Kyungsoo in particular has been praised to the moon and back for being an idol actor with substance. He is good at what he does and he loves it. Lots of times idols break into acting for the extra boost to their fanbase, not because they have any real love or talent for the art form. For me, personally, I find their dance style refreshing. They are all moderately talented dancers. Some of them are amazing, others meerly proficient, but their choreography is always eye catching without going to some of the extremes that other groups go to when looking to make an impression on the industry with their dance. Since their choreographers seems to focus on the artistry rather than the difficulty level, even their least talented dancers execute their choreography with ease, making their stages very enjoyable to watch. This is not to say their choreo is easy by any means, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s not overly complicated. I think a lot of that has to do WITH the fact that they have such powerhouse vocalists. They don\u2019t want to take away from their ability to perform by winding them with unnecessarily strenuous choreography. They are idols who can bounce back. They don\u2019t let upset or tragedy hold them back or make them hesitate. They continue forward. They learn and grow with the times. Fans know they can rely on them. They are stable idols. That means a lot in an industry where turn over is ridiculous. All in all EXO are good eggs. Talented boys. Hard workers. Definitely deserving of all their accolades and praise. ",
