            "answer_text": "Hi Mohammed, Yes you can publish for free on Amazon KDP, Smashwords also with correct format they'll submit as premium catalog, which will automatically be posted on Barnes & Noble and other platforms. Keep in mind though, you will need to recruit a professional editor and formatter. Also a professionally designed cover. There are some places do as low as $5 USD, but I'm not sure of quality of design. Also though your created work is automatically yours, you may consider copyrighting. You can go through Bowker, purchase app, then have to submit fees directly to USCO. Though they also offer ISBNs, barcodes, you can opt to get them free, when submit book on Amazon and Smashwords. Hope this helps a bit with your project. DRMF ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Duncan, it is possible to publish for free using Amazon kdp, smashwords, and I would add draft2digital. The steps for uploading your book is pretty easy to learn. Keep in mind though that one thing is to publish and a whole other is to get people to read you book and pay for it. If you want paying readers, it is important to invest money or time to proofread, edit and format your book. Next you really want a good cover for your book. These things will avoid every writers nightmare: bad reviews and poor sales. Blessings Luis Rodriguez ",
