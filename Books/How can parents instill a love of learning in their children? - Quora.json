            "answer_text": "Two ways. 1. Help them find what they are passionate about. You do this by exposing them to a myriad of cultures, hobbies, things to do. When you see them gravitating towards certain things, immerse them in the lifestyle to see if they become utterly fascinated or simply find it was a fleeting interest. If they are like a fish in water, it's time to give them a project to take on having to do with the subject. 2. Get them understanding the difference between laziness and disinterest. It can be difficult to distinguish at a young age. They are still working to understand their complex emotions happening in their mind and can misinterpret them. Here's the trick: Don't raise lazy kids!If you are doing everything for your child, helping with his homework to doing his dishes, laying out his clothes, doing all his chores, cleaning his room, he's not going to want to put effort in places where effort is due--even if he really enjoys doing it! It's crazy how often I work with children not wanting to go play outside in the woods, or practice skateboarding simply because they didn't want to have to put the effort into getting up and doing it. This is despite their longing for progressing at these things and intense fascination for them. It's simply because they are lazy. Life is spoon fed to them and they never had to work towards ANYTHING. Don't treat your kids like this, it'll make them sad when they're adults.This is worldly different than just not having an interest for something. Not having the spark for it, not getting excited or fascinated at it. Never push a child into something he truly is just not interested in, but DO push him into something that he really loves. They want this, they need it. They don't know what it actually takes to progress at something, that's why there are parents--to inspire and encourage. If you don't show children the right way to do things, their learning curve will make things take years longer than when someone is pushing you in the right direction. Children don't want a servant nor a dictator--Children want a leader. Remember that. The short answer is that children don't need to learn how to love learning.. they just need a good guide that will nudge them in the right directions and show them the ropes.The problem with the school systems, is that some kids are being forced to learn things they have no interest in... and it shows. When they don't like what they are learning, there is no passion. No fire in their hearts.You can get clever and attempt to find loopholes into liking certain subjects by making them more fun and less mechanical, but in the end, people like what they like. If I'm not interested in crochet, you're not gonna find a way around it... I just don't like the subject. Maybe in twenty years my brain will become interested because of my different lifestyle, but you can't force a passion, you can only discover it. ",
