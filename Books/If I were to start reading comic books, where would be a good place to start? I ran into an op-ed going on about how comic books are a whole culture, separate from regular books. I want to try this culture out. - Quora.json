            "answer_text": "My advice, if you\u2019re trying to get into comics-as-literature, is to ignore newsstand editions altogether, and focus on trade paperbacks (TPB). The reason is as follows: a comic book is a living thing, presided over by a bullpen of writers (the brain) and pencilers (the eyes), supported by a staff of inters, letterers, colorists, and editors, cranking out issue after issue, as various members of the team are cycled through overtime. Sometimes a title can start out cheesy and corny, evolve into something with literary merit, and then rot and stagnate. Sometimes this happens over and over. The TPB market collects specific groups of issues that have some kind of market potential, and publishes them in an easy-to-obtain format. Sometimes, but not all the time, that market potential is due to actual literary merit. Now, how to get into comics the way I did has three phases. Phase 1: Acquire general comics-literacy. I know you\u2019ve probably heard about great comic literary achievements (Watchmen, Sandman, V for Vendetta, etc), but hang back! One of the things that made these works great was how they were able to transcend the medium. That doesn\u2019t have the same impact if the reader isn\u2019t familiar with the medium. So it\u2019s wise to spend a little time just reading whatever comics you encounter. See what you can grab at the library, or at used bookstores. Don\u2019t worry that you\u2019re joining in in media res. That is how ALL comic fans start. When you\u2019re 8 years old, and you grab an X-Factor comic off the shelf, it isn\u2019t going to be issue #1. In my case, it was #24. I didn\u2019t know anything about superheroes beyond the Superman movies, the sixties Batman show, and Spiderman and His Amazing Friends and Superfriends cartoons, but I knew that I wanted to read about the guy with blue skin and metal wings. Knowing what came before simply was not an option. There is no point, literarily speaking, in reading an entire comic series (with some seriously important exceptions).  Good works to read during this phase: Marvel Masterworks (collects early editions of classic titles), Batman: The War Years (some Batman comics from WWII era), definitely anything with art by Jack Kirby (helped establish superhero comics\u2019 visual style), really anything you can get your hands on. It\u2019s EASY to absorb this kind of material, and it will make the next stage matter so much more. Phase 2: Transition to maturity This is where you, now a comics-kind-of-person, can focus on the works that blew the doors off the medium. You can skip right to this phase if you must, but you will be dulling the impact quite a bit. Must-reads during this phase: Watchmen: Alan Moore\u2019s magnum opus. This is the reason why you need to read some bog-standard superhero comics before you move into this. Why bother trying to appreciate an author defying conventions you aren\u2019t familiar with?  Any Frank Miller Daredevil TPB: This is one of the most epic runs by any writer on a mainstream superhero series. It established the Daredevil-as-superhero-noir, and firmly placed Marvel into the realm of comics-for-grown-ups.  Kingdom Come: The most beautifully painted (not drawn) graphic novel ever. Also, a terrific post-modern Superman story, with ALL the other characters thrown in for fun!  The Tick: A black-and-white affectionate parody by a 19-year-old kid. Also one of the great cautionary tales of the comics business. Ben Edlund sold his creator\u2019s rights for better distribution, and lost control of his characters. Other comics, TV shows, cartoons, and toylines followed, but the first 12 issues of the Tick are the only ones that matter. Collected in Tick Omnibus 1 and 2.  The Sandman: The comic that put Neil Gaiman on the map. Don\u2019t try to read it all at once, and if something in it seems like it\u2019s a reference to something, look it up. I learned the legend of Orpheus from this comic, and it forever deepened and complicated my appreciation of Shakespeare. I am about to begin the tenth and final volume, and I\u2019m in no hurry.  Okay, now onto Phase Three: Go Apeshit! The world is yours. By this time you will hopefully have gotten a pretty good idea of what you\u2019re into, and you will be able to hunt for hidden gems. Some favorites of mine: Promethea (Alan Moore) The Courtyard (Alan Moore) Pogo, Prisoner of Love (Walt Kelly) Bone (Jeff Smith) Top Ten (Alan Moore) Akira (Katsuhiro Otomo) Providence (Alan Moore) And the list goes on forever. You will never run out of comics! I\u2019m currently working on Alan Moore\u2019s Providence, and after this, I plan on looking into Saga, Tom Strong, Blue is a Warm Color, Strangers In Paradise, the list is endless. ",

            "answer_text": "Comics are a literary, visual arts and/or storytelling medium. There is a cross over culturally amongst consumers and audiences in multiple subcultures. In some international Comics markets there is such broad diversity of content, that there is not much distinctive association with Comics and a specific subculture.  In North America the birthplace of the Comic Book and origin of the terms Graphic Novel & Sequential Art (ala Will Eisner) there is more destination and separation, but this has not always been the case here and is rapidly changing. Thus, your own interest.  Because of past diversity, International market verieity and rapidly expansion of American Comics market, it is absolutely impossible to hand every individual one and the same Comic to start. Your own personal interests & aesthetics will have much to do with determing the Comic that is best for you. As much as the broad respect of a work or it's quality under the light of a critique. When recommending a Comic I tend to find out what other works from other mediums they like, a bit about them, their passions and aesthetic leanings. Even then I am usually surprised by what they actually end up liking. Comics are an intimate medium, with unique properties that are always utilized differently by creators.  It is important for readers to understand how to read Comics. A skill not as common among some Americans.  It is also important to understand that most Comics do not result in significant profit (if any) in most cases. Even the seemingly simplest work may actually be a masterpiece. Most Comics take a tremendous amount of effort to give you such a short amount of experience. The Cartoonist or Writer & Artist teams work usually under tremendous pressure of one sort or another. The reason this is important to understand, is so when you react to it there is a promotional response. Making Comics often comes down to the love and care of the medium. Sometimes it also is an act of bravery. Appreciating this bring value to the art you hold in your hand. It enhances your reading experience. If your journey into Comics feels like it is not your tuning, it is that Comic, not all Comics. ",
