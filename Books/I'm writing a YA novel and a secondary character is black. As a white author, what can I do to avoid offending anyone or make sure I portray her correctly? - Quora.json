            "answer_text": "First of all, there\u2019s no use trying to avoid offending anyone. That\u2019s not something you can control, and not all people who take offense do so with just reason. To me, skin color is just one of many physical traits that can be used to make characters look different from each other. I make no specific differences between my fictional characters that can be explained by skin color alone. Portray them correctly? Your secondary character is a different person, not someone who must fit a particular mold, and definitely not because she\u2019s Black. OTOH, I\u2019m from Chile. Until recently, people of Black African descent (as which most other people outside the European-indigenous American spectrum) were quite rare, and today most of them are recent immigrants from countries such as Haiti, Venezuela, etc. Furthermore, we didn\u2019t have a long-standing history of slavery and segregation of people of Black African descent as it happened in the U.S., Brazil or elsewhere, so those sensitivities just don\u2019t apply here. In one of my stories, I have two minor characters of Black African descent. Francisco is the big guy among his classmates, he\u2019s kinda clumsy but also quite hard-working and much smarter than he looks. He had an unrequited crush on a nerdy girl, but he got better. His father is White and also quite large, while his mother is a slim and pretty Afro-Brazilian lady.Jean-Vivien is fully Black, and his French name hints to an Haitian or French African descent, but is otherwise fairly unremarkable. He has a fairly cute girlfriend, they both love to play Basketball.Rodrigo\u2019s skin tone is almost as dark as Jean-Vivien\u2019s, but he has no known Black African descent; it\u2019s just that his family comes from Northern Chile.I\u2019m sure that you can do better; I\u2019m not happy about Francisco\u2019s design, but I decided to not change it at this point.

Make the fact she\u2019s black completely incidental. The colour of her skin is of no more note or merit than the colour of the main character\u2019s hair. Unless you are writing a book specifically about racism, then the fact she\u2019s black simply doesn\u2019t matter. The second you make anything primarily about her race, you\u2019ve fucked up. For the purposes of your writing, she\u2019s not a black person. She\u2019s a person who happens to be black. And please tell me that this \u2018secondary character\u2019 isn\u2019t the only black character in the book. ",
