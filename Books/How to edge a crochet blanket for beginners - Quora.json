            "answer_text": "I think it really depends on how you crocheted your blanket and how skilled you are in crochet. A good edging that isn\u2019t too difficult (if you know how to double crochet) is a scalloped edge. It\u2019s basically just a lot of double crochet stitches in one stitch, and then skipping a few stitches (look a up a tutorial if you want to do this, this is not a very accurate description.) Or, you can just do a normal double crochet edge, putting in a few more stitches in the corners. It\u2019ll make a cleaner edge and will also round out the corners. ",

This question needs re-phrasing to be clear. Are you asking about the quality of the finished edge, or about the method and assuming you edge it differently? ",
