            "answer_text": "How do I start investing money?  The live markets are an intimidating and brutal place for someone who starts off with the wrong information and they can be a mysterious, murky, and complicated place for the ill advised. By following the advice in this post and keep it simple and take it very slow and absorbing every detail you can have the best chance for a high probability outcome as a successful market participant. Should you decide not to listen to what it says, you will have a verrrry looong and expensive journey I assure you of that! Don\u2019t be that trader! Make no mistake, the market can make you lose your mind, burn your soul, and help you to lose all your money. Quickly!! There is a certain progression of things that all brand new investors and traders need to know and study. Unfortunately, no one tells them in the beginning that most of the information they need is basic and is mostly common sense, buy low sell high. They don\u2019t usually find out until it is too late for their account and they have blown out or ran it down so far they cannot trade live anymore until they deposit more risk capital. Should you decide to try to take any short cuts or side step any of the learning process, you can be assured of losing some or all of your money in the live market. The learning curve in this business is different for everyone, some people catch on to it right away while it takes others quite some time to \u201cget it\u201d. I encourage you to take as much time as you need to learn everything you need to know for the style of trading or investing you wish to do and build your rule based trading plan around that style. There is a lot to know to be successful in this business and the more you can know in advance the higher the probability of you having a positive financial outcome from working in the live market, anything else is not acceptable, trust me the market is always going to be there waiting to pay you. The average time frame that it takes someone to go from starting with absolute zero knowledge and learning the trading business from scratch to consistently profitable on a daily basis is said to be in the neighborhood of 3-5 years, I know that\u2019s not what you want to hear but it is the harsh reality. The reason the learning curve is so long for some brand new traders is because they try to learn everything all at one time. You first need to become familiar with: chart reading/ price actionhow the trading platform you are using worksmoney managementyour own trading psychemarket dynamicssupply and demand tradinghow to develop an edge to beat your competitionThis list can go on and on for a long time depending on how much you want to learn. The end result of not doing the proper preparation in this business though is that you lose all your money. The progression of learning is money management first, why do I put it first in the list you may be asking because if you lose all your money in the market from lack of managing it you can't be in the market. Then would come chart reading and how to build out a price chart properly, learning how to use supply and demand as your trading method, your trading psychology and composing a rule based trading plan. Which books to read? If you\u2019re a raw beginner have a look at these books How to Trade Currency starting with $500 Capital, How to Trade Stocks Online on a $500 account, How to Start Day Trading with $500 hopefully they can give an idea of how to start off on a beginners budget and earn while you learn. If you do your education and training properly the right way from the first day you have a very good chance of becoming successful and rich from it. The learning can be long however it is well worth the time and effort when you consider that you will have a lifelong skill with which you can make an unlimited amount of money and you can do it from anywhere in the world, to me that's a win win, don't you agree?
