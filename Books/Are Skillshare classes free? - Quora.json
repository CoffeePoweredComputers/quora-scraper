            "answer_text": "There are actually a lot of free classes available on Skillshare. However, many are premium, which means you must be a premium member to access them. Currently, it is $12/mo (or you can save 33% by paying annually - $96/yr, which works out to $8/mo). Having said that, a lot of teachers offer a certain amount of free enrollment links to their premium courses. Some do 25, some do 100, others do time-limited offers; it just depends on what their goals are. There are numerous Facebook groups where Skillshare teachers offer those links, and they can be found by doing a search for Skillshare and going through the groups. If you would like to check out ALL of the courses (which is going on 10,000 now!), you can sign up for 3 months of premium for 99 cents. ",
