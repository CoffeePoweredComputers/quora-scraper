            "answer_text": "Hi,  eSports Betting is not a source of income and It is very rare to make a profit on it. To be able to do it you need to find valuable odds where you have the upper hand, basically look for miss calculations. It is very rare that a bookmarker dose those miss calculation but it happens. Sometimes the odds compilers overlook things when deciding the odds which you could use to your advantage. To answer the question, is eSports betting profitable you need to take several different things into consideration.Do you know the game you\u2019re betting on and the eSport scene inside and out?Are you good analyzing and predict the outcome?Can you spot and identify player/team/map/patch strengths and weaknesses which the odds compilers may have overlooked?Can you spend countless of hours to watch pro matches and study the games? If you answered yes on those you may have a slim chance to make a profit, even though the time and energy you need to invest is never worth it. Another important thing to take into account is to find a good, trustworthy betting site to bet on. I would recommend any new player to EGB which is in my opinion the best eSports betting bookie out there. You have a very good and in-depth EGB eSports review here if you want to know more. Good luck and have fun! =) ",
