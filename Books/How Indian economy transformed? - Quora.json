            "answer_text": "Till late '80s India was a closed state economy, with capital controls and peg on currency to basket of other currencies. This was our stand of almost from the time of Independence following the Fabian socialist route. This culminated in our having to face destructive balance of payment problem and the solution then then Finance Ministers like Yaswant Sinha and Manmohan Sing figured out was to take the economy to open state and float currency, with a free market direction for future. This led to the solving of  our problem, infact we became a global player with larger trade and markets expanded and is still expanding. The deepening of our markets is going on with derivative markets introduced which is giving more choices and risk control opportunities for private savers. On top of this our infrastructure is improving with modern marketing and retailing coming into play, with improved international players in the consumer products and service industries.  Wage levels have gone up, living standards improved. Youngsters are moving into a situation of having their own home early stages of their career unlike olden days of closed economy status. Even our percapita gdp has doubled to 2000 dollars from around 1000. ",
