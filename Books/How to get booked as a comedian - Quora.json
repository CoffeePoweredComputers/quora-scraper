            "answer_text": "If you don't know who to send them to, then I'm assuming you don't have much of a network to book yourself independently as a comedian. Perhaps you are new to comedy and/or new to a city? It's not that often that bookers use videos these days as merits for booking talent. Usually word of mouth through other comedians is the most productive way when you have no agent. Also, many comedians produce their own shows. So, what you need to do is start performing at the open mics in your city and get to know everyone at the mics. Some of them will be producers.  Now, I'm going to be blunt but this is not personal to you. The fact is most comedians are terrible when they first start. And if they aren't terrible, then they're at least horrid. Even if you got some laughs. Since you don't know where to send your video then I'm assuming you are new to comedy. The last thing you need to do is showcase yourself at this development stage to people that matter. Focus on getting really good first. Get booked through word of mouth and through people requesting you. This is how you know you're good.  Now, to answer your question. Find out who the bookers are at your local comedy clubs or venues that have comedians. Find out what shows you can get on. Find out the contact info of these booker(s) and send them a video. Don't be surprised if they ask you to support the show by brining people to the show. Don't be surprised if they don't even respond at all. Another thing I highly recommend is to start producing your own show. Through this you can trade stage time with other comedians with their own show. Also, you are promoting a brand that will gain followers, which is the most important to the comedy clubs that you are seeking to be in.If your videos are solid start sending them to comedy festivals that you can attend. You can get these contacts either through fellow comedians that have submitted or a simple google search.  Now back to my emphasis.... Do not make your first impression to bookers in your rookie stage. It will be hard to erase their memory of you being unimpressive. Focus on getting good at open mics and gain a reputation first. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Quora Family, First things first, take a look in the mirror and come to terms with where you are at. Don\u2019t book yourself for something you are not ready for. Not only will it go poorly for you on stage, but off stage, the club will likely not give you another shot for months. Getting booked as a comedian for shows is quite a difficult task for a new comedian because there are already many veteran comedians who are popular among the audience and ruling the comedy scene in their countries but they were also new when they started. So Don't give up too early As many comedians will tell you, getting into some of the best clubs can take years of sending emails, doing guest spots, and having comedians vouch for you. Some bookers receive 20+ emails a day and it would be impossible to take a look at everyone and respond. Just because a booker doesn\u2019t get back to you right away, doesn\u2019t mean you give up on that club. Eventually, you will get a response, maybe. Just remember what every established comedian will tell you: Comedy is a marathon, not a sprint. This is one of the few professions where age doesn\u2019t matter as much as performance, so take your time and develop your craft. Follow below listed two points to get booked as a comedian. Go to the Open Mics:  Aside from being an essential tool for building up your set and working for different crowds, open mics are great for networking and getting gigs. Some open mics turn into paid showcases as well. Making friends in this business will essentially create more business. Do as many shows as you can do at open mics, this makes you more confident and popular among the smaller audience, search for different open mics in your city and try to do at least one show at every open mic in your city as It will help you gain more fans & audience. Register yourself on Online Artist Booking Platforms: If you\u2019re a professional Comedian looking for opportunities, then I highly recommend online artist collaboration platforms rather than dealing with troublesome vendors on the phone. These collaboration platforms act as aggregators of artists and event managers/clients. To make things easier, there are numerous artist collaboration platforms online, some of them are totally free such as StarClinch.com, You could register yourself for free as a comedian and clients who are looking to book standup comedian will find you on their own. Whenever your profile would be compatible with the client's requirements, you will get a confirmation call from StarClinch.  'StarClinch is an Online booking platform for hiring professional artists and entertainers including Stand-up Comedians, Celebrities, Singers, Live Bands, Musicians, Anchors, and Speakers.
