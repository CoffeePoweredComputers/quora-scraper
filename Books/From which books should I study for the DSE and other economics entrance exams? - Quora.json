If you live in Delhi you can do the same by going to SRCC photocopy shop or DSE photocopy shop both of which are in north campus. If you don't put up in Delhi, I'm sorry in that case as I've no escape for your refuge. :(And for UPSC optional you need to study both graduation and post graduation leveled economics. Graduation syllabus for preparation should be preferably as mentioned on DSE site and for post graduation study material, JNU will be better. Of all that I know, optional of economics comes in two sects: 1. Indian Economy and 2. World Economy. And JNU has M.A. in world economics as one of their prestigious course which is handy for UPSC preparation too. Indian economy is sufficient of graduation level only if you can relate those foreign authors' books mentioned on DSE site in the Indian context as well. ",

Amit Goyal's answer to I am an Indian from a non-Economics background, but have developed a very strong affinity for the subject. I wish to pursue it as a master's program. I have heard about the better schools for it, like DSE, JNU and others. I would prefer not to take coaching for the entrance exams. How do I prepare?   ",
