            "answer_text": "If you read a book a month, you will be reading 12 books in a year. It\u2019s quite easy to finish reading a book in a month. One month is equal to 30 days or 4.5 weeks, which is plenty of time to read a book. You can read a book in 1\u20133 weeks if you want to. If you read interesting material, you will be a lot more likely to finish reading the book quickly. It is also important to read outside of your favorite genre to broaden your horizons once in a while. Create a reading schedule. Dedicate to reading a certain amount of chapters or pages per day. Set realistic goals that you can achieve. ",

Count the number of pages, divide it by the number of days available ( deduct at least three days from them, just for cases when you don\u2019t feel like reading at all) and just start reading with consistency. Consistency is the key. Besides, the book should be interesting and should match your interests, for e.g whether you like non-fiction, if yes then what genre in non-fiction and so on. ",
