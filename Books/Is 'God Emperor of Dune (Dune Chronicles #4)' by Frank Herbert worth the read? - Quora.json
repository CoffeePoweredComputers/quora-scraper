            "answer_text": "Whats this crazy talk..\u2019worth the read\u2019\u2026Is Return of the Jedi worth the watch, after the much more superiorly directed, and far less Ewok infested, Empire Strikes Back? Would you pass on the epic tale of the the normal, run-of-the-mill, nothing especially interesting twins Sandy and Dennys, couldnt think them siblings of the extraordinary Murry family until they are wisked away to a Dune like planet in \u2019Many Waters\u2019 just because the story doesn't have the delicious plot device \u2018A Swiftly Tilting \u2018 planet does, with its \u2018Might Have Been\u2019 McGuffin at the heart of the adventure? \u2018The Drawing of the Three\u201d possibly the best in the \u2018Dark Tower\u2019 series\u2026I am kinda beating this comparative loss retort into the ground a bit. Point obviously is, although superior stories have been told and seen from within that universe, there is still more fascination to be discovered. Of all the novels in the Dune Chronicles; Dune or Children of Dune Being arguably the best, God, Emperor of Dune is the one I puzzle on more and more often just because it is so off the written path of the other novels\u2026it is a hard read at first, from my perspective, because the protagonist is a creature most would have as an antagonist. Maybe that was Herberts premise all the while\u2026turning the hero trope around and having the reader see the story from the mind of the antagonist\u2026Hmmm\u2026been 20 years since I read that novel AND I STILL FIND REVELATIONS LIKE THIS ONE\u2026I digress. Reading a book is like dancing, some stories I glide right into, flow off each other in a beautiful rythm, sometimes a story is like a bumbling staring at their feet, clumsy and awkward off beat, going back a few pages because I missed something, adventure in patience, like Tolkiens Silmarilian, yet, when the song is over, the adventure\u2026are you happy with the time spent engaged with that world or dance partner for the duration of the song? Although God, \u2018Emperor of Dune\u201d was as anti-climatic as dancing with a very attractive 3rd cousin at a family wedding, it was still enjoyable and thought provoking epic time during. Duncan Idaho really gets his place in the limelight during this story, it is a shame such a unique character was killed off so early in Dune. Its worth the read just to see the Dune world 10,000 years after the events of Children of Dune, Duke Leto the second transformed after melding with the sand trout, becoming the monster to save humanity embarking on his Golden Path\u2026 It has been 20 years since I have read that novel and I was able to recall everything about it without need to refresh the old memory banks, that says quite a bit about that unique, sometimes awkward tale. Take the time, read this book. ",
