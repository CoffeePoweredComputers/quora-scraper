            "answer_text": "Broad question. Its different in so many aspects especially considering the timelines. The earliest know Greek civilization artifacts date back to 900\u20131100BC, while Harappan/Indus ruins have objects dating back to 5000 BC, and considering they were worshiping human gods as opposed to Sun gods back then, that tells us of even older origins. Another major difference that came over time was the scientific approach - the Greeks were experimental, practical and outward looking researchers . Hindus practiced inward-looking, calculative , meditative sciences. A striking similarity though is that both these civilizations employed religion as a power and governance model. Many others also did, but its the Greek and Hindu gods that have really influenced lifestyle and politics of their entire community, for over 2000 years now. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, there has NEVER been a European civilization. The very first clamoring for such a recognition came from colonial powers, and Germany to highlight white supremacy. Germany stole the symbol of Swastika from India, and colonial powers contrived a story of inheritance of thought, philosophy, and history from the Greeks. Whatever existed in Greece was out of middle eastern and Indian origin. Nothing new, and certainly had nothing to do with the rest of Europe. There is ZERO evidence of anything coming out of Europe in terms of thought and contribution until after 1200 AD. Any repeated references to \u201cEuropean civilization\u201d is all wishful thinking. There was no such civilization. ",
