Read either Indian express or the Hindu religiously, make short notes of it for different GS papers Read Yojana magazine, every month. Memorize the syllabus and segragate accordingly ( better get a print out of syllabus and stick it up front on wall) Answer writing should start once u finish a chapter. Try to improve your writing skill. Write anything and everything ( about a movie you watched, about a life experience, about a match u watched) this will definitely improve ur writing skill. ",
