            "answer_text": "It's a Post-HBP HHR fanfic, so really it depends on whether you like HMS Harmony or not. Also, it depends on how much you like Ginny Weasley as this is not a fic that is kind to her. There are a few late plot developments which are not really explained (can't go into them without spoilers) but overall I think that it is reasonably well written. ",
