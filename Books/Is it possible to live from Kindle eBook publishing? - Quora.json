I'm not a millionaire, but I pay my bills, support my son who is in university, and put money in savings every month. About 70% of my income comes from Amazon (Kindle sales) and the rest from other channels, like Nook, iBooks, and Kobo. ",

            "answer_text": "I think so, but it would be tough with just one book. If you wrote a series, or did one of those compilation \u201ctrue crime\u201d series, like \u201cFamous Killers Volume 4), you might be able to create a good revenue stream. The trick to success in digital publishing is marketing. You have to sell the hell out of your books, every chance you get, every medium you can find, and never let up on it. So, short answer? Success on Kindle = Marketing PS: I have two books on Kindle, which don\u2019t make me a living but it\u2019s a nice little check every month. ",
