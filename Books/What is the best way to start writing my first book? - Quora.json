            "answer_text": "Here are a few things I think you should consider. 1.) What genre do you wish to write in? There are lots of authors who enjoy specific types of books and want to write those specific types of books, and then there are other authors who enjoy reading strictly fantasy, but think writing mysteries would be a cool challenge. No matter what you decide to write you need to realize that crafting a novel will be a different process within each genre simply because each genre incorporates different techniques. Fantasy is heavy on world building. Mystery books have an onion layer plot line. Science fiction has a host of terms and technical equipment that most readers of the genre will be well-versed in and if you\u2019re not\u2026it will be noticeable. There are also sub-genres within genres that must contain specific elements for them to be considered plausible. For example in your mystery genre you have cozy mysteries, hard boiled detective mysteries, noir mysteries, paranormal mysteries, etc. So I recommend starting out by reading a ton of books in the genre and subgenre you want to write in. 2.) Write to market. What is selling the most on Amazon right now? It would behoove you to find out what genres and sub-genres are super popular at the moment. Cozy mysteries are huge. Psychological thrillers and crime thrillers are also selling great. Erotica is always a huge seller. Urban Fantasy in the YA section is making some headway. So find the stories that are popular, become familiar with the themes and tropes that resonate with readers, and see how you can creatively build a story with these popular themes and tropes. You\u2019re more likely to write something people really want to read. 3.) Go the distance Don\u2019t just say you want to write a book. Set aside a specific time of day to write and make a goal that you\u2019re going to write 500 words or 1,000 words a day until the book is finished. Rumor has it that Stephen King writes 2,000 words a day. I like to set that goal myself if I can swing it with four kids at home. YA books are 90,000 words in length. If you wrote 1,000 words a day you could have a rough draft written in 90 days. 2,000 words a day would take 45 days. Woot woot. The rewrite will take longer depending on how much outlining and character development you\u2019ve prepared before actually writing the book, but rewrites shouldn\u2019t take too long. 4.) Don\u2019t edit anything until you\u2019ve finished the first draft. Get that book written no matter how awful you think it is. You can go back and fix it later once you\u2019ve laid down the ground work. Just write the crap out of that thing and finish it first. It\u2019s a huge milestone that many aspiring authors never achieve simply because they can\u2019t stop editing and rewriting before they\u2019ve even finished the damn book. Then they get discouraged, give up, go back to their nine to five job, and say it wasn\u2019t meant to be. You can do it. I promise it is so meant to be. ",

            "answer_text": "All first drafts are terrible. This is just a fact of writing, regardless of whether you\u2019re Stephen King or a first-time author, but it\u2019s especially true for first-timers. It\u2019ll feel like your writing is crap, and that\u2019ll probably be true at first, but that\u2019s okay! The only thing a first draft needs to do is exist. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. That\u2019s not the point. The point of the first draft is to have a beginning\u2014something you can shape into something better. Don\u2019t get discouraged and give up because it seems like your writing isn\u2019t very good. If you give up you\u2019ll never write anything good.Pay attention to point of view. What point of view have you chosen for your book? First person? First person with rotating narrators? Third person omniscient? Third person limited? Whatever you chose, learn the conventions of the form, and then pay attention to applying them right. Fixing POV errors is not easy, because a lot of the time they tend to be subtle\u2014particularly in novels with rotating perspectives. Make sure your characters don\u2019t know things that are exclusive to other characters. Otherwise, you\u2019ll leave readers wondering how Character A suddenly knows Character B\u2019s secret about where he was the night of the murder\u2026 unless B let it slip, of course.Not every rule needs to be followed. You\u2019ve probably read a fair bit of writing advice, or, if you haven\u2019t, you\u2019ve at least heard the stock rules: \u201csaid is dead,\u201d \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell,\u201d and \u201cstay away from adverbs.\u201d Now, the thing about writing is that for the most part there are no hard-and-fast rules, other than basic grammar and spelling conventions. Said is just fine, and there\u2019s no real need for fancy dialogue tags, but if you feel a neat dialogue tag like \u201cgrowled\u201d or \u201cmoaned\u201d is right for the situation, go right ahead! Descriptive writing is great, but sometimes you need to convey information quickly, and the details won\u2019t be relevant. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell when it comes to things that don\u2019t need to be showed. Adverbs are meant to be used. For the most part, you can replace a verb-adverb combo with a stronger verb (\u201cran quickly\u201d to \u201csprinted,\u201d for example), but if an adverb really does modify a verb, it\u2019s there to stay (\u201csmiled sadly\u201d or \u201cstabbed gently\u201d). When you see writing advice, don\u2019t take it as a hard-and-fast must-have. Take it as more of a suggestion\u2026 including with this answer.Get yourself invested in your writing. The most important thing about writing is that you enjoy it. Fall in love with your characters, and your plot, and have a ball of a time writing, whether you\u2019re on your first draft or your fiftieth. If you really love what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll keep doing it, no matter what obligations get in your way.",
