            "answer_text": "For beginners; Start first with 16th chapter from Bhagavadgita. It is easy to pronounce the Sanscrit words and learn this chapter. You can learn by-heart within one week. After ten days start the 12th chapter without leaving 16th chapter. 16th chapter contains 24 shlokas only, explaining the qualities of good (godly) and bad (demonly). 12th chapter is having 20 slokas only and teaches us the Bhakti yoga. You can practice them thoroughly without seeing them. Then start to read 10th and 11th chapters. Try to understand them. You can get knowledge through Vibhuthiyoga (10th chapter). Though the Viswarupa Darsanam chapter is difficult, it is main key to Geetha. 10, 11, 12, chapters can be read daily in temples by seeing or without seeing. Now, after finishing these five chapters, learn well the 15th chapter. It is also easy to by heart, as it is containing only 20 shlokas. It is Purushoththama prapthi Yoga. First two slokas can be recited near Aswathha Vruksham, while doing Pradakshina. After finishing these 6 chapters, you can proceed as you wish. One can read the 18 chapters (having 720 slokas) in two hours by seeing the book if one knows well how to read. Aham Vaiswanaro bhutwa praninam dehamaashritha, Pranaapana samayuktham pachaamyannam chathurvidham || The above mentioned shloka is recited before meals to make our food sacred.vThere is the practice of reading Vishnu Sahasranamam in many South Indian temples almost daily. I don't know well, about North India. All the best. Jai Hind.    ",

Devotion is process loosing self and without it you cannot Experience the knowledge contained in those words. Faith because Every Single Letter even spaces between them is Divine. It is as true today as it was the day it was spoken and will remain true as long as this creation remains. Geeta Ji has this WHOLE(Everything) broken down to Basics and hence they apply to ALL and at all times. Open Mind because you MUST accept the Truth that will be revealed to you and Live it. NOT JUST KNOW IT, LIVE IT. And I cannot express my joy and also envy that you at the age of 15 want to read it. Welcome to the world of wonder, joy, meaning, Truth\u2026 ",
