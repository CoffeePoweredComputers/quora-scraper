            "answer_text": "He lost from the start by challenging the only both Omniscient and Omnipotent Super human God the great Jehovah. Immediately he lost his God given name he lost his gifts of perfection and eternal life as well as his position of being a cherub over the garden of eden he lost God\u2019s trust in him. He did gain somethings though he gained the title the very personification of Mendaciousness and became known as a manslayer John 8:44 Also he made himself into a Satan which means a Resister and a Devil which means a Slander God did not create him that way by him doing the things he did he created himself into a Satan the Devil. And no God did not create the devil why would he create someone who he knew would resist and slander him and then punish and kill him for it? And he\u2019s failed at his challenge to God that mankind would be better off being ruled by him rather than Jehovah God . And he stupidly challenged God\u2019s right to rule in front of his non omniscient angelic sons Job 38:7 who themselves are not Omniscient and did not know if satan could prove his challenge or not so that\u2019s how Satan became the temporary god of this one little planet see 2 Corinthians 4:4 to prove Gods point that he can\u2019t rule succesfully and this is proven up till this day see Romans 8:22 His time is now short see Revelation 12:12 On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea,because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time. Armageddon is on it\u2019s way in the near future Satan is mortified definition cause (someone) to feel embarrassed, ashamed, or humiliated. difference between embarrassing and mortifying. is that embarrassing is causing embarrassment; makes you feel shy or ashamed; leading to a feeling of ouncomfortable self-consciousness while mortifying is causing mortification; extremely embarrassing. So with just this bit of information it can be said he is losing and bascially has lost only now reaping what he sowed and awaiting the thousand year lock up he and his renegade demon are to recieve Revelation 20:2,3 And the final punative death sentence he and his demon cronies richly deserve. Revelation 20:10,14 ",

            "answer_text": "Despite people who have little or no real knowledge of the bible taking the devil\u2019s side, we have to remember that spiritual things make no sense to they who are carnal. If one is carnally minded, they do not understand the things of spirit. They are usually too arrogant to admit that and believe that, with their imaginary superior intellect, they are capable of understanding spiritual things. Having said that, it is clear that God gave free will to humans as well as angelic beings (good and evil). In doing so, we have a great responsibility to use that free will properly, and will in fact suffer the consequences of misusing it. The world is loaded with examples of how misuse of free will has ruined, destroyed, corrupted, distorted, contaminated, and twisted many things of this world. This is besides what we blame on \u201cthe devil\u201d. Humans, alone, can screw things up just fine without the \u201cdevil\u201d. Humans can be their own \u201cdevil\u201d. When humans decide to use compassion, love, forgiveness, justice, mercy, and God and spiritual things as a choice over selfishness, destruction, bitterness and anger, hatred, revenge, and violence, God wins. When humans CHOOSE with their OWN free will, all by themselves, with no \u201cdevil\u201d to blame, selfishness, destruction, bitterness, and anger, hatred, revenge, and violence, the \u201cdevil\u201d wins. We got to stop thinking in terms of who else to blame for the victory of \u201cGod\u201d versus \u201cthe devil\u201d and look at ourselves. That is what one person called the Great Controversy between Christ and Satan. Humans make their own beds and lie in them then complain about their fate and state. No wonder pseudo-intellectualism reigns in so many circles: they always invent a god or devil to blame and avoid their own responsibility. I\u2019ll just give one example and shut up. I knew a person years ago that was in a few combat zones. In discussing God and the devil, he immediately became hostile, telling me of all the dead bodies and human suffering and destruction war created. \u201cThere\u2019s your God\u201d he stated bitterly. No, that\u2019s not \u201cGod\u201d. That\u2019s not \u201cthe devil\u201d. That\u2019s HUMAN CHOICE TO MAKE WAR. Well, God didn\u2019t come down and stop it. Why exactly would God want to come down and take our free will away? So people can COMPLAIN they don\u2019t have free will and how \u201cmean\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d God is? I knew a few others who also were in combat zones and other places with great trouble and horrors, and praised God that, through all that, He preserved them miraculously and helped them survive IN those things. They didn\u2019t blame God, and were much more emotionally healthy as a result. They knew humans are crazy assholes sometimes and there is little we can do but our own job. He lets us play things out and rarely intervenes, that is true. He does at times, but who knows the criteria for his interventions. I\u2019ve read and heard many testimonies of people who have experienced \u201cmiracles\u201d and things that were far out of the ordinary and \u201ccoincidence\u201d, and many other stories of how despite prayer God didn\u2019t come through. Including in MY life. So how did it happen in some and not other situations? No one knows. I haven\u2019t heard a really good explanation other than the trite \u201cGod\u2019s mysterious ways\u201d thing. That isn\u2019t satisfactory to Christians anymore than atheists. Long answer for such a question. The devil is whatever is in humans that makes them crazy assholes. We choose. My advice is don\u2019t waste time with dizzying philosophy; you\u2019ll drive yourself nuts. That is what it comes down to. ",
