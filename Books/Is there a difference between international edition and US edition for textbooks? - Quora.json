            "answer_text": "Hahaha well maybe there is some content differences, but as a book reseller I can tell you that 95% of the time there is virtually no difference. The only real difference is the resell value, most textbook buybacks won\u2019t accept international editions. This make the prices significantly lower for the international edition because it can only be sold on marketplaces like Amazon or Ebay. I believe the reason for international editions is for publishing companies to sell them overseas without copyright issues. ",

            "answer_text": "From my experience (this was 7+ years ago), the \"international edition\" is generally the same book in a less expensive, more lightweight format, which makes it easier to ship and distribute overseas. The upside to buying them in the US (usually through a website like Half.com or another online marketplace) is that they're generally less expensive. The downside is that most resellers (like your college bookstore) won't buy them back at the end of the semester because they don't have a domestic bar code. ",
