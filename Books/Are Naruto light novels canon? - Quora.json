            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Archit Bhattacharya . Yes, the Naruto Novels are canon. These Novels have been co-written, supervised and approved by Kishimoto himself. Heck Kishi himself has taken the liberty to illustrate the cover pages of each of these novels.  Some haters often try to diss the Novels and moot them as non-canon material. They believe that novels contradict anime canon which in fact is absolutely false. ! It\u2019s the anime that contradicts the novels and not the other way around. They novels serve as source material for the anime . It is Studio Pierrot who fucks up the storyline of the novels and messes up the timeline and the order in which they have to be adapted into. For instance , let me give you some examples. I\u2019ll now compare the storyline of the novels and it\u2019s respective anime adaptaions. 1> Itachi Shinden Novels ( Vol 1 and 2)  Here\u2019s what happened in the anime adaption of it. Revolved around Itachi\u2019s life in the Ninja Academy.Showed his growth from a genin to an anbu elite.Animated the Itachi and Shisui vs rogue anbu fight.Shisui\u2019s death.Itachi murders his clan and joins the Akatsuki.Now here\u2019s what the anime failed to adapt from the Novel. Itachi and kid Naruto were actually on good terms with each other.Itachi and Shisui went on a hell lot of missions together.Itachi and Shisui fought a bootleg Hyuga and had a crushing defeat in his hands.Fugaku never had a Mangekyo Sharingan.Itachi was the one who killed his waifu (Izumi Uchiha) and not Obito. Itachi put her under a genjutsu where she spent an entire life growing up and marrying Itachi and eventually dying with him. Itachi gave her a painless death after doing so.Here\u2019s when the Itachi novels were published .  and here\u2019s when it was adapted into the anime.  So you tell me which source material is more reliable.  2> Shikamaru Hiden Novel Now Studio Pierrot fucked up big time. This Novel\u2019s timeline fits in before \u201cThe Last\u201d but they animated and adapted it after the movie\u2019s timeline.  The anime did adapt 99% of what happened in the novel but the order in which it was adapted fucked it up. Also here\u2019s when the novel was released:  and here\u2019s when it was animated :  So you tell me which source material is more reliable.  3>Sasuke Shinden : Book of Sunrise Novel  Again, wrong timeline. This novel actually takes place 5 months after Naruto and Hinata get married, however SP animated it before their marriage. The anime adapted 90% of what happened in the novel but never contradicted what happened in it, some I\u2019m cool with it. Here\u2019 the novel\u2019s release date :  and here\u2019s when it was adapted into the anime :  So you tell me which source material is more reliable.  4> Konoha Hiden: The Perfect Day for a Wedding Novel  This was a slice of life novel but it\u2019s canon nonetheless. The anime adapted almost everything that takes place in the novel. Here\u2019s when the novel was released :  And here\u2019s when it was adapted into the anime :  So you tell me which source material is more reliable.  5> Naruto Shinden : Parent and Child Day Novel  Now there are a lot of differences between the anime and the novel. Here\u2019s what the anime showed us : Naruto, Sasuke and Choji\u2019s POV.Boruto roams around the village aimlessly.And here\u2019s what happened in the novel: Boruto never left his home and slept through the entire day.It focuses mostly on Hinata who was on a mission with Hiashi, Hanabi and a bunch of other Hyugas and this clearly shows that Hinata continues to be an active ninja.Hinata fights Hanabi and she stomps easily.Sasuke looked so much like Madara that Sakura had to give him a haircut.Also here\u2019s when the novel was released :  and here\u2019s when it was adapted into the anime:  So you tell me which source material is more reliable  6> Konoha Shinden : Steam Ninja Scrolls  The anime adapted pretty much everything that happened in the novel. Here\u2019s when the novel was released :  And here\u2019s when it was adapted into the anime :  So you tell me which source material is more reliable.  The follwing are the novels which although have been canonized, were never adapted into the anime: Kakashi Hiden : Lightning in the Ice Sky Sakura Hiden : Thoughts of Love riding Upon a Spring Breeze Gaara Hiden : A Sandstorm Mirage Akatsuki Hiden : Evil Flowers in Full Bloom  Here are the novels which are yet to recieve an anime adaptation: Sasuke Shinden : The Teacher\u2019s Star Pupil Shikamaru Shinden : A Cloud Dancing in Forlorn Falling Petals Kakashi Retsuden : The Sixth Hokage and the Failure Boy Sasuke Retsuden : The Uchiha descendents and the Heavenly Stardust Naruto Retsuden : Naruto Uzumaki and the Spiral Destiny  The only novels which were canonized/ adapted from the anime are the : Naruto : The Last movie Novel Boruto : Naruto the Movie Novel The only difference between the movies and the novels is that in the \u201cLast Movie\u201d Novelisation, Rock Lee destroyed 2 meteors, the origins of the Otsutsukis have been described beautifully well and Naruto was hella horny and wanted to smash Hinata, whereas the Boruto Movie Novel did justice to Momoshiki and actually gave him feats that puts him on a pedastool over Kaguya! Mind you, the novelisation of the movies were done by Kishimoto himself!  The side characters who\u2019ve been neglected by Kishi have far better development and feats in the novels (except Tenten) and that\u2019s all the more reason to view them as canon source materials.  The Naruto Novels are canon and that\u2019s a bloody fact. Facts don\u2019t care about your feelings. Peace Out. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I don\u2019t think so.   The novels are too inconsistent to be proved canon. B-but it was approved by Kishimoto Yes, it was. But from what I remember, wasn\u2019t the databooks too? And according to the databooks, Hebi Sasuke can beat all of Akatsuki. So should we accept it as facts like the novels? I don\u2019t really think it is on the same tier as the manga. There are so many inconsistencies in the Novels, for example- Naruto in the novels was able to dodge a lightspeed attack. But in Boruto, Momoshiki hit him a couple of time. And no, Momo is not the speed of light- he was blocked by Gaara\u2019s sand.   And then, there\u2019s also the fact that Momoshiki blew up a star. I feel really annoyed when people use this thing to make Base Momoshiki star level, like we don\u2019t even know how much prep time Momoshiki got.  All and all, I don\u2019t like using Novels to bring up feats. You know, it\u2019s kind of like the databooks, it at times you could use- however not EVERY thing here has to be logical. Just like Naruto got hit by a sword in the Boruto manga, which is completely illogical. The same way- Naruto dodging a light speed attack in BASE form, is also illogical. I think we should take the novels with a grain of salt, if it is contradicted in the anime/manga- it should be deemed untrue. ",

            "answer_text": "Terry write a really good answer but he\u2019s half right. 1. Itachi novel: Itachi\u2019s story was disclosed in 2008. Throughout the series over and over Itachi\u2019s story has been shown. And last it was 3rd Hokage talk about Itachi when Sasuke asked about Itachi\u2019s truth and it was 2013. So about Itachi, everything was shown in Manga but in different panels. In the novel they gather all the information about Itachi which was in Manga and then published in 2015. And when SP animated they remove irrelevant parts which doesn\u2019t go with the story. Like Itachi killed Shisui, and his girlfriend. A 13 year boy, who was Anbu captain, was so much busy that he didn\u2019t have enough time for his dearest parson Sasuke, but does have time for having a girlfriend. Didn\u2019t think about any children or his parents but about his girlfriend\u2019s dream. Fugaku was uchiha leader and don\u2019t have MS \ud83e\udd37. Do you really want me to believe that? If you think that Itachi\u2019s story was taken from the novel. Then sorry you are wrong that was already on the manga. 2. Sasuke shinden: According to novel it took place 5 month after Naruto and Hinata\u2019s marriage. In war Naruto was 17, In Boruto Naruto said that it\u2019s been 15 years since war and Boruto is 12 years old.  So in between 15 years, The last took place 2 years after war, NaruHina got married after some time and immediately gets pregnant. It took 9 months to born a child. So I am considering that their dating, marriage and give birth in total 1 year (12 Month). If Sasuke shined took place 5 month after NaruHina wedding then how Sarada is just 4 days younger then Boruto. Does it make any sense? And about some part like Sakura told Naruto about Sasuke\u2019s dream of becoming Police officer. Seriously!!! Here is she telling Sasuke never tell anything to her before Sasuke leave the village.  After war Sasuke was in jail and then went for his redemption journey. Then when did he tell her? If Sasuke tell her, what did he tell \u201cI want to kill my brother then I\u2019ll be a police officer\u201d \ud83e\udd37 Doesn\u2019t make any sense. Naruto\u2019s last v-72 was released in February 4 2015 and Sasuke shinden release on November 4 2015. So they pick the plot form Naruto\u2019s last chapter about Sasuke\u2019s redemption journey. However again SP correct those mistakes and remove those irrelevant parts which doesn\u2019t go with the story . 3. About Shikamaru hidden . The last release on December 6 2014 and the novel release in March 4 2015, Naruto V-72 release February 4 2015. So the last release before end of the Manga and shikamaru hiden. And get animated as it fits in the timeline. 4. About the last (Dec- 6 2014) and Boruto movie (Aug 7 2015), that aren\u2019t a part of the light novels. First they release the movie then they published the script. Those aren\u2019t adopted from any novel. 5. About Konoha Hiden: Perfect day of wedding. this novel was needed for Boruto, Actually Sasuke shinden, shikamaru hidden, konoha hidden were for complete the Naruto story, as Kishi already started his work for Samirai 8. And About Boruto novels Boruto is full of fillers or Anime canon whatever it calls. 6. Naruto Shinden: Parents and Childs day. Again SP remove irrelevant parts, Such as if Boruto never left his home then why don\u2019t he go with Naruto as it was a parents Childs day. Sakura give Sasuke a haircut, Boruto took place in modern era, and how come there is no salon. Sorry I don\u2019t believe that Hanabi has this level of audacity to talk about Naruto. I mean how dare she (if they Animated those parts she would definitely replace Sakura as most hated Character) So again SP remove those irrelevant parts which doesn\u2019t go with the story. And won\u2019t affect the original story. 7. Konoha Shinden: Steam Ninja Scrolls. Doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Original story, but that was needed because of Mirai. 8. Now the novels which were never animated. That novel has nothing to do with the original story. If those novels fits in the original timeline doesn\u2019t make them canon. Do you know what else fits in the original time line? Fillers. 9. And now the novel which Are yet to receive an anime adaption. If they make any sense to the Story they will be animated, if they doesn\u2019t make any sense then they will never be animated. If they get an anime adaption the irrelevant parts will definitely be removed. Then how come all those novels are canon? 90% people don\u2019t read novels, only watch anime. 10% read, among them 5% don\u2019t give a f**k 3.5% believe those are not canon 1.5% believes those are canon At this level it really doesn\u2019t matter those light novels are canon or not.

            "answer_text": "As Terry said, Light Novels are canon (only to those few fans), who find that their characters portrayed in them have better feats than what they actually canonically have. It's why you will find a Sakura fan telling you Sakura was on meds which made her performance poor against Shin, as in being a hostage to six of those brats  And in that very same conversation, they'll talk about a poisoned Sakura who can fight Nine tail V2 jinchuriki. What's easier to like? The same mostly useless Sakura or the badass illusion? Novels are not canon And the biggest reason most would use those words are simply because \u201cthey fit on the timeline\". They actually do, but that's because they are written to fit the gaps that exist in canon. And Kishimoto Illustrated, on novels, that in no way can be considered \u201capproved\". Should we consider all anime fillers and movies as canons because they were all actually approved by Kishimoto? Canon material is only ever regarded canon when the creator of the story says its canon. Just like how Kishimoto went out of his way to publicly announce that, Naruto The Last \u201cmovie\", Boruto the movie and Boruto manga are canon aside from his own Naruto manga. Such is the case with any and all known forms fiction. But Novels are canon, just as most other fandom stories that exist  ",
