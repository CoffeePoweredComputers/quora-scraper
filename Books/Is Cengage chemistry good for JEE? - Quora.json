            "answer_text": "According to me CENGAGE is really good for jee advanced but only MATHS AND PHYSICS. In chemistry you don't have any standard book for jee advanced preparation. So in chemistry try to read any standard coaching institute study materials like FIITJEE, RESONANCE OR AAKASH\u2026 Specially RESONANCE\u2026.. Why cengage is not that good for chemistry\u2026. It goes out of syllabus a lot.Contains errors specially in organic chemistryPhysical is good but better options are available and same for inorganic.NOW let's see what if we don't have coaching institutes study materials thenORGANIC CHEMISTRY : Read M S Chauhan organic chemistry for jee and also practice problems from question book of M S Chauhan (it is very time taking\u2026) OR buy plancess online material for organic chemistry (better option )PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY : Read NCERT and RC MUKHERJEE and solve all questions from it.INORGANIC CHEMISTRY : Read NCERT carefully and refer coaching institutes study materials only if you have\u2026 because all good books will take a plenty of time and won't be good for you if your focus is exam\u2026.It was all my personal view may be wrong or right in some ways\u2026 Also instead of buying books buy all stydy material of any one class like allen or resonance etc. would be far better\u2026",
