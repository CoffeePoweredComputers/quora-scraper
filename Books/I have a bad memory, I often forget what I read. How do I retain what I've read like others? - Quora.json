            "answer_text": "Mostly I believe that nobody in the normal range of brain structures has a bad memory. People lack interest in what is around them. Often the concentration is on internal thoughts, rather that what is being said to them. People who retain what they read were probably interested in what the book had to say. When I was at college there were some fellow students that could hear and repeat the latest football (soccer) results but had difficulty in recalling Math formulas talked about the in the latest lecture. The simplest advice, when reading is to really try to feel and see what is being described. The more visual, action and emotion you put into what you read should make recall of the book easier. You can check yourself at the end of a paragraph or chapter or any preferred break in reading and take time to reflect on the images you extracted so far. If none come to mind then you were not trying to see the books images. ",

            "answer_text": "Musa, just focus more when you read. A lot of the time when we forget what we have read, and that happens to everybody actually, we do not focus enough. And even if we focus a lot, sometimes it is hard to remember everything, so when it is like that, read slowly and read over several times even and that will make it soak in more! ",
