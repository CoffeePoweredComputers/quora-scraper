            "answer_text": "The book of Malachi is a fitting ending, because Malachi\u2019s name which means \u201cmy messenger\u201d is the last prophet of the Old Testament who prepares for the coming of Jesus (3:1). No one is certain who Malachi was, but, his name means \u201cmy messenger\u201d or \u201cmessenger of the Lord\u201d. It is interesting that the word \u201cmessenger\u201d occurs three times in such a short book (55 verses). The Jews were God\u2019s special nation in the Old Testament. He had chosen them, and had made a Covenant with them. God had promised to bless Israel, and Israel had promised to be obedient to God; but, as we read through the Old Testament story, we quickly find that, although God kept His promises, Israel broke theirs ; which is why they ultimately landed in the Babylonian Exile. Seventy years in exile was supposed to humble them and to cause them to return to the Lord with all their hearts (Jeremiah 29:10\u201313), but many of the sins listed in the book of Malachi were being perpetrated in Israel causing them to profane the covenant (cf 2:10). It was as if God\u2019s people hadn\u2019t learned a thing in Exile. God\u2019s judgement upon Judah began right away in the days of Malachi whose name means \u201cmy messenger\u201d (3:1) with the fact that God stopped speaking to His people for 400 years from that point. In one sense Malachi himself is \u201cmy messenger\u201d who prepares for the coming of Jesus. He is the last prophet of the Old Testament, and the next page in our bible\u2019s begins with the gospel of Matthew and the New Testament. No other vocational prophet opened his mouth after Malachi, until the Lord Jesus Christ had been born into the world at Bethlehem. But of course, the New Testament makes it plain that these words concerning the \u201cmessenger\u201d have a double reference. Jesus, speaking of John the Baptist, takes up the words of Malachi 3:1 and says \u201cthis is the one about whom it is written, I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you\u201d (Matthew 11:10). John the Baptist prepared the way for Jesus\u2019 coming. As well as being God\u2019s Son, He was the long awaited prophet par excellence \u201cthe messenger of the covenant\u201d (Malachi 3:1) who announced the New Covenant. ",

            "answer_text": "The Redemption Testament ends at Revelation 22. There is NO old or new Testament! The church artificially split it into two so they could insert the druid god chosen by Constantine for his then new pagan religion! The WHOLE of the so called NT is described in the Torah for example which is why you can cross reference the Book of Revelation verse by verse 100% with Torah. It is one cohesive story of Redemption artificially split by druid churches so if there is no OT, the end cannot and does not need explanation! ",
