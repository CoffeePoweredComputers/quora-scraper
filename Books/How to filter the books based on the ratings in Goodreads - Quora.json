            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A On Goodreads, you need to check the ratings as well as the no. of ratings. For example, a rating of 5 is not good when only 10 people have read the book. Similarly, a rating of 3.73 is excellent if 100,000 people have rated it. The no. of reviews also matter and the no. of good reviews vs. bad reviews will give you an idea of the popularity of the book. This is an example of a book which is not so popular. If only 100 people have rated this book, this must be a regional work(specific to a country) or written in a regional language. 2. This is also similar, but the language is limited to only a few people.  3. This is a very good rating and considering the no. of reviews, the book must be good.  4. This book is awesome from the no. of ratings and the reviews. It is widely spoken of and is a must read. Then again, it depends on the genre you like.  Always read the reviews, check the ratings with the denomination of the no. of ratings and then give it a go. Follow fellow readers with similar taste and get recommendation on goodreads if you are confused. Here is my book shelf if it interests you Archana Chari . You can see my ratings and review there. Hope this was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. I generally don't bother with the ratings. I am very eclectic in selecting books. Sometimes, even when the rating is good, you end up not liking the book at all. The vice versa can happen too. So, I suggest, just go with your intuition. ",
