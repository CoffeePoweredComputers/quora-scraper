            "answer_text": "Oh, nothing. Just a great story of love, friendship, loyalty, courage, temptation, determination, maturity, adventure, good, evil, light, darkness, life, and death. Not much. Yeah, you might have realized I\u2019m lying. You\u2019re missing a lot. THE HOBBIT is, though a children\u2019s book, a story with meaning much deeper than just dragons and gold. Bilbo Baggins is a respectable young Hobbit who likes books and his cozy little armchair inside his snug, warm Hobbit hole. It\u2019s not until Gandalf the wizard pushes him out onto a quest to defeat a dragon and take back a mountain (not to mention a generous amount of gold and weapons with him) does Bilbo open his eyes up to the real world outside. The long dormant feelings of wanderlust, adventure, daring and loyalty wake up inside him and shake his world forever. LOTR is a high fantasy. You\u2019re reading about the adventure of Bilbo\u2019s nephew: Frodo. He too likes the comfort of the Shire, his loving uncle, and playing around with friends Sam, Merry and Pippin. But he loves an adventure of his own, just like his uncle. Little does he know that he is in possession of a dangerous and powerful ring, and must take it all the way across Middle Earth to destroy it once and for all before the evil Sauron awakens. Accompanied by his Hobbit friends, a man, elf, dwarf and Gandalf, Frodo is taken through a series of trial and error, dangerous paths, risky decisions, adventure, and the power of good over evil as he goes all the way to the fiery lands of Mordor, far far away from his Hobbit hole back at home. HARRY POTTER is the story of a young wizard orphan named Harry Potter. Hated by his grudging aunt, uncle and enormous cousin Dudley, Harry learns after eleven desperate and dull years that he is in fact, a wizard. He\u2019s taken to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magic, where he meets his best friends Ron and Hermione and learns over time about the dark legacy that he must face. As time goes on, the series of Harry Potter becomes darker and darker, and as Harry grows, he learns more about who he really is, as well as a thing or two about his and Ron\u2019s darkest fears, a prophecy that shows a grim future he must face, secrets kept hidden away from his eyes, his Gryffindor heart, and how love will hopefully even out the hate that he must inevitably face in the very end\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "There's only one way to find out. I don't mean that as a joke. These are forms of entertainment. You can't conceivably know if they're going to be forms you enjoy without trying them. Both are children's books. The Harry Potter books grow from children's book to young adult fiction as the series goes on. The Hobbit grows up nicely during the course of the book, and leads into The Lord of the Rings, which is definitely an adult book. Neither The Hobbit nor the first Harry Potter book (The Socerer's Stone/Philosopher's Stone, depending on where you get it) is a major investment of your time, so pick it up and read it.  If you hate it, skip it. If not, you'll have found something you can enjoy. You already know that some people you respect found them entertaining, so why are you reading this answer instead of something actually worthwhile? ",
