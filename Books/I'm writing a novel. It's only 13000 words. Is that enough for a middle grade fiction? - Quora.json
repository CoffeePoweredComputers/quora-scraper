            "answer_text": "Hi What you are writing falls in the category of a novelette, as per the suggested word count. Word count - Wikipedia I\u2019d also suggest going through Hugo Award for Best Novelette - Wikipedia to get an idea about the value of novelettes. So yes, it is sufficient to satisfy the criteria of a novelette, but not that of a novel. Here\u2019s another bit, which shares advice on minimum wordcount for a novel Word count by genre: How long should my book really be? My personal take is, just to be on the right side of the fence, a novel should be over 70\u201375,000 words. Good Luck ! :) ",
