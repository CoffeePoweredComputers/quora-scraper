            "answer_text": "A german language primer... along with about 3-4 years of German instruction. Freud is read much better in German. One gets the jokes, and the language has much less of a 'technospeak' sense to it... Just to give you an example. English --- German --- ordinary German back in to ordinary English.Ego   --- Das Ich --- English 'I/me', sometimes the 'me' case of the pronoun works better in English phrasing. Super Ego -- Das \u00dcber Ich --- \"Above I/me ('Above me' would be better English)\" Id -- Das Es -- It. In German 'Ich' is used any time one is saying 'I... ' as in 'I go to the store', etc. it is not a 'technospeak' term. No one has to run to the dictionary to look up 'oh, Ego is Latin for \"I\"'... Likewise for \"Es\"... it is the pronoun used in such phrases as \"Es is there.\" (one has to know what 'it' refers to.... but that's what a pronoun does... refer to something already known... except in the 'indeterminate' case of 'who is it'...) And \"\u00dcber Ich\" is easily understood as well. All that got tied up in technospeak in the English translations, and while Freud oversaw those translations to some degree, he did not really object. As I recall he did write something about the 'american' need to appear more sophisticated than need be... but it has been quite a while since I've read his works. ",
