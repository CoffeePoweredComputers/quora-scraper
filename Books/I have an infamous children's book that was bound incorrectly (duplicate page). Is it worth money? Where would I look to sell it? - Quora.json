            "answer_text": "If the flaw reveals that the book is a first impression of a 1st edition (like the true 1st edition of one of the Harry Potter books\u2026 I\u2019m not telling you the flaw nor the book, although you can have a hint: your best chance of finding one is in Australia), then it can make it much more valuable. However, if it\u2019s a \u201creading edition\u201d - almost any paperback edition and any late hardback edition, then it\u2019s probably worth less than a flawless copy. The example of the Harry Potter book was a printing error, and therefore it\u2019s known precisely how many copies with the error exist. This means it has known rarity which is very attractive to collectors. The problem with a binding error is that unless you know that all the copies of that edition share the same binding error, you can\u2019t tell how rare it is. I have a copy of John Barth\u2019s \u201cThe Sot Weed Factor\u201d where about 100 pages were bound in reverse order, about 2 thirds of the way through the book. I\u2019ve seen other copies with the same flaw. Not only is it worthless (because you can\u2019t read it) but it also shows that a lot of people must have never finished the book\u2026 Pity. It\u2019s a great book. ",
