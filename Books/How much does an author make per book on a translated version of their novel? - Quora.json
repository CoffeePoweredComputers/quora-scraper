            "answer_text": "You might be talking about prolific writers who are on the best-seller lists each year and have their books translated in xxx number of languages. Hardcover novels in the US cost around $24.95 with the trade paperbacks at about $16.95 nowadays. It is up to the agent to negotiate what the author gets paid, not the price of the book. In the good old days, an agent received 10% of the money, now it is anywhere from 15-18%. And many authors get an advance. You have to make that advance money back before you make a dime. I have two novels in print, as well as stories in 170 anthologies, and have appeared in eight languages. I might be considered a B-list writer of short stories, and several of the anthologies I have been in have been reprinted in the UK, then French, then German. That seems to be the pecking order. In the case of an anthology, the editor keeps 60% of all monies, the rest is divvied up between the other 8-12 authors. Even still, I do get royalty check for stories I sold to those anthologies as far back as 1994. There is no real answer for your question unless you get a reply from a literary agent here, because the prices will differ wildly. Most writers are happy just to have their work reprinted in, say, Finland (as a story of mine was) and would settle on a flat rate plus copies of the book. Say for example there is a new publishing house that starts up in Germany, which loves writers from the US. Their editors will contact different companies here to try and buy up out-of-print anthologies or novels. If they are books that came out in 2006 and were asked for today, the US publisher will sell the foreign rights for pennies on the dollar, because the more books they give them to reprint, the more money they will make on a product that was not making them money at all. So there would be no royalties, although we would get copies of the book, which is still a good thing because we can sell them on our own at cover cost or even higher. Many bookstores where I live in Chicago will stock foreign editions of a book in which they sell the US version. I don't know if what I have said has helped much. Germany is by far the best country to pay royalties, but again it comes to what price gets negotiated. That is, my novel that I wrote in 1992 was sold for xxx amount of dollars and the German version for about a fourth of that. But of course I'll take that money over not having the book reprinted at all. And I get paid promptly. If I made $4.00 per copy sold of  my novel, I would make $1.00 in Germany, but I might even make a bit more, maybe $1.50, if the book sells well. I'm thrown by the 55% reduced price you mention, as none of my books were ever remaindered and simply went out of print,but it makes me think of the discount a US edition gets when picked up overseas. The answer is always going to vary, especially so on genre. Many overseas publishers like to see thrillers or mysteries. Some publishers pay more for the genre that they are looking for. I hope I've answered your question well enough to make sense. It is not an across the board thing. Every writer who tries to get his or her work reprinted overseas should look up German publishers first. And those in France after that. Speaking as a writer in the middle of the swimming pools' waters, that's what I can offer. Some countries and specific publishing houses can be very generous. ",

            "answer_text": "Your numbers are wrong (most publishers pay 10% of list price on hardcover sales), but I'll ignore that for the moment and address the actual question. Probably at least 90% of the time, despite agreements and contracts, authors are not actually paid on a per-copy basis for translated editions.  I don't know how many translated editions of my novels have been published, even without counting the pirated ones, but it's at least a couple of dozen, and the only ones to ever actually pay royalties beyond the advance were the French editions of one fantasy series.  At least ten Russian editions, half a dozen German, a handful of Spanish and Italian, a couple of Japanese, a few Polish, and assorted others never paid a cent beyond the advance.  In some cases the contracts were structured so that they couldn't pay more -- the contract was for a specific print-run, and selling the entire print-run wouldn't earn enough royalties to pay anything beyond the advance. Calculating royalties and paying them in foreign currencies is a pain in the ass most publishers would just as soon avoid, so deals are often deliberately designed to avoid doing so. Generally, with foreign deals, you take the advance and forget about royalties.  I was very pleasantly surprised when I got those French royalty checks -- I'd been selling translation rights for twenty years before that (including other French editions) without ever seeing that happen. So, given that it's probably never going to matter, what do foreign editions pay per copy?  It depends on the country and the language.  Sometimes there simply aren't any royalties -- it's a flat fee for translation rights for a specific period of time, or a specific print-run.  Sometimes the royalties are calculated in the local currency, not dollars, so it'll depend on the exchange rates. When it is a straight royalty it will vary with the size of the market and the local traditions on book pricing, and it may be split between the author and the translator. In short, there isn't any useful standard and it probably won't matter. ",
