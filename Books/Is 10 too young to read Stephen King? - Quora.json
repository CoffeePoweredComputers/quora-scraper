            "answer_text": "I would say that depends on the child and what they expect to get from the experience. I would avoid letting them read anything that has sex scenes in it unless you know for sure they already have covered the topic of sex in school or with their parents, as Stephen King's books are definitely not the reason you want to have \u201cthe talk\" with them. But more to the point, there's a fine line between whether someone is too young to read the books because of their content and whether they're too young because they simply don't have the world experience to understand the more subtle horrors and themes in his stories. Certainly, a smart kid with an advanced reading level could enjoy the surface story at that age, but I would hope that they're the kind of person who will want to reread it again as an adult to really absorb the story from another perspective. For example: Pet Sematary might have some scary scenes and memorable moments, but I doubt a ten year old, even a gifted one is going to take to heart the true horror and grief the story presents. Ten year old brains just don't comprehend it the same way as an older reader. ",

            "answer_text": "My daughters were more into Stephen King than my son, although my son also read his novels. All three were reading them when they were nine and ten years old (they\u2019ve all been declared gifted at an early age by their schools). They aren\u2019t currently interested in Stephen King novels, or any pleasurable reading. That\u2019s because of the pressures of their current occupations. Stephen King wasn\u2019t around when I was nine and ten. However, I was reading my mother\u2019s \u201cModern Romances\u201d and other magazines when I was nine and ten, and the vocabulary in Stephen King novels is about the same. I do believe his novels are aimed at the adolescent, and younger, reader, and that\u2019s why they are so easy to read. Back to your question: \u201cIs 10 too young to read Stephen King?\u201d From my own experience with my children, I don\u2019t think so. Also from my own reading ability at nine and ten, I don\u2019t believe ten, or even nine, is too young. ",
