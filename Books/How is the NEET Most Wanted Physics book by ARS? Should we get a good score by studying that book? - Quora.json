            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t fall for such cheap scams by some poeple who derive benefit from being in top colleges. Read your normal NCERT and solve good books like MTG and Biology Booster by S. Ansari Sir. Even the Errorless Biology for NEET is a fine book. People like Aryan Raj and Aman Tilak don\u2019t give a f**k about you and you shouldn\u2019t give a f**k about them. This will hurt if you are a fanboy but if you think logically you\u2019ll be able to see why I am saying this. Do you really think there is a \u201cMagic book\u201d that will boost your score from 400 to 650 in a few days? Do you even have the slightest idea how much effort goes into scoring a score of 650 and that too consistently? Believe me it takes months of late nights and tons of MCQ solving to get there. No magic book will do that for you. The only people falling for Aryan Raj\u2019s scams are the ones who are too weak/scared to work hard. My friend, Aryan Raj and Aman Tilak just want to scam you of your parent\u2019s hard earned money. DON\u2019T FALL FOR SUCH CHEAP TRICKS MY FRIEND!!! ",
