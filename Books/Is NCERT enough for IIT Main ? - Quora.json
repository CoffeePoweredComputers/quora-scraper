            "answer_text": "For Chemistry, it's good enough (you can expect around 60\u201380 marks from NCERT level in JEE MAINS). For other subjects, NCERT won't be enough.(If you want to get a very good rank). But if you want to just clear the cuttoff then probably it's enough (provided you really have read it). But just clearing the cutoff isn't very useful. You won't get a good college. Also solve previous year papers ( Both MAINS and ADVANCED). ",

            "answer_text": "For chemistry, NCERT can take you even to a score of 100+ in JEE Mains. While working out with Physics, concepts can be studied from the NCERT but you need another reference book in order to get a number of questions to practice. For mathematics,you need a special book for even the concepts and the problems. Here, the problem with NCERT is that the concepts covered in the book are not upto the mark and level of concepts required during JEE is not available in the NCERT book of Mathematics. ",
