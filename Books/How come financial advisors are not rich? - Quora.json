            "answer_text": "Financial advisory is a career, and everybody has to start somewhere. That being said, \u201crich\u201d is a relative term. In finance, we have specific definitions for mass affluent, high net worth, very high net worth, and ultra-high net worth. There are categories of \u201crich\u201d. Eventually, those who do stay on in the finance industry, and do well, get rich. The thing is, many of us who deal with wealthy clients, learn from them as well, and understand the value of not flaunting wealth. It invites unnecessary scrutiny and tax audits. That being said, I personally know of people in this industry who were once wealthy, and then lost it all, to fall back into the middle class, or worse. One of them was caught laundering money, and the fines and asset seizures stripped him of almost everything. Another had the misfortune of running afoul with compliance due to paperwork issues, and lost her licence. Big money also brings big risks. This is why I qualify my potential clients and do not take some characters on as clients even when they are willing to throw tens of millions my way. Once you have a reputation of being good at fund and portfolio management, there will be this temptation of all manner of dubious characters who need \u201chelp\u201d with their funds. Successful financial advisors become poor because they give in to this temptation, and the law eventually always catches up. I am quite happy with the air outside prison. ",

            "answer_text": "How come financial advisors are not rich?  Well, some are and some are not. Financial advisory is a profession, a career, a business. Like any other, your expertise plus your hard work, opportunities, and strategies equal your success. Like anyone else, you must define what success looks like for you, and then either find or build the structure that works. Financial advisors often have the opportunity to capitalize on their expertise by using it in their own lives. Barriers to financial success could include poor business structure and/or planning, lack of sales skills (even pure consultants must sell their offering), and much more. Like any other professional, a financial advisor who isn\u2019t starting with a large chunk of capital must build towards wealth. Once that wealth is built, some will remain in the profession while others - like anyone else - may choose to retire. ",
