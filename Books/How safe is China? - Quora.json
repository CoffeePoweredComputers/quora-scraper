            "answer_text": "Undoubtedly, China is the safest country I have ever lived in. Coming from a 27 year old African-American, you don't have to worry about your safety at all compared to living in the United States. Use your common sense and everything will be fine. In America, there is constant gun violence across the country. In China, there are no guns at all (except for certain agencies). After living in China for some time now, it is perplexing that Americans have such easy access to shoot someone, even in common cases such as road rage. In America, part of the gun violence stems from police, and causes high stress in many communities. In China, it is much more peaceful, and the police will rarely approach you, if at all (and they don't carry guns). In America, I would rarely walk around at night in a major city, unless it was a popular area or just walking to my car. In China, I have explored many areas in major cities late at night, and never ran into any trouble. Also, the culture in China is very social at night; many people will eat BBQ on the street and continue the night with friends. If you think New York never sleeps, China REALLY never sleeps. As a foreigner in China, you will encounter many friendly situations with strangers. Parents will encourage their children to speak English with you. People walking past you will want to take a selfie with you (you might be in a city with not many foreigners, or you might look like an NBA player to them). It is very easy to meet new people, including expats and locals. You can probably tell I really enjoy my life in China as a foreigner, but I think many expats would agree with these comparisons. Lastly, a key comparison are the borders. Entering China from the airport, you will have your carry-on luggage checked by one or two people, you will fill out your arrival card, wait in line, you will notice about 5\u20138 employees, then they will check your passport and visa, and will let you in as long as everything checks out. Rarely will they ask a question. Entering America from the airport (as an American), you will scan your passport at a kiosk, then you will wait in line, you will notice about 20\u201330 employees, with some of them armed, you will get to the counter to check your passport, and you will have to answer at least 10 questions at a very fast pace, then they let you go through if everything checks out. For an expat, this is not the best welcome home. I couldn't imagine the differences foreigners have with CBP when entering America. China is very safe and I highly recommend visiting or living here. There are many factors to why China is so safe, and I encourage you to come experience it for yourself. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "Since this question was first asked in 2015, there have been some changes in China. We weren\u2019t thinking about COVID-19 five years ago, so let\u2019s start with that. Ever since I first travelled regularly to China (about six years ago), I have become very used to facemasks and the numerous screening desks: medical ones at airports, and security ones on the subway, at train stations, malls and office buildings. Being repeatedly checked, screened and scanned going about your daily business was initially a pain, but it takes no time at all to get used to, and it soon becomes second nature. At times like now, you really appreciate it and it makes you feel safe. I am waiting right now for visa restrictions to be lifted so I can fly back from London to Beijing. I know that when I arrive, all these security and screening stations will be operating at full tilt. I trust them and I trust the eagerness with which the authorities will screen out and process any person who has an elevated temperature or other symptoms. I trust the system to be efficient, and as long as I don\u2019t have COVID-19 symptoms, I know it will benefit me. (Mind you, if I did have COVID-19 symptoms, I\u2019d probably find that the screening would identify them in China far sooner than if I was in the UK and I\u2019d be ushered off for well-practised and efficient treatment very quickly). So yes, the upshot on COVID-19 is that I can\u2019t wait to get back to China, for my health\u2019s sake too \u2013 I will genuinely feel extremely safe once I am there. Beyond COVID-19, the question and prior answers relate not to health safety, but primarily to physical safety and security. In nearly 6 years and 20 trips to north and south China, I\u2019ve been very lucky that I\u2019ve never encountered anything which made me feel unsafe. Nothing. I know I\u2019ve been lucky, but it\u2019s true. Tripadvisor says \u201cBeijing is probably one of the safest cities of comparable size anywhere in the world\u201d. Lonely Planet says \u201cChina is relatively safe and non-violent\u201d. The UK government\u2019s official travel advice says, \u201cpersonal attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare\u201d and \u201cserious crime against foreigners is relatively rare\u201d. Even the US Department of State says \u201cThere is minimal risk from crime in Beijing\u201d and reports that \u201cdiscrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, disability, etc. are relatively uncommon\u201d. This all reflects my personal experience. The global private security firm, Intelligent Protection, says \u201cBeijing is considered one of the safety cities in this region\u201d. Beijing and Shanghai, Taipei and Hong Kong were awarded the highest grade, \u201cVery High\u201d, in personal security by The Economist\u2019s Safe Cities Index 2019, a ranking of the leading cities in the world. This was above any US city apart from Washington, DC! Hong Kong and Taipei also rank in the highest category in digital security and infrastructure security.  Police and security officers are ubiquitous in China. Community-based patrolling and the police presence is very obvious. Guns are not allowed. Technology monitoring (cctv) is everywhere, not just for archive footage but to identify real-time petty infringements such as jaywalking. The anti-drug laws and punishments are draconian. Even the new social credit system, which grades citizens based on their behaviour, feels like it has made the place safer. I don\u2019t have the results to hand, but there\u2019s just a feeling that \u201cyou need to be on good behaviour\u201d. One memorable evening, I was in a hotel in east Beijing quite some distance from a subway station. After 1 hour waiting for a taxi (the concierge swore blind that \u201cone will be along any minute\u201d!) I lost patience and started to walk. It was about 10:45 pm. I had no data on my phone but no problem, I knew if I found a subway I could make my way to Chongwenmen station. No need for data. You may know that in London, the distance between tube stations is often tiny. But in Beijing, two tube stations which look \u201cone block apart\u201d on a map, are most likely a 20-30 minute walk. So finding the first subway station was a challenge. Once in, I breathed a sigh of relief and bought my ticket for Chongwenmen. Only two changes on the subway. No problem. But then on the first change, the subway starts to shut down for the night. Suddenly, there are long walkway tunnels with iron shutters at the end and the place is spookily empty and eerily quiet. The penny drops and I realise I need to leave the subway and find some other way home. I end up outside the subway, heaven knows where in Beijing, and no data. It\u2019s around midnight now and I\u2019m in an area with no street lights. And it\u2019s raining. It\u2019s a bit spooky. In other cities, I would have been fearful for my safety, but for some reason I wasn\u2019t. I decide to break the rules and put my hand out when a guy in a tricycle scooter taxi thing passes by. I ask him for paper and I write Chongwenmen on it which, miraculously, he seems to understand. I have no way of knowing that he actually does, of course, but I\u2019m in fate\u2019s hands now so I go with the flow. After 20 minutes or so I\u2019m starting to recognise the area and then I realise I know the street we are on, so I pat the driver on the back, tell him we\u2019re in the right place and do the thumbs up thing a few times with a big smile. After a bit of pointing and two dead-ends, he\u2019s taken me to my hotel and I\u2019m one grateful traveller. He asks me for about \u00a32 and I give him \u00a35. It was worth it. I\u2019m totally relieved, he\u2019s done me a huge service and he seems to understand how helpful it was to me at that time. It was a nearly 3 hour adventure in the end. I never once had fear. But I can tell you, having spent time in New York, and working now in the East End of London, I can tell you that I would have been much more apprehensive if I was a foreigner there. The watchword for visitors is: don\u2019t be negligent. Don\u2019t leave your bag or mobile of laptop lying around, be aware of petty thieves and scams and street hustles, be hypersensitive to pickpocketing \u2013 these things apply in Rome and London and New York, and they apply in Shenzhen and Shanghai too. But being prudent, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find China as safe as I always have. ",
