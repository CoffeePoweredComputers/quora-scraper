            "answer_text": "The most accurate answer to your question must come from a qualified cognitive neuroscientist. I am a bit under-qualified to answer your question but here is a meta-neuroscience answer. Our consciousness, ie. the sense of who we are is held in the brain. Who we are comes from the brain - our conscious and subconscious thoughts. Our actions, behaviour, beliefs are shaped by what we see, hear, read, what we are taught and our own critical thinking faculties - which we have nurtured. When we are kids, our brains are in a hyper learning mode - we absorb a lot of things and these perceptions are coded into our minds. Reading is one way of absorbing ideas. What you read is transformed to thoughts - you may feel that you forget what you read but those thoughts seep into your sub-conscious and if you are read similar stuff again and again it transforms your psyche. There is a theory that neural pathways are activated when we are experiencing anything. Reading requires focus and in a focussed state the neural signalling are stronger. Each thing your read is basically a neural pathway - a road through the bushes in the brain. The more times you traverse a road in the bushes, the clearer and smoother it becomes. Some separate notes: 1. How strongly reading affects you depends on various factors - your maturity, critical thinking ability, acceptance for new ideas, questioning ability etc. 2. While it\u2019s true that our environment/upbringing as a child shapes a major part of who we are, we can make a voluntary effort to expand our thoughts by reading. Reading effects who you are. ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to began my answer with recommending \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d, the story that provides the ultimate answer to how would books or reading will affect how I am as a person question. \u201cThe magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us.\u201d \u2015 Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451 If you are reading in a foreign language (Not Translated), as a person you will have the ability to articulate situations differently and view new perspectives, as these stories were not part of how you have seen or interacted with the world. This is Vital in the digital age where the algorithm is highly tailored and personalized creating an echo champers of self thought. As the Examined Existence blog has put it. A foreign language is a whole new system with distinct rules, etymology, and meaning, which are just a few of the complexities of a language. Learning a new one puts the brain to task by recognizing this new language structure. As the brain works out meaning and makes full use of this new arsenal to express ideas, it sharpens skills on reading, negotiating, and problem-solving. In a famous study from Emory University titled \u201cShort- and Long-Term Effects of a Novel on Connectivity in the Brain,\" . The Study finds that reading fiction can increase the readers empathy, as novels enhances connectivity in the brain and improves brain function. So what you read, doesn't only affect who you are in terms of cognitive abilities (memory, decision making, elegant use of language). doesn\u2019t only affect who are as a person from empathy to culture. What you read becomes a part of you, those stories live in your imagination and woven themselves into your life. What you read is part of who you are. ",
