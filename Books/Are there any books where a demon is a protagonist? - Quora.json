            "answer_text": "Asura: The Tale of the Vanquished by Anand Neelakanthan is the tale of Ravana and the race of Asuras. In Hindu mythology, Ravana was the king of the Asura race - the demons. He was, in essence, the demon king. Legend has it that Ravana did penance to Lord Brahma (the creator) to get himself boons to make himself all powerful, this ensured that he became the most powerful asura or demon and thus by default the King of the Asura empire. Indian folklore is rife with stories of demons who have been both good and bad. So any time you want to read a book where the demon is the protagonist, pick authors from India like Anand Neelakanthan or Ashok Banker. I also recommend the Vengence of Ravana by Ashok Banker - this is the culmination of his Ramayana Series, but Ravana is the protagonist of this story. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, there\u2019s the classic by C.S Lewis: The Screwtape Letters.  This book is about a demon in Hell named Screwtape, and he\u2019s writing a bunch of letter\u2019s to his nephew Wormwood. Screwtape is basically a bookkeeper in Hell, while his nephew is a demon whose duty it is to damn human souls. But it turns out wormwood needs some pointers on how to properly tempt humans, because he\u2019s really bad at it. It\u2019s a satirical and fascinating story, I recommend it. ",
