            "answer_text": "Mbbs students study many books. There is no count for the number of books they study.It depends on the individual and his/her interest, understanding power of the concepts. Mbbs students study 19 subjects in a short span of 4 and half years. Yeah its a short span because you can't expect them to study everything that is in the book with in a year and even if they study the whole we tend to forget the things because its human tendency. You can't expect a mbbs student after reading for 4 and half years to treat all the cases because diseases don't present in the same way as given in the book. For some subjects we study in only one book, for some we study in two books, for some we refer many books. It mainly depends on the individual and whether he /she understands it or not. If we feel that the content is not full in particular topic ,we refer to other books for that topic. Other than textbooks we also need to read books for our practical exams. A medical student is a student forever because they have to learn throughout their life. There is never an ending to the learning process in medical field.  ",

            "answer_text": "It's better to ask how many subjects,rather than how many books.Any individual can study 'n' number of book if he/she is interested in studying. An MBBS student has to study overall 19 subjects in a course of 4 and half years.If a student is interested in gaining knowledge rather passing the exam he may read at least 2\u20133 books in every subject , this kind of students study more than 40 books in the 4and half years course,if the guy only wants to pass the exam then he goes with a local author book which doesn't impart any knowledge to him but make him pass the exam,this kind of students may study only 4books only one book per year which includes all the subjects of that year in a single book. You can easily know the difference between a guy studying 40 books and a guy studying only 4 books. ;-) Hope this may helpful for you.Thankyou. ",
