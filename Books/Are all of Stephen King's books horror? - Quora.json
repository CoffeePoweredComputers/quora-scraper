He\u2019s written five non-fiction books and, of the 61 other books he\u2019s written, several could better be classified as science fiction, fantasy, or even drama. And even his straight horror books often have elements of other genres. King\u2019s never allowed himself to be confined in his storytelling. He frequently mixes genres and themes. The Green Miles, for example, is far more a drama with supernatural elements than it is horror. Although horrific thing do happen in the novel. The Eyes of the Dragon is almost straight fantasy, with some slight tinges of horror here and there. Point being, while King\u2019s reputation is well-established as a horror author, he has much more to offer than just that. ",
