            "answer_text": "A major biographical work by Ian Kershaw simply titled Hitler is a good place to start. A new edition has come out recently, I believe in 2015, that combines the original two volumes. Kershaw\u2019s work is now considered the definitive biography, namely because more information has come to light and availability with the disintegration of the Soviet bloc and the opening of long-sealed Soviet archives, so Kershaw\u2019s book is more up to date and current. But there have been others. If you can find a copy of Allan Bullocks\u2019 biography, that\u2019s worth a good read. It is likely out of print, a search in the library might get you a copy. If you can ever get a copy of The Psychopathic God by Robert G. l. Waite, it\u2019s a good read as a psychological portrait of Adolf Hitler. I found it an illuminating work in explaining Hitler. ",
