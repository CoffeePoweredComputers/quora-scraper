Or else i will suggest you to be smarter. Do commerce give your best and do bba if you are interested in H.R. field this will not require your much effort and besides this while doing your graduation do some additional courses of personality development and computers. Trust me now a days the competion is so hard that if you are at 99% only then you can take a free breathe but if you are at 95% you will be having alot of competion. But the 2nd option i told you for comerce and ending with H.R. this is what every company wants a man who can get us qualified employers and this is never ending so by doing this you will secure your future. So do let me know in the comment section what you feel. I wish you good luck. ",
