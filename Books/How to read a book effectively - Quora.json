            "answer_text": "It all depends on the complexity of the book. If its quite simple, like a thriller, say a 'whodunnit' its a piece of cake. On the other hand, if its a work contemplating a dystopian society, human emotions, conflicting ideas within characters and topped off with a bit of philosophy, then, oh boy, you're in deep trouble.  If you're no savant, then the obvious way to master the book, is to re-read it. Its that simple. I've re read some works either because they were too difficult to comprehend the first time, or because I thought that they deserved a second reading, because of the quality of the written word.  1984 and Love in the time of Cholera are the two that comes to my mind.Also, when in doubt. research (read 'research' = Google). Its always good to do that,cause you'll always learn a little something extra.I am currently reading For Whom the Bell Tolls by Hemingway, and after some digging I came to know about the Iceberg Theory.Try to think of the author and his emotions when reading. Almost all of the novels will be a mental projection of the authors' mind.Do not focus on finishing the story, by reading through the words, sentences and paragraphs. Instead read between the lines, grasp not the literal meaning , but what the author is telling you. Listen to his words.Think on difficult ideas put forth in the novel. Something like this: \u201cFor him it was a dark passage which led to nowhere, then to nowhere, then again to nowhere, once again to nowhere, always and forever to nowhere, heavy on the elbows in the earth to nowhere, dark, never any end to nowhere, hung on all time always to unknowing nowhere, this time and again for always to nowhere, now not to be borne once again always and to nowhere, now beyond all bearing up, up, up and into nowhere, suddenly, scaldingly, holdingly all nowhere gone and time absolutely still and they were both there, time having stopped and he felt the earth move out and away from under them.\u201d  \u2015 Ernest Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls Still trying to wrap my head around this :) Hope this helped. Have a nice day ",

Every. Possible. Question. (talk to the author)After each page, summarize it in one sentence. (relax this as you see fit, but this is essential)Never leave something for later.
