            "answer_text": "Originally answered: Can humans understand people with severe autisms? I can\u2019t address the asker without breaking BNBR, so instead I\u2019m going to address readers. The tendency to speak as if autistic people aren\u2019t human has an unfortunately long and painful history. As recently as ten years ago leading researchers said things like autistic people are closer to chimpanzees than humans and said we are like robots and lack something that makes us human. Ironically, this both illustrates why some people prefer person-first language and why i think person first language is pointless-because if you need person-first language to remember that we\u2019re, ya know, people, you are part of the problem and should shut the hell up about autism and autistic people. It is sadly true that there are some autistic people who are unable to communicate in a \u2018normal\u2019 fashion. Even more sadly, many people assume that because an autistic person can\u2019t communicate verbally, they can\u2019t think. Here is a blog post by a mother who thought this way about her autistic child. She is bluntly honest about the way she treated her son and how wrong she was. Faith Some autistic people are non-verbal. Those of us who are non-verbal can\u2019t communicate with the people around us if we aren\u2019t given a way to communicate. Whether it\u2019s a letter board, sign language, an app, or something else. For those of us who are verbal but need high levels of support, yes of course other people can communicate with us. That\u2019s what being verbal means. The biggest challenge for allistic people will be understanding that we think differently and while some of us, especially those of us who are hyperverbal, are able to understand allistic thinking well enough to communicate \u2018normally\u2019, many of us will speak as we think\u2014autistically\u2014and that will make for a weird and sometimes frustrating conversation by allistic standards. So allistic people (and hyperverbal autistic people) will need to have patience and take the time to our pattern of speaking and communicating. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is maybe. Depends on your level of empathy, just like with understanding anybody. I would highly recommend adding \u201cautism\u201d as an interest on Quora and reading what other autists have to say on this subject and the difference between autists and neurotypicals. No one can explain autism better than the autists. I have autistic traits and two autistic children (I don\u2019t myself qualify for the diagnosis because I don\u2019t have any of the sensory problems or ritual behaviors as one neuropsychologist put it; if anything, my sensory system is more numb than even most neurotypicals). Understanding the sensory problems they have is probably the harder part of understanding those with autism (at least for me because I have such a numb sensory system). Everything is brighter, louder, more intense to them. I\u2019ve read that some autists feel even emotions differently than neurotypicals. It just depends on the person, because it IS a huge spectrum. I only know these things because I\u2019ve studied what other autists had to say about it in trying to understand my own children better, so that I know what it\u2019s like to be in their heads better. So again, to know what it\u2019s like, I would read what other autists have to say about it. Some autists can\u2019t talk or communicate (the more severe side of the autism spectrum), but there are many who can and who can get you close to understanding what it must be like for those with severe autism. The most important thing to know is that they are people with feelings and thoughts just like the rest of us, but they are on the whole more loyal and honest than neurotypicals. Depending on the autist, their honesty is often mistaken for rudeness. We live in a society where neurotypicals function by telling pleasant \u201cwhite lies,\u201d and neurotypicals think it\u2019s rude to violate this standard, but most autists generally see that any lie is still a lie, it\u2019s an untruth, and they don\u2019t like to lie. Personally, I admire this about autists and find it refreshing. I think the world has a lot of good qualities to learn from autists. ",

            "answer_text": "I am answering the far less offensive version of this question. It depends. Some autistic people - no matter how severely autistic - can talk and communicate. Others are completely mute. \u201cBut what about sign language or electronic forms of communication?\u201d From my experience, there are some autistic people who are completely unable to communicate. Especially when they\u2019re very young. My son occasionally shares the gym at his occupational therapy with a boy of about 4 or 5 years old who has this disability. He\u2019s slowly learning to communicate through a tablet app that can help him express his wants and needs. There are also times when my son, who is otherwise quite verbal, is completely unable to communicate. Usually when he\u2019s under stress, or he\u2019s having some kind of panic attack. When there is no communication at all, there can be no understanding. Sympathy? Compassion? Yes. But understanding doesn\u2019t come from any of that. It only comes from communication. And sometimes, that\u2019s not possible. ",

Neurotypical people claim themselves to be empathic but autistic people seem to be more empathic towards other autistic people than neurotypical people are. Neurotypical people seem to confuse making \u201csympathetic\u201d noises and pitying someone with empathy. Pity is not empathy. Just because autistic people don\u2019t make \u201csympathetic\u201d facial expressions and murmur \u201csympathetic\u201d sounds does not meant hat they cannot empathise although they may struggle to understand neurotypical people well-enough to empathise except in extreme circumstances.

We\u2019re all essentially living in our own little worlds not matter how much we share with others and express thoughts and emotions outwardly. To a neurotypical, it might seem harder to understand someone on the spectrum, but it\u2019s really just the same as trying to understand anyone else. It seems harder because so many neurotypicals are close-minded when it comes to communication. My partner and I communicate non-verbally more often than not, and it would feel weird to me and confuse me if we actually talked more. We can sit in silence for hours and still understand each other. ",
