            "answer_text": "Reading comics is easy! Just follow these two simple steps: Make a list of all the words on the page.Put them in the order that makes the most sense to you.Follow these steps, and pretty soon, you\u2019ll be reading comics like a pro!  Okay, okay\u2026 Comics can be difficult to follow sometimes. Generally speaking, American comic books should be read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. But that\u2019s not always the case. Good comic artists lay out the flow in such a way that, if they break convention, it\u2019s easy enough to follow. Take this page from Gwenpool Strikes Back #5, for example:  The reader starts in the upper-left. Easy enough. That flows into the large panel covering the top half of the page. Following the reading order, we move to the top of the two stacked panels. Now, a strict \u201cleft-to-right\u201d order would dictate that we go to the tall, skinny panel next. But if you do that, the bottom of the stacked panels doesn\u2019t make sense. In this case, the artist has provided a visual clue or two to suggest the proper flow. The word bubbles from the bottom panel flow into the panel above, indicating that the two panels are linked. Also, the bottom panel literally runs into the tall, skinny panel to show that you should read that one when you\u2019ve finished with the panel before. Note: If you are new to comics, maybe don\u2019t start with Gwenpool. There\u2019s a lot going on. For instance, in this page from Gwenpool Strikes Back #1, the artist breaks convention by overlapping a text block across two panels, orphaning the stacked panel above it. Is the stacked panel important? Nah. The page reads fine without it. But, for clarity\u2019s sake, the \u201cMale sharks have to penises\u201d box could have been moved slightly to the left to prevent the overlap and eliminate any possible confusion.  Did I mention there was a lot going on? Gwenpool knows she\u2019s a comic book character. That knowledge allows the character to do things that few comic characters can do.  In the corner of this page, she literally peels the page back and asks a question to someone on another page.  Seen from another perspective, she\u2019s interacting with a past version of herself in service of the story. It\u2019s a fun mechanic to tell interesting stories, but it can seem intimidating at first. Here\u2019s a page from These Savage Shores #1 (Vault Comics, \u00a9 2018) that breaks convention, but still manages to be easy to follow:   The first three panels read left-to-right, but the top-right panel overlaps with the right-center panel below. The character in that panel, having just been set on fire, is running to the left. Sure enough, in the center panel, he goes crashing through a window, continuing on a leftward journey into the left-center panel, falling into the lower-left panel to continue the normal left-to-right order. Also note that the bottom six panels form a single image, broken up by white lines (or \u201cgutters\u201d). When taken together, the six panels indicate that everything is happening in one location, but the panel breakup indicates a sequential series of movements. And finally, a page that\u2019s not just super clear\u2026  With this, you just have to follow the contextual clues. My gut tells me that it should be read in a zig-zag fashion, like the example from These Savage Shores. But that would be wrong. Black-suited Spidey (who appears to be, in reality, Venom) gets hit by a blast in the left panel, causing him to rage in the right panel, and leading to Colossus punching him in the panel below. I get it. It\u2019s left-to-right all the way down, but the panel layout makes it seem like there should be something else going on. Comics do leave room for interpretation, and every page isn\u2019t going to be perfectly clear. When you find a page like that, sometimes the best you can do is shuffle everything around until it makes some sort of sense!  All images \u00a9 Marvel Comics except as noted ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re supposed to go left to right all the way down each page. You can also read in issues, volumes, or collections. There are issues that add up to volumes, and volumes that add up to a whole storyline that you can buy as soon as they release the collection. And, there are MANY collections to read. My favorite comics are still Deadpool and you can also look for the Civil War collection which, if you\u2019ve seen the movie, was WAY better and had a lot more fighting with a bigger cast of characters. There\u2019s also wild multiverse spin off comics that explore random events such as Deadpool killing the Marvel universe, or the X Men fighting the Avengers. ",
