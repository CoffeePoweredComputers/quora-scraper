            "answer_text": "My sincere apologies to the questioner as I might be seen as an arrogant answer who answers by posing multifarious convoluted but interwoven questions. And thus the readers are invited to exercise their best discretion but at the same time to tune in their cognitive abilities if at all they are very keen, as to knw the answer. Y do u think, since ages the mankind has always been bequeathed with writers & readers? Y do u think that the mankind treasures books? Y do u think that the mankind is so adamant to quench his thirst of knowing, learning, seeking? How do think the mankind is best represnted for all the times to come? Of what have u got to say, when i postulate that the *\u201dhouse of residence of humans (mankind4U) is the LANGUAGE\u201d* Y do u think the characteristc colours of human colonies drawn on the canvas of Culture is best aritculated in Languages that is so widely expressed in books which are so patiently and skillfully written by writers and read by the Readers who in the end engage with it so as 2make it their own book? Now, don't u think literary fest is a celebrated manifestation of all the above questions and if not it ought to be and it can be when they (literateurs) rightfully equip themselves with the rational as to define and effectively confront the violence and propaganda exhibited in Language. Esp like the likes of rajdeep who in the Economic Forum Summit contemplating on India's Tourism mislead the audience of investors with his corrupt degraded journalism (which still fails 2understand the efficacious realtion of ecology, biosphere, culture of a tourist spot and the impact of booming industrial tourism and the experience of enjoying the difficulties and harsh complexities of a tourist spot that truly dwells in the lap of natur of whose inaccessibility is deliberately maintained) GOES 2AN EXTENT 2TOUT ABOUT HIS BOOK IN amazon rather than doing 4what he is called? (In the 1st place he shouldn't even be called but what 2do the august audience of our nation giggles and claps 2the silly play of host karan johar and guest smriti irani 4THE STAGE OF ECONOMIC FORUM.

            "answer_text": "Literature festivals celebrate books and people who write them or read them. They have these panel discussions where you can ask questions to the panelists and get enlightened. I have attended the Jaipur Literature Festival quite a few times when I was there. It was my happy place. I would recommend books to someone who was looking in doubt at a book or someone else would walk up to me and suggest a book. I would love to go again sometime soon. ",
