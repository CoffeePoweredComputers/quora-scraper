            "answer_text": "Spivak Calculus is not an easy book. If you are working through many/most/all of the problems as you should, it can easily take a year. I\u2019d say 8 months is a good goal, as it\u2019s the usually the goal of two semester course sequences that use the text, but they also tend to skip or skim some chapters, to you might have to work faster or do the same. As far as pre-requisites go, you should be strong in elementary algebra. If you got A\u2019s in high school or college algebra 1 and 2, you should be fine to pick up this text if you\u2019re motivated. It will be tough, but because of a lack of mathematical maturity more than lack of background knowledge. Trigonometric functions are defined well in the book, but it would probably be helpful (both for this book and otherwise) to learn about them in a trigonometry course since it will give you more practice with their use and more time to understand intuitively what they\u2019re for. I don\u2019t have any particular book recommendations for elementary texts, I think they all do a fine job. You could learn calculus from another text before approaching this text. I wouldn\u2019t really recommend it unless you\u2019ve already learned calculus before discovering this book, and you really want to go through it. If this is the case, you will have a much easier time with the book since it will mostly be review, but don\u2019t get too cocky. There is a lot to learn from this book even after passing the standard calculus sequence, make sure you find those things and learn and practice them. Parts I, II, and V are all necessary, but III and IV can be picked apart a bit (but after the first two parts, you may not want to). If you want to go faster through the book, you just need to spend more time on it. You could probably work through it in a summer if you\u2019re doing it full-time, but if you\u2019re spending around 10 hours a week on it, I wouldn\u2019t expect to do better than 8 months. The caveat is that the faster you work through a book, the more problems you should do. When you work slower, you have more time to absorb everything just from reading and reading, and thinking about it consciously and subconsciously throughout the in-between time. Working quicker means you need to force that information to stick, which means engaging more senses by thinking through and writing out solutions to as many problems as possible. If you learn it too quickly and don\u2019t follow up with learning something that uses that knowledge as a pre-requisite, you\u2019re much more likely to forget a good amount. In that case, or any other case where you\u2019re interested in continuing on after this text, I highly recommend Spivak\u2019s Calculus on Manifolds. It sounds tough, but it\u2019s a perfect follow-up to this text and one of my personal favorites of all time. Only thing is, you should do a quick review or crash course of matrix and vector algebra since it expects that knowledge from you but doesn\u2019t present it (well) itself. ",
