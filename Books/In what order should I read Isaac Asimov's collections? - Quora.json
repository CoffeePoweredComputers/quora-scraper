            "answer_text": "When I was in 7th grade, my dad gave me a copy of Foundation for Christmas. That\u2019s where I started. I read the Foundation series and loved it. Then I went on to read the rest. So even though the Foundation books take place way after everything else, it turned out it wasn\u2019t a terrible place to start. However, I realized there was much more depth to the universe after I read his many other works. So if I had it to do over again, I think I would start with the robot novels. They take place chronologically much sooner, and they were also closer to the beginning of his career. It will allow the universe to unfold before you more in the way that he originally intended. The Empire novels take place next, and then the Foundation novels. That\u2019s the order I would read them in if I were to go back. I have one warning, though. The Empire novels were my least favorite, so if you don\u2019t like them, don\u2019t let them keep you from Foundation, which is fantastic. The other works, such as his mysteries, his fantasies, his stand alone novels or anything else take place outside of his shared universe, so it doesn\u2019t matter when you read them. Read them in the order of how excited you are to pick them up. ",
