            "answer_text": "If by publishing you mean creating a book, it is easier today than it has ever been, whence the flood of self-published books. Putting ink on paper is extremely easy and inexpensive. If by publishing you mean attracting the attention of and investment by a major publishing house, it is more difficult. Book reading is declining, especially among younger potential readers who acquire most of their wisdom and knowledge from small digital screens, who like everything to be condensed into brief messages and who have not acquired the attention span necessary in reading books. At the same time, the major publishers, who must earn profits to survive, have come to bet on certainties: celebrity books from \u2018names,\u2019 books from authors they are already publishing, books about \u2018hot\u2019 current events (what\u2019s going on in the White House), scandal books (e.g. Theranos), sex books (\u201cFifty Shades of Dreck\u201d), crime books (Grisham), horror books (King), explosive books by a young female author who has survived \u2014\u2014\u2014-, doomsday books (climate). The list of top-level popular book genres is short and predictable. So, it\u2019s easier, and yet it is much more difficult for an aspiring author to attract the elements that will make his or her book a success. Does that answer your question? I hope so. Books are an endless source of knowledge and wisdom. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s easier than ever before. The technology is all around us, What remains difficult is the planning, the writing, and the preparation. The commercial publishers, to generalise a bit, are focused on profitability and the quality standards remain reasonably high. Self publishing has seen a drop in quality standards simply because it\u2019s so accessible to a great many. But the self publishing revolution has also given opportunities to writers who might otherwise have remained silent. So publishing is quite a brew at the moment. There are big changes afoot. But what\u2019s certain is that the genuine voices - and literature itself - will find a way through. Talk to us at Porcupine Press. ",
