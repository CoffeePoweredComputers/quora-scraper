            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never taken an IQ test, but I\u2019ve been professionally evaluated and tested in various cognitive/reasoning abilities. That testing included various professionals\u2019 estimates of my IQ based on my scores and I was told that it\u2019s probably around 140 (lowest was 133, highest was 152, most were in the 138\u2013144 arena). So, hopefully that counts. I basically perform two types of reading: Investigative Scouring: This is what I do when I find something interesting or the text requires my full attention.Two steps forward, one step backwards. It\u2019s like overlapping brush strokes in order to ensure that the canvas is completely covered in paint.Each sentence is read, then re-read and usually read again. It\u2019s almost a tactile experience; as if my mind were lifting and discarding any obstacles or blocks between myself and full comprehension of a text.I look for patterns of all kinds (and deviations from them): behavioral repetitions; maybe repetitive choices in diction; over or under-representation of certain letters and sounds (i.e. does the author dislike cacophony, specifically the \u201ck\u201d sound?).Authors often will also unintentionally leave subconscious residue on the page; personal views, biases, personality traits, intentions, (oftentimes) quite intimate or personal information about past and current life experiences can be deduced, etc\u2026 I enjoy postulating a mold of the author\u2019s psychological profile quite a bit.Also, I dissect the work in terms of its current and projected cultural significance. So, things that are incredibly \u201cera-specific\u201d may make the book a clunker for now, but in thirty years it could be heralded as the most accurate representation of 2014 ever. You never know.In processing a text as a work of art, a personal artifact of the author\u2019s, and as a cultural artifact, I formulate a much more comprehensive understanding of the text itself, but I also formulate a psychological model of the text\u2019s creator and an understanding of problems/norms that exist within the author\u2019s culture.Contextual Association: This is what I do to see if I\u2019ll find the text interesting; when I don\u2019t have time to give a text my full attention; when I don\u2019t find the text interesting and/or just need to write an essay or something with the text as a source.I usually read any \u201cthesis statement\u201d and \u201cconclusion\u201d type material first. That way I know the jest of the entire text\u2019s subject matter, specific keywords to look for, and also how the original \u201cthesis\u201d changed from beginning to end. I do this on a surface-level scale (literal thesis and conclusion, first chapter and last chapter, etc\u2026). Then, I do it on a slightly more comprehensive scale (first and last page of a chapter, first and last few paragraphs of each section, etc\u2026).For non-thesis/conclusion material, I initially spend about 30 seconds on each page, jumping from top to bottom to middle to bottom to top, in no particular order, to absorb the general, overarching \u201cnarrative\u201d of the page through context clues. If nothing jumps out at me, I use those context clues to piece together a general outline of what I just \u201cread.\u201dIf I find a keyword, I will finish my ~30 second overview for contextual information and if need be, return to that keyword. I\u2019ll skim the paragraph before the keyword and after the keyword for context clues. Then, I\u2019ll read the keyword\u2019s paragraph very closely. If necessary, I\u2019ll expand my radius of \u201cactive reading\u201d out in both directions until I have the information I need. Sometimes, I\u2019ll read the whole page, several pages, a chapter, etc\u2026I generally follow this formula until the text is completed, or I have procured all necessary information required in order for me to move on.So, yeah. That\u2019s what I do. It\u2019s also worth noting that I\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, so I pretty much operate at two levels: hyperfocus and inattention. I\u2019ve found my little speed-reading formula to be quite helpful. Don\u2019t know if it would help others, but it helps me. Where I used to fully read texts which were of no interest (and thus no consequence) to me, I didn\u2019t really retain the information. I\u2019d get done with a chapter and think, \u201cwhat did I even read?\u201d Usually I\u2019d been daydreaming about something else entirely, but sometimes simply scouring the text for proof of its futility. So, I was focusing solely on grammatical mistakes, poor narrative devices, leaps in logic, biases that I disagreed with, etc\u2026 Since I only focus on that which retains my interest and as I subconsciously viewed the text negatively, I only found its negative components to be interesting. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019d focus on. With the contextual association thing, I am able to make a game of sorts from the formula. So, I find it interesting. So, I get to hyperfocus on \u201cthe game\u201d of finding relevant information and piecing together an entire text through context clues, without developing a negative bias toward the text. By the end, I come away having learned or retained significantly more than had I drug my attention, kicking and screaming and leaving long claw marks in the floor, through each and every word. ",

            "answer_text": "My grandmother was the only ancestor I aware of having extremly high IQ. Although she never attended any IQ test moreso she had only 4 year basic school degree (she had to start to work when she was only 10 years old!) but she was the most brilliant person I ever know. Okay I have to write a few words about myself to put my story in a perspective. It is not for some bragging, but I think it is necessary. I made IQ tests in my 20s at the range 150+ (closer to the 160ish range). I won several math and physics competitions, have a few inventions too (for example the most interesting ones: I was 13 - and it was 31 years ago - when I designed a 3d television, I was only 7 when I designed a working electric engine (a lame one but working), at my 15\u201316 I made an adjustable obscureness sunglasses for myself just for fun, I designed at 16 a new type internal combustion engine (based on a roots blower, which seemed promising but it was suck eventually) and a new and working syncron electric engine that has about the same size but 2 times the power output the \u201cnormal one\u201d, and my \u201celectric engines\u201d teacher kicked me from the class because I successfully proved that is working engine and he gave me an \u201cA\u201d without attending any more classes and tests. At one my first jobs - after falling out the school system - I was a simple maintenance guy at a Philips factory. A few months later I had allowance to come to work and leave whenever I want, do whatever I like, just having one task: if I have any idea about anything, share with the team I worked with.) Had several other things to tell but I think that is enough to get my point) So the one and only people that I know personally and clearly having superior intellectual skills comparing myself is my grandmom. When I was a newborn my mom had no place to go, so my grandmom took us to her small house and she raised me as if I was her son. I always call her \u201cMom\u201d. When I was in doubt she was the first I asked and she always had a good point or at least some warm encouragement. She always readed a lot. Books, magazines, everything that contains letters was around in her house, it was enough for a smaller library. Too bad, I lost her early so the only thing I know about the topic she loved to read. Let\u2019s jump to my father (son of the my mentioned grandmom) He is bright too. Without finishing his \u201cmiddle school\u201d - having high school graduation he made his way to a law university where he became a lawyer. (he is at 140ish range on IQ tests, and he has several inventions too) He reads more books at same time just as me and as my grandmom. We both reads over 3 hundred pages in an hour comfortably. (My fastest reading test was at my highschool graduation where my test was to analyze a book I should had but actually I had never read before - but it was on the self with the books we can used for the preparation. I had only 20 minutes preparation time (the book was the \u201cFekete gy\u00e9m\u00e1ntok\u201d (\u201cBlack diamonds\u201d) from J\u00f3kai M\u00f3r. It has 683 pages and I finished in 20 minutes and get an presidental laudation on my exam. My teachers never believed me I have finished the book on my way to the board of examination. I had a headache after\u2026 My father reads about at the same speed as me (a little bit slower but he has way better memory comparing to me so he remembers way more thing from a book) He does about 200\u2013250 pages in one hour (hard text - law books, etc, as I mentioned when reading novels he comfortably can do over 300 pages in an hour). My limitation is in reading is my short term memory: I am unable to process longer texts at the fastest speed I can read (novels and literatures doesn\u2019t matter, thats why I was able to finish \u201cBlack diamonds\u201d in 20 minutes). But the most important thing is: we both love to read. We do it at about every day if we have time, 2 books in a day is average one, but unfortunately I have read-time nowadays just before I fall to sleep so I finish a book in two days. I have a plan though about circumnavigating the world on a sailboat with a huge amount of book on my computer (and my wife and kids). Maybe I never do it but I think it is still a good plan. ",
