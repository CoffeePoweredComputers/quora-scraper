            "answer_text": "Modeling in 3D is actually something that is learned nearly as easily by yourself as with an instructor.  The reason for this is that the concepts are fairly quick to learn, but getting good at it is all about getting a ton of practice. First of all, choose a good software to learn on that has all the features you will need in the future.  I don't recommend using simple, low-feature tools like Sketchup because you will quickly outgrow them and start over learning a new software.  If you want to create accurate 3D models for engineering, inventing, or high-accuracy simulations, try Inventor, Solidworks, Autocad, or Catia.  However, if you want to make models for movies, video games, and special effects, then choose 3DS Max, Maya, Modo, Cinema 4D, Blender, Rhino, or Lightwave.  These are complete packages that can do almost everything. After you have chosen a software, completely dedicate yourself to that software.  Don't jump around wasting time trying all the different software packages, just dedicate your time and energy to mastering your software of choice.  It will take months or years to become fully trained in even one of the above listed software packages because they have so many powerful features and capabilities. Whatever software you choose will likely have several tutorials and guides available free.  You can also buy books, but I find it hard to learning modeling from a book.  Tutorials on YouTube may be helpful.  For more professional tutorials and complete courses online, check out CGCookie (best), Digital Tutors (great), Lynda (usually good), or Udemy (sometimes good.). Video instruction is going to be a huge help as you get started, and will probably be much better than a book. With all that in mind, the final piece is just practice. 3D modeling is an art form akin to playing a musical instrument.  The only way to get good at it is to spend a lot of time practicing it. ",

            "answer_text": "3D modeling is a vast area which can be broken down or contextualized in a variety of ways. Depending on the approach taken, the visual complexity (and pre-production workflows) can be very large indeed (proprietary alternative and virtual reality), or relatively quick and simple (Web3D using declarative, html-like languages). With more or less everything migrating to the web, it makes sense to expose yourself to the latter first. This will give you a feeling for the medium without all too much overhead, but may also open a fast-track door to paid work. Here a little (musical) context. It shows some of the technologies in use for web variants of 3D. This is taken from my music visualization blog. (Ignore the 2D blocks on the left of the diagram, which are currently partly erroneous anyway. I\u2019ll update the image if I find time).  Here we see two broad approaches: the browser DOM-based approach (literal or structural) and the WebGL-based approach (figurative, drama and gaming-based). Broadly speaking, things get more complex (and the workflows more demanding) as we move from left to right. If we focus on the web-based technologies and \u2018zoom in\u2019 a little, we get the following.  This already gives you some background on learning contexts. Most of these areas are already well documented online. You can see one of those \u2018heavy-duty pre-production environments\u2019 on the very RHS (here Unity), exporting graphics objects into Three.js-based WebVR contexts. These are the environments focussed on by other answers to this question. There are many analogues. There is a diagram with yet more detail on my blog, but at this stage it will probably only confuse you. Artificial intelligence is a bit of a bull in every china shop at the moment, so it\u2019s probably wise to keep an eye it\u2019s movements as you learn. Have fun. ",
