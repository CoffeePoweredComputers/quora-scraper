            "answer_text": "The first three books should be read in the order of publication:  Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation. The remaining books should not be read at all.  The transition between the two generations is instantly obvious:  the later books lack the sociological backbone (however improbable) that made the earlier trilogy coherent and, in its own way, grand.  Instead they have the heroes one would expect in a Young Adult novel, and plots that are about the heroes rather than about the society.   The lack of intellectual content also highlights Asimov's somewhat stiff prose.  So the books are not only dumb and condescending, but objectively poorly written. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. Of the Tolkien novels, I did read THE TWO TOWERS before FELLOWSHIP. But in the case of Asimov, I read the FOUNDATION books in order, then the Elijah Bailey novels and I, Robot. But I went on to read obscure titles few today have heard of like PEBBLE IN THE SKY, THE CURRENTS OF SPACE and THE STARS, LIKE DUST. In fact, all were rich in my thoughts when I was asked to write the final followup novel, FOUNDATION\u2019S TRIUMPH, tying together all the loose threads from all those novels, even the obscure ones.
