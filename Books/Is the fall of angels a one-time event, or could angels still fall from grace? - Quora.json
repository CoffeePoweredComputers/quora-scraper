            "answer_text": "My opinion is it was a two-time event - those who fell with Lucifer and were cast down to earth from the heavenly war as written in Revelations 12: 7\u20139 and those that left Heaven on their own accord in Jude 1:6 and 2nd Peter 2:4. They were supposed to be Watchers of mankind and instead mingled with mankind as written of in The Book of Enoch and mentioned in Genesis 6 -Before the Flood of Noah. After witnessing what has, is, will happen that mistake who will not happen again. As it is written the Lake of Fire was created for the angels and the Angels don't want to go there. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear,: Still. Fall, Angels and mankind are both created beings. However the relationship is entirely different when they relate to the greater. It may very well be that the subject of grace may well not be implied in regard to angels. Angels once fallen do not seem to have the aspect of grace to be back in Holy standing with God. The separation of God's angels of fallen and not fallen seem to be a one time event. ",
