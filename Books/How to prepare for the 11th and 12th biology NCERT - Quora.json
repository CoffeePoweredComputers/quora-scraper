            "answer_text": "Start making notes of the chapter which have high portion of learning.. And make tree charts of those chapter which are more application based\u2026i know its sounds not productive to you but really making notes of biology helps u alot and u will score more than 320+ \u2026. The reason behind is that most of the part of bio is of learning if u have notes then in very less time u can revise many chapter.. So its my request to all of u that start making notes of learning chapter like animal kingdom, morphology part, diversity part, ecology\u2026bcoz they need a consistent revision otherwise u will forget them very easily\u2026.one more thing try to compress your notes as much as possible.. \ud83d\udc4d ",
