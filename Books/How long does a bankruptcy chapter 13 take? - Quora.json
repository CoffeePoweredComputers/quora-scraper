            "answer_text": "That depends. Filing bankruptcy requires planning. It may take you a while to gather all the information your attorney needs to file your case. In some cases, you may need to delay filing in order to take advantage of bankruptcy laws that affect how certain secured debts or tax debts are treated. When you do file, you must submit a plan to the court that details how you will pay your creditors. You must make monthly payments for not longer than 60 months. Depending on your income, you may qualify for a 36 month plan, but if you owe arrearages on a secured loan, you might want to pay over 60 months anyway. ",
