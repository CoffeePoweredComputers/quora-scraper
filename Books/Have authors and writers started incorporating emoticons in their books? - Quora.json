It\u2019s amateurish, lazy, sloppy, they get in the reader\u2019s way, they will annoy that reader, and I would never read a book that had emoticons in it. Never. If a writer cannot show their characters\u2019 emotions without resorting to icons and smilies, then they shouldn\u2019t be publishing anything at all, because they don\u2019t know the first thing about writing. If I saw a book with emoticons in it, I\u2019d trash it, look at the writer, and tell them to do some research on how to write a book. I don\u2019t say that to be overly mean, even though it sounds like it, but that is how big of a mistake it would be to put emoticons in a book meant for publication. Just don\u2019t do it. ",
