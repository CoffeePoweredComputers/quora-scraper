But you can just start reading and next thing you know you are cleared of the basics. This book is tricky and tests a student's patience and aproach in understanding. You won't believe but ncert books for physics are written with collaboration of so many intelligent minds. One of them is my mentor. Basically ncert is base for both neet and jee. That's why always ncert are emphasized for reading. Physics if you can solve interactive questions then you will surely enjoy the physics book. ",
