            "answer_text": "I am currently using Hathway for the internet connection at home in Bangalore. I bought this connection about three months ago, and I paid approximately INR 2600 for a 100Mbps plan and a data usage limit of 1000GB. I\u2019ve had several issues with them. They gave me a single band router capable of 100Mbps which was good enough for my connection. Later, I upgraded to a 150Mbps plan with a 1000GB data cap and they refused to upgrade my router to handle the higher speeds. All the Ethernet ports on the router provided by them are limited to 100Mbps which does not even allow me to connect to another router capable of higher speeds. I have spoken to them several times before and they haven\u2019t been able to help me with my issue. I had even paid an additional amount for a static IP which was assigned to me but I could never use because I could not port forward on their router. The Hathway representatives in most cases did not understand my problem and decided to transfer my call to a supervisor, who also could not be of any help and said she will transfer me to a manager. The manager was also of no help and told me to send an email to them and hung up. I am not satisfied with my internet connection with Hathway as they are not willing to help me with my issue nor are they willing to refund the amount that was charged. I have never honestly faced such horrible customer service with any other ISP. When I told them that I would like a refund they told me that they could terminate my account even with three months left but they will not refund. I was trying to host a simple website at home and was also trying to create a NAS Server at home that I wanted to access from outside my network. I didn\u2019t even have the option to remove the static IP from my account after my plan expired. I would highly recommend you do not opt for Hathway as your ISP and I feel you might face several issues with them. I still recieve calls from different hathway agents on a daily bases after submitting my information on Hathway\u2019s website for a new connection. They send me several messages a day and call me repeatedly asking me if I want a new Hathway connection. As of writing this message, my Hathway account is still active and I am still trying to claim a refund for a static IP that I can\u2019t use and the speed that I was promised and never got. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been using Hathway for almost 1 year 6 months now. I requested the connection in the morning and it was installed and working in the evening. I stay in BTM 2nd stage and there service here is really fast. I opted for 150mbps plan with an FUP of 1200GB and post FUB 10mbps, Costs Rs-1195 per month.After the installation of the wifi connection i was getting about 40mbps on my mobile and 60mbps on the laptop only if i am standing right next to the router.The moment i enter my room, speed drops to around 15\u201320mbps.I was constantly facing issues with connection drop and data speed being really inconsistent.I Raised a million requests and every time they applied some useless new settings where the wifi continues to be worse.The Hathway guys also upgraded the so called \u201cRouter\u201d but nothing changed.After 6 months of constant struggle i decided to use my personal router and see if it makes any sort of difference to the connection quality.I switched to a d-link Dual Band router and bam the connection quality improved by 10 folds, No connection or speed drops. Now i am getting 150+ mbps both on laptop and mobile in all the rooms throughout the house.The main reason why the Hathway sucks is the free router they provide with it. It is a really poor quality router.Important tips to follow: It is really important to use a Dual Band router with this connection to use its full 150mbps speeds on all types of devices and connect to 5GHz wifi frequency if your device supports it.Whenever you face any issues with Hathway connection, never directly call them. Install the Hathway mobile app and raise a ticket on the app, they will always respond within 24 hours without fail.I hope the above points help you guys and if you do follow the above tips, there is no competition against Hathway in terms of value for money with this kind of data speeds at reasonable prices.
