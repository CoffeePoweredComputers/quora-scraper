            "answer_text": "I would go ahead and beging with Fooled by Randomness. It is a fun book to read and because it is the first of the 5 book Inserto, and you will find a Nassim Taleb which is pre-fame. The Inserto is basically a long essay which Taleb broke down into several books. You could argue that its the work of more than two decades condensed. You will find that the same topics are repeated along them. Before writing the Black Swan (the least interesting in my opinion), he was struggling to publish his ideas. FBR is a very unusual book that deals with several topics including risk, probability, finance, comedy and of course the idea that randomness has a much bigger role in daily life than humans assume.  Incerto by Nassim Taleb. FBR has a lot\u2019s of take away lessons and several -in my opinion- \u201cAha!\u201d moments. One of the most interesting topics discussed is the \u201cSurvivorship Bias\u201d. It also makes reading entertaining by introducing characters that are very different to each other and that help to make up a point. These are: Nero Tulip, Carlos, (The emerging market trader) Jean Patrice and many more. These characters show how the decision making process affects their careers and thus their lives. The style is close to that of author Tomas Wolf (Bonfire of Vanities). The book makes fun of other misleading recipe books such as The Millionaire Next Door. It clearly describes how humans are biased to see only those who win but not all the others that lose. It warns about thinking that people that are successful in life, have \u201ctraits\u201d that can be copied and so one can become successful too. Probability and Statistics are made something fun and interesting. The Ponzi scheme is well explained and also how people are deceived to think that past information is important to make a decision for their future. Anti Fragile and Skin in the Game are heavy contenders. But I would leave them for later. AF is a must read, but I would advise FBR first just to get familiar with Nassim\u2019s Taleb style. Finally, The Bed of Procrustes, is very good to read, to enjoy simple but almost golden rules of what Taleb is about. Enjoy. Fernando ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Disclaimer: I personally haven't read any of his books so far, so I thank you for introducing to me to this author. Regarding the reading, I would start by first going through the Incerto set which consists of 4 volumes. Chronologically they are as follows:(copied from wikipedia).  Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets. New York: Random House and Penguin. 2001. ISBN 0-8129-7521-9. The book was completed in 2005 with the updated second edition.The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable. New York: Random House and Penguin. 2007. ISBN 978-1-4000-6351-2. The book was completed in 2010 with the second edition including a long essay \"On Robustness and Fragility\".The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms. New York: Random House. 2010. ISBN 978-1-4000-6997-2.Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder. New York: Random House. 2012. ISBN 978-1-4000-6782-4.From what I have seen, the most critically accalaimed of these so far has been The Black Swan, but all books are worthy of reading. As far as I know they are not a chronological progress but rather deal with different aspects of uncertainty. So you can go by publication order which would be Fooled by randomness first or by best selling which would be The Black Swan. Again, As i have not read them yet I am not well qualified to answer this, but now that I know, I personally would go by the publication order. ",
