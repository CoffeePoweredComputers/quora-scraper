            "answer_text": "Yes. In the following sense. If, in a defined system (call it system A), this system A operates; and then, after it has operated (however that is defined), the input/output of entropy and work is examined. The net entropy change of system A, can be negative. If, (and only if), work, is done on the system at least equivalent, the negative change in the entropy of system A. But, if however, you draw the controlled mensuration boundary around system A, to surround and incorporate the space of the source of the work done on system A. you will observe and measure that the net change on that space\u2019s entropy will be found to be positive. That is, in doing the work on system A, to achieve the operation of System A, such that, the entropy of A in its operation is negative. Then the entropy of the space control volume around the boundary of where the work upon system A was done (to achieve the negative entropy of system A) will; upon analysis, be shown to not possibly have, anything other than an increase, in its net entropy. And as a system if that system which has had an increase in its entropy; it will also be shown that the boundary of that system will be the universe. And not any other intervening, process or system.

Either the macroscopic state is not possible (\u03a9=0)(\u03a9=0), in which case the entropy is undefined, or there is at least one possible quantum state consistent with the macroscopic state (\u03a9\u22651)(\u03a9\u22651), in which case the entropy is zero or greater (S\u22650)(S\u22650).

            "answer_text": "Yes it can be. Any process in which the randomness of the final state is less than the randomness of the initial state will result in a lowering of entropy. A few examples are, adsorption of gasses or aqueous ions on a solid, combination reaction like formation of NaCl from sodium and chloride ions, and also crystallization, etc\u2026 Since entropy change is negative, according to the equation, \u2206G= \u2206H - T\u2206S The spontaneity of the reaction will reduce. Because \u2206G will be less negative. But if the enthalpy change, \u2206H is more negative compared to the magnitude of entropy change then the reaction still remains spontaneous. ",

If you have a heat rejection happening at some temperature, dQ = -ve, so ds = -dQ/T = -ve Let me remind you entropy Change being negative is applicable only for a process. In case of a cycle it can be zero or +ve. I suggest you read about 2nd law and Clausius inequality to understand entropy. ",
