            "answer_text": "Brilliant: Here is my review: \u201d I am haunted by humans\u201d.        The ending of the The Book Thief is as true and impacting as it can be.The Book Thief is a true masterpiece of a work by Markus  Zusak, a work in which Death has a story to tell. And what a touching  story he has and how beautifully he narrates it.   No, don\u2019t infer that  the book is about death and horror.  It is much more than that, it has a  beautiful story, woven around a girl and an equally good narration in  the backdrop of Hitler\u2019s Germany.The Story and the Scope: Set in the reign of Hitler,  in a town of Germany, the story is about a girl, Leisel, her family and  friend. The story is about the harsh realities, about the parental  love, about the friendship, about the selflessness and selfishness,  about the rich and the poor, about the war and yes it is about the death  too.  Full marks to the author for brilliantly depicting the  relationships, especially for the adorable depiction of Leisel\u2019s cordial  relationship with her father, I almost felt like it is the depiction of  the my relationship with my daughter.  The condition of the Jews and  the treatment met to them under the Hitler\u2019s regime is also profoundly  presented.The Presentation and Organization: Wow!!  Delightful!! Unique!! The presentation is simply superlative. With death  as the narrator, the tone of the story changes multiple shades \u2013 with  death being incisive at times, humorous at some places and sarcastic at  some other times. Very peculiar to this book, the author presents the  by-product thoughts (if that is the term I can use for all the secondary  thoughts which flow in mind while focus is on primary thoughts) in the  form of intervention notes, right in the middle of the page and these  notes actually add lot of value to the story.  The book is organized  into 10 chapters with several  small sub chapters under each.  Such kind  of organization tempts reader in to reading those extra few chapters  which usually would be postponed to the next seating.The Flow of plot: On this front too, Zusak is  brilliant. No amount of organized approach would help if the plot does  not evolve smoothly.  At know point in time, author has lost the grip on  the plot.  The flashbacks and the flash-forwards (Oh, this is another  unique attribute, the author has flash-forwarded the story on few  occasions and reveled the secrets when least expected, and then he  merrily returns the story to its present) never looks out of story and  are well timed.The Characters: As a reader, I found it very easy to  connect with the characters as most of them are real. Apart from the  narrator and Leisel, there are several interesting characters.  There is  Leisel\u2019s friend Rudy, who thinks himself to be Jesse Owen, has habit of  poking nose in others affairs and ending up in trouble. Leisel\u2019s mother  is temperamental, practical and has habit of using slang as every other  word. Leisel\u2019s father is a simple man who plays an amateur accordion  and for Leisel there is no one who can play the accordion better than  him.  There is Jewish fist fighter, Max, who gets shelter in the house  of Leisel and with whom Leisel develops and indescribable attachment.   Of course,  through Max, the author despises everything for which Hitler  stands for, and he is quite successful in evoking hatred towards  Hitler.The Language: The language used is such that the  tones adopted by the narrator hits like an arrow.   The author is at his  best when he writes about Hitler and when he describes the Death\u2019s  point of view about his job.  The realities of day to day life are also  crisply described.This is how narrator flash-forwards the story:  \u201cOf course, I\u2019m  being rude. I\u2019m spoiling the ending, not only of the entire book, but of  this particular piece of it. I have given you two events in advance,  because I don\u2019t have much interest in building mystery. Mystery bores  me. It chores me. I know what happens and so do you. It\u2019s the  machinations that wheel us there that aggravate, perplex, interest, and  astound me. There are many things to think of. There is much story.\u201dSome crisp statements:\u201cI have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\u201d\u201cLike most misery, it started with apparent happiness. \u201c\u201cImagine smiling after a slap in the face. Then think of doing it twenty-four hours a day.\u201d\u201cA small fact:You are going to die\u2026.does this worry you?\u201d\u201cI guess humans like to watch a little destruction. Sand castles,  houses of cards, that\u2019s where they begin. Their great skills is their  capacity to escalate.And Death\u2019s statement on his job:\u201cI wanted to tell the book thief many things,  about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those  things that she didn\u2019t already know? I wanted to explain that I am  constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race-that rarely  do I ever simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing  could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning  and brilliant.\u201d\u201cShe leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Leisel  kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He  tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees  and in the glow of the anarchist\u2019s suit collection. She kissed him long  and soft, and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with  her fingers\u2026She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few  more minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground.  It amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down  their faces and they stagger on\u2026\u201d\u201cHis soul sat up. It met me. Those kinds of souls always do \u2013 the  best ones. The ones who rise up and say \u201cI know who you are and I am  ready. Not that I want to go, of course, but I will come.\u201d Those souls  are always light because more of them have been put out. More of them  have already found their way to other places.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Review: Well, it is a long read. Nearly six hundred pages. But I\u2019d say they are worth the effort, and time. In 33, Himmel Street,in Germany, during the winter of 1939, a nine year old girl comes to stay with her foster parents. On her way here, a part of her world has already collapsed. On Himmel Street, well, she builds another. This is a story set in the Nazi Germany, in the years 1939\u201342, and is narrated by death. Yes, you read that right. \u2018And when death tells a story, you really have to listen\u2019. Death turns out to be an interesting narrator, sprinkling the story with its own sense of humor, philosophy, and its observation of the human race. As it works tirelessly day and night, it observes the colors of the sky, and the humans it has left behind. And from such observations, comes the story. The writing style is unique, as the narrator keeps moving forward and backward in time, and gives hints of what to expect in the later parts of the book. The author puts words to brilliant use, and creates pictures so real, one can almost feel them. An excerpt: \u201cOther Jews walked past, all of them watching this small futile miracle. They streamed by, like human water. That day, a few would reach the ocean. They would be handed a white cap.\u201d In war based stories, though the tragic end is predictable, in this one, it is worth the journey to the end.The end may remind one of the movie \u2018Titanic\u2019, though the two stories have very little in common. Overall, the story is engaging, and does have the power to leave one in tears. As it ends, one can feel the aftermaths of war very closely. And Liesel Meminger, for sure, stays etched in the mind of the reader. Stars:8.5/10  ",
