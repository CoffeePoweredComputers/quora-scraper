            "answer_text": "Zero to 21326 Words In 31 Days \u2013 Create a Writing Habit So I decided to incorporate a daily writing habit into my life which involved me writing at least 500 words a day, every day\u2026yes, every day! On top of work and family life why not add something else to the mix? If I wanted to achieve even some moderate success as a writer on the Amazon Kindle Publishing platform I would need to create a daily writing ritual. I always tried to write as often as possible but I never really had a schedule of sorts, it just involved me hitting my keyboard as often as possible., sometimes hard if I was frustrated, and I would finish when my eyes and brain hurt, not the best way to do something that was supposed to be fun. My eyes and brain really did hurt sometimes. This so called \u201croutine\u201d would often leave me feeling frustrated during the week for not getting enough content put together and then annoyed on a weekend for missing days during the week and having to spend even more of my free time crammed over my computer at the weekends trying to fit in monster writing sessions of 4000 words plus just to make up for what I had missed during the week. This was not the kind of writing lifestyle I was looking to build for myself. It was not a good routine. After one weekend of realising that I had interacted more with my computer than my family, (no, not that type of interaction) I decided that I needed to change my routine so it would be fun to write again and to ensure that I put less pressure on myself. I have always put pressure on myself, I have no idea why, for some reason I just want everything to be done in an instant, I can\u2019t seem to wait, I needed to learn to be more patient with my writing and therefore get back to enjoying it and taking the pressure of myself. I needed to relax\u2026 So I decided to come up with a plan to introduce a daily writing habit into my life, it seemed like a daunting task when I thought about it more, it was a big commitment to ensure that I wrote every day, but if I wanted to change my life for the better then I need to implement a new schedule with a new habit. I choose 500 words, basically this would pretty much equate to at least 1 book per month or thereabouts, if I could contribute that amount of words on a daily basis I should have added a healthy amount of work to my eBook catalogue by the end of the year. The best way to sell your current eBook is write another eBook. 500 words per day did seem daunting, I needed to work out a way to trick my mind that is was in fact an easy task, could I convince my brain of this? I am actually at one with myself\u2026this is getting weird\u2026they say that the first sign of madness is talking to yourself , how could I get myself that to believe that writing 500 words a day was not a difficult task? I decide to time myself. This would be technique number one. The result was that it took me just 30 minutes to actually write 500 words. Not bad at all. Just 30 minutes\u2026why did I not try this before? What is wrong with me! This was now a perfect fit for me, being able to dedicate just 30 minutes a day to fulfil my writing habit seemed much more appealing now knowing the block of time that I needed to set aside was fairly small, I could even break up the 30 minute session into two separate 15 minutes if I was tight on time, perhaps one session in the morning and one in the evening. Technique number two was to track my progress, after checking through apps available on the Google Play store I decided to use the app from www.coach.me , this way I could log in and declare my word count every day, this would give me another sense of commitment to completing my habit every day, I now felt responsible for checking in every day after I had completed my writing session, seeing the green tick that the app gives you after checking in felt like closure to the habit for the day without applying any further pressure to myself, green tick equalled done for the day, forget it all now and start again tomorrow.  The result of implementing that new writing habit into my daily routine? I went from zero to 21326 words in just 31 days! On most days I easily exceed my minimum word count, it was no longer a chore to type, I was enjoying it again more and more, I even had to stop myself from typing some days, once I hit the 30 minute mark I forced myself to stop except on a few occasions where I was in the \u201cgroove\u201d, yeah groovy baby! , I then let myself carry on long enough to finish off a particular page or chapter, once you are in full flow you should not deny yourself the privilege of typing away every now again, your work deserves it and your brain will thank you for unleashing the words down through your fingers and into your keyboard. So what did I learn from creating my new habit and making it stick? *Working out how long it will take you complete your habit task will make it much easier for you to start it and stick with it going forward in the future. *Your habit needs it have an end goal, from walking every day to keeping fit to eating healthier to having a better diet to lose weight, you need to have an end goal to seek and pursue a sense of achievement. *Setting aside a small amount of time everyday to perform your habit is much more productive long term instead of cramming in as much as possible over a few days, this stops the habit becoming a chore and lets you enjoy it. *You need to fell accountable for your own actions, this is were an app like Coach.me comes in really handy, by checking in everyday to register your progress you can easily keep your track of what you have done and for the number of days you have done it for, you then tend to feel responsible for your progress, you will want to check in every day and not let your self down. As my results have now been proven to be successful, I will shift from writing towards an eBook everyday to incorporating some of my writing into a blog, perhaps once or twice a week, both will help me with building my author platform going forward which is my ultimate goal towards creating a better life for myself. If I can make this writing habit stick what else can I do to keep improving? Anything seems possible. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on you. I read somewhere that Georges Simenon was able to write up to 80 pages per day, which means he completed a new novel in a week. That rate is fantastically high for my standard. I am happy when I can write 1-2 good pages per day. And take into account that writing a novel is much, much more than putting one page on top of the other. You need structure, character development, documentation, and so on. I think 3 months would be a pretty tight constraint also for an experienced writer. I would go for 1 year minimum.  Of course, if you don't mind writing a crappy book (which could become a bestseller nevertheless), 3 months could be enough. Also, if you are not planning to write a novel but (say) a recipe cookbook and you have already collected the material, you could be able to put it together in even less than 3 months. I have no experience on formatting books for Kindle, but I guess it shouldn't take, on average, more than a few workdays for a 300-page volume. ",
