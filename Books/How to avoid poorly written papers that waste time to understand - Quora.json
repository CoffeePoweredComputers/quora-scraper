An outline will give you a framework that prevents wandering thoughts.An outline gives you a straight line from your opening statement to a logical conclusion.An outline will reveal which sentences are useless because they do not contribute to the straight line. Think of an outline as the blueprint for a house that requires a foundation first, then walls and then a roof.My first papers in college were poorly written. But after learning to outline my writing and my grades improved a lot. Eventually, it will become second nature. ",

OUT. It\u2019s just one of those things that you can\u2019t avoid in life. You will just have to read it and try to understand it as best as you can or there will be consequences. If you have the choice/don\u2019t have the responsibility of reading those papers, then you could just choose not to read them! If you don\u2019t want to do that for some reason or another, maybe try speaking to the person who wrote the paper and see if you can do anything about it! Good luck! ",
