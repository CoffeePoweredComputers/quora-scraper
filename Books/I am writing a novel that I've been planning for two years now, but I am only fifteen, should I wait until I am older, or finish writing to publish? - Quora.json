Just keep in mind that unless you're unusually talented it's probably not going to be your last one.The first book I published I actually conceived of when I was about 10 years old.  I ended up rewriting it when I was 14.  When I was 20, I adapted it into a game, and the book was released (unfortunately largely unchanged from the draft I wrote when I was 14) to promote the project during development.The game, sadly, didn't end up seeing release, but the book sold, and the sequel (written properly) sold even better and is something I'm actual Continue Reading",

In addition, find a an editor who will be brutally honest with you about your writing style, grammar, characters, etc.  Edit, revise, edit, revise. You want this thing to be perfect. All the hot authors from King to Scalzi will tell you to write every day, and write a lot. Most authors end up writing 3-6 books before they get good enough to publish one.  When you/your editor think your book is ready, go for it! Christopher Paolini was 15 when he published Eragon, and while everyone agrees the book could be better, it still got made int Continue Reading",

Answering your question, no, you should not stop writing and wait until you are older.It is never too early or too late to write. Also, at 15, you are in an age of discovery and self development, the next few years will shape your personality and your views of the world and, because you are in this transitional period in your life, if you stopped writing your novel now and get back to it years later, you would realise you are not \"the same person\" as you were at 15 and that will be reflected in your writin Continue Reading",

After writing the first draft for a year, Paolini spent a second year rewriting and fleshing out the story and characters. Paolini's parents saw the final manuscript and decided to self-publish Eragon. Paolini spent a year traveling around the United States promoting the novel. By chance, the book was discovered by Carl Hiaasen, who got it re-published by Alfred A. Knopf. The re-published version was released on August 26, 2003.\" -- Wikipedia If he can do it, you can do it.   ",
