            "answer_text": "His books have sold more than 350 million copies, many of which have been adapted into feature films, miniseries, television series, and comic books. King has published 58 novels (including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman), six non-fiction books and approximately 200 short stories. King's formula for learning to write well is: \"Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer.\" He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. ",
