            "answer_text": "I started reading Bhagavad Gita after my dad advised me to, as I strongly believe in his principles. Started off with Srila Prabhupada's ' Bhagavad Gita , As it is '. You need to start off with a sense of Confidence, Bhakti and Belief on Sri Krishna. Convince yourself that you will understand and follow the principles mentioned in The Gita, to whatever extent you can. Ask yourself before you start reading: why am I reading ? I need strength, mentally and spiritually, to tide over any situations in the future\u2026I want to improve the quality of my life, not materialistically but spiritually.I have realised that the material world provides temporary, flickering happiness, whereas I am on the look out for permanent peace and happiness.I realise that I have been blessed with human birth so that I fulfil my goal which is to spiritually evolve myself and serve Lord Krishna.Knowing that there are 84 odd lakh species that exist on the planet, I pray that I want to avoid the misery of the cycle of birth and death. The Gita gives me ways and means to attain Moksha.I know that embracing spirituality does not mean taking up sanyas, you can continue to lead a normal life, albeit of a superior quality.Put yourself in the shoes of Arjuna, assume his problems as yours, his dilemmas as yours although of a different nature, not war related. And relish the solutions provided by the Lord himself! Now, start reading ! Best wishes\u2026 If 'The Gita' cannot be understood by the common man, how will the common man benefit from Lord Krishna's teachings ! Read it once, twice, thrice\u2026.you will get it ! ",

            "answer_text": "Following is what you can expect from Bhagvad Gita - Gita Says - \u201cOne Sun illuminates the Universe\u201d. Science says - Our Sun is just one medium sized star among billions others. Gita Says - There is Heaven above & Hell below (the earth). Science says - Our Earth is spherical and rotates & revolves rapidly. There is no terminology like above or below! Gita Says - On earth night follows the day. Science says - There is nothing like day or night as sun always shines irrespective of earth\u2019s position. Still, do you think, Gita is divine knowledge? Interestingly, above teachings are common in Bible and Qu\u2019ran as well. Which means, Mesopotamian thoughts were adapted to the geo-political needs of religious market. I am quite sure that Gita is work of fiction. The worst part is that it justifies killing of anyone YOU feel is wrong. Brand other party as \u2018Adharmi\u2019 and then self justify his killing. It\u2019s Karma theory is also self-defeating. If you are absolved of karma due to pious deeds, you cease to exist! So, if you want another birth, don\u2019t become too pious, it might be suicidal! Also, do not do \u2018bad\u2019 deeds (paap karma), you may be born in animal yoni in the next birth. But, where is the definition of good or bad karmas? If karmas are carried forward in each birth, it is truly amazing. If Almighty wants to settle the karma score, HE must do it in the same birth, because by the time one grows up and understand whatever little known about good or bad karmas, death comes calling, \u201cOK, enough of this life now, do the rest in the next.\u201d And, in next birth, one is unwittingly compelled to commit bad deeds as one has to relearn the whole classification of good or bad karmas again from scratch. Also, if soul attains unification with Parmatma, where from are they replenished? Are souls infinite in number? If yes, where are they stored before initiating their worldly journey? How and in which proportion, the first set of karma is attached to any given soul? Nainam chhidanti\u2026.If it is true, how a surreal soul is first entrapped by karmas, and then they both reside in a real physical body? No karma can be done without the desire of result. So, to say Karmanyae vadika\u2026 is a fallacy. Humans start doing karma only when they desire certain result. How, otherwise, in a goal-less mode, will anyone decide what to do? Lastly, the epic says that the Sanjay was giving real-time commentary to Dhritrashtra. At one point in time, he tells to Dhritrashtra that Lord Krishna has revealed HIS grandeur (Viraat Swaroop) to Arjuna. Which means, before the start of battle, Dhritrashtra actually knew that Krishna was not any ordinary lad but incarnation of GOD. In such circumstance, it must have struck to him that his son Duryodhan will definitely be got killed as GOD HIMSELF was with Pandavas. Why then he made no efforts to immediately send a messenger to Duryodhan to make him aware of the startling fact?! Gita is filled with so many paradox. It also demeans women at couple of places and divides society on caste lines.Only one who never questions and keeps blind faith can search of any teaching in it. Still if you wish to proceed and read Gita, Best Wishes. ",
