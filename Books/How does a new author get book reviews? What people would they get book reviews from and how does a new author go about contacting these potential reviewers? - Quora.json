That\u2019s part of how a publisher earns their shares of the book\u2019s profits (if any). They may do the same with experts in the field, book trade people who might order the book in quantity or recommend it to their purchasing staff, people whom the author has informed them might be interested (either because of the nature of the work or because they are familiar with the author), and/or occasionally people who write the same kind of book AND ARE KNOWN BY THE PUBLISHER TO BE RECEPTIVE. (Stephen King is known to be a very sympathetic reviewer of less-known writers\u2019 work.) ",

Just be very careful of trying any review schemes at Amazon. They have ways of detecting behaviors and even knowing if it\u2019s relative commenting on the work\u2026 they will take them down\u2026 and if it\u2019s too egregious they will take you down \u2026 and it can take 6 months to a year to be reinstated. To give you a sense of how draconian this can be, I was in a Amazon exclusive agreement. Someone pirated my book and posted it. We got a strike. We were informed after we thought it was taken down, that it popped up again. Handed strike number 2. Mind you, this is outside of my power. I can\u2019t control the internet and what people do. I hunted sites for days\u2026 thought it was clean. Before I could even report back they gave me a third strike. And banned me from any promotions or any sales programs. It took a year to get my privileges back after we managed to get all the pirated copies taken down. So, be careful\u2026 if you plan to work with them\u2026 don\u2019t work with anyone else before hand\u2026 you\u2019ll get messed up like I did.  ",
