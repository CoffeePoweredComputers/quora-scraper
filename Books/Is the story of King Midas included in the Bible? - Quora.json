            "answer_text": "No. There are three historical King Midas\u2019 to whom the myths have been attributed, but it is likely none of them are the source and it is simply used as a common name. The two myths of Midas warm against speaking without thinking of the consequences. The first of course being the Golden Touch. The second is the tale of Midas being asked to judge between a musical competition between Apollo playing the Harp and Pan playing the pipes.Midas rashly praised Apollo as being far superior to Pan and so was cursed by pan with the ears of a Donkey to improve his listening skills. The two myths together are obviously the basis of Paris and the Golden apple, the incident that started the Trojan war. ",
