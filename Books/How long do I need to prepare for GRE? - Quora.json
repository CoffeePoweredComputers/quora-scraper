            "answer_text": "Hello! Hope so you\u2019re running cool. GRE (Graduate Record Examination) is a technical entrance exam and the preparation time only depend upon you. Your management, learning, communication, writing and intelligence skills can help you predict the exact time you need to prepare for it. Moreover, Practice material also plays an important role. There are students who prepared for it in a two months time. I have also seen people preparing it from 6 months to 1 year time. What you have got to do is give yourself a time goal. Example (when do you want to appear in the test? If you want to appear in December then you\u2019ve got almost 9 months) Then make yourself a timetable for your particular duration (9 months), study through quality practice material. Then keep a regular check on your weekly and monthly performance. If you need any assistance in making yourself a schedule according to your requirements then you can use help of GRE Magoosh, QS Leap and many forums like these which can help you in preparing a schedule according to your ease and comfort.
