            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re feeling unmotivated, unsure of yourself, aimless, can\u2019t find your passion, directionless, not clear on what your purpose in life is. You\u2019re in good company \u2014 most people are in the same boat. Now, there about a million things online telling you how to find your passion in life, and that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s a search worth undergoing. I\u2019m not going to give you a fool-proof method, or a 5-step method, nor share my passion manifesto with you today. I\u2019m going to give you a one-step method. However, that one step is a doozy. The One Step to Finding Your Purpose It\u2019s simply this: learn to get outside your personal bubble. Your personal bubble is the small world you live in (we all have one), where you are the center of the universe. You are concerned with your wellbeing, with not wanting to look bad, with succeeding in life, with your personal pleasure (good food, good music, good sex, etc.). This is the bubble we all live in most of the time, and people who say they don\u2019t are trying to prove something. When someone tells you you look fat, this only hurts because you\u2019re in your personal bubble. You take that statement (a colleague who says you look fat) and believe that it\u2019s about you, and feel the pain or embarrassment of how the statement affects you. It matters a lot, because in your bubble, what matters most is how everything affects you personally. I\u2019m the same way, and so is everyone else. Some other problems caused by this personal bubble: In our bubble, we\u2019re concerned with our pleasure and comfort, and try not to be uncomfortable. This is why we don\u2019t exercise, why we don\u2019t only eat healthy food.This fear of being uncomfortable is also why we get anxious at the thought of meeting strangers. It hampers our social lives, our love lives.Because we don\u2019t want to look bad, we are afraid of failing. So we don\u2019t tackle tough things.We procrastinate because of this fear of failing, this fear of discomfort.When someone does or says something, we relate that event with how it affect us, and this can cause anger or pain or irritation.We expect people to try to give us what we want, and when they don\u2019t, we get frustrated or angry.Actually, pretty much all our problems are caused by this bubble. Including the difficulty in finding our life purpose. But more on that in a minute \u2014 I ask for your patience here, because this is important. What Happens When We Get Out of the Bubble If we can learn to get outside this personal bubble, and see things from a less self-centered approach, we can see some amazing things: When someone says or does something, it\u2019s not really about us \u2014 it\u2019s about pain or fear or confusion they\u2019re feeling, or a desire they have. Not us.When we have an urge for temporary pleasure (TV, social media, junk food), we can see that this urge is a simple passing physical sensation, and not the center of the universe.We can start to see that our personal desires are actually pretty trivial, and that there\u2019s more to life than trying to meet our pleasures and shy from our discomfort. There\u2019s more than our little fears. Including: the pain and suffering of other people, and compassion for them. Compassion for all living beings. Wanting to make the world better.We can tie our daily actions, like learning about how our minds and bodies and habits work, or getting healthy, or creating something, not only to our personal satisfaction and success (trivial things) but to how they help others, how they make the lives of others better, how they might lessen the suffering of others.We become less self-centered, and begin to have a wider view. Everything changes, from letting go of fear and anger and procrastination, to changing our habits and finding work that matters. How does this relate to finding our life purpose? Let\u2019s explore that. The Wider View, and Our Life Purpose Once we get out of the bubble, and see things with a wider view, we can start a journey along a path like this: We can start to see the needs of others, and feel for their suffering.We then work to make their lives better, and lessen their suffering.Even if we aren\u2019t good at that, we can learn skills that help us to be better at it. It\u2019s the intention that matters.As we go about our daily work, we can tie our actions to this greater purpose. Learning to program or become healthy (for example) isn\u2019t just for our betterment, but for the betterment of others, even in a small way. This gives us motivation on a moment-to-moment basis. When we lose motivation, we need to get back out of our bubble, shed our concern for our discomfort and fears, and tie ourselves to a bigger purpose.In this path, it doesn\u2019t matter what specific actions you take or skills you learn to make people\u2019s lives better. What career you choose is not important \u2014 what matters is the bigger purpose. You can always change your career and learn new skills later, as you learn other ways to fulfill this purpose. You\u2019ll learn over time. What matters is becoming bigger than yourself. Once you do, you learn that you have a purpose in life. How to Get Out of the Bubble Sounds great, but getting outside this personal bubble isn\u2019t as easy as just saying, \u201cLet it be so.\u201d It takes work. First, you must see when you\u2019re stuck in the bubble. Whenever you\u2019re angry, frustrated, irritated, fearful, anxious, procrastinating, feeling hurt, wishing people would be different \u2026 you\u2019re in the bubble. These are signs. You are at the center of your universe, and everything is relating to you and your feelings. When you can\u2019t stick to habits, or have a hard time with a diet, you\u2019re in the bubble. Your momentary pleasure is what matters in this bubble. Outside the bubble, they\u2019re just little events (sensations of desire, urges) that can be let go of. Second, when you notice that you\u2019re in the bubble, expand your mind and heart. See the bigger picture. Feel what others must be feeling. Try to understand rather than condemning. See how little and petty your concerns and fears have been. Realize that if others treat you badly, it\u2019s not about you, but about their suffering. Third, wish others well. Genuinely want their happiness, just as you want your own happiness. See their suffering and wish for it to end or lessen. Fourth, see how you can help. How can you lessen the suffering of others? Sometimes it\u2019s just by paying attention, just listening. Other times you just need to be there, just lend a hand. You don\u2019t need to go around solving everyone\u2019s problems \u2014 they probably don\u2019t want that. Just be there for them. And see if you can make people\u2019s lives better \u2014 create something to make them smile. Make one little part of their world \u2014 a cup of tea, an article of clothing you\u2019ve sewn \u2014 be a little space of goodness. Repeat this process multiple times a day, and you\u2019ll get better at it. You\u2019ll learn to be bigger than yourself. You\u2019ll learn that the life we\u2019ve been given is a gift, and we must make the most of it, and not waste a second. You\u2019ll learn that there is nothing more fulfilling than making the lives of others a little better. Best Wishes Kaushik ",

            "answer_text": "Thanksgiving, I went up on stage. 15 people were in the audience. A small number. It didn\u2019t matter. It was an American holiday so nobody in the audience was from the US except my two daughters. So I didn\u2019t use my regular material. I just said, \u201cWe\u2019re like a United Nations here. Tell me your countries and I will solve all of your problems.\u201d And for the next 20 minutes we had a blast. I was happy. I was in love. I was free. Sometimes my purpose (and there\u2019s been more than one) has made me millions. Sometimes it has helped me find love. And sometimes it just makes people laugh. Even my two daughters.  \u2014- IMAGINE you can find your purpose, master it, be known for it, make friends because of it, meet the best in the world at what you love. I know it is possible because I have done it and it\u2019s changed my life over and over at my absolute worst moments. I looked back at every time I\u2019ve found a purpose. How did I put the 10,000 puzzle pieces spread all over my brain back together into a beautiful picture. ANSWER: By now, you want to find your purpose. I will tell you how I did it and how the hundreds of others I\u2019ve interviewed about this exact topic did it: You realize what purpose means.you build a foundation of habits so purpose becomes easy.you find the cluesyou learn what to do with the clues.There\u2019s no one purpose in life. There are many. What were the clues? I analyzed. Then I spoke to hundreds of other people who had found their purposes. Everyone ranging from Richard Branson to Tyra Banks to super race car driver Danica Patrick to former world chess champion Garry Kasparov to writers like Ken Follett, Judy Blue to self-help gurus like Tony Robbins and Wayne Dyer and many more.  (talking to Tony Robbins about purpose. Click on video) How do you find your purpose? How do you put together that puzzle. And when I was so ashamed of losing wife house money life purpose I had to figure out how to live LIVE find the foundation that could lift my life so I was ready for purpose. FIRST: A DAILY PRACTICE Without a solid foundation, you can\u2019t create a building that will reach for the sky. I do this every day. Improve 1% (whatever that means) in each of these areas: PHYSICAL: Eat, Move, Sleep. If you\u2019re in bed sick, then a purpose will do you no good. EMOTIONAL: Trim the toxic people (even if they are \u201cfriends\u201d or family) and be with the people who love you and support you and you love and support. If you are constantly angry or resentful or nervous about your relationships, your purpose will forget you. MENTAL: Exercise your Creativity Muscle every day. If you aren\u2019t creative every day, the muscle will atrophy. And if you are creative every day (just write down 10 ideas a day on a pad) it will become a Creativity Super Power. Without that super power you will have no chance of finding a purpose and then exceeding what\u2019s been done before. Finding your own unique voice that will make you rise above everyone else.  SPIRITUAL: Not in a prayer sense (although it could be). Not in a meditation sense (although it could be). Not in an \u201cAngels\u201d sense (ok, it won\u2019t be that) but a feeling that you can\u2019t control everything. Only focus on the things within your control. No anxiety or regret or resentment about what you can\u2019t. I do this Daily Practice every day. Without it, there\u2019s no way to find purpose. If I don\u2019t do it, within a week or so the first thoughts of depression, anger, resentment, or worse start to take hold. I die while I\u2019m still alive.  FINDING A PURPOSE FAQ: Rule #1: There is no \u201cone purpose\u201d. Bill Gates had a purpose. Take a piece of software and get everyone in the world to use it. Now he has another purpose: stop Malaria in Africa. Every athlete has a purpose: play football, basketball, skateboarding, whatever. But then they retire and find other purposes. I spoke to Tony Hawk, who was 11 time World Skateboarding Champion. Now he makes the best video games out there for skateboarders. I spoke to Garry Kasparov, former World Chess Champion for 20 years and still one of the best chess players in the world. Now he fights for human rights in Russia.  (playing chess with Garry Kasparov. Check out who won). I spoke to Arianna Huffington. She wanted a platform to share news that was more accurate and powerful than traditional news sources. Now she writes books about the amazing benefits of Sleep. For me, I thought my purpose was to be an astronaut, then a computer software guy, then a billionaire, then a writer, then make a TV show, then a comedian. Then and then and then. I\u2019m always hunting for the things that give me such pleasure it\u2019s like I\u2019m walking around in a living cloud of purpose. RULE #2: How do you find the clues to your purpose? I asked Danica Patrick, the highest ranking female race car driver ever. She told me three of her ideas:  (talking to Danica Patrick, race car driver extraordinaire). a) Ask yourself, How would you structure the ideal day? b) What photos are on your phone? The thing you take the most photos of might contain a clue. c) What makes you most energized? List everything you did this past month and then rank them by how happy you were when you were doing that activity. These all lead to clues as to your purpose. Let me add a few more. d) What were you most interested in at ages 12\u201315? How have they aged? For instance, if you loved basketball but now your are 50 years old maybe you can write a blog about basketball, or make a fantasy sports league about basketball or maybe be a basketball coach or write a book or make basketball clothing or maybe music for basketball teams. Jesse Itzler was a failed rapper. He loved rap but his songs just wouldn\u2019t break out (see Jesse Jaymes, \u201cWhite Girls\u201d).  (Jesse Itzler, aka Jesse Jaymes) But interests age and change as we get older. He started making songs that sports teams would use as their anthems during games. He built that business and sold it. Then he flew on a private plane. He thought, \u201cthis is amazing! But more people should have access to this.\u201d So he created Marquis Jets, a service that allowed for people to fly on private jets without owning a jet. He sold that to Netjets which sold to Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. But old interests don\u2019t just go away. Now Jesse is back to his interest in sports. He doesn\u2019t play basketball. But he OWNS the Atlanta Hawks. After starting off his career with $0 in the bank. I loved writing when I was 12 years old. I kept a notebook about who liked who in my class. That wouldn\u2019t work now (Facebook does that trick without any help) but I love to write every day. I write 3000 words a day every day since 1990. 21 books later I\u2019m happy with the result. It took writing every day from 1990 until 2004 before my first book came out.  (my daughter, crushing me at poker. Maybe will turn into her purpose?) e) Purpose Sex If you love music and you love sports, what about music for sports teams. See the Jesse Itzler example above. If you love psychology and you love economics, what about creating the field of behavioral economics and then winning the Nobel Prize like Daniel Kahneman. If you love Media and you love Astronomy, create books, shows, podcasts, explaining Astronomy to laymen like Neil deGrasse Tyson.  (Neil shows me how to make an atomic bomb using the formula e=mc2) I loved investing and I loved writing software. So first I created software to help me trade the markets. Then I created a website called Stockpickr that was thinly social media site out there devoted just to investors. f) What are you AFRAID to do. In 1996, every Monday I\u2019d get to the Luna Lounge on Ludlow Street an hour early. I\u2019d wait on line so I\u2019d get a good seat. It was comedy night at the Luna Lounge. All the up and coming beginning comedians would perform. People like Amy Poehler, Marc Maron, Michael Ian Black, and on and on. Then I\u2019d even go to the Aspen Comedy Festival. Unknowns like Dave Chappelle, Louis CK, etc would perform. I wanted so badly to try it. But I was terrified. TERR. A . FIED. It took many years before I realized that I loved going a bit past my comfort zone and trying new things. So finally I challenged myself to try it. I was scared to DEATH. Three years later, I now perform all over 3\u20134x a week. I even own part of a comedy club (Standup NY on 78th and Broadway. Stop by!)  It\u2019s a real passion for me. I have no goal or agenda. I make no money doing it. I just love doing it. My two daughters don\u2019t like when I make fun of them but that\u2019s part of life. Grow up! You\u2019re only afraid to do something if it\u2019s important to you. if it\u2019s important to you, it might be a clue as to what your purpose is. g) What section of the bookstore would you read all the books in. When I was a kid I\u2019d go to the chess section of the bookstore. Yes, at Coliseum Books on 57th and 7th there was an entire section devoted to chess. One by one I\u2019d buy all the books. I was obsessed. I\u2019d read each one. Very quickly I won my state\u2019s junior chess championship and I got the ranking of \u201cmaster\u201d. This has helped me in every other area of life (since people assume that chess mastery equals intelligence). In 2002 it was the Investing section of the bookstore. In 1998 it was the poker section. In 1992 it was the short story section. In 2017 it was the comedy section. in 1995 it was the \u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d section. In 1996 it was the \u201cTelevision\u201d section. In 1980 it was the \u201cpolitics\u201d section. In 1982 it was the \u201cPsychic Powers\u201d section. Because, you know\u2026with psychic powers I could become invisible and control people and fly.  What do you do once you find clues to your purpose? a) list all the ways you can spend more and more of your day involved in that purpose. b) find a community of people who love that purpose just like you do. Compare notes. Learn. Help people. Find mentors. c) read as much as you can about that purpose. Read the history, read the biographies of the greats. Read all of the current thinking. You need to do this to discover your unique voice. d) Purpose sex. See above. e) DO. Start doing things that make a name for yourself in that purpose. When I got fascinated with investing in 2002 I read every book. Then I wrote software modeling the markets. Then I started sharing my results with others and they would invest with me. Then I started writing about investing (purpose sex). Then I built a website devoted to investors. Then I built businesses around investing. And, of course, I learned every strategy of investing and started investing more and more successfully. DIVERSIFY YOUR PURPOSE I don\u2019t like to feel horrible. And if you throw your whole life into something, sometimes you will succeed and sometimes you will fail. When I fail, it feels horrible. Of course I will try to learn from failure. Of course, failure can propel one to success. But it feels like death. When I \u201cinvest in myself\u201d I make sure I diversify. I never have one passion or purpose that I am pursuing. Because if you bet everything on Red, you can lose everything. But when one thing is not going so well for me I switch to other interests I am passionate about. This makes me feel better. Gives me ideas for the other things I am interested in. Clears my head so I can learn better from my failures. And makes me a happier person in general: Community. I meet other life-minded peopleImprovement. I start to achieve mastery in the things I am in love with.Freedom.What is freedom? The ability to spend more and more of your day making decisions that are your choice and nobody else\u2019s. In other words, the reason for being ALIVE. ",
