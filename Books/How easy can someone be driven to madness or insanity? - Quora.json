            "answer_text": "If by madness, you\u2019re referring to any mental disorder, the answer is it varies. Most mental disorders occur through the complex interaction of biological and environmental factors. Several genes and environmental factors must interact to create a disorder in any given person. The more risk factors you have\u2014that is you have a genetic predisposition to a certain trait, or you lived in an abusive home, or you experienced a traumatic event\u2014the more likely you are to develop a disorder. Some people have a genetic predisposition to feel a certain way and it may only take a slightly stressful situation to trigger that biological vulnerability and create a disorder. Other people are luckier, and they are not genetically at risk to develop disorders. These people can experience highly stressful situations and they still may not develop a disorder. As an example, not everybody who is sent to war goes on to develop PTSD. In fact, not even most people who experience combat end up developing the disorder. There is no doubt that they experienced highly stressful situations where they and their friends were likely to be killed. They may have also been responsible for the lives of others, and that too can be unimaginably stressful. Yet, they often do not go on to develop a disorder. This isn\u2019t to say they aren\u2019t negatively affected by their experiences\u2014I\u2019m simply saying they do not develop a clinically recognized disorder. For some people, perhaps all it can take is a push to trigger a disorder. For others, this isn\u2019t so. However, I think the quote works better if you examine it on a less literal level: All it takes is one event to change how you think. Sometimes that\u2019s for the worse. ",
