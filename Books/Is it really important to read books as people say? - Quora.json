            "answer_text": "Reading books is really as important as people say. I really didn't realize it when I heard this advice. I just thought, useless, boring old people who don't know what to do in life is also coming and wasting my life and time. I just heard it through one ear and passed it out through the other ear(that's why God gave us two ears *lol*).  I'm sorry but I had that attitude. When I was forced to read books other than my academics,  I would just read some fifty pages, not knowing what I read, then leave some seven pages, turn over the pages, get bored, yawn, sleeping while reading,passing over to the epilogue and coming back to read some pages. Finally with a war of pages I proudly and successfully finish that book. In the end of the day wondering if I have ever read a book? Disgusting right. I was like that.  But now without reading at least five pages I can't go to bed. If the novel is more interesting I finish the book even in a day.   Such a epidemic change!   I regret I could have started reading before even and for not utilizing it.  Past is past! Reading books have widened my thinking. It gives me different aspects and angles of life. Obviously it has developed my vocabulary. Moreover it had made me happier. I get immense joy in reading. Reading is one of the most important habit one can develop. So I kindly request you to start reading books. Books are one's best friend. As for you start reading little by little tenderly. Watch for the words (the meaning) you don't know in the dictionary. I'm recommending this to all my( non- readable) friends. Academic books gives you knowledge only about one area. Books/novels covers up the entire genre. But careful in what books you are choosing.    Happy reading! ",

            "answer_text": "The life changing potential that books carry cannot be overstated. Let me tell you why: Books have words. Words that originated in someone else's mind. A mind that follows a different thought process. A thought process that has been developed as a result of a different view point. So basically, when you are reading a book, you're looking the world through someone else's eyes. That is one hell of a super power if you ask me.Books are like a window to another world. A world that has entirely been created by someone else. A world where things are different than they are in reality. A world where there's hope and love. Where things happen as you wish them to be. This ability to peek into another world is amazing.Books introduce you to different personalities. The characters in the book, sometimes, have a personality, that is unlike anyone you've ever met. It introduces you to a different thought process. A different way to perceiving things.Books enlighten you. They take you to places you've never visited. They take you to places that don't even exist.Books make you fall in love with people who are not a part of this world. I love Hermione Granger. She doesn't even exist. Yes, there's Emma. But Emma's not Hermione. Are you getting my point?Books help you get through the though times. Immensely knowledgeable people have stored their wisdom in the form of words enclosed in a book. We were not fortunate enough to meet them. But reading what they wrote is the closest you can get to them.If I could wish for one super power, I'd ask for an unparalleled reading pace and efficiency along with great retention capability. I could not ask for more.There is a saying that I absolutely love. If you want to stay alive in people's minds and hearts even after you die, either do things worth writing about or write things worth reading about.Books hold immense amounts of wisdom. If we are able to taste even tiniest bit of it, we could achieve greatness.",
