            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of pathogenic. If by pathogenic you mean infectious to humans, then I don't believe that there are any pathogenic cyanobacteria (it would be difficult for them to colonize our sunless interior, unlike heterotrophic pathogens).  If you use a broader definition that includes environmental toxin-producing agents (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen), then there are a lot of pathogenic cyanobacteria. For example, I am currently characterizing a highly toxic freshwater lake bloom composed of an Anabaena strain that produces anatoxin-a. Anatoxin-a is a powerful neurotoxin - an acetylcholine-like agonist - that blocks nerve signaling. This causes respiratory paralysis because the diaphragm becomes paralyzed. This is just one of many cyanobacterial toxins, though. Microcystin is another, better-studied toxin that poisons the liver. There are new cyanobacterial toxins still being discovered, such as cylindrospermopsin. Saxitoxin and Nodularin are a couple more. Wikipedia has a nice article on these toxins: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotoxin These toxins are interesting for many reasons, but here are the reasons I find most interesting. The cyanotoxins are produced by non-ribosomal synthesis, meaning that similar cellular machinery puts each of the toxins together. This machinery - which also produces antibiotics and intercellular signaling molecules - is just beginning to be understood, and it is fascinating (to scientists, at least). Secondly, toxins such as microcystin seem to be ancient according to phylogenetics, predating metazoan (animal) lineages. This suggests that the toxins originally served a purpose besides killing animals (that might eat or destroy the cyanobacteria). What that purpose was and what provokes toxic cyanobacterial blooms is still a mystery! ",
