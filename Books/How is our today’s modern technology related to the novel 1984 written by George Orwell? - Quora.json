            "answer_text": "When Orwell wrote 1984, back in 1948, it was already quite obvious that there was government surveillance on the people, to a level that was higher than most people took into consideration. A great deal of this surveillance was due to the government\u2019s vigilance to spying and loyalty, during the second World War which just ended. By 1948, Orwell noticed that the government was very intrusive in people\u2019s lives. More people had radios, for entertainment and news, films, for the same purpose, and lots of newspapers and magazines, for war and post-war commentaries. There were also many reports on traitors and collaborators, all of which came out of government spying and investigation over the regular population. Television was not an unknown technology, though only the few had it by 1948. It did not take Orwell long, as a reporter within his own right, to project what was happening in 1948, fifty years into the future. In truth, by 1984 surveillance was already quite pervasive and over much of the population. By 1984 there was at least one television in each house, especially in the Western Nations. It was not that much of a leap to make up two-way spying by \u201cBig Brother\u201d (the Government) on every single household, or individual The attitude towards the news, today being constantly denigrated as \u201cFake News\u201d, plays right into Orwell\u2019s suggestion that nothing presented to the public, as news, was actually real news, but just some spun lie, for the sole benefit of the government.

            "answer_text": "The George Orwell\u2019s novel 1984 was about total government control over the creation, dissemination and the acquisition of all information. A process predicted by Orwell. One that is already now coming into place by corporations in America. And one which the public is not paying proper attention to. Already the dissemination of false information is becoming established and acceptable to numerous populations. Even by top government officials. It is just a matter of time before this information control becomes completely incorporated into government as a way of controlling the masses. After all, many governments across the world are very similar to corporations and work in the precisely the same way. So why would everyone be surprised if their government begins to look and act just like a corporation? ",
