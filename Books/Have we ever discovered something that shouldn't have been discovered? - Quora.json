            "answer_text": "First off , whenever we talk about something that shouldn\u2019t have been discovered I think that Nuclear Weapons will always come up. Kinda understandable, since they can do this:  But, I would argue that they were a net positive for the world with one caveat: That if it were ever used in war again, that it would immediately have became the one thing that we shouldn\u2019t have discovered. But so far MAD(Mutually Assured Destruction) has held. And in turn, it has prevented the worlds most powerful nations from going to war with one another, possibly preventing the deaths of millions if not billions. Even whether or not its only use in warfare in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was ethical of not is up for debate. Had we not bombed the two cities, we would have had to have invaded Japan which would possibly have resulted in millions of more deaths.  So why am I argueing for the benefits of Nuclear weapons when the question\u2019s task is to find the one thing that has had the worst effect on mankind? Because Nuclear weapons fit the bill; nothing else could end human existence as we know it in a few hours. Our whole civilization could be wiped off the face of the universe. But I can\u2019t choose Nuclear Weapons in good conscience. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know if it was a good thing or a bad thing for society until its too late or Nukes become child\u2019s play and we find something much more destructive. So with that out of my way I throw my hat in the ring for this contender:  Millions died apon the discovery of this continent by the old world. Although humans discovered this before, the discovery of this chunk of land by another group of humans lead to the annihilation of a whole civilization and countless deaths. I\u2019m aware that the world would have been unrecognizable had this not happend, but because of the fact it would be unrecognizable I cannot compare how the world would be then to how it is now I can only take into account its immediate effects. If only perhaps the cultures of the region had more time to urbanize and condition themselves for modern diseases, or perhaps the first explorations never returned to Europe just so they could deal with the plagues without having to deal with the Conquistadors. Or maybe disease could be introduced in a more staggered manner. Maybe the world would have been worse, perhaps it would have had a net negative for humanity. But we\u2019ll never know how the chain of cause and effect would unfold. All we know is that the Native Americans payed the highest price for the world we live in today. Most have been assimilated, wiped from history or pushed to the periphery of the world. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you are asking if humans have ever discovered something without which we, or the world, would be better off. I have to answer that question with a definitive NO. And here\u2019s why\u2026 There are, and always have been, discoveries which led to some very bad consequences. Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are two examples. If they hadn\u2019t been discovered, the world would not be in danger of annihilation due to nuclear weapons. If gunpowder hadn\u2019t been invented, many many lives would have been saved throughout the years due to its use in weapons and explosives. If concrete hadn\u2019t been invented, a family I knew once would not have died when their car ran into an abutment. Each of these things have had some bad, sometimes disastrous and catastrophic consequences. And yet each has contributed greatly to the advancement of human society. It is their misuse, or careless usage, that causes the consequences, not the things that were invented. Mankind is its own worst enemy. Perhaps the world would be better off if tobacco had not been discovered, or cocaine, or the intoxicating effects of alcohol. But I would say that even those things have also been beneficial to human society. Without the study of nicotine, alcohol and other drugs, we might not have modern anesthesia, and thus modern surgery and much of modern medicine. I can\u2019t think of a single thing that mankind should not have discovered because it had only negative, or bad consequences. Maybe if I had more time, or maybe someone else can make a good suggestion. But I believe the best answer to your question is, flatly, no. ",
