            "answer_text": "There are two ways of to achieve it. First Method: 4 days = (4 x 24) hours - 4 x (8 hours of sleep + 2 hours of other activities) = 96 - 40 = 56 hours So we have 56 hours to complete a novel. The minimum word count for a novel is 40000. If you are a seasoned writer, your average word per hour rate should be 1000 words. Sit and write 1000 words in one go for 50 minutes. Take a break for 10 minutes. And then resume your writing for next 50 minutes. So, per hour, 50 minutes writing plus 10 minutes break, you are adding 1000 words to your book. That means, at the end of 40th hour, you will be done with your first draft. Now spend the rest 16 hours reviewing and editing. Second Method: All you need is to have a NZT pill from Limitless movie, which gives access to 100% to our brain\u2019s power. In that movie, after taking the pill, the protagonist completed his book in four days. P.S. - The second method is for a joke sake. Within four days you can have your first draft for sure, but it will demand determination. All the best! ",

And trust me if you start writing instead of wondering about writing you can make it real quick. And four days is possible if you have a clear idea of your story and what all you have to write. ***But the key point is that you should start writing.*** once you finish a page you will have a little confidence and as you keep on writing you will build confidence and will know by yourself what all is necessary for you novel/story.
