            "answer_text": "May be your word file is damaged or corrupt or there is some problem with the word installation files. Let me explain one method that you can try in order to fix this issue of word document on your Macbook Air. Open MS word on your Macbook Air and click on File menu to select \u201cOpen\u201d. There you need to select the corrupted MS word file that you want to repair. After that choose \u201cRepair\u201d from the bottom-right of the window and press \u201cOK\u201d. The file will be repaired soon after that. Once the process is complete, try re-opening the word file. If the issue still persists, consider watching this video for more solutions.  ",
