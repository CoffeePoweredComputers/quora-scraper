            "answer_text": "There are a great many ebooks available free now. 1st Project Gutenberg has out of copyright books available free. Look there for the classics. https://www.gutenberg.org/ Next All the big online retailers have free ebooks. Authors will give them away in the hope that readers will like them, review them and look for other paid books by them. The first book in a series is often given away free. Retailers make no profit from free ebooks so often don\u2019t make them easy to find. Try this link Amazon Best Sellers: Best Kindle Store and look for the \u2018Top 100 Free\u2019 link. At the page left you can select the genre you are interested in. You might also try Smashwords - Ebooks from independent authors and publishers - free ebooks Try author websites too - often you\u2019ll find a link to a free ebook as on my author website - Avoiding the apocalypse Sadly there are also many sites which make pirated books available. Beware if you use one. Pirates usually have a hidden motive such as stealing personal information or credit card data. Often the books they feature are riddled with errors because the pirate has scanned and OCRed a paper book leading to errors such as \u2018Giinthur clear\u2019 when the text should be \u2018G\u00fcnther dear\u2019.
