            "answer_text": "Before answering this i must understand one thing, do you really want to know what Al Ghazali (ks) told about doubt or uncertainty or how muslim must deal with that ? I will start with what Al Ghazali told about doubts. Al Ghazali never had faith problem on this doubt mentality.He tried to show weakness of mind and how weak those people who making own fake idols with using their minds. He explained bravely his idea aganist to philosophers because the philosophers making traps for the people by using mind. He said \u201cIn my research i found 4 reason, faith weakness and lazyness from the people\u2026 1- People with working on philosophy or trying follow philosopher 2- People with who following fake sufism 3- People who declaring their leader as innocent and they declaration \u201conly innocent leader can teach\u201d 4- People following who fake or very limited intellectuals.\u201d Also He says \u201cSome of rough muslims says, we are denying whatever comes from philosophers.Why we have to deny if the knowledge comes from philosopy which that knowledge not aganist with Quran and hadith also that knowledge has a indications.Those people shows Islam as a rough\u201d. One thing people must understand Al Ghazali never deny the mind. Just he tried to tell \u201cDont trust it too much and dont try to proove everything with mind\u201d. Here is an example of it. \u201cSaid one who had knowledge from the Scripture, \"I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.\" Surah Neml 40. How you can explain this with mind ? You can believe it or deny it. Also people who satisfied with prooves never get the source,actually thats not a belief or faith. Mind always care profit thats why always fails. Imagine a person who you love, he is rich, he is handsome and he is educated but its not giving you guarentee of happyness. Mind says thats the right person but people ignoring factor of God. May be God give your happyness to garbage collecter and you will find happyness with that. Thats why we follow only by heart and soul. Hope it helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Islam has a principle \u201cDoubt does not erase certainty\u201d we always have a root to fall back on and that root is the book of Allah. There is no doubt in the truth of the Quran, so every-time we turn back to it for certainty. Ghazali actually writes quite a bit about this in his book called \u201cThe incoherence of Philosophers\u201d ",
