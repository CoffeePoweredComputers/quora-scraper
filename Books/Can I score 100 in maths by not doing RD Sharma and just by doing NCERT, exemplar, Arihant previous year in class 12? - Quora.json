            "answer_text": "Definitely! Actually RD sharma or even exemplar are unnecessary. First and foremost read the theory of each chapter given in ncert. Look at carefully at every graph too. Watch a video about that particular topic or sub topic where you are struggling to understand the text. You can even ask your teachers. Then you should solve all ncert examples and then non repeated questions from the exercises. After this do previous year questions. If you do this much and don't make silly mistakes in the exam, you will definitely get 100. All the best for your exam! Ps - I didn't even do this much. I did ncert questions (about 60%), exemplar(45\u201355%), previous year(chapterwise and only the few questions which I thought could't do). ",
