            "answer_text": "I have been an investor for over 40 years. I spent 20 as a professional Financial Advisor. I achieved Presidents Club for my firm (Top 50 Advisors in the US). In this answer, I will teach you how to get started managing your money properly, in a well diversified stock portfolio. I buy quality stocks in my portfolio. No penny stocks, no story stocks like this is the next big thing in 5G, Pot stocks, Internet of Things, that sort of thing. Those are quite often pump and dump stories. I might buy one here and there, but only because I have done my research. Penny stocks (anything under $5) are a really dumb idea for investing, and especially beginners. 85% of stocks are owned by institutions (like mutual funds, insurance companies, Pension funds, etc.) Virtually all institutions have bylaws that forbid buying stocks under $5, and some have bylaws demanding they sell if a stock goes below $5. They have those bylaws because statistically, those are lousy investments. If you buy a penny stock, 85% of potential buyers (the institutions) are eliminated. Where is the demand for your penny stock going to come from? As a result, it is much harder for a $0.50 stock to go to $5 than for a $20 stock to go to $200 simply because 100% of potential buyers have the ability to buy the $20 stock. Index funds. First and foremost, I have never been satisfied with being average. Never in my life has that been my goal. By definition that is what index funds are. If you rank all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 by performance, the index will fall between #245 and #255 usually. You own both the best and worst in each sector, and everything in between. Same with sector ETFs. Average. ETF\u2019s (Exchange Traded Funds). ETF\u2019s are like mutual funds with 2 major exceptions.  1) They can trade during the day, all day, just like stocks are traded. This is unlike mutual funds, which can only be purchased or sold at the closing price each day. (A few can be traded twice a day.)  2) Mutual funds can pick and choose what they wish to own and as an investor, you may not know exactly what you are buying when you buy it. ETF\u2019s are defined at inception what they will have inside them, so you always can know what you are buying. The QQQ (Nasdaq 100) used to be a good ETF. Today, just 6 stocks now account for 50% of the ETF. Those 6 stocks are Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Nvidia, and Google. While they are all great companies, your diversification needs to be greater. Same for the S&P500. Those same 6 stocks make up 25% of the index. Not enough diversification for my taste. This came about because the SPX and the QQQ are market cap weighted indexes, meaning that the proportion of each stock held by the ETF is determined by the total value of the market capitalization of the underlying stocks. I believe in a diversified portfolio. I have learned from experience that what I think on January 1st will do best this year is not usually the case. Things change. Tech can go flat for many years at a time. In 1999. Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Dell, Oracle, and AMAT were the equivalent of FANG today (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, NVDA, GOOG.) Look at the charts. Some of them have not made their shareholders a dime in 2 decades. The same thing will happen to the FANG stocks someday. (Full disclosure: I personally still own 4 of the 6 FANG stocks. It ain\u2019t over yet.) Rule #1 Always Buy Top Quality - Never, Ever Forget This I like buying the #1 or #2 stock in a sector or subsector. The reason is quite simple. The company got to that position because they had the right combination of management, marketing, sales, distribution, finances, capitalization, product R&D, etc. Most likely, they also now have the best margins in the business because they do volume. They can afford to spend more total dollars on marketing, but their per unit expense for marketing is less than the competition. Same for R&D, sales, etc. They probably also have patent protection in place.  It is really going to be hard for the competition to unseat them. Finally, the #1 stock in a subsector has the best capitalization usually. They can not only survive a crisis, but usually take advantage of having access to capital to make acquisitions when their competitors are weak. Or they can increase their marketing and sales efforts while the competition is suffering. If just one department of a company is having problems and not performing well, you can likely describe the stock performance as mediocre. Exceptions to the Rule of Owning the #1 stock in a subsector I do make exceptions to this rule when I see a trend developing that I think will last. For example, in the Financials subsector Capital Markets (Broker/Dealers, Investment banks, Mutual Funds, etc.) the traditional Wall Street firms just got too greedy. They have lost the next generation. The kids of the baby boomers (I call them the Echo Boomers) think everything should be online and free, or ultra low cost. Boomers do too. They also do not trust the old Wall Street firms, with good reason. However, investors been sold on the concept of owning index funds. You already know my thoughts on them, but that does not matter. The largest creator of index funds is a company named MSCI. They create indexes and funds all over the globe. They create the ETFs that this generation is buying in droves. The funny thing to me is that MSCI was previously known as Morgan Stanley Capital Investments. It\u2019s old school Wall Street creating these ETFs and cashing in. They charge low fees, and they can because once created, they almost have to do nothing to keep collecting the annual fees. MSCI is laughing all the way to the bank. So I bought the stock that creates the ETF\u2019s, MSCI, even though it is a smaller player in the Capital Markets subsector. MSCI is at the very heart of a new generation of investors. I\u2019ve now had it since 12/31/2018, and it has already more than doubled in price. Market leaders can make tragic mistakes. IBM miscalculated the importance of software for the PC, and the impact of the PC as well. Intel did not see phones as a threat to their PC cpu chip business until QCOM already owned the phone cpu business. GE management did not understand the derivatives their financial unit was packaging and selling. You must stay diligent. Market Leaders can also do almost unimaginable great deals, like LMT (Lockheed Martin) landing the JSF (Joint Strike Fighter, F-35) deal, manufacturing it in 45 states for political protection, and getting the world\u2019s largest contract ever, which, with upgrades and parts, will likely top $1 trillion in value.  Or Nvidia designing graphic chips and getting patent protections for a dominant position in Gaming, Autonomous driving, Artificial Intelligence, 5G, cloud computing, and Video conferencing. Six of the fastest growing businesses worldwide. Awesome job! It is very difficult for a small company to take business from a market leader.  It is much, much easier for a market leader to take business from a secondary company. As a result of getting rid of the losers in each sector, I usually outperform the S&P every year. I set a very high bar for my portfolio performance. I currently expect to beat the S&P500 by 1% per month. I don\u2019t achieve that every month, but I usually manage to beat the S&P by 12% a year. That is a spectacular result in my opinion. You may have higher goals than that, but I have found I am happy close to achieving that result. Good Luck! Please Note: This is a starting point for you. You will usually find there are companies outperforming the subsector market leader sometimes. Perhaps they have a niche that is fantastic, like MSCI. Over time, you can make adjustments to your portfolio when you see fit. This just gets you off to a very solid start in investing and learning how to watch your portfolio and managing it. You can get more aggressive after you learn what you are doing. Three Major Influences on Stock Price There are 3 primary things that influence a stock price: The sector accounts for 50% of the move.  The market, 30%.  Company fundamentals is only responsible for 20%.  It is therefore 80% of the battle to focus on the sector and the market. Most beginners focus on company fundamentals. It is the least important. You can own the best stock in a sector, but if the sector and the market are declining, you are likely to be losing money. You can own a lousy stock, but if the sector and the market are advancing, you will likely be making some money. I repeat. It is more important to focus on the sector and the market! Pareto\u2019s 80/20 law.  The markets are predictable on a long time basis. If you look at a log chart of the DJIA, the markets have an alternating pattern of a stairstep. They are relatively flat for 17.5 years, then rise for 17.5 years. Timing is everything in the S&P and DJIA on a long-term basis. It\u2019s not that hard to understand why, or do. During the flat stage, the market gains about 2.0% \u2013 2.5% per year. Inflation adjusted, 0-1%. During the riser stage, they gain 15%-17% per year over the entire 17.5 years. It can make you quite wealthy in less than 2 decades! Surprisingly, the flat stage has more volatility and can have some of the most rapid gains. However, it is usually proceeded or followed, or both, by horrendous losses.  The riser stage is surprisingly steady growth, with 2-4 periods during the 17.5 years of down markets.  During each riser stage, the markets will double 4 times. 2\u20264\u20268\u202616. A $1 invested will become $16 if you own the index. $30,000 becomes $500,000. If you beat the market by 1% a month, $30,000 becomes $2,500,000. There is a reason this stairstep pattern exists. Once you know it, you can take advantage of it to make a lot more money from your investments. Since inception in August 1896, the DJIA has had 4 flat stages and 3 risers. We are right now (2020) at the beginning of the next great rise. I took the 20%+ downturn in December 2018 as my best real-time guess as to when the next riser was starting. 18 months later, I think I nailed it. These flats and risers are caused by the generational waves in the population. There were 78 million baby boomers. The kids of the baby boomers, which I call the Echo Boomers, consists of a combo of millennials, gen Z, etc. There are 84 million Echo Boomers.  Most everyone goes through 5 life stages:  Kids,  Young Adults,  Building a Family,  Empty Nest, and  Retired.  And then one Dead stage. That one is pretty much permanent, but very important. About 95% of your income during your life is during the Build a Family stage and Empty Nest stage.  The flats in the markets are when a generation (of 80 Million people) is Building a Family.  The riser occurs when that generation are Empty Nesters. Why? When the kids move out, the parents focus on their next big goal, which is paying for their retirement through investing. When you have 40 million of the 80 million people doing that, the markets rise dramatically. In January 2000, the net cash inflow into the markets was over $60 Billion in a single month. (Net cash inflow = Deposits less disbursements.) That is when the Baby Boomers were contributing heavily toward their retirement, and cash flows going out for retiree\u2019s had not yet started increasing. Since then, the net cash inflows have never exceeded the January 2000 inflows. I expect that will happen later in the cycle of Echo Boomers saving during their Empty Nest years. The market does not give a damn if you are 88 or 38 or 18 years old. It does not care if you are conservative or aggressive. It is driven long term by the net cash flows into or out of the markets. More buyers than sellers or vice versa. Short term, it is driven by the news cycle. Unless you are prescient and know what is going to happen, good luck with that.  This next rise up is going to be enormous! The Largest Financial Engine Ever Created on Planet Earth! The Echo Boomers already control 65% of the income in the US. As such, they are the largest Financial Engine ever created on Planet Earth. Bigger than China! The leading edge of the Echo Boomers have completed the Build a Family stage and are now beginning to become Empty Nesters. Finally, on top of their massive position in income, they will inherit $69 Trillion over the next 20 years free of Federal Tax (unless the tax laws change.) What does this mean for investors? To say the S&P has gone up 10% per year (or whatever number you used) for the past 90 years is completely meaningless. It totally depends on whether the markets are in a flat (Build a Family) or riser (Empty Nest) life stage. Net cash flows follows the birth rate, offset by about 48 years. As a generation becomes Empty Nesters, the cash flows into the markets increases dramatically because millions of people increase their savings, and spending, as they become Empty Nesters. We can reasonably expect the markets to rise over the next 18 years by over 18% per year until 2037. (That is my estimate and implies DJIA 330,000 (or S&P = 41,000) by sometime in 2037. Yes, I know 18% sounds crazy big, but it is real. In 2019, the S&P was up 28.8%. The S&P is up 6.6% in 2020 as of Oct 19, 2020, even after a pandemic.) How to beat the Index \u2013 2 steps By making 2 changes from index investing, you can dramatically increase your returns over the next 18 year riser. The first change is to NOT own all the sectors and subsectors like in the index.  First step\u2026 Get rid of the sectors that are most important during the Build a Family stage, as those sectors will have declining demand. You only want to own the sectors with demand increasing as more and more of those Echo Boomers change their lifestyle while transitioning from Building a Family to Empty Nester. Second step \u2013 Buy the market leaders only, except if you have done your research and think that you have something really special (like MSCI.)  Above is a chart showing both the Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, divided by sector, and a list of the Top 10 stocks in each of 7 sectors. The combined revenue of the DJIA 30 stocks are larger than the total GDP for every country on Earth except the US and China. They are very good at what they do.  Note: Dow Jones considers Visa a Financial. S&P considers it a technology company. There are 6 major sectors you want to own. These are: Healthcare Financials Technology Communications/Media Consumer Discretionary Industrials You probably do NOT want to own all the subsectors in each sector! There are exceptions.

You do not want stocks in the Utilities, Consumer Staples, Energy, Real Estate, or Basic Materials sectors during the Empty Nest stage. Those are Build-A-Family sectors with declining market demand as the 84 million Echo Boomers transition from Building-a-Family to Empty Nest. Certainly, those sectors contain some very good stocks but in a declining sector, it is like swimming upstream. Out of over 15,000 stocks on the NYSE & Nasdaq combined, those 60 Top 10 (in their sector) stocks make well over 50% of the TOTAL sales and TOTAL profits of all 15,000 US stocks combined. As Willie Sutton said when asked why he robbed banks: \u201cThat\u2019s where the money is.\u201d Starting Your Portfolio You don\u2019t have to do a lot of research to get started. In fact, I would advise against it because it is a lot of work while you still might have some doubts about your abilities and skill. I will make it easy for you: Pick 4 from Health (JNJ, UNH, MRK, PFE, ABBV, ABT, TMO, AMGN, LLY, BMY) Pick 4 from Finance (BRK.B, JPM, BAC, C, WFC, BLK, SPGI, AXP, GS, CME) Pick 7 from Technology (AAPL, MSFT, V, MA, INTC, NVDA, ADBE, PYPL, CSCO, CRM) Pick 3 Commun./Media (FB, GOOG, GOOGL, TMUS, NFLX, ATVI, T, CMCSA, EA, CHTR) Pick 3 Consumer Discretionary (AMZN, HD, MCD, NKE, LOW, SBUX, BKNG, TJX, TGT, DG)  Pick 4 from Industrials (UNP, HON, BA, RTX, LMT, MMM, UPS, CAT, GE, CSX) Consider this as a good starting point. You can adjust the portfolio later to get more aggressive if you like. I recommend this as a starting point so that you get used to owning top quality, which translates into a high percentage of winners. ",

Becoming a self-directed investor and trader is possible however the question for you is are you willing to do whatever it takes to learn it? Are you willing to study days, night, weekends and holidays? Truthfully, trading is not as hard as it sounds. You just have to make the commitment to really want to do it bad enough to go through all the education and training required to do it as a business. For most brand new investors and traders learning from scratch it is 18\u201324 months of intensive studying and learning risk and money management, trading psychology, composing a rule based trading plan for the style of trading and investing they wish to do, working on a demo account to learn the trading platform they will be working on in the live markets and testing out their rule based plan on demo to make sure it works the way they composed it. You must have a vision of what you plan to get out of your trading and also goals that are your own and not someone else\u2019s. Once the goal and vision are in place it will be time to take action to get things off the ground and going in the right direction which can only be done by you. Being a self made investor and trader I was willing to stop at nothing to get what I wanted, what was that? More freedom. I already owned a business which gave me 6 months off a year, yes that\u2019s right 6 months off a year, nice. I just wanted to be able to make an unlimited amount of money as well and have all that freedom;-)  I once stayed up 3 days straight when I was learning this business. I wanted to get the part I was learning down pat so bad that nothing else including sleeping mattered at that point. I watched some video\u2019s maybe ten times or more until I got it and it was burned into my trading psyche. As far as success goes I have been fortunate enough to do 20% net the last 4 years in a row. I only work from a rule based plan for the type of investing and trading I do which is swing trading and position trading. If you wish to be successful and rich from investing and trading you\u2019ll need to learn it properly the right way from the first day and compose and always follow a rule based plan, it\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll ever make any money from trading. Make no mistake, the market can make you lose your mind, burn your soul, and help you to lose all your money. Quickly!!
