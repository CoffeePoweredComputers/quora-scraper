            "answer_text": "Hello Friends ! Today I want to share with you the story of Shivani Gupta, UPSC CSE 2017 AIR 121. She not only cleared the exam in her first attempt but also cleared it without coaching.  So, I will try to share her strategy for all those who feel they don\u2019t have any idea about preparations and are not willing/able to go for coaching. I will start with a brief background. Shivani Gupta, a Chartered Accountant by profession. She had only 8-9 months for her preparation as she was working in a company and was a late starter. Further, She was totally clueless as to how to go about my preparations. She chose Commerce and Accountancy as my optional subject. She had so many myths and doubts about this examination . When she began, she was doubtful about whether she should take coaching or not but then she decided not to opt it. Certain ideas to be kept in mind during preparations: This exam can definitely be cracked in first attempt itself, so those who feel that they need to go for rigourous preparation for at least 2-3 years should re-devise their strategy.Mock tests are very important, so please take them very seriously.Don\u2019t be misguided by people who suggest numerous sources for a single topic/subject. Pick one source for one topic and stick to it.Be confident about your strategy. Plan in advance.Give regular mock tests and assess your performance. Try to give mocks in most disciplined environment.Make the maximum use of online resources like ias babamrunal videos etc.Revise, Revise and Revise !!Prelims: Shededicatedly prepared for prelims for 3 months (March-June 18). She did not make any notes from the standard books except NCERT, rather underlined the important portions/areas. She read The Hindu daily and tried to attempt maximum questions before the exam. The major benefit of giving mock tests is to assess how many accurate answers/guesses you are making, which helps you during final examination. Revise the answer keys of the mocks. In her case, she used to make a notes on a word document after every mock test in bullet points. When she had given all the mocks, she had 10 pages notes with the summary of all the mock test of different institutes (Vision IAS, Insights etc) in it, which helped her a lot in the last week before the examination. For CSAT paper, she did not prepare separately. She attempted past 2 year question paper and scored fine in them. For certain topics, She referred google. She Had made separate notes for these areas, among others. Mnemonics for constitutional articles (Important ones)Committees formed for different purpose by GovernmentWorld Heritage SitesNational Parks/ Wildlife Sanctuaries, rivers flowing through themVarious reports released by domestic/international institutions (e.g. World Happiness Report)Revision and diligently following the time table was the most important key, She stressed upon. Mains: She had started preparation for Mains only after prelims as She did not have much clue regarding how to prepare for mains. She used to divide her whole day into three parts: Newspaper and Answer Writing Practice- 4-5 Hours- A senior suggested her to follow answer writing practice on online websites, which she used to do regularly. Initially , She used to take 20-25 minutes to write a single answer which was gradually reduced to 6-7 minutes with daily practice.Speedy writing and fast thinking is the essence of this examination, so my personal suggestion is to focus on this aspect, the most. Optional Subject- 4-5 Hours \u2013 She used to devote 2-2.5 hours for each partGS Subjects- 6-7 Hours dailyShe took one mock test series and was very disciplined about it. She gave around 17-18 mocks before sitting in examination. She used to write the tests in a closed room environment within the duration of 3 hours. This really helped her to tackle the final exams pressure as she never felt that she was sitting in examination for the first time. Points regarding answer writing: Introduction-which should be of 30-40 words. It should explain the essence of questions asked. Statistics or recent happening can be included.e.g. A question asked on domestic violence may start with some statistic or some current legislation formed.Main Body- 130-150 words- Write in bullet points. Try to be as diverse as possible. Diversity in answer is appreciated. Make diagrams and factual information can be used.Include Examples,Facts,data, diagram, maps, wherever possible.Conclusion: Should be around 20-30 words. Should involve some innovative suggestion. Govt schemes can be mentioned. It must be positive and not criticalOptional-Commerce and Accountancy Part I \u2013 Practical in nature. It hasAccountancy, Cost Management, Financial Management, Taxation and Auditing. The syllabus is of CA-IPCC Level. So the key is practice as much as you can. The theory part in Paper 1 is generally repetitive in nature and one must go through the previous year exam papers to get an understanding on the types of questions asked. She followed Rankers IAS notes and attempted mock tests. As she was devoting 2-2.5 hours everyday, she did fine in tests and final papers. Part 2- Theoretical- The subjects are- Human Resource, Organisation Behaviour, Organisation Theory, Industrial Relations. For these, She followed Ranker IAS notes and also followed the recent news article that were touching this subject. Some points to be considered for attempting theory papers are: Try to make you answers crisp and add as much content as you can precisely.Substantiate your answers with examples.Draw diagrams wherever possible.Give recent statistics or legislations related to questions asked.Underline the most important words in your answer.I am herewith attaching her marksheet so that you can understand how much her strategy paid off.  Apart from this, you must study NCERT Books as they are the base of everything and you will be able to understand different topics very easily. I expect that most of you will have NCERT Books but if you don't have them then I am providing you with a link from where you can download them for free in PDF format. Go and download them and start studying. Go Guys!

            "answer_text": "Yes , you CAN and you SHOULD . I always suggest to go without coaching as coaching has become almost redundant today because of online initiatives. Coaching classes only burn a BIG HOLE in your pocket and waste your precious time . I am reproducing one of my previous answers where I have provided a comprehensive and detailed strategy to crack UPSC. Are you really serious about the attempt ? Are you willing to give 110% ? If yes , then First and foremost understand that you will need to really fire on all cylinders to complete the syllabus and be competent enough to clear the exam. This should be rough time table and guidelines ,please tweak it to suit your needs. Break the available time into months , weeks , days. Before starting anything , do previous year question papers thoroughly . This will be very very helpful , don't discard it as useless activity. It should take around 10 days. Try and finish all relevant NCERTS in max 20 days. Give INSIGHTS and VISION\u2019s test based on NCERTS. Move on to reference books . I'll give you a rough time taken to complete the books. Laxmikant for polity - 15 days .Spectrum for modern history - 10 daysShankarias for environment- 10 daysClass 11th NCERTS for geography - 8 daysEconomy videos or class 12th Macroeconomic with Sriram notes - 10 days.Ancient and medieval you should do from MRUNAL videos and make notes out of it (you don't have time to read books and this topic has low cost benefit ratio) - 5 daysAs you can see you will take approximately 2 months to complete standard reference books . Meanwhile keep reading the Hindu and please don't make notes out of it (it's too time consuming ) . Instead follow INSIGHTS dialy Current affairs , coupled with ONLY IAS analysis. 3 months would have gone in a jiffy !!!!! Start giving full length mock tests for prelims from VISION and INSIGHTS (both complement each other pretty well). Analyse each mock thoroughly and revise it umpteen number of times . Neglect the revision part at your own cost because in the exam hall when you are required to analyse and recall minute details , it is the revision which would come at your rescue. Slowly steadily start reading daily mains answer writing at one of the online website preferably INSIGHT . When you have a decent knowledge base you can start answer writing (don't spend too much time on it though!!) After this for next 2\u20133 months you should keep revising the NCERTS , standard books , mock papers. Looking at this year's prelims it's clear as daylight that prelims would require full fledged preparation . Also prepare your optional in this time , you should have completed at least one reading before PRELIMS !! Last 2\u20133 months focus should be completely on prelims. Solve mocks , revise them . Various coaching institutes would give last minute revision modules. Do them , even if they don't come in exam directly but they surely help in developing our intelligent guessing !!! Ant further doubts ,please DM me or comment below or go through my other answers for booklist and other queries. All the best !!! Thank you . ",
