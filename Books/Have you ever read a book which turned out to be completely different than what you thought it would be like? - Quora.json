            "answer_text": "Yes, lately I read two books, they turned out to be different than I thought. First was a short story book, Slices of Life by Richa Gupta. It was based on women\u2019s issues that they face silently in our societies. Their pain and suffering was highlighted with subtly. That book informed me much about being a woman. The second book was an anthology of poems. Moments of Life by Benisha Nadar. The book narrated the phases of life via poems. So, when I grown old, probably I may face the same issues. Thus, better I prepare myself than losing everything. I thought this going to be an immersive poem book, well it turned out to be a realistic book. ",
