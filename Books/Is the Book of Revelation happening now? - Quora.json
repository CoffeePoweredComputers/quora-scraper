            "answer_text": "So many Christians have a complete misunderstanding of the \u201crevelation\u201d of the Apostle John [born 6 A.D.] because their teachers and preachers are inept and blind. Many, not all, impute external ideas into passages to project a progressive application of specific beliefs in a very cult like fashion. The truth is Jesus Christ from Heaven instructed John to write down \u2018these things that will \u201cshortly\u201d come to pass\u2019. The timeline was not a long range, final generation message. It was a message of urgency for Christians who were alive or born shortly after the ascension of Jesus Christ into Heaven. The initial recipients of this message were seven literal churches in Asia Minor that we know as Turkey today. The only time all of these seven literal churches were in existence was in the 60s and 70s in the 1st century. These churches were located on the equivalent to major interstates today that were travelled by sojourners between Judea and Athens. Keep in mind that John was a political prisoner of Nero. When Nero committed suicide [June 9, 68 A.D.], political prisoners were released. This was Roman Law. But Roman legions were dispatched in 66 A.D. to squash the will of the Judeans [Jews] who were war-making against Rome. Remember Jesus said before the Temple was destroyed you will hear of wars and rumors of wars before the Temple would be destroyed. [Matt 24] The Temple was completely destroyed in 70 A.D. John went to live out his life in Ephesus after his release from Patmos. His exact date of death not known. Jesus\u2019s message to each church was specific. It would have conveyed His intimate knowledge of each assembly of Christians in nature, faith issues, and problems. This was a demonstration of the Lordship of Jesus Christ from Heaven, and that He was active in promoting the true evangelical good news message. But, concurrently with the spread of the gospel, many hardships in the form of calamities, death by war, death by disease, death by famines, and death by martyrdom would come. All these things happened shortly and quickly. But, all these things were permitted and under the control of Jesus Christ. Angels, seals, horses, riders. All these mediums REVEAL that Jesus Christ is Lord and in control of all of human history. This is how the intuitive Christian reader would perceive this message and truth. The still standing Temple in Revelation conveys the fact that when this book was being written and sacrifices were still on-going in Jerusalem. But since 70 A.D. not a single animal sacrifice to cover the sins of Jews has been offered. Reason: the perfect Lamb of God completed an eternal blood offering for the sins of all who would believe by faith in Jesus. The earthly Temple in Jerusalem would be replaced by a living temple in the heart of each believer. [Hebrews should be read side by side with Revelation to grasp the \u201cspiritual Magna Charta\u201d of Jesus Christ as Messiah. Superior as King, as Priest, and as Lord.] The prophecy of the seven kings and then an eighth applies to the Julio-Gallo line of Caesars known to the entire Roman world. This ascribes a history line to the target period of completion. Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar[Jesus Birth], Tiberius Caesar [Jesus Crucifixion], Caligula Caesar, Claudius Caesar, Nero Caesar [persecutions], and Galba Caesar. The collective is described as the \u201cbeast\u201d. Regarding the 7\u2026.5 have fallen[died] 1 is [Nero] and 1 has not yet been appointed. [Rev 17:9] This pinpoints the exact date of the writing. Nero was still alive when this letter was written. Babylon represents the world system that is alienated from Almighty God by sin. Rome is Babylon. But surprisingly, Jerusalem sides with Babylon when she rejects Jesus Christ. JERUSALEM has become the harlot. True Israel is a Spiritual Israel[Rom 9] not a genetic Israel [John 3]. The Apostle John is surprised as to the identity of the Harlot. But time and time again, God regarded Israel as being unfaithful to Him choosing unfaithfulness. It should not come as a surprise that the stoning of Jerusalem from the catapults of Roman machines was a figurative stoning of a harlot based on the law of God. So the tumult upon Jerusalem to destroy her would not be the finality to faith. Jesus Christ will return as King of Kings and Lord of Lords. He will rightly judge the dead and the living. But subsequently to His 2nd Coming, there would be a complete New Heaven and New Earth, a forever home for all the faithful forever. This is a very condensed synopsis. It is a preterist view. But the point is, there is ample historic evidence to view the message to the early church as one of encouragement in all circumstances because victory has already been assured in Jesus Christ regardless of the circumstances of peril that will result in major suffering for some\u2026.particlularly these early churches! The message to the church today\u2026\u2026there is victory in JESUS! We see how history ends. [Rev 22] Jesus is in control from the 1st century through the very last day. Live for Christ! ",

            "answer_text": "Some of it is happening now . A good part of it is about to happen in the very near future. If you begin reading at revelation 17:16 it gives you something that you're right on the verge of . Notice it talks about the 10 horns and the beast who hate the prostitute . The word 10 in The Bible sometimes can mean completion so when it's talking about the 10 horns it's talking about all the political powers of the Earth right now . The beast in the setting is the United Nations . The prostitute is false religion which prostitutes itself with the political powers of the Earth . Notice how when a country wants to go to war , assuming it's not Communist , They have the clergy stand behind them and get those young boys to go kill people for them. Look at Revelation 17:17 And you will see that it is God who puts it in the minds and hearts of these political powers to give the United Nations teeth and have them close the world Empire of false religion . When you begin revelation chapter 18 the world Empire of false religion is now called by another name Babylon the great . If you have any doubt that this is the world Empire false religion go down and look at Revelation 18:23 . Notice once she is closed there is never heard in her another bride or bridegroom again. Notice when you start to read revelation chapter 19 this is the battle of Armageddon . Notice it tells you in there that all the military's will be destroyed , that's all over the Earth . If you think about it how could they possibly survive a battle against God his son and hundreds of millions of angels that work for God ? After all the people in the military are just flesh and blood . Then when you finish reading revelation chapter 19 look at revelation 20 satan the devil is locked away . Locked away for what ? JW . ORG I just remembered one of my favorite times sharing this information . It was a born again lady who was renting a property from me . She said you CAN'T have it right ,if you were right that would decimate the financial system because sooo much money is spent on religious holidays . I highlighted Revelation 18:11-13 for her and she was fit to be tied . Lol . Jehovah puts life or death in front of all of us . Deuteronomy 30:19 ",
