            "answer_text": "How can I get a start-up business loan?  This is probably the answer that you\u2019re not looking for. You want the details and people/banks/organizations to be laid in front of you, but there is no such list. At least not to start-up. TL;DR: Don\u2019t get a loan even if you can. I suggest you to go for gov. grants, startup competitions to earn monetary prizes (plus you get fair visibility there too) and crowdfunding. Those are the best ways to fund your startup in the beginning. The reason; The word \u201cloan\u201d indicates something to be put down as contingency of future failure, plus an increase in the lent amount (interest) for an agreed amount of time , for something urgent at the moment. For example: $40000 loan indicates; $40000 + %interest / # of months, with $40K worth of real estate to be put down as contingency. Thus a loan consists of Proper deadline of paybackContingency for failure of paybackInterest rateWhen you start-up, you cannot guarantee a deadline for payback because nothing really on its proper path in the beginning. Everything has a fair amount of chance to go sideways, and everything will go sideways at least once. You know it and the lender knows it too. You maybe are crazy enough to put your assets down for something you aren\u2019t really sure whether will work or not, but the lender is not that crazy to give you a loan knowing that s/he will have to fight for it later on. In other words, unless you have some assets that you can write off, you can\u2019t get a loan to start-up. And it is completely unwise to get a loan to start-up. ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of ways you can obtain a business loan. Most business owners will first try going through their bank to get financing, but the fact is more than 80% of small business owners are denied a loan from the bank (particularly startups). Additionally, of those businesses that DO get funded, more than 60% of them report that they didn\u2019t get the full amount that they had applied for. Clearly, this is a pressing issue for any small business owners or entrepreneurs - so what\u2019s the solution? In recent years, developments in digital technology have made an impact across many different industries, including the financial market. If you\u2019ve never heard of the term before, \u201cfintech\u201d or financial technology is completely changing the face of how people interact with money matters. How does this relate to your question? Two words: online funding. While in the early to mid-2000s leaps and bounds were being made in the realm of social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.), the last 10 years or so have been an era of digital innovation in the field of financing. Fintech companies focused on all different areas have been jumping at the opportunity to revolutionize the way businesses not only handle their money (by inventing new security systems, for one) but also the way that business access money. One of those fintech companies that is primarily focused on the actual financing of businesses is Lending Express. Admittedly, I may be a bit biased, but only because I\u2019ve already had a great experience with them. That being said, what I saw in the process of applying was a business lending platform that truly grasps the needs of its customers and the applicability of technology to make a spectacular customer experience. What does Lending Express do? Lending Express helps small-to-medium sized businesses improve their ability to obtain financing. They use high-tech algorithms to analyze your business and then match your business with the loan provider that\u2019s the optimal fit. What they do that\u2019s different from other alternative lending platforms is provide transparency by telling you exactly what is keeping you from getting a better financing option. They then give you personalized guidance on how to improve those specific factors that are limiting your access to more funding solutions. Of course, as I pointed out above, there are a lot of different ways to obtain business funding. In my experience of applying through banks and through other online lenders - Lending Express does it best. In any case, best of luck! Hope this helped out! ",

If your startup business is a brand-new business, my suggestions for funding would be:Business credit cardPersonal loanStartup business loanFamily/friendsCrowdfundingInvestorsAll have their pros and cons, which you can read more about here: Best Loan Options for Startups and New Businesses | Lending Express here: Business Loan vs Personal Loan: What's the Difference? | Lending Express and here: Using Credit Cards To Fund Your Business Startup: Yes or No? | Lending Express 2. If you define a startup as a business less than a year old, then you have more options available to you. If your business is 6+ months old you could qualify for a business loan in addition to the options mentioned above. Most lenders will fund a business that\u2019s been operating for at least 6 months (some lenders will even fund 3-month old businesses) as long as you can show a steady revenue stream and overall business health. Loans from online lenders are pretty easy to come by, with very little if any documentation required. You usually just need to show a few months\u2019 bank statements and proof of ID. How to get a loan for your startup business: I recommend applying through an online lender. My business Lending Express takes this up to the next level.

How much will rates go up? The insurance industry has already said they will raise rates. A few years ago when insurance became mandatory, they raised the rates too. As much as 100%. What\u2019s your guess as to how badly the will gouge their customers this time?\u201d Citroen c2 1.4 insurance why so expensive how to get smaller quote? I just bought a C2 1.4 04 plate less than 30000 on clock semi auto and when I came to insure it nearly died! More than I paid for car! I am 30 and have been driving for 5 years, the first year I had my own car then I have driven hire cars or been a named driver on relatives cars. No claims, points, accidents or offences. WHY SO EXPENSIVE??? Please help me I feel in so annoyed as can\u2019t drive without insurance and at this rate can\u2019t afford to insure!

Thx =]\u201d Will applying for medicaid affect the insurance I have now in any way? I am 32 weeks pregnant and I am covered under my dad\u2019s insurance through Tricare. I remain eligible under his insurance until I am 23 and everything is full coverage. However, as soon as my baby is born he is not covered at all. I am looking into my options and I read that if I apply for medicaid now, then I can call the day my baby is born and just have him added on so that way he will have coverage right away. I am worried if I do try and apply for medicaid now that it will affect the insurance I am covered under now by Tricare. I do want to stay under tricare, I do not want to lose this insurance and its coverage if that is the case. I am also worried that since I have to wait until the baby is born to apply him for his own insurance through CHIP or Medicaid - whichever one he ends up qualifying - that I will have to wait a long time before he is actually covered and I know the baby is going to need check ups and a pediatrician right away. I am really worried about all this and wondering what is my best option and what I should do! Will I lose my insurance if I apply for Medicaid in advanced so my baby will be covered right away? Is my best option waiting until the day he is born and then applying? I also live in PA if that makes any difference. Anybody who can help out, thanks!\u201d Does your parents car insurance increase when you get a drivers permit? question above How much will my mom\u2019s car insurance go up after I crashed her car? I\u2019m almost 19, got my license about 8 months ago now. I was in a drive-thru going only 10 KM an hour at most and accidentally rear ended a car after I panicked and accelerated. My mom\u2019s car definitely had the most damage done. All of the other people involved only had slight dents or scratches. I think the damage is around $3000. I know my mom has really good insurance and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s no-fault (and it happened on a private property). How likely is it that her insurance will go up? Oh and for the record my mom has NEVER had a ticket or been involved in an accident before. Stupid me.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "When it comes to startups the main question entrepreneurs juggle with is, \u201cwhere is the money?\u201d. Apart from investors, Indian banks are also taking a keen interest in facilitating new age entrepreneurs with attractive business loans and various funding schemes. Let\u2019s take a look at what do these banks have in store for startups and how to incur sweet benefits using business loans from banks for growth and sustainability. Bank Loan for Startups Today, banks thrive harder to provide monetary security by introducing special business loans which include: Working Capital Loan The purpose is to fund company\u2019s every day or short-term operational needs. These needs include wages, rent, inventory costs and so on. Seasonal businesses can opt for a working capital loan as their business activity is reduced or low otherwise. For example, companies manufacturing firecrackers will make maximum sales during Diwali whereas companies producing umbrellas will make most profits from June to September in India. Term Loan This type of loan is granted to small businesses in mainly hard cash in order to purchase fixed assets. Fixed assets include tangible goods \u2013 laptops, machinery & equipment, furniture, vehicles and intangibles \u2013 goodwill, copyrights, patents, to name a few. Term loans are sanctioned to borrowers for a fixed amount and time period. Approximately, the repayment process can extend to 1-25 years. Intermediate Term: This type of term loan runs for less than 3 years and is paid in monthly installments. A balloon payment process, wherein a portion of the total amount is paid initially and the rest is paid altogether in the final repayment, is also eligible here.Long Term: As the name suggests, it can last up to 3-25 years. The most common type of long-term loan is bonds. Bond sales bring in immediately. The only distinguisher between an intermediate and long-term loan is the time period for which the loan is sanctioned. It also limits other financial support a company may take on such as other debts, dividends, etc.Secured Loan In this type, the borrower pledges his property or other valuable assets to the lender, in this case, a bank, in order to secure loans. This pledged property is known as a collateral. Once the collateral is secured by the bank, it has full authority and charge over it. It means, it can be seized, liquidated or sold by the bank at any time in case, the borrower faulters to repay in time. Here the bank evaluates the company\u2019s (borrower\u2019s) present earnings over its credibility. Mortgages are a classic example of secured loans. For instance, if, you pledge your current home or previous office for your new startup up venture to the bank in opposition to a business loan, then the bank has complete power over your pledged asset or collateral. In case you fail to repay, the bank will take over your collateral completely. Unsecured Loan These are the exact opposite of secured loans. No collaterals or seizing is involved here. The banks lend loans to companies solely on the basis of company credibility history. The credit must be really high to be able to get unsecured loans. Unsecured loan has high rate of interest compared to secured loans because it is risky for the banks to lend such big amounts without any security involved as such. Unlike secured loans, where the banks can repossess the collateral if company defaults repayment, in case of defaulting under the unsecured loan, the bank can trigger a collection agency to collect the debt amount or it can drag the company to the court. Business loans in India are usually granted for an amount ranging from Rs. 50,000 to 75 Lakhs. But this amount may vary as per the terms and conditions laid down by the banks. However, it is always recommended to go through the T&C before finalizing any type. Business Loan Sanction Process Decide: How much money you actually require? Which bank you want to opt for? How many years the repayment process take? And so on. In this process, you can also take a glance at your own credit history \u2013 personal and professional. Banks require clean records to build trust. The Plan: Draft a detailed and crisp business plan, because your preferred banks, will want to know why, where and how much they investing or lending? This plan is crucial not only for the bank\u2019s clarity beam but also for your own clarity. At times, we do ask for more when in reality we don\u2019t need that much at that moment. Application: Once all the above answers are in place, proceed towards gathering and compiling all your documents. The basic documentation required is: For Id & Address Proofs \u2013Aadhaar CardDriving LicensePAN CardPassportVoter\u2019s IdFinancial Proofs \u2013Bank Statements (last 6 months)Latest ITR with computed incomeCA Certified/Audited Balance sheet & PnL account (last 2 years)Proof of Continuation (Establishment/ Sales Tax Certificate/ ITR)Legal Proofs \u2013Sole Proprietor Declaration or Certified Copy of Partnership DeedCertified true copy of Memorandum & Articles of AssociationAssessment: After you have submitted your application form with all the required documents (mentioned above), the bank assessment and verification process commencement. The assessment mainly takes place on the basis of the type of loan you have opted for and hence credibility. Response: Depending on the assessment, your application will be approved or disapproved. *The entire business loan sanction process may take up to a minimum of 60-90 days to get completed. Eligibility Criteria Who can apply or avail a business loan in India? Self Employed Professionals & Non \u2013 ProfessionalsArchitectsChartered Accountant (CA) & Company Secretary (CS)Entities (traders & manufacturers) \u2013 Partnerships, Limited Liabilities Partnerships, Private Limited Partnerships, Limited Companies.What factors decide the eligibility?

            "answer_text": "Joy Atlast Post provided a very detailed response. Kudos to her! I do want to point something very important. It is the financial institution that has the ultimate authority on whether or not they will move forward with the loan request upon completion of the application. The financial institution will be the lender, the SBA is only the guarantor. The SBA does not loan money. The best thing you can do to help you, is to follow Joy\u2019s advice. Even if you do your due diligence, there is no guarantee you will get a loan. As a Business Consultant for over 20 years, I have been exceptionally successful in obtaining monies for my clients, in the form of loans and grants. I did attempt to apply for a loan. I applied at my bank, Paypal, and a CDFI. I was not successful in having the application processed. However, to be honest, if the loan amount is not over $150,000 USD, the possibility of a loan application to be processed is quite minimal because there is not a good profit margin for the financial institution. It is a fact. As I research how the monies are distributed, it is quite interesting that small mom and pop businesses, independent contractors, and micro enterprise businesses do not get their loan applications processed. Recently the Federal government changed their requirements because there is still money in the pot they need to distribute. In the changes they included small mom and pop businesses, independent contractors, and micro enterprise businesses. It is a telling story when they made this change. I found another way of staying alive and in business. Good luck to you! ",

            "answer_text": "Despite an often desperate need for capital, small businesses can struggle to secure a loan from a traditional bank. The process is time-consuming and the qualifications are limiting. But as with most other aspects of our lives, the loan process has been changed by COVID-19. It can help to know what lenders expect for different types of loans: ACH loan, which is ideal for addressing cash flow issues (If you\u2019ve been in business for more than 6 months and have revenue of more than $10k, this could be a good fit)Business line of credit is one of the most flexible lending options (available to those in business more than two years and with revenue of more than $15k, with decent credit)SBA 7(a) loans, which feature low interest rates, but more paperwork to secure (open to companies at least two years old with a minimum of $20k in revenue and a good credit score)That said, loans are considered on a case-by-case basis, so there is some wiggle room. Of course, these are just a few examples. There are far more options available to small businesses that consult with a bank or lending marketplace expert who can walk them through the process of securing a loan. ",

When you are applying for a business loan from the bank, your financial documents should be meticulously detailed. You should also have extensive plans outlining how you will achieve success. The time and the documentation that goes into getting the loan is extensive and in the end they might require collateral then base the loan on your personal finances not the financials of the business. Because of these things people seek out business funding from alternative sources that are unsecured based on the business. While these cost more than a traditional loan, they can be approved the same day with funding up to $200,000 with simple limited documentation. 4\u20136 months of Business Bank statements and an application.Additional documents are required for larger funding amounts, ( tax return and P and L statements) with an additional waiting time of 24\u201348 Hours.

(Real estate equity is good, no collateral is bad)2. Does the person have any direct experience running a business similar to the type they want to get a loan for? (years of experience is good, no experience is bad)3. Does the person applying for the loan have good credit? (700 or better is good)4. What is the purpose of the loan? (buying real estate and fixed assets like equipment is good, making payroll and paying for marketing is bad)5. Does the person applying for the loan have any personal assets to help secure the loan if the loan cannot be fully secured by business assets?6. Does the person applying for the loan have any cash to put into the business? (20% or more of the total project to fund is good and anything less is much more difficult) So ultimately, it depends on how a person has handled their own personal finances to determine the likelihood and probability of getting a start up business loan.

            "answer_text": "Essential Things to Keep in Mind before Applying for a Personal Loan.  Many people take the help of a personal loan to borrow funds when they don\u2019t have enough funds to meet their immediate requirements. It is indeed a good way of escaping from the financial crisis. A personal loan can be used for various purposes like consolidating the debts, financing your education, buying something expensive, paying for medical procedures etc. Firstly, you should avoid taking any loan if you can manage the funds somehow or it is not that much necessary. But, if you really need it, then you should keep a few things in your mind before applying for a personal loan. Yes, having adequate knowledge about the loan is necessary for saving yourself from any future tensions or problems. Read on to know the main things which you should consider before applying for a personal loan: Check the Interest Rates:You should know that personal loan is accompanied by interest rates like any other loan. But, the main thing to notice here is that you have to pay higher interest rates in case of unsecured personal loans. These loans aren\u2019t backed up by any collateral security, so; the interest rates are higher in these as compared to all the other loans. You should also know that some people can get a personal loan in lower interest rates. You can also be one of them if you have a high credit score and a good profile matching all the eligibility criteria. Know about Other Costs Involved:Apart from interest rates, there are some other amounts that you also have to pay while taking a personal loan. Knowing about all the costs involved is very important for you as you will have to arrange them accordingly. You should enquire the lender bank about these costs beforehand as these differ from bank to bank. The main costs involved are: Processing Fee:Usually, every bank charges 1-2% of the loan amount as the processing fee of the loan. These charges add to the total amount that you have to repay to the bank. The percentage of processing fee is written in the loan papers. Otherwise, you can also ask the bank representatives about this cost. Prepayment Fee:Sometimes, people take a loan to start a business or invest in some profitable endeavour. In such cases, people earn enough and become capable of paying off the whole loan amount before ending of the tenure. People prepay the loan to save the absolute interest cost. Banks charge prepayment penalty cost in such cases to make sure that people don\u2019t prepay. You should ask about these costs too. Late Payment Fee:Banks charge some extra amount as the penalty in case you won\u2019t be able to pay the EMI within the prescribed time period. Knowing about this fee is important as you may face this situation while repaying the loan. Check the Eligibility Criteria:Banks are there to provide loans, but only to those who have to ability to pay back the amount after a fixed certain period of time. Many people often forget this simple thing while applying for a personal loan. You should not be one of them and check the eligibility criteria before applying for the personal loan. The eligibility terms differ from bank to bank, but most of these banks will lend you money easily if you have a decent earning, you work in a reputed company or run a profitable business, you have a decent credit score, and you have never done any fraud with banks in the past. Still, you should visit the specific bank\u2019s website from which you are planning to get the personal loan and read each and every term carefully. Don\u2019t waste your time by applying if you don\u2019t fit in the criteria. Know about the Documents Required:You have to submit several documents to prove your eligibility while applying for the personal loan. You should know about these documents beforehand so that you can collect and submit them. Usually, everyone keeps their basic documents handy like identity proof, birth certificate etc. But, the problem arises, especially with the specific documents. For example, if you are a salaried person, then the bank will ask for the salary slip and the appointment letter as proof of your salary and occupation details. Now, many people don\u2019t have these documents because small companies often don\u2019t provide these things to their employees. Knowing about the documents beforehand will give you enough time to ask about these documents from your company and collect them for submitting. Check your Repayment Ability:Banks will check your repayment ability with the help of your credit score. You can also check your credit score beforehand to find out whether your loan application will be approved or not. But, apart from these scores, you should also know your real repayment capability by evaluating your regular expenses, your responsibilities etc. which banks can\u2019t know. At the end of the day, you are the person who has to repay the whole personal loanamount, that too with interest rates. So, you should check honestly whether you will be able to do it or not. If you are doubtful in this area, then try to drop the idea of taking the personal loan because you can be in real trouble in case you won\u2019t be able to pay off the loan on time. Instead, talk to your family and friends to collect the funds. If you think that your earning is enough to pay back the EMIs and bear other expenses at the same time, then go for it. Gaining adequate knowledge before applying for the loan will save you from regretting later. Yes, shortage of funds is a big tension, but having debts that you can\u2019t pay off is the bigger one. So, be vigilant before you apply for a personal loan. ",

            "answer_text": "This is going to be anecdotal. I like to give my answers to you based on experience as much as I can, but I have always found business lending to be unappealing, meaning it\u2019s much like personal loans but it\u2019s worse. I already mentioned the number of businesses that go out of business is very, very high and so basically, business lending is only for businesses that can easily afford it. If you\u2019re an existing business which has been trading for a while and your numbers look good then, you know, maybe business lending is okay for you, you\u2019ll get one. But if you\u2019re a start-up then the way I would answer the question directly is, how can I get a start-up loan? I would do it personally. If you can get a personal loan and lend it to your business that\u2019s what I\u2019d do but, you\u2019re at a disadvantage because starting up a business is difficult enough and then you\u2019re adding a loan on top of it. It may be necessary but as much as you can avoid that then I would, but if you\u2019re convinced about getting a loan I would do it personally because business loans are difficult to get for a start-up.

When I got my small business line of credit, it came as an offer in the mail. No application fee, no long forms, no collateral pledged.. Apparently, Capital One at the time was looking for other areas to diversify their offerings besides their popular credit card. I don\u2019t even remember doing much that filling out a bit of information and signing the agreement. These were the days of \u201ceasy credit,\u201d which are long gone since the real estate blow up. Will the purse strings loosen up again? Absolutely. Can you count on when that will happen? Not likely. For the most part it\u2019s well-covered by others\u2019 answers how difficult it is to get the SBA loans we all hear about. This is the standard. This is why the friends and family plan, or other types of credit are most often used by bootstrapping entrepreneurs.

            "answer_text": "Always exciting to start up a business! One very important step if you are looking for any kind of loan or investment in your business is creating a solid business plan. Any lender or investor would want to see the plan before committing a loan or investment. There are a number of options to get money for your startup, a loan being one of those options. If you're only looking for a loan you could get a personal loan, open a line of credit, apply for a business loan. These could be done through a financial institution or potentially your network (depending on your network). There are other options beyond getting a loan such as looking for business grants (there are many available), or looking for investors in your business. One of the things that we do is partner with entrepreneurs starting up a business and invest in them. It is a bit different than getting a loan, in that we own a percentage of the business meaning the money doesn't need to be paid back. The advantage of getting a partner/investor like this is you have someone else that is experienced helping which is typically way more valuable than the percentage of the business given up. Another option is to start very small and use sales to cover costs and grow slowly. Though this can be tough, is not always possible, and not always smart. Hope this helps.

Eligibility for business loans are contingent on a number of factors, but there are five big ones that go into consideration when assessing whether or not you\u2019re eligible for a loan. They are: Your personal credit score. The lender wants to make sure that you have a history of consistently paying your debts.Your time in business. The lender wants to see how your business has performed in the past. If you have not been in business for very long, lending money is very risky as you have not proven that your business is sustainable.Your business revenue. You need to be making enough money to repay the loan.Your debt service coverage ratio (DSCR). Similar to the above, you need to constantly have enough money left over after paying your expenses to handle making periodic loan payments.Collateral. If your lender has some way to get their money back in the event that you default on a loan, they\u2019re much more willing to lend you money.Each lender has different requirements regarding the above business characteristics. Some may require a credit score of 700, whereas others might only require a score of 500; some may require that your business is at least 2 years old, whereas other might only require 6 months in business; and so on. If you know what a lender requires for the above characteristics, you will be able to quickly assess whether or not you have a good chance of receiving funding.

            "answer_text": "You can have a great idea, a fantastic business plan and the professional chops to build a successful business, but if you don\u2019t have the funds your startup might never get off the launchpad. According to a 2017 survey from the Small Business Administration, personal savings and personal credit cards were two of the top funding sources for small-business startups, but 19% sought some form of capital. If you don\u2019t have a lot of savings or assets to liquidate, or don\u2019t want to risk wiping out what you do have, you may choose to look for a small-business startup loan. But the same risk that makes you hesitate to put all your personal savings on the line to start a business can make lenders wary about giving you a business loan. Many traditional business lenders want your business to be established before they will lend to you. The good news is, most small businesses don\u2019t need a huge sum of money to get started. In fact, according to the Small Business Administration\u2019s 2012 survey, nearly 40% of one-person small-business startups need less than $5,000 in capital to get started. At Avant, there's a minimum of $35,000 to be given out as a loan to investors and this is perfect for most small businesses. All you need is get on to invest in the company and be qualified to get a loan. No credit score but necessary questions would be asked for clarity of running accounts. All you need do is register with Avant and get pre-qualified! Feel free to send a DM if you've got more questions concerning Avant on instagram via www.instagram.com/sophia.armani.5 ",

I would like to advise and be a little cautious as far as shopping goes... if that involves running your credit with each lender you are doing yourself a huge disservice. This will not only drop your credit score but hinder your chance for getting the money you need.  We also suggest working with a business consultant or a finance broker. Someone that will really hear you out. Right now the market is filled with so much creative financing and it is especially important to be able to have a conversation with a well rounded organization that could help set you up for success.  Often times some companies only focus on one or couple of lending products and even though it seems you fit that product- you apply and notice a decline. If you have someone on your team and they are able to put the puzzle together before taking you to the lender and make sure you look bright under the best light! Our website covers many of these topics in great detail and someone from our team is always ready to help Diamond Business Loans. 888-620-3800 Additionally, you should NEVER have to pay an application fee unless you are certain that you will be refunded if the funding does not take place!

            "answer_text": "Meredith has given a great answer for small business owners located in the US. I will now try to add to it by making it applicable to borrowers from around the world. The first thing to understand is, that banks are not a good bet for the vast majority of entrepreneurs around the world. Indeed, there is a $2.5 trillion dollar investment gap for small and medium sized enterprizes according to the United Nations. This gap is the result of banks cutting back significantly on loans to small business owners. Why have they done that? Because, banks are not innovative enough to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers active in the digital economy. A bank simply hasn\u2019t figured out yet, that someone who sells thousands of items on Amazon every year, can be deemed creditworthy. Thus, banks consider it too risky and refrain from making capital available. The sad thing is, that even if you are lucky enough to find a bank that will lend to you, the interest rates may well be sky high. Small business owners in Brazil for example will have to pay around 32% interest per year on a bank loan. And that is on a SECURED loan, which involves collateral. On an unsecured loan, the interest rates are much higher. Add to this the inefficiency of banks and the arduous application process, and you can discount banks all together. Luckily, alternative financing platforms have emerged in recent years. One of these is Bitbond, a global peer to peer lending platform which specialises in loans to small business owners. Here, entrepreneurs from around the world can quickly, cheaply and efficiently apply for a loan to hire new staff, buy new inventory and grow their business. The application process takes less than 15 minutes, and can be done from the comfort of your home. Interest rates start at 1% per month, and there is only a single 1\u20133% origination fee which is deducted from the funded amount automatically. Bitbond is available to all small business owners, regardless of their location. Thanks for reading :) ",

To get a business loan you have to have a proper business plan, and proof to support that idea that your business would continue to run. In addition, the financial paperwork for a business loan can be extensive, especially if you\u2019re applying as a business that is not already established. An easier option would be to get a personal loan online, primarily because when you are getting a business loan, you\u2019re getting it on your own merit, and not the merit of your business. For this, all you need is strong financial background individually. You\u2019ll need your KYC documents, and bank statements, as well as a good credit score, and you\u2019re good to go. A Personal Loan can help you go a long way. ",

I have today received an email from them saying that We have amended the class of use on your policy due to the information provided by our claims department there is an additional premium of 21.38. This will be debited from the payment details we hold on file for you within the next ten days. Can they do this? I haven\u2019t amended any details and although I paid my car insurance last October in full for the year I didn\u2019t expect my payment details to be kept on file. Any statefarm agents that can help with a car insurance question? I had my auto insurance with state farm for several years. I used to live in Miami, Fl for pretty much the whole time until this past January that i moved to Orlando. Until now (October 2012) i hadn\u2019t changed my address because i was planning on going back but now that i decided to stay in Orlando i ended up changing to another insurance company because my policy was going to be A LOT cheaper. My question is, should i be able to get retroactive pay for the difference in my premium from the more expensive premium that i was paying in Miami and the much lower one from Orlando? I sent my state farm agent my lease contract since the beginning of the year and she said that they weren\u2019t going to allow it. Does that sound right? I know it was my responsibility to have my addresses changed but since i didn\u2019t and i was paying my premium for one city while living at another.

(I had no insurance, of course, I\u2019ve learned this lesson) Recently they\u2019ve filed suit against me for more money that they didn\u2019t receive from the insurance company. I can\u2019t afford an attorney and was about to hire a bankruptcy lawyer for all of this, but I recently found out from the insurance company that the case is closed. It\u2019s also been over a year as of a couple days ago and due to Tennessee\u2019s Statute of Limitations they can\u2019t claim any more money. So my question, the insurance company says it\u2019s closed and even said the attorney settling with them has closed the case. I call the opposing attorney myself and of course they say they can\u2019t discuss the case with me, even though I\u2019m just asking if the case still actually exists. They wont\u2019 give me a court date either so naturally, I\u2019m a bit suspicious. Should I be ready to put this behind me, or do law offices do this sort of thing all the time? They were recently paid out $10,000 from the insurance company I\u2019m making payments to. I really don\u2019t see where else they could find money given my situation.

That\u2019s because lenders want to see your average monthly revenue, time in business, assets, and possibly, your business credit score (Paydex), among other things. They need to see some proof that you have the ability to repay easily. There are some credit card stacking options for startups which are essentially a personal product: a service will apply for multiple cards for you and \u201cstitch\u201d together the total into a single line of credit. This product keys off of your personal credit score. Theoretically, you could get a maximum of $150k this way, and add additional amounts several times a year. You\u2019d have to have a great credit score and strong quality of credit. There are always collateral-backed loans available that use real estate as collateral. But it\u2019s hard to understand why anyone would risk owned real estate for a business idea that so far hasn\u2019t generated a dime. Startups can get funding from family members and friends or they can use equity financing. P2P lending may be an option for those with good credit and a strong track record. You can try to obtain angel investments as well. Or you can start a business with anywhere from $100 - $2,000 \u2014 a low-cost business that you fund with your own cash. That takes the stress off of you and it gives you a big experimental space to learn everything about running your own business and making it profitable. I hope that helps! ",

Indian Banks are having Crooked Managers, co-wards, lazy, and lethargic, who do not see your valuable assets., and simply take more time than 1 year., without saying whether they can give or not., and if they give they ask bribes, and charge more lending rates. Believe me. They take risk on Mallaya\u2019s & Nirav Modi\u2019s , Anil Ambani\u2019s or say so many companies taken 10000 ~ 50000 crores. - They see Branded Company with Big Money making Balance sheets.

You may be feeling down when you read my quora - but it is the reality. We saw every day so many people running around in Banks to get funds for their own ventures. but failed to get and failed to convince those Bank Managers. Indian Banking system & finacial system very urgently needs revival of policies. Here Politicians making this impossible. They fill their pockets., first.

            "answer_text": "Firstly, you can't just take out a business loan, you have to properly apply and then get approved to get the loan amount disbursed into your bank account - and to be able to do that, you have to be eligible for the loan. The whole things take a lot of time and there are a lot of processes involved. So, you can't just take out a business loan, you have to follow a proper process. To start with, find out the right loan to apply for. Even though you have the required clarity about the purpose of the loan and the type of loan you want to take, given the plethora of options and lenders available you'll have to choose the best among them. How can you do that? Define your loan expectations such as the loan amount you want, the minimum time you need to repay the loan, and at what interest rate (though you can't decide the interest rate on your own, you must have a range to define what's suitable for you). Once you're clear about all this, you can compare the credit options based on those factors and find the best options by narrowing down your list. Later on, you can check reviews about the lenders to further narrow down your list and find the most fitting option for yourself. Once you're done here, check the eligibility criteria and online application process. Use the mobile loan app if the lender has one in place to apply for the loan, it makes the whole process easier.

The big task is to arrange the loan to support your venture. A start up doesn't have a solid background like other companies, so the efforts to prove themselves worthy of a loan is an uphill climb. As a start up you can't promise a regular payback as everything depends on return of the gamble that you play with an idea. It might or might not turn out as you perceived and projected to lender. The best suited lenders for a start up are the angel funding companies. You need to put your best foot forward while presenting your idea to them,once they are confident you can get the ball rolling in your favor.

Many entrepreneurs and business owners believe they need a business loan but cannot explain exactly why. Banks and lenders make money available for specific reasons. Do you need to purchase equipment? That\u2019s an equipment loan/lease. Do you need to improve the office or space you work in? That\u2019s a tenant improvement loan or leasehold improvement loan. Does your business pay its bills every 30 days but collects cash from customers in 60 days creating a 30 day problem? That\u2019s called working capital. The more articulate you are in defining what your business needs, why it needs it and how it can pay for it you will increase your chances of being approved. Banks and lenders want to know your business can make the payments based on historical cash flow and that there are assets available either through you or the business to cover the loan amount in the event that you default on the loan. :) Watch my complete answer here:  ",

Most businesses usually require funding for meeting various requirements and they need this without any need to mortgage property or assets. Additionally, most businesses will be more comfortable if guarantors are not required for the loan. Every small and medium business is faced with a problem whenever collateral has to be put up for urgent funding. Several financial institutions usually offer business loans that are collateral free but sometimes the guidelines are quite stringent. You should always know the right amount to apply for based on your needs and should apply online swiftly along with uploading document copies that are needed. Some of these include the income tax returns, financial statements, KYC documents, bank statements, and business vintage. Bajaj Finserv is a great option in this regard since the online application, processing and verification procedures are fast and you get quick disbursal of urgent funds. There are Flexi Loan choices available for organizations as well. With pre-approved offers, you get special benefits including discounted rates of interest. You can also view all your loan information online as per your convenience. Doing your homework carefully before applying for a collateral free business loan is a must since you will naturally want to get the lowest possible rates of interest and other favorable terms and conditions. Make sure that all your documents are in order before applying. ",

Getting a loan specifically for starting a business is not likely without those other two.  To get a loan with good credit and no collateral, expect to pay highish interest, depending on just how good your credit is.  To get a loan with collateral, it depends on the collateral. If you have a house - you can get a second mortgage. If you have a car, you can get cash for a percentage of the equity (though the interest will be higher than a house).  Those two are probably easiest (unless we're talking pawn shop, but I suspect you need more money than that?) If you have other types of collateral, you'll need to find a lender specializing in that type of collateral. For example, if you have a bulldozer lying about, you'll need to find someone who will lend on the equity in a bulldozer.  ",

You can ask friends and family to give that initial funding . Post that you can approach a lot of angel investors . Angel investors are a group of people who invest in initial stage startups and are risk averse . A lot of angels like Hyderabad angels ,mumbai angels can be approached for this . After this stage your company will have funding as well as a network of people to guide you . after this stage once your company is operational and starts generating revenue you can approach seed funds for investments ranging from 100,000$ to as much as 500k$ . In every stage of the company you have to forgo a considerable portion of equity in exchange for an investment . The other option you have is to approach banks . You have two types of loans . Secured and unsecured . For unsecured loans you don't need any collateral (proof for bank to give loan ) . You can get upto 10 lakh and this loan is based on your credit history . For a secured loan you need to give a collateral . Hope this helps ",

Loaning to small businesses, especially startups, is a riskier proposition for banks than mortgage lending or lending to larger, established businesses. So picking the right institution for your needs is important. Do your research and look into how easily a financial institution can fund your business and how flexible they\u2019ve been with others.

            "answer_text": "Hi, Emily. Thanks for the A2A. Winston Rowe has already given you a great answer in terms of the SBA and its programs. In terms of getting approved for one, you need to start with a lender. Such as a traditional bank, a credit union, or another source. Even some of the online lenders, such as the one I refer people to, offer SBA loans. SBA loans are approved, or declined, based on pretty standard underwriting criteria. Things such as proving the ability to repay, having collateral, having the required equity injection (i.e. the cash you will put into the deal), etc. all improve your chances of getting approved. Where the SBA helps is in the guarantee they offer to the lender. This won\u2019t help a \u201cbad loan\u201d get approved. But, it might convince the lender to do the deal if the lender is \u201con the fence\u201d. You can learn more about business loans, including SBA loans, through my course on the topic. ",

First, you could apply for one or more personal loans based on your current credentials as a salaried person and accumulate the target figure of Rs 15 lakhs. But if you are considering quiting the job to start the business , then you have to make sure that you have enough resources to meet your EMI obligations for atleast a year since you can not expect your business to provide support by generating profit from day one. The other way is to form a company amongst your friends and approach a bank for loan in the name of the company. If you obtain a Term loan, you will get a moratorium for atleast 6 months. If it's a working capital loan, then you need to service the interest only.Make sure you take a clear cut stand regarding continuing or quiting your job. Most jobs do not permit dual activity in their service Regulations. Banks also do not prefer a part time Business Entrepreneur. ",

The criteria for state as well as the central government schemes is stringent and educated women, from stable income households, may sometimes not meet the eligibility criteria.. The most obvious choice then is of course banks, NBFCs and other lending institutes. With women empowerment taking centerstage, all state and private lending institutes are offering business loans for women who want to set up a small business. However, like with every other loan, the woman entrepreneur will have to meet the eligibility criteria of their lending institute and provide KYC and other documents.
