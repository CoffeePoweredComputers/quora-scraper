I still have his contact saved\u2026he checks all my status updates\u2026somewhere deep down I also update status so that I can see his \u201cseen\u201d\u2026 But now I have promised myself to stop my attempts to get him back\u2026he is all gone\u2026just one memory, one regret, one guilt I'll have till my last breath\u2026 Thought he is not dead yet but still if heaven give me one last hour to talk someone I lost it will be him\u2026always\u2026 Because I feel death vanishes all the possibilities of getting that person back\u2026but that one probability and one tiny unrealistic ray of hope is more painful than death.. I just want hear his voice that's it\u2026whatever he says\u2026I'll just listen him\u2026 ",
