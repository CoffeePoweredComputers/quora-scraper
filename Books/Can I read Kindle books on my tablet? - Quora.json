            "answer_text": "Yes. You can download the dedictaed Kindle App for your operating system - Android, iPadOs, Fire Os, and start reading. The apps provide more flexibility than the kindle e-readers due to night mode, ability to invert text color and a bunch of other features. If you have a windows tabler, amazon has discontinued the app for that but, depending on your tablet, you can read kindle ebooks using the Kindle Cloud Reader feature available on the Amazon Website.
