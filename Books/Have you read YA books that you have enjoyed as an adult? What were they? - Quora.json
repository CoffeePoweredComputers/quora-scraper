I\u2019LL GIVE YOU THE SUN by Jandy Nelson (get tissues out and ready)FANGIRL by Rainbow RowellTHE RAVEN CYCLE by Maggie Stiefvater (cheating bc this is a series)THE HATE U GIVE by Angie Thomas \u2014 I especially suggest this if you are a teacher/student reading TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Read THUG along with TKAM and then discuss the differing narratives, historical contexts, and systemic racism in the US from then to now.A MONSTER CALLS by Patrick Ness (tissues are also a good suggestion for this one)",

Also, depends on what you call YA. The Harry Potter books are fantastic, and they\u2019re technically children\u2019s lit. The Lord of the Rings were written for children but they are adult fiction imo and are incredible of course. ",
