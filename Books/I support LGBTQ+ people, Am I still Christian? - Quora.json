            "answer_text": "Emlyn Shen has a really great answer, Emlyn Shen's answer to I support LGBTQ+ people, Am I still Christian? I want to add to her last point, from the perspective of someone who doesn\u2019t attend church. \u201cIf you believe, if you have that faith, you are a Christian. And, even if you don\u2019t, I firmly believe Jesus would still open up his table to you.\u201d During the summers of 2012 and 2013 I worked as a counselor at CAMP Camp, a summer camp for special needs children and adults. From 2014 to 2018 I was a student at Columbia University. The experience I had with religious people within both of these communities was amazing. Just to be clear, I\u2019m not saying I never encountered someone homophobic or that I never meet someone who tried to force their faith on someone else. But the counselors I met at CAMP were often religious, the vast majority of them being some denomination of Christian. Our counselors loved their campers, and for many of them, that love was interwined with their faith. Moreover because of the inclusive nature of the camp, counselors within the LGBT community were a part of that communal spirit. Instead of rejecting LGBT counselors due to some native \u201csinful\u201d aspect of them, these counselors dedicated themselves to this communal love, a love that was inherently linked to god and inclusive of all members of the community. They did not shy away from religious expression, but their expression allowed for the acceptance of those outside the traditoinal interpretation of their creed. You could be gay, you could be non religious, but as long as you were at that camp, that love would extend to you. It was similar at Columbia. Christian groups there were incredibly inclusive, and made explicit outreaches to the gay and trans communities. They were commited to their faith, but their interpretation was based on tolerance and communal goodwill, one that outweighed the restrictions often associated with their creed. Within both these communities there was a palpable sense of love, one that I know several in the LGBTQ+ community benefited from. They didn\u2019t restrict the communal affection encouraged by faith, instead they increased the \u201celigible\u201d recipients of that affection. In both CAMP and Columbia, this expansion allowed those of varying faiths, sexualities and genders to recieve food, housing and a social foundation to fall back on. It was beautiful, and to many it was invaluable. I don\u2019t want to minimize the harm some christians have done to the lgbtq community. But please know that there are many who choose to expand their love instead of contract it, and that there are countless members of this community who have had their lives enriched by these christians. Lord knows I\u2019m grateful for meeting them. ",

            "answer_text": "I am LGBT+. I am also Christian. There\u2019s a church I quite like, small and part of the Disciples of Christ denomination. One of the keys of that particular denomination is the ability for singular churches and even church members to make their own decisions on what they believe is moral. This church was founded for a specific group that the pastor refers to as \u201cspiritual refugees.\u201d She, and other Christians, felt that \u201ccircle drawing\u201d of who was allowed to sit at Jesus\u2019 table was entirely ridiculous; Jesus made it very clear that all should be welcome at his table. One of those excluded groups, spiritual refugees from closed-minded and judgemental churches, was LGBT+ people. Whether or not being gay or trans or bi or NB is against the Bible is hotly debated. Biblical text is torn apart, page by page, word by word. There\u2019s solid, solid arguments as to why the Bible is ultimately neutral or positive towards gender and sexual minorities. There\u2019s also solid arguments as to why the Bible is misconstrued to be against LGBT+ people, mostly based on poor/biased/misleading translations. But I also think making those arguments misses the point. Being Christian is not about legalistic arguments of morality and sin. Being Christian is about believing in the Christian God and the Gospel story, and taking those ideals to heart: love and the knowledge that we are all forgiven of our sins and saved by grace. If you believe, if you have that faith, you are a Christian. And, even if you don\u2019t, I firmly believe Jesus would still open up his table to you. ",
