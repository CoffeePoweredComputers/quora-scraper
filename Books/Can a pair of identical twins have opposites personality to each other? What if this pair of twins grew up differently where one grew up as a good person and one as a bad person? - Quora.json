            "answer_text": "Q. Can a pair of identical twins have opposites personality to each other? What if this pair of twins grew up differently where one grew up as a good person and one as a bad person? - \"In twin studies it had been clear that even though the twins are identical (monozygotic), there are still some differences between them that emerges over time,\" says Gerd Kempermann, a behavioral geneticist at the Dresden University of Technology and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Disease in Germany. \"Identical twins are often amazingly similar, but mothers and close relatives can still tell them apart easily.\"Importantly, identical twins raised in the same household \u2014 the same \"outer\" environment \u2014 still develop personality differences over time. Behavioral geneticists have long pegged these differences to influences by the \"non-shared environment,\" though there's no real consensus on exactly what the non-shared environment consists of, Kempermann told io9. In twin studies, he says, these non-shared environmental influences essentially boil down to the individual experiences siblings have, and their own personal interactions with their environment.From https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-do-i... - Twins studies have been so popular that one 2015 meta-analysis found that researchers had looked at no fewer than 17,800 traits \u2014 including depression, cardiovascular disease and gun ownership \u2014 involving more than 14.5 million twin pairs over the past 50 years. It concluded that both \u201cnature\u201d (what you\u2019re born with) and \u201cnurture\u201d (what you\u2019ve been exposed to as you age) are nearly equally important for understanding people\u2019s personalities and health: The variation for traits and diseases was, on average, 49 percent attributable to genes and 51 percent to environment.From https://www.washingtonpost.com/n... - -Because personalities are not determined by genetics, even identical twins can have totally different personalities. -In Western philosophy of science, all is based on materialism. All about living materials are based on genetics. Evolution of living organisms from simple unicellular organisms into complex multicellular animals (including human beings) is under the influence of genes. What makes those genes evolve like that? Genes themselves make it. If one gives enough time, continuous combination of genes (causing different arrangements of sequences of genes) will make evolution complete. So genes are everything. All the living things including human beings are under the influence of genes. So identical twins should have very similar habits, behaviors, interests, characters, personalities, intelligences and thinking processes, etc., because they have same (or almost same) combination of genetic sequence. -The identical twins will have similar physical structures according to same genes. But they will have different habits, behaviors, interests, characters, personalities, intelligences and thinking processes, etc., because those traits are not determined by genes. -One can observe whether above behaviors are genetic or not by studying identical twins. If those behaviors are genetic, identical twins will have same behaviors. If not, one will find different behaviors in identical twins. Actually, some behaviors can be observed since very young. If one observes very different behaviors within the same identical pair, personality traits are not genetic although they are present since very young. Some people explain the reason of different behaviors within same identical twins pair by interaction with environment after birth by those twins. But the explanation is not satisfactory enough. -In present day science of genetics and evolution concept, it cannot explain how the identical twins have different personalities, different I.Qs, different characters, different interests, even different sexual orientations, etc. Someone will see a lot of explanations with different mechanisms. But those different mechanisms can't explain the initial differences during the first 3- 5 years of ages. Genetics can only give identical external physical appearances. Genetics cannot determine so called internal characters. Those internal characters are determined (inherited) by different unique soul or spirit. -Although science cannot explain the cause of differences in internal characters between identical twins, extreme differences between children and their parents (i.e very, very far from the tree), those differences can be explained by rebirth concept. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, although the identical twins have identical physical appearances due to identical genes, each has different intelligence (I.Q), personality, character according to actions and habits, etc from previous individual's lifetime. So one will see different personality, character, intelligence and talent between identical twins. It must be miracle to see those identical twins have same or identical so-called internal characters between them because they have different souls. -And those extreme differences will be more and more common in society like USA because USA is the land of immigrants and rebirths may (or may not) occur in family of different cultures, different concepts, different values, etc, because one cannot select to rebirth in family with same culture, race with previous one. -But science will not accept that kind of answer because science has no concept of soul and science denies concept of rebirth. -Which concept is right? -One needs to look into identical twins studies (made without bias). Thousands of twins pairs were studied by scientists in the past. Or one can ask directly to those twins or their parents if you have friends with them. - - How an identical twins pair ends up with different behaviors, personalities Child prodigy in piano playing -In psychology research literature, the term child prodigy is defined as person under the age of ten who produces meaningful output in some domain to the level of an adult expert performer. Child prodigies are rare, and in some domains there are no child prodigies at all. Prodigiousness in childhood does not always predict adult eminence. (From wikipedia) -Some researchers believe that prodigious talent tends to arise as a result of the innate talent of the child, and the energetic and emotional investment that the child ventures. Others believe that the environment plays the dominant role, many times in obvious ways. -In child prodigy, there were many children talented in piano playing. They were recognized for piano playing ability since very young. Among them, many of them lost interest in piano playing in adulthood. Some of them continued to play in concert and are still famous as gifted piano players in later life. A small portion of them became famous composers in addition to gifted piano playing. What is certain is that those who continue to become musicians are devoting significant amount of time in practicing piano playing besides their in born talent of piano playing. It means they need a lot of practice to maintain the piano playing ability. -If someone is not a piano prodigy and if he is interested in playing piano, he has to do a lot of practice and needs a lot of years to become a professional piano player. -So what is the nature of child prodigy in piano playing? It is not due to inheritance from genetic traits because many of them have no talented piano players in their previous generations. Some said it is due to in-born trait (like just lucky brain development which makes one easy in learning piano playing). -In a book called the power of habit written by Charles Duhigg, there is a chapter about a man called Eugene Pauly who got viral encephalitis and it destroyed part of brain and made him permanent loss of the recent memory. He could remember his past, his previous experiences very well. But he could not remember what happened each and every moment after viral encephalitis. When he met a stranger and he was introduced to that man and made conversation with him for a time, he couldn't remember that particular man when he met again him later that day. He didn't even remember what he did an hour ago. After watching a particular TV program, when someone made him watch that again, he would watch that program as if entirely new to him. So he could not form recent memory and remote memory starting from the time of viral encephalitis. -When he was discharged from hospital, he and his wife moved into a new house with new environment. His doctors warned his wife not to get lose him. His wife took him on a walk outside their home, always together and always along the same route everyday for a period of time. But one day, Eugene went out without his wife and he returned safely later. When he was asked, he didn\u2019t know whether he went out along and how he walked back home without losing his way. (\u2026\u2026. It was clear to Squire (The scientist who made research on Eugene) that Eugene was absorbing new information. But where inside his brain was that information residing? How could someone find his way home when he had no idea which house was his? How were new patterns forming inside Eugene\u2019s damaged brain?To test if Eugene was forming new habits, Squire devised an experiment. He took sixteen different objects\u2014bits of plastic and brightly colored pieces of toys\u2014and glued them to cardboard rectangles. He then divided them into eight pairs: choice A and choice B. In each pairing, one piece of cardboard, chosen at random, had a sticker placed on the bottom that read \u201ccorrect.\u201dEugene was seated at a table, given a pair of objects, and asked to choose one. Next, he was told to turn over his choice to see if there was a \u201ccorrect\u201d sticker underneath. This is a common way to measure memory. Since there are only sixteen objects, and they are always presented in the same eight pairings, most people can memorize which item is \u201ccorrect\u201d after a few rounds.Eugene couldn\u2019t remember any of the \u201ccorrect\u201d items, no matter how many times he did the test. He repeated the experiment twice a week for months, looking at forty pairings each day.But as the weeks passed, Eugene\u2019s performance improved. After twenty-eight days of training, Eugene was choosing the \u201ccorrect\u201d object 85 percent of the time. At thirty-six days, he was right 95 percent of the time. After one test, Eugene looked at the researcher, bewildered by his success.\u201cHow am I doing this?\u201d he asked her.The experiments demonstrated that Eugene had the ability to form new habits, even when they involved tasks or objects he couldn\u2019t remember for more than a few seconds. This explained how Eugene managed to go for a walk every morning.Excerpt from the power of habit by Charles Duhigg) - -Suppose that Eugene is able to remember what he does for one day and forgets on the second day. Suppose he has never used bow and arrow in his whole life. Suppose we train him to shoot a target with bow and arrow everyday. He will wake up everyday and he will feel that he has never practiced shooting a target with bow and arrow previously, his arrow shooting skill will get better and better day by day. And finally one day, he will very surprised to find himself that although he feels that he has never shot and practiced arrow shooting in the past, he can shoot straight into target nearly every time he makes attempts. He will be surprised and satisfied about his in-born skill (so he thought) of arrow shooting. -Just like above example, suppose that we train Eugene to play piano likewise, ..................\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. -And finally one day, he will very surprised to find that although he has never learned to play the piano in the past (so he thought), he finds out that he can play the piano very well. He will be surprised and satisfied about his in-born skill (so he thought) of piano playing. -Just like above example, suppose a human being is interested in music and learns to play the piano his/her whole life and he/she can play the piano very well finally. He/She grows old and dies one day. Suppose that philosophy of Theravada Buddhism is true and each and every so-called soul or spirit or mind or consciousness will come into cycles of life unless he/she becomes liberated (reach Nirvana). Suppose that particular he/she comes back to human life. Suppose that although he/she cannot remember previous life, he/she will find out he/she can play piano very well since very young. People will be surprised about his/her in-born skill in piano playing. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 -Just like above example, suppose a human being is interested in (one particular subject) and learns and study (one particular subject) his/her whole life and he/she knows, understand (one particular subject) very well finally. He/She grows old and dies one day. Suppose that philosophy of Theravada Buddhism is true and each and every so-called soul or spirit or mind or consciousness will come into cycles of life unless he/she becomes liberated (reach Nirvana). Suppose that particular he/she comes back to human life. Suppose that although he/she cannot remember previous life, he/she will find out he/she can learn, know, understand (one particular subject) very well since very young. People will be surprised about his/her in-born skill in (one particular subject). \u2026\u2026 -Just like above example, suppose a human being has inquisitive mind and he/she always asks questions to concerning persons, teachers, elderly, specialists, wise people and learns, studies, practices, memorizes things constantly. He/She grows old and dies one day. Suppose that philosophy of Theravada Buddhism is true and each and every so-called soul or spirit or mind or consciousness will come into cycles of life unless he/she becomes liberated (reach Nirvana). Suppose that particular he/she comes back to human life. Suppose that although he/she cannot remember previous life, he/she will find out he/she is a quick learner and more intelligent compared other people. People will be surprised about his/her high intelligence and wonder why \u2026\u2026 - -Just like above example, suppose a human being has bad behaviors (e.g., lying, cursing, easily irritated and angry, etc.,) and his/her bad behaviors are not prohibited or even encouraged by his/her environment and he/she does those behaviors his/her whole life constantly. He/She grows old and dies one day. Suppose that philosophy of Theravada Buddhism is true and each and every so-called soul or spirit or mind or consciousness will come into cycles of life unless he/she becomes liberated (reach Nirvana). Suppose that particular he/she comes back to human life. Suppose that although he/she cannot remember previous life, he/she will find out he/she will act those bad behaviors effortlessly since young (instead of his/her present well-behaved parents and surrounding environment is strictly prohibits these bad behaviors). People will be surprised about his/her behaviors and wonder why \u2026\u2026 -Just like above example, suppose a human being has good behaviors and his/her good behaviors are encouraged and even given reward by his/her environment and he/she does those behaviors his/her whole life constantly. He/She grows old and dies one day.

Suppose that particular he/she comes back to human life. Suppose that although he/she cannot remember previous life, he/she will find out he/she will act those good behaviors effortlessly since young (instead of his/her present bad-behaved parents and surrounding very bad environment is encouraging bad behaviors). People will be surprised about his/her behaviors and wonder why \u2026\u2026 -Suppose above two persons with very different behaviors come back to human life as an identical twins pair. Their parents and other people will be surprised about their different behaviors and wonder why \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. - (All the livings cannot take their belongings, wealth, servants with them when dead.

            "answer_text": "My identical twin sister and I may look alike, but our personalities are completely different according to those around us. Alexis and I were polar opposites when we were younger, but we changed as we grew and matured. I was the nice twin- outgoing, funny, and easy to talk to. It was rare that I had a conflict with someone, at least not a public one. Alexis was more reserved, she kept with her group of friends and didn\u2019t stray. She was still great, of course! It just took more effort to be friends with her, and sometimes kids just don\u2019t have the patience. It\u2019s completely possible for there to be a \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d twin. Every pair of twins I\u2019ve ever known has been pushed into one of these labels, whether true or not, but it\u2019s still possible. I knew a set of twins back in middle school where one was sweet as a button and the other one ended up in the office more times than I can remember. Most twins don\u2019t grow up differently, though. They\u2019re normally treated the same by their parents, at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve noticed with other twins. Of course that\u2019s not always the case. Either way, their personalities aren\u2019t always going to be persuaded by their environments. ",
