            "answer_text": "Reading to me is like breathing and always has been. A true bibliophile at heart, my first friends were the characters that leapt from the pages. Anne of Green Gables, Junie B. Jones, those two kids from the Magic Tree House series, the Baudelaires from A Series of Unfortunate Events, and of course Harry, Ron and Hermione and many others. My book collection was so large it took up half my closet and then some, and when I got in trouble I would be grounded from reading, as it was the only thing my parents could take away that truly broke my heart. By kindergarten I was reading chapter books thicker than my thumb, and in fifth grade, my reading teacher pulled me aside and literally told me \u201cI know this sounds odd coming from me, but you must stop reading! At least during my lectures.\u201d If it weren't for my mother, none of this would have been possible. A full time business woman, part time super hero, my mom found time to read to my brother and I at least an hour a day-if not more. She would get home from a long day at the office and an hour commute in Houston traffic and with infinite patience she would read to us before dinner. She would sit us on either side of her lap and use her finger to follow along with the words so we could make the cognitive connection. Then before bed, she would sit with her back propped against the bathroom door and my brother an I in our beds and read to us from Harry Potter. She read us the first three books until my brother decided he was too old for it and I finished the series on my own. Without my mom's patient devotion to supporting my love affair with literature- driving me to the library in the summer, buying me hundreds of books of my own throughout the years and writing to my kindergarten teacher to excuse me from nap time so I could read instead of sleep- I would never have discovered the Magic of a good book.

            "answer_text": "When I was too young to attend school, my parents - and every other adult caretaker I had - would read to me, constantly. I loved books. I loved sitting in laps and being cuddled and being read to, and would request this activity more than any other. We didn\u2019t have a lot of books, so we would read the same ones over and over again. That didn\u2019t bother me. Eventually, when I was about three or so, I would pick up the books myself and read them from memory. This translated to being able to read other books that had not been read to me by adults, because I recognized the words I\u2019d heard and seen before. I entered kindergarten a fluent reader, and remained in the highest reading groups throughout my educational career. Interestingly enough, I\u2019m an /instinctive/ reader and grammatician - I don\u2019t know the rules for why things should be written or read in a certain way - I just /know/ what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. It makes it difficult for me to teach others to read. I can\u2019t identify the parts of a proper sentence - I know nouns and verbs, but get tripped up when asked to identify any other part, and only just figured out what pronouns were this year. I blame this on the fact that when my teachers were teaching these rules, I was usually reading something else. ",
