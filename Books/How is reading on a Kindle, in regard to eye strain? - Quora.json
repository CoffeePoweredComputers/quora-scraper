            "answer_text": " My Paperwhite the first day unboxed What a Kindle Kindles Why would anyone want a Amazon Kindle\u2014a gadget that enable you to do nothing but reading? Well, I do. And I am confident there are many out there like me. Because the Kindle kindles. Refound Interest in BooksFor one, it kindles my refound interest in books. You see, I used to like reading so much. When I was a kid I would not listen to teachers who failed to interest me with their uncreative lessons. But what can you do, sitting in that uniform chair like everyone else in the identical classroom? Well, you can always use a drawer. It\u2019s your reliable friend, a comrade. All through primary school and into high school, I would read my Jin Yong wuxia novels for days (ok, hours maybe). I finished all fourteen of them well before I went to college.  But then, before I realize what happened, it changed. I changed. For a whole semester in college, I did not manage to finish one single book on my own. I still read the required readings and all, but it was different. Suddenly I lost interest in the thing called books. It was too inconvenient. Too much work. Too heavy. Too unimportant compared to other things I wanted to do.  Then came the Amazon Kindle. I remember the urge to buy one the moment I noticed it the first time. The mobile had too small a screen. And it was way too much burden to the eyes reading for just half an hour. And where do I find books anyway?  The Kindle, as it was sold on the Amazon page, solves it all. It is light as a paperback\u2014the read people carried to a plane and finished by landing. It could store thousands of books. And where do books come from? You just search on Amazon\u2019s stock of hundreds of thousands of titles and download them with a magical click of the finger. Then BOOM! Before you know it, you are reading the title you thought of/came across moments before. Withheld Passion for KnowledgeI don\u2019t know about you. But I\u2019ve always known that I longed for knowledge. Knowledge of why\u2014why are people, myself included, so unhappy?\u2014 of how\u2014how do I find freedom (and a girlfriend)? and of what\u2014what is happiness, anyway? None of the lessons I went through my entire schooling experience told me the answers. Not a clue. And there was no one I could ask. So books seem the only way. And with a Kindle, and a Wifi (or 4G) connection, it all seemed possible. I bought a paperback copy of the Chinese translation of Russell\u2019s The Conquest of Happiness back then. I was interested. But I never finished it. Maybe it\u2019s the translation. But probably more because of the weight. It looked like a brick, and weighed and occupied space like one. But hey, I have got the Kindle now. For one-third of the price I bought the paper translation copy, I downloaded the digital copy into my Kindle. Within two weeks, I finished it. It was such a great read. And then I wanted more. I learnt so much from this man, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. And just moments after my personal feat, I bought The Basic Writings of Betrand Russell, too. The Kindle literally kindles in me the withheld longing for knowledge and wisdom\u2014from those same physical and technical barriers that I trust must have withhold many a potential bookworm like me.  Most Wanted Peace of MindToday I experienced what I believe a mystical state of peacefulness. I was reading Joseph Campbell\u2019s masterpiece The Hero with a Thousand Faces, on a ferry that carried me towards home. It was a short ride. I downloaded the e-book into my Kindle Paperwhite during a break between work, with a whim that just popped out in my mind out of nowhere. I got so used to the routine now I almost did it unconsciously \u2014search, 1-click order, wait. On the ferry, slowly venturing through the prologue and onto the first chapter, I realized that the fifteen minutes passed without my consciously knowing it. I mean, normally my mind strayed so much \u2014 did my girlfriend just texted me/let\u2019s take a look at Facebook/ I got to watch this on Youtube! But not today. For the whole fifteen minutes I was on another plate. There was nothing but my mind, the words and the meanings. And the Kindle of course. Without it the possibility of reading something as heavy and as distant from daily life would almost equals zero. And the concrete feeling of peace while reading must tell something about the reading experience. Disclaimer: Amazon should have paid me for this. But no, I didn\u2019t have any connection with them except I am such a loyal and good-looking customer. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, reading on a Kindle is nothing like reading on a tablet. That is the only reason why I bought a Kindle. The e-ink screen is non-reflective, and there is no glare like tablets, so you won\u2019t feel the strain on your eyes. You can read it anywhere - indoors or outdoors without any problem. The contrast is excellent. The weight is also very light, so you won\u2019t feel the strain of holding it over long periods of time. And the batteries last for a week or more, which you can\u2019t say the same for a tablet. Navigation-wise, it depends on which Kindle model you get. I\u2019ve got the Voyage, and the buttons are located on the sides using haptic feedback. I feel the buttons are too close to the edge and require a little pressure to activate, which means I still feel more secure holding the Kindle with two hands. I do not own the Whitepaper model with the buttons at the bottom, but I\u2019d imagine that would be the better position for one hand reading. How does the experience compare to reading actual books? Well\u2026 like the iPod, the best thing is having so much materials in one device. You don\u2019t have to lug bulky or heavy book(s) with you, so that\u2019s great. You learn more as well - you can check difficult words using its built-in dictionary. The biggest plus for Kindle (IMO) is the mobi format. You can adjust the spacing between the lines, as well as the size and type of fonts. This makes it easy to read depending on your preference. What is not so great though, is that the Kindle doesn\u2019t handle other types of files well (such as PDF), which are not formatted for Kindle. Because of the small screen size, PDF files are very difficult to read on a Kindle. You can\u2019t adjust the size of the fonts or spacing with a PDF, and the formatting just goes haywire if you convert to the Mobi format. I do enjoy reading on a Kindle, especially for Mobi format files and anything you buy from the Amazon store. On vacations and long flight, it is really great to have a few books with you in such a compact device. The one thing I do miss though, is the tactile experience of flipping actual pages in a book (oh the accomplishment!), and the sense of joy knowing that you are almost at the end of the book when you\u2019re holding a physical copy. The Kindle does indicate the percentage of pages read, but it just doesn\u2019t feel the same. ",
