            "answer_text": "The best and easiest way to decrypt a PDF file is to make use of a PDF unlocking software tool. In my opinion, the best tool for this purpose would be the HiPDF online PDF editor. The \u201cUnlock PDF\u201d module of HiPDF will help you quickly decrypt any PDF file in a few simple steps. The very first thing you need to do is to visit HiPDF website and select \u201cUnlock PDF\u201d from the homepage. Once the tool window is open, you need to select & upload the encrypted or password protected PDF to it.  You can make use of \u201cChoose File\u201d or cloud storage options for that. You can also use a simple drag & drop operation to upload the PDF file. Once the PDF file is uploaded, you will see a password column where you need to input the PDF password and click on \u201cUnlock\u201d button after that.  The HiPDF will then process the PDF and remove the encryption. You will get the decrypted PDF file in next few seconds. To learn more about the process, refer this article on How to Unlock Your PDF Online Fast and Easily. ",
