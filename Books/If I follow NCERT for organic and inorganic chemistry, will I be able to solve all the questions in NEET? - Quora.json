NCERT is best for organic because a many reactions asks in exam as it like line to line & other concept like leaving group , withdrawing group, their affinity ,resonance are also very good in NCERT to understand & you can easily learn it by yourself also from textbook . Inorganic Chemistry is also explained good but in a very lengthy way & very difficult to understand NCERT language & many questions doesn't solve in exam .

            "answer_text": "NCERT should be your basebook to score 150+. It all depends on the dedication you've spent on reading out the NCERT. By doing the NCERT well through you can do 41 out of 45 questions while those 4 questions are risky and could add to your negative marks; I would suggest you to either leave them out or what you can do is eliminate out the least likely answer and could reach out the answer. All the best for your PMTs. Thank you for reading. ",
