            "answer_text": "How historically accurate is How to Train Your Dragon? I\u2019m going to comment on the books since I\u2019ve listened to seven of them, last time this year, while I\u2019ve only seen the first film and that was pretty much right after it was released on DVD and Blu-ray. So, onto the actual answer: This is a humorous fantasy series for children that involves dragons. This should tell you pretty much all you need to know on the topic. I love the series because the author plays with pretty much every barbarian-related trope that exists in fiction and its entire foundation is built on the Rule of Funny, which makes it absolutely hilarious. It doesn\u2019t matter that I aged out of the target audience about twenty years ago and that the main characters are a couple of pre-teens, it\u2019s still brilliant. If you want a well-known example to compare it to, it would be the Ast\u00e9rix comics. But, you wonder, what is its relationship with actual history? Like I said\u2014implied\u2014above, there isn\u2019t one beyond a few superficial pointers. The archipelago itself is inspired by the Hebrides on the west coast of Scotland, an area that was under Norse control but was\u2014and still is\u2014almost exclusively populated by Gaels. In the books however, the Viking tribes are definitely inspired by the Norse, using their gods and talking about going on Viking raids in a manner that doesn\u2019t even suggest that the war parties will be made up from people of different cultures. And of course, the books treat Viking as an ethnicity when it was actually a job description. The Viking raids in the books are also more or less war campaigns, when in the real world, the expeditions were at least as much about trade as they were about plunder. What about myth then? Again, not beyond the surface. There is some inspiration from Old Norse sagas and of course a few of their deities are mentioned quite a lot. But the dragons could have come straight out of a tabletop role-playing game akin to Dungeons and Dragons, something done very much on purpose, and they are even scored on things such as intelligence, speed, attack skills and so on. They also take the place of pretty much any animal you could think of, especially domestic\u2014in the books, Toothless is the equivalent of a hunting dog, albeit sentient and lousy at his job. Dragons in Norse mythology are a lot more complicated, most of them are named and seen as individuals rather than simply a kind of animal. F\u00e1fnir for example, the one from whom the treasure hoarding of the generic Western dragon comes, was a dwarf who was turned into a dragon in order to guard the treasure he had already amassed. In other words, hunting dogs or beasts of burden, they are not.  A short note about the books and how they compare to the films: They are completely different works with only the main setting and the names of a few characters in common. Watching the films won\u2019t spoil anything about the plot in the books and not even any sort of character development. The films are also much more classic Hollywood in their brand of humour. Last but not least, I very much recommend listening to the audio version of the books if you\u2019re able to, as David Tennant does an absolutely fantastic job. He\u2019s especially good at giving each character their own voice without making them sound like they weren\u2019t even from the same place accent-wise or making them into more of a caricature than the text required. I actually felt like I was listening to a radio play and not an audiobook. ",

            "answer_text": "I have only seen the second movie. Which wasn't all that bad actually. But the movie has 0% to do with anything remotely related to historical Viking Norsemen. Costume and weaponry is 90% wrong:  And Dragons described in Medieval Sagas set in the Viking Age are not at all like the dragons in the movie: they tend to either be humans who magically transform in Dragons, or inteligent creatures more like Smaug:  One thing though, the depiction of the bad guy, Drago is actually pretty spot-on. If you took him and set him in a Norse saga he would actually do a pretty convincing villain, but I'd think that he would then be said to be either a troll or a Berserkr:  Besides that, the settings of the movie have essentially nothing in common with the real-life Vikings or their environment. A nice, family-friendly movie (I particularly liked the way they used the main character's disability in a positive way) with an okay plot and pretty good visual effects. But historically accurate? Nope. ",
