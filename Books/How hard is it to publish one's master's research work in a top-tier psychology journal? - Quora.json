            "answer_text": "Well, if you want to publish in ISI or ISI Proceedings, you'll have to pay a fee and have an interesting subject / a different approach or use an interesting statistics procedure.  In the last years, publishing in top journals has become more of a business, so you'd often find research studies that aren't that great but still get published because people pay the publishing fee (usually from $500 and above).  I see a lot of studies using R or AMOS as analysis programs and among statistical analyses, I see SEM (structural equation models), advanced statistics, path analysis, EFA and CFA in the case of instrument development & construction, multiple linear regressions and complex models. Theories used a lot are IRT (Item-response theory).  So the main idea is either have a great fresh subject which hasn't been explored yet, or use complex statistical procedures to reveal hidden findings.  Another thing to focus on is sample size: since it's hard to get a large sample size, if you have the opportunity, go for it and it may count for a great research paper.  Don't forget to contact journal editors and take into consideration each of their publishing guidelines and tips. ",

            "answer_text": "If your research is relevant to the subject matter of the journal, and if it meets its standard, it will be published.  Different journals have different criteria.  It is not impossible to publish, but the smartest strategy is to check out what has been published in that journal before. ",
