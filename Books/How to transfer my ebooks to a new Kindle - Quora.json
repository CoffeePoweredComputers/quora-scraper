            "answer_text": "All of the e-books that you purchase from Amazon are stored in the cloud, and can be downloaded to anywhere you have the Kindle software. Once you register the new Kindle, you can view all of the e-books you own, and select which ones you want to have physically on that device You PROBABLY only want to download those books that you have not read yet (assuming you still want to read them), those that you intend to reread shortly, and those that you believe you\u2019ll want or need to reference. Everything else, you may as well leave in the cloud. If you change your mind later, they will still be there. When I got my new Kindle, I found it easier to view and organize the books, initially, on my PC \u2014 go to Amazon, select the \u201cDepartments\u201d tab, select \u201cKindle\u201d \u2014 \u201cApps and Resources\u201d \u2014 \u201cManage your Content and Devices\u201d. It\u2019s just easier (for me) to use the PC app. ",

            "answer_text": "When you add the new Kindle device to your existing Amazon account - the same account that the previous device is registered to - your entire library will be available on that new Kindle device, with the exception of certain things such as Active Content and other Media-Rich books if your new device is not compatible with this alternative content that may have been available on your older device. I have Active Content still on my Amazon account that I purchased for my much older Kindle devices (Kindle Keyboard models) that are incompatible with my newer Kindle Paperwhites and Kindle Fire HDX 7\u2033. Just as similar I have Media-Rich books that work on my HDX but cannot be downloaded or viewed on my simple e-reader Paperwhites. ",
