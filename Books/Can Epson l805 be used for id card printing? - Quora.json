            "answer_text": "It\u2019s indeed used for ID Cards Printing. However be known, you need to purchase an Epson L805 which has been re-engineered. That basically means you get a printer with warranty void from day 1 from the Epson company, however the company who re-engineers the printer to enable ID Card Printing onto it, gives you a 6 months warranty from their side. On the cost effectiveness part, printers which are specifically designed to print only id cards have higher cost-per-card and maintenance while Epson being an inkjet printer just needs ink to be refilled. Tank once entirely filled could print up-to 2000 cards while original inks doesn\u2019t cost that high. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it can be used. I am using it personally for over a year. But note that if you use the card tray, the warranty is void from day 1. However, you can get it serviced from local service guy. Most of the problems can be solved by yourself. Answering your question, yes, epson L 805 can be used for ID card printing with third party tray and software. Comment if you need more details. Good luck printing. ",
