But when it erupts, it probably won\u2019t be at Yellowstone. The North American plate drifts southwest at about twice the rate human fingernails grow, so by the time that hot spot is ready to blow again it could be up near Hudson\u2019s Bay, not in Wyoming. From the articles I\u2019ve seen about activity in the Yellowstone caldera, the events there aren\u2019t indicative of a coming eruption but are rather sings that the hot spot is moving (or rather the continent is moving over it).
