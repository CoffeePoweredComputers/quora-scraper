            "answer_text": "How long is a piece of string? There is no way to tell. Unless you measure it. The same with pages in a book. Only you count them. Chapters do not have a standard length. While some authors try to keep them about the same length, they can vary from a few lines, to five or even ten thousand words. It depends on the chapter, and where it\u2019s going. Also, authors dont work with pages. We count our books by the word. And 80k words could have 10 chapters or 100. So a 50 chapter book, could be really short, really average, or really long. There is no way of telling, even if you know how many words it has. On Amazon, the page length is woolly anyway. They have their own algorithm for determining page length, which they wont tell anyone. But on the Kindle, the number of pages is determined by the font and font size selected by the reader, so the same book can have wildly different page counts on different devices. ",

A \u201cchapter\u201d might be only a few pages\u2014some of the most popular writers, like James Patterson, believe tiny chapters make a more exciting read. Or it could be twenty pages or more. For that matter, \u201cpages\u201d is an assumption too. A book\u2019s formatting sets how many words are on a page; you can even change the page count yourself on an ebook any time you change your device\u2019s font setting. If you have a particular style of writing in mind, you can guess how many pages a book has, and how many words per chapter, and so on. But the real measure is the number of words. ",
