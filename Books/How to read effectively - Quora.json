            "answer_text": "Reading Effectively The first strategy is to get your mind in a state where it\u2019s easier to understand and absorb the information you are about to read. The goal is to have a general idea of the subject and explore just enough to become curious and excited about it. Read a short article on the subject. This is something you can do to get an overview of what you will learn before you start reading the book.Look at the table of contents to know how the book is organized.If the book or chapters have introductions and summaries, read those first, If you don\u2019t like to get too far ahead, read only the summary of the first chapter, then read the chapter. Follow by reading the summary of the second chapter and then read that chapter, and so on.Skim the chapters to start forming an idea of what you will be learning.What we are looking to do is have our brains asking questions and getting curious about the subject. Our minds don\u2019t like unresolved problems or unanswered questions (specially when we find them interesting), it\u2019s our nature to try to fill that knowledge gap.  This curious and inquisitive state is ideal for learning and creativity, it focuses our attention and prepares us to think and reflect on what we\u2019ll read. Underlining and Taking notesI used to never underline a book or write on it, I thought it was disrespectful to do so. Today is the opposite, all my books are full of notes and underlinings, I feel it\u2019s disrespectful not to do it. Why? Because you want to learn from the book, not just read it. That\u2019s how you really respect the book.  Taking notes, writing on the margin and underlining will help you reinforce and remember the information. Don\u2019t feel bad about underlining and writing on the book, great minds in history did it all the time. Underlining or highlightingThe concept is simple, underline or highlight the main ideas and any information you like or find valuable. Underlining forces you to stop and focus on what you are underlining; this extra attention works as a boost for your memory. To avoid underlining too much try to do it after you finish the paragraph. If you do it as you read -specially if you don\u2019t know anything about the subject- you will think that everything is important and worth underlining. So finish the idea first, understand what is being said, and then underline what\u2019s important or want to remember. Taking NotesThere are different kinds of notes. Sometimes you transcribe or summarize what you just read, other times you write questions, observations, ideas, and even have discussions with the author. All of these reinforce what you read in different ways.  Summarizing, for example, helps you understand and encode the information, while observations helps you connect with ideas and knowledge you already have. For your general knowledge, when you write notes at the margin of the book they are called \u201cMarginalia\u201d. If you prefer to write them in a notebook where you keep all other notes, observations, ideas, etc this notebook is usually referred as a commonplace book. (More on common place book later in this article) I encourage you to make all types of notes, write everything that comes to mind as you read, either on the margin or in your commonplace book. Don\u2019t rely on thinking you will remember your ideas later, you won\u2019t, write them right away.I do want to emphasize that you write down what you want to remember. As a final note on writing your thoughts, it is important that you do it not just to remember them but also to encourage more thinking. Writing makes you slow down and organize your ideas in a coherent way, this in turn promotes more thinking and connections. Another benefit of underlining and taking notes.I constantly go back to books and read only my notes and underlinings. The first time you read a book you need examples, stories, and arguments. But once you understand the subject, you can go straight to the information you want, and avoid all the fillers. If you don\u2019t take notes or underline, you would have to read the entire book again. Summaries and conceptual mapsMaking summaries leads to a better understating of the subject because it makes you think about what you are reading and forces you to condense the information. The summaries you make also work as quick references to refresh your memory. To get the best results, summarize in your own words, it will help you understand and encode the information at a deeper level. Conceptual maps or mind maps help you in a similar way, they force you to create an overview of what you read and to organize and connect main ideas.  All this thinking and ruminating on the information helps solidify it in your memory. A word on reviewingReviewing is not much of a learning strategy. The value of reviewing is to refresh the information you already know, but it is not an efficient strategy to learn it the first time. When you review information (either your notes, summaries, underlinings or the entire book) be aware of the \u201cFluency illusion\u201d, where we mistake our familiarity with the material with the mastery of the content. In other words, you recognize the information so you assume you already know it.  To really find out what you know or don\u2019t know you need some kind of self testing, either in the form of explaining the subject in your own words or answering questions about it. Commonplace bookClosely related to marginalia, underlining, and summarizing is keeping a commonplace book. This is a type of journal or notebook where you write down ideas, quotes, and concepts you find valuable. A commonplace book becomes a collection of all the wisdom you come across. There are variations on how to keep one, it can go from just writing down anything you find worthy of remembering without any order, to a complex system with many categories and cross references.  Practice TestingA great way to use marginalia to remember what you read is by creating quiz like questions as you are reading.  Let\u2019s imagine that you are reading a book on Napoleon. As you read, write questions next to the paragraphs where you learned something you would like to remember. For example, if you just learned about a specific battle, write next to the paragraph \u201cwhen did this battle took place and how it unfolded?\u201d Once you finish the book, go through your questions trying to answer them by memory. If you can\u2019t remember, don\u2019t worry, the answer is in the paragraph next to the question. Keep quizzing yourself every other day until the material is solid in your memory. This strategy basically creates instant Flash Cards. Why should you do this? Practice testing is one of the best learning strategies out there. It surpasses summarizing, underlining, reviewing, and route learning (repetition). The effort we put into trying to recall the right answers during practice testing makes a big impact in strengthening our memories. Here\u2019s John Dunlosky on the article \u201cStrengthening the Student toolbox: Study strategies to Boost Learning\u201d Featured on \u201cAmerican Educator\u201d: \u201cTaking practice tests can substantially boost student learning\u2026The use of practice tests can improve student learning in both direct and indirect ways. When students correctly retrieve an answer from memory, the correct retrieval can have a direct effect on memory. When a student fails to retrieve a correct answer during a practice test, that failure signals that the answer need to be re-studied; in this way, practice test can help students make better decisions about what need further practice and what does not.\u201d He then adds, \u201cMost important is to make frequent use of testing and retrieval practice to verify what you really do know versus what you think you know.\u201d MnemonicsMnemonics are memory techniques to make memorizing easier and more efficient. It\u2019s beyond the scope of this post to discuss the techniques, but we\u2019ll cover them in depth in future articles. In the meantime I encourage you to pick up a book on the subject; reading about Memory and mnemonics is fascinating and well worth your time. Here\u2019s a link to a good book to start: Moonwalking with Einstein Talking about the book or teaching what you learnedThis idea is similar to summarizing and making conceptual maps, but instead of writing you\u2019ll be talking. Next time you are socializing talk about the book or the subject, try to explain to other people what you learned. You will find that is difficult the first time, but you will get better as you force yourself to do it. This type of recall will help you strengthen and organize the knowledge you got from the book. Read in ClustersRead more than one book on a subject. There are several benefits for doing this: 1. You\u2019ll get a better understanding of the subject. Your mind will be thinking about it for longer and you\u2019ll have more information to build your knowledge. Also, as you internalize the principles, you\u2019ll start seeing deeper layers and nuances of what you are reading. 2. You\u2019ll remember more. With better understanding also comes better encoding. It\u2019s easier for us to remember what we understand deeply. We are also being exposed to the information for a longer time, and as ideas repeat themselves they become reinforced in our memory. 3. You\u2019ll be exposed to different perspectives from several authors. Reading this way gives you better understanding of the subject because it makes the books complement of each other instead of being stand alone.  Also, reading from different authors in a subject will help you avoid the \u201conly source bias\u201d where we think what we read is right even though we haven\u2019t read other sources. If you are going to follow this strategy make sure to not let much time pass by between books, ideally read them back to back. The information should be fresh in your mind so you don\u2019t waste time reviewing and relearning the material. Reading in clusters will also improve your reading speed. Since you already have knowledge of what you are reading, you won\u2019t have to spend time trying to understand it again.  The Information will also start to overlap, you can then speed up on the parts you already know and focus on the information that is new and important which will give you the deeper understanding we are looking for. Make knowledge personalWe learn faster and remember better when the knowledge is personal and actionable. Try to relate what you are learning to something you already know and visualize specific scenarios where you can apply the new knowledge. Think how it relates or benefits your life and when you can use it. If you are reading a book on body language, for example, think about how you could apply the ideas to your next presentation at work and how it would benefit you. Taking action/Using the informationThe best way to remember what you read is to use it or incorporate it into your life in some way. Besides being the best strategy to remember what you read, it\u2019s also the ultimate goal of reading (non fiction that is). Using the information -which can also mean being able to talk about the subject or having a better understanding of it- is why you wanted to learn the ideas from the book in the first place. Read, Read, Read.The more you know the easier it is to learn more and remember what you learn. Why? Knowledge is not linear in our minds, it is a web, we make connections between subjects and memories. The more things you can connect new knowledge to the easier it is to understand and remember it. We\u2019ve covered many strategies to remember what you read. It might seem overwhelming so implement the ones you like the most, let them become second nature, and then work on another one. My goal is to show you different things you can do to remember what you read, but I don\u2019t want to turn reading into a dreadful activity for you. Above all, I want you to read and learn more, so implement the strategies at your own pace. ",

            "answer_text": "By getting used to it. Effective reading is actually a habit. But also depends on what kind of books you\u2019re reading. If you\u2019re reading a novel and you\u2019re not in a hurry, the best way to enjoy it is just with taking your time. I usually read the paragraphs entirely without missing anything out, just in case there are details to fill in the \u2018gaps\u2019 as the story progresses. It\u2019s different with textbooks or journals. I\u2019m a medical student, and there are a lot of medical-related books, and surely it\u2019s impossible for me to read them all (though the more you read, the better). Here are the things I usually do to absorb more information in one reading. Before you read the book, look up the topic in Wikipedia and read the introduction paragraph, just so you\u2019re a little familiar what you\u2019re about to read. You usually will also gain keywords in here.First, jump to the conclusion page, it\u2019s usually at the end of the chapter. Just read it, so you know in general about the topic you\u2019re going to study about. Also try to look for another keywords.Understand the title of the chapter, then check and read all of the subchapters, too. I don\u2019t know why I do this, but this will help.Don\u2019t read the entire page, you will waste your time. Try to filter what you need and what you don\u2019t need to know\u2014you can use your keywords here.Underline or highlight the important stuffs. If you spare time summarise them, that\u2019s even better. EDIT: this method will also help you when you go back to the chapter and try to re-read or re-memorise them.It seems a lot but it\u2019s actually going to consuming less time than if you read all the pages, and plus, it will give you more understanding. Hope it helps. ",
