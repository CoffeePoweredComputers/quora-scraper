            "answer_text": "The place of original publication of a book determines copyright issues. This is most clearly defined (in the case of books published in the USA) by registering the title and other information with the US Copyright Office (with submissions of copies of the book as required). The residence or citizenship of the author does not matter, but it also registered. If the book is published elsewhere, the copyright laws of that country would be definitive. If published in more than one country, each publishing venture would best be registered to make it most probably that copyrights will be established. Of course, there are some countries that are not party to various copyright treaties or agreements, and they may well publish a book copyrighted elsewhere, at this time there being no way of recourse on such matters. This applies whether the book is self-published, published through amazon or other companies with similar offerings, from actual publishing houses, etc.  ",
