            "answer_text": "I always do this, and most of the people that I know who would consider reading their \"main\" hobby do this as well, to some extent. It's never seemed unusual to me. A long time ago I used to have a rule of not reading more than one novel at a time, because I thought I'd get confused or forget things, but I haven't been following that rule for at least a couple years and it's been totally fine.  Right now I'm reading: October Country by Ray BradburyScarlet by Marissa MeyerPerdido Street Station by China MievilleThe Rape of Nanking by Iris ChangTrigger Warning by Neil GaimanWriters of the Future, Volume 30The Book of Mormon (A companion to the musical, not the religious text)I think a lot of it comes down to your memory. Are you the kind of person that's going to forget what's going on in a novel if you haven't picked it up in a week? If so, you probably can't do this sort of thing. I can put a novel down for months and remember exactly what's going on when I pick it back up again, so I have no anxiety about reading lots of things at once. If I get distracted and put a book down for a while, I know I'll almost always be able to come back to it without starting over. ",
