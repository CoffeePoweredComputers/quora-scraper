            "answer_text": "Firstly it is a great idea that you want to imbibe reading habit in a 6 year old. Afterall it is the small droplets that make the large ocean. At this young age one of the first things that you need to do is make him feel that as a parent you are into reading too. This might seem a slightly unconventional idea but children learn a lot by immitation. If the child sees you reading and surrounding yourself by books, he will develop a natural tendency to do the same by himself. Most parents do not read nowadays and are hooked on to their phones. There is no point in blaming your child for something you do yourself. Once he grows an inclination to look at books, try to bring in illustrative books. Books with colourful illustrations can catch a child\u2019s attention easily. Once he is attracted to the books he will develop a subtle habit of reading. You can start with books having very short stories and anecdotes and read them to him. Ask him to read after you and then by himself. Once he gets into this practice he will get the essence of reading. If possible take him to book fairs or shops where he can look at a variety of books and even choose. You also need to keep a watch on his screen time, so that he spends less time looking at a screen. This time can be valuably devoted to outdoor games and reading books, a habit that would pay him well throughout his life. ",

            "answer_text": "Switch from YouTube Videos to AudiobooksYes, audiobooks count as reading\u2014and they can help children do it better. Hearing someone reading a book confidently is a great way to experience fluency, which is the ability to read a text accurately, quickly, and with good expression. 2. Start With YOU! \u201cChildren take cues from adults\u201d. When you grow up surrounded by junk food, you like junk food. When you grow up surrounded by books, you like books. Make sure they see you reading, and talk to them about the book. Try excitedly pointing out something that reminds you of the story, because you want them to see that books bring you joy and will bring them joy too. 3. Read the books and then watch the movie. Pick a classic that\u2019s been turned into a movie\u2014Bridge to Terabithia; The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014and read it together, a few chapters at a time. When you\u2019re finished, host a family movie night to watch the film version. It\u2019s a great way to motivate children to read. 4. Stash Books All Over \u201cSurrounding kids with books at an early age gets them hooked,\u201d says Alice Sterling Honig, Ph.D., a child development expert at Syracuse University, in New York. Just like you surround your kids with limitless toys, this time try replacing it with books. Give a book to keep him/her busy instead of handing a toy in their hand. Do not keep the books in the shelves, put it somewhere close to them, where they would most likely find it or stumble upon. 5. Read Aloud - even when they don't need it Reading aloud is both educational and social, so there are layers of value there. Plus, children learn to read best\u2014and to love it most\u2014when they hear countless stories over many years in a meaningful context. This also gives the reader a break. GuysRead.com, specifically for boys, and ReadingRockets.org are excellent sites for book ideas broken down by age and interests. I hope this answers helps you imbibe a reading habit into your child.

I am not saying that children should never stretch while they are reading, but reading things that are easy for them but still interesting to them will do marvels for their confidence. I had two children who struggled to learn to read. We would read every other paragraph, or sometimes they would read one sentence and I would read the rest of the paragraph. Keep it as much fun as possible. Reading with a child tucked under your arm is wonderful. Read things with them that are at their level. Read things to them that they can understand but might have difficulty reading. Ask them what they are enjoying. Try to figure out what kind of books they like. Go to the library with them and let them choose the books that they want to read. If they are having a lot of difficulty with the reading, try to figure out what the problem is. Do they really solidly know the letters? Can they see clearly? Do they report that the letters seem to move on the page? But if the difficulty is no interest, the best thing is doing it with them. ",

I knew, when he was six and he could get from the beginning to the end he could read, a six year old can\u2019t memorise that much. Find a book they like, read it to them, show them the words as you read, and even if you read the same book over and over again, do it. Also, ask them questions about it - \u2018What happens next?\u2019, \u2018Why do you think he did that?\u2019 And don\u2019t worry if you think the book is way above their ability level, it\u2019s their interest you want.

The kind of environment we make around the child ,he/she derives those qualities. \u2705 I had recently read a story based on real life - where a parent tried to see if just the kids with implicit talent succeed in life or it can be any one . So, after he had two baby girls , he started to keep them around Chess and taught them to play chess from a very young age and eventually the children feel in love with it and both the sisters would play it everytime. This simple step by their parents in their childhood led them to become champions when they grew up. So, this story show we become what we are subjected to , afterall we are just some living being searching for a bigger purpose . HOPE THIS HELPS \ud83e\udde1. ",

My advice is READ TO YOUR CHILD. Don\u2019t wait until they are that age, start earlier because around the age of 7 - 9 many kids, especially boys, suddenly find physical activities are a bit more exciting than reading books. But if enjoyment for reading has been given to them earlier, they will return to it after the games are over. LIMIT their time on devices like ipad and phones. LIMIT their TV and movie watching and computer gameing. LET YOUR CHILDREN SEE YOU READING. That is very important. And READ TO YOUR CHILD. ",

Learning should be fun, but read fantasy genre stuff can be fun too. I suggest starwars(Darth bane series) LotR and Harry Potter and D.souse.also when I was 6 i didnt like fiction or fantasy yet, i was a little older when I got into unreal things being entertaining. At 6 i nm preferred to read education material about animals plants space w_e hand a kid a science book at that age they should have a blast. Here my question for the parents, what do you allow your 6year old to do that's so fun that learning it's fun anymore? Learning should be the the most fun a 6 year old has ever had, and it should stay that way for another 10+ years. ",
