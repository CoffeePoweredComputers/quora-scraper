In any case, if you want to read ancient literature and religious writings that are not in the Bible, all you have to do is search for it on the Internet or even (gasp!) go to a brick-and-mortar library at a university in your area. Thank you for the A2A, but I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re getting at. ",

There are English translations online, though the sites presenting them look rather dodgy. ",

The books are well known and available. The most famous copies of the Gnostic texts were found in Egypt New Testament apocrypha - Wikipedia ",
