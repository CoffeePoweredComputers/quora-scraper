            "answer_text": "My very first philosophical paper, written when I was fifteen was on this very question. I had just learned to play billiards (pool?) and, thinking about it, I could not figure out how when two balls collided, they both knew instantly which direction to take. I wrote that the actual calculation which anyone would have to make was considerably complicated: the elasticity of each ball, the velocity of the incoming ball, the point at which collision would begin, the friction of the felt, etc.. The event would vary according to temperature, moisture content of the air, ambient sounds, air movements, zair friction, to name only a few. How could these blasted little balls figure it out? In fact, I pointed out that the behaviour of the wo balls could be used to estimate the result of collisions between two other balls before it had even happened because there was such a thing as similar events. It was an odd kind of a paper, obviously by a naive thinker but the editor of the Canadian Journal of Philosophy was generous in offering advice as to how the paper would be needed to be corrected before he could send it off to one of the journal\u2019s editors. Said it was an interesting paper. The question was, of course, how could it be that the pool balls could make such a complicated calculation so quickly and without any instruments, without pencils and without paper. This was before electronic calculators. Even though Turing had said a few things about them seventeen years before my fifteenth. But I hadn\u2019t heard of his absolutely glorious papers. Well now, the quick answer to my conundrum was to say that no calculations were necessary for the balls to do their dance, it was, in fact, just how balls behave. They do the way we do, by a natural ability evident throughout the universe. Who in Heaven\u2019s name tells Mars when to twinkle? Saint Shiny? Ah, but, not so quick, dear naturalist! Fact is that the balls could very well be used as a computer, an analogue computer. A computer which makes prediction or controls events by the clever selection by a human of another bit of stuff which behaves just like it does. Hence \u2018Analogue computing\u2019 from the latin \u2018ana\u2019 and \u2018logos\u2019. The \u201csame logic\u201d (with apologos for pop etymology).But it\u2019s not that simple, and saying so is no help at all. The Greeks did not play pool but I\u2019m sure they saw this miracle all around them. It seems that things can figure things, even with an IQ zero. And that\u2019s how we get to believe that there is mathematics in nature, nature seems to do what we do but we, we have to use mathematics. Nature makes us think that it has the math in it. It\u2019s built in. But it\u2019s just seems to, mind you, just seems to. ",

            "answer_text": "I understand that there is no mathematics in nature. Mathematics is a discipline that people have devised to deal with quantitative aspects of nature. Mathematicians have taken mathematics one step further, and have devised new forms of mathematics that have (or had at the time when they were devised) no relation to nature. For example: non-Euclidean geometry has applications in nature, but when it was devised it was merely an answer to the question of what geometry would look like without Euclid\u2019s parallel postulate. How do you understand mathematics in nature? ",
