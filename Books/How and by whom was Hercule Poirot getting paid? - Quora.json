            "answer_text": "Poirot was obviously very successful as a consulting detective as he could choose which cases he would take, he often didn't charge his professional fee and he maintained a staff of his valet, George, and his secretary Miss Lemon.The employment of Miss Lemon clearly indicates Poirot was a professional running a successful business: Miss Lemon's duties included filing - her goal in life was to develop the perfect filing system - making appointments, answering the telephone, dealing with the post (mail), and billing clients.Large fees are often mentioned, particularly in relation to wealthy and titled clients whom Poirot often refused. Poirot refuses to take a case from Mr Ratchett in Murder on the Orient Express despite being offered a large fee.  After many years of solving cases with great success Poirot was financially secure and generally only took on cases which interested him. This included assisting the police such as Inspector Japp and coming to the rescue of damsels in distress, usually without charging his fee. In Mrs McGinty's Dead Superintendent Spence asks Poirot to look into a crime for which a man who may be innocent was convicted. In Third Girl Poirot seeks to save Norma who believes she may have committed murder.  Poirot was paid in the same manner as private investigators today - he billed his clients for services rendered.

            "answer_text": "Frequently he worked for private clients. They would write to him/come to his office and engage his services, so they would be the ones paying him. If the police asked for his help I assume they would have been expected to pay - possibly only for his expenses since he didn\u2019t seem to be struggling for work and could choose not to charge them a fee if he wanted but I don\u2019t think it ever explicitly says in the books. On occasion he seems to be working purely out of his own sense of curiosity, in which case no one would have been paying - although it is possible he may have got a reward from a grateful person cleared of murder or someone related to the victim for finding the murderer, but again that is not stated in the books, I\u2019m just speculating.
