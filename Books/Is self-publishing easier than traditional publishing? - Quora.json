            "answer_text": "Yes and no. (Disclaimer - I have never been traditionally published). The key to being a successful self-publisher, is that you need to be organized. You need to have editors, know a way of getting your covers done, and spend time marketing your work as well as writing your next book. If you go the traditional publishing route, then you will likely need to find an agent who can submit your work for you. You will already have had your book edited by someone professional (you want to make a good impression with your manuscript), but you don\u2019t have to worry at this point about marketing or cover graphics. The thing is, getting a traditional publishing contract is really difficult and can take a long time. You might finish your book in January, and maybe find an agent relatively quickly, but even then it might take you another two years before you book is released due to publishing schedules and the amount of work publishers put into readying your work. That\u2019s if it gets accepted by anyone at all. Self-publishing is more immediate - but you do everything yourself. If I finish a book on January 20th, it is live for sale on Amazon by January 25th. While my book is at the editors (I have two), I am creating the cover, promotional graphics, doing the formatting for my file, and writing the blurb. As soon as the edit files come back, I enter them into my original document and then I upload. By this stage, I am already writing my next book and doing the pre-marketing for the book I just uploaded. I am not sure that \u201ceasier\u201d is the right question to ask. As an author, you want to find a system that works for you. Some writers love being able to say they are a \u201cpublished\u201d author and that is what they strive for. They aren\u2019t worried about low royalty percentages or the length of time it takes for a book to come out. They have a thick skin, and can weather rejection letters - because their biggest dream is to be professionally published. That works for them. On the flip side, self-published authors want to keep their small audience of readers happy and make a semi-regular income. They know that most readers don\u2019t follow publishing houses, they follow authors, so they promote their name and works heavily to their target market. They write a lot (I write every single day), and publish frequently because there is a lot of power in getting back list sales. But it is a lot of work, because a self-published author has to be writer, administrator, and marketer and that doesn\u2019t suit everyone. Thank you for your A2A and good luck no matter which way you decide to go. ",

            "answer_text": "Easier is too vague a term. With traditional publishing you have a finished, very well edited manuscript and then you have to send it to publishers willing to read it or look for an agent willing to market it. Once it ends up sold to a publishing house they do the rest but it takes six months to eighteen months before the book comes out and if you sold it to a \u201cbig\u201d publisher they actually put books into book stores. If you sold it to a smaller publisher it\u2019s not much better than self-publishing. Online only. BUT they should have done proof reading, cover design, wrote the blurb and do all the formatting and uploading work for you (and for free \u2014- if it cost you money you are not with a traditional publisher by a hybrid or vanity press, traditional publishers do things for free). With self-publishing you have to see to formatting of the book for both print, Mobi and EPUB file types. You have to see to a cover for the eBooks and a front and back cover for the print books. You have to upload these. You have to examine the pre-publication proofs. You have to pay to get a printed proof (I typically have to get 3 to 4 proofs at $10 each before I\u2019m happy with the book and in the case of a hardbound color book it cost me $30 for one proof). Once you\u2019re happy with the way it looks you press the PUBLISH button and in 24 to 36 hours it\u2019s on Amazon and within a week the print book is in most every data base. You also should file a US Copyright if you\u2019re an American Citizen. It is require to sue in Federal Courts. Failure to file for a copyright can cost you the right to attorney fees and statutory damages. Failure to timely file free copies with the Library of Congress Copyright office could result in fines. It only costs $45 to $65 online to file a copyright. A PDF copy for eBooks. Two printed copies for print books. So you have to ask yourself which is easiest. Spending one or two years looking for agents and publishers, submitting, getting rejected or doing all the work it takes to self-publish. ",
