Step 5:-Buy a full study material of reputed coaching like made easy it will surely strengthen your concepts or you can also go for made easy handwritten classroom notes. Step 6:-Start taking mocks (proctered as well as unproctered) as many as you can and always analyse each of your mock as it will help you the most in boosting up your score. Now the question arises the availability of the study material, Handwritten notes and test series as these are not available easily everywhere and if there are then the cost will be too high or the quality will not be up to the mark so come on let me give you solution for this also which i experienced personally. There is a online website named as NOTES4U(.IN) which provide all the study stuff at very reasonable and friendly prices and the highlighting feature of there is the service, quality of material, originality and the timely delivery. I am saying all this so because i have personally experienced and i was very happy with them. So i must suggest you to go for NOTES4U. ALL THE BEST\u2026 ",
