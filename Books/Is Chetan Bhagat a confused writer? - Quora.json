He is smartest than 99% Indians.(Don't tell me that smartness is not measured by IIT and IIM unless you are from MIT and Harvard) CB has made India read. Many (many many) have read one of his books as the first Novel of their life. From their, many have evolved to read books. His books are cheesy, have one adult scene, story line is repetitive but then, they are far better that The Twilight's and The Fifty Shades of Grey's of the real world. If you don't like it, don't read it. But you wont stop reading. Either because that's the only book which is in your comprehension limits or because you can see a part of yourself in it. ",
