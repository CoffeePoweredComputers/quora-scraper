            "answer_text": "You want to start reading The Flash comic books. So I'll assume you know nothing or little about Flash. The other answers take a different approach but I say start at the beginning. But do only that.  I am not giving you stories about Jay Garrick (the Golden-Age Flash). If you want to read Golden Age stuff, just read the Flash stories in Flash Comics #1 and Flash Comics #104. The following stories mark the beginning of Barry Allen as the Flash. Showcase #4 - The origin of the Flash and Barry Allen's first appearance.Secret Origins (Volume 2) Annual #2 - Read this instead of the one before if you want a complete origin for Barry Allen's Flash.Flash #123 - Must read story because it introduced the idea of parallel earths.Flash #300 - A good story but basically contains info about all the supporting characters and rogues of the Flash.Some of the above are collected in the Flash Archives and/or The Flash - A Celebration of 75 Years. You can also read them digitally on comixology. If you liked the above stories, read some more Silver Age Barry Allen stories. Flash Recommended Reading contains good Barry Allen stories. They are under Single Issues. The Barry Allen stories are of The Flash (Volume 1) series. Also read The Death of Iris Allen and The Trial of the Flash.If you did not care very much for the above stories(Showcase #4, Flash #123,etc.), let's move on.After this, a big event took place in Barry Allen's life. You have three options to learn about this event. Choose only one and choose wisely depending on your reading preference. If you know about the other parts of DC Universe and don't mind reading a mind blowing long story, read the entire Crisis on Infinite Earths (12 issues Maxi-series).If you don't want to read the entire 12 issues of Crisis on Infinite Earths but want to read about Barry Allen, read Crisis on Infinite Earths #8. Read this only if you don't care about the main story but what happens to Barry Allen.WARNING: Read this option only if you are sure you won't be opting for the above two options and don't want to read the actual event. This contains a SPOILER. So let's give it to you now that I have warned you. Barry Allen runs around a Anti-Matter Cannon (no need to get into the details of what a Anti-Matter Cannon is) and in doing so saves the Universe (great, that's what Flash does) but also dies (this is the main spoiler).Now let's move on to Wally West. Read The Flash: Born to Run. This is Wally West's origin. After this read some more Wally West stories given on Flash Recommended Reading. I highly recommend stories of Mark Waid and Geoff Johns. Now again some big event takes place. You again have three options. Choose only one. This time I would recommend the last option. Read Final Crisis (the entire twelve issue story line) followed by The Flash: Rebirth. You must have the time to read 18 issues if you opt for this option.Some SPOILERs. In Final Crisis, Barry Allen returned. It is revealed that Barry Allen never died but was sucked into the Speed Force. After having this information, read The Flash: Rebirth.Massive SPOILERs but the easy way. In Final Crisis, Barry Allen returned. It is revealed that Barry Allen never died but was sucked into the Speed Force. In The Flash: Rebirth, it is told that Professor Zoom was responsible for Barry's mother's murder for which his father was sent to prison.Do not read further if you've not yet chosen any one of the above. After Barry Allen's return, he became the Flash. So read both the trades of The Flash (Volume 3) followed by Flashpoint (only the core series). Now you are up to speed and can read the current Flash series which is The Flash (Volume 4). This is a part of New 52. Happy and speedy reading! ",

            "answer_text": "I would say to start off watching the Flash TV series, to get to know some background information about the character, like who he is and what he does. Watch all of Season 1 (but remember the comics are a bit different from the show), if you already have then great. Then I would read The Flash: Volume 3 (all of it) and Flashpoint (the main 5 issues, you don\u2019t have to read the tie-ins unless you want to, since they\u2019re not completely Flash related). Once you\u2019ve read that you can go straight into the New 52 run of The Flash story line. Once you\u2019ve finished that you can go onto DC Universe: Rebirth, then Flash: Rebirth and then just the Rebirth run of the The Flash story line. If you want to read stuff about Wally West, then you can start with The Flash: Volume 2, and then Titans Rebirth since Wally is a main character there. Hope this helped. ",
