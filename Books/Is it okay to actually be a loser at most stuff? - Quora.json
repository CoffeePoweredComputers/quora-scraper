So, first let me introduce myself. The back bencher of the most popular convent at my place. \ud83d\ude02Amongst the most notorious ones of my school(more than 3k students from 5 to 12). \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude02Poor grades. Oh how poor? Used to pass the finals with 52%. Is that enough?\ud83d\ude02Not anything good at grounds. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude02Loved binge watching anime, playing games, partying and racing above all.\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffbParent's reaction, \u201dCan\u2019t you be a little more like your younger brother. My reaction: No.(idk what I used to think \ud83e\udd23) Parents: Sigh! What'll you do! You don't even have some reservations. You gotta work hard huh! Me: M going out. Bye!  And then it happened. Things took a turn. I watched an anime called Naruto . The protagonist,in beginning,was totally like me and I was inspired.  Then,I changed school for 11th and I saw it as a new journey, A new chance. Used my time for studying. Stopped every notorious thing that was in me. No distractions. \ud83d\udcaf Had various medical conditions during this period of 2 years( more than I ever did had),lost some important parts of my soul,but they're still with me.\ud83e\udd70 Took me an year to learn to sit still(focus)\ud83d\ude05 for hours and I knew this was it. I was gonna do it I had this quote,in my mind\u2026. I don't quit and I don't give up. That's my way of life.\ud83d\ude01 One more, When geniuses do something good, headlines are made , But,when failures succeed History is born. \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 Flashback ends..\ud83d\ude0c Fast forward, I entered medical school.\ud83e\ude7a\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2695\ufe0f\u2695\ufe0f Am here in my room,again at home in this lockdown, reading Physiology, Anatomy and biochemistry.(Hard to focus these days\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f), Writing diaries,poems\ud83e\udd13, doing gym.\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Life will change, but it'll take time. You'll get better. So it's good to be a loser at most stuff and enjoy but its best to strive to turn the tables around.\ud83d\ude09 \u262e\ufe0f ",

Just decide what you want to be a winner at and devote your time and energies to these things you desire. Time is life. When you waste time, you waste life. There is a difference between Fate and Destiny. Fate is what the world gives you; destiny is what you make of it. You can create your own destiny, just decide (best done in writing) and focus on it. Become what you want to be. Have what you want to have. Focus on the meaningful. Invest your time, your life, on the desirable. It\u2019s easier than you think. The girl of my dreams became my wife, the work I enjoyed became my career, I drove the cars I liked, I lived in the house I wanted, and much more. Just use your time to forge your destiny. Al ",
