            "answer_text": "The Covenant of the Baha\u2019i Faith is its strength. The Covenant of Baha\u2019u\u2019llah provides a clear set of texts delineating the future succession and governance of the Baha\u2019i Faith. See The Baha\u2019i Covenant | The Covenant of Baha\u2019u'llah. But it also provides a unity and motivating force for individual Baha\u2019is. This is so clear that 99.99% of all Baha\u2019is in the world belong to one common religious organization and nations have recognized legally the exclusive authority of that religious organization to govern the Baha\u2019i Faith and to own and manage the properties of the Baha\u2019i Faith. ..the Covenant of Bah\u00e1\u2019u'll\u00e1h\u2026is, indeed, the potent instrument by which individual belief in Him is translated into constructive deeds. The Covenant comprises divinely conceived arrangements necessary to preserve the organic unity of the Cause. It therefore engenders a motivating power which, as the beloved Master tells us, \u201clike unto the artery, beats and pulsates in the body of the world\u201d. \u201cIt is indubitably clear\u201d, He asserts, \u201cthat the pivot of the oneness of mankind is nothing else but the power of the Covenant.\u201d Through it the meaning of the Word, both in theory and practice, is made evident in the life and work of \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1, the appointed Interpreter, the perfect Exemplar, the Centre of the Covenant. Through it the processes of the Administrative Order \u2014 \u201cthis unique, this wondrous System\u201d \u2014 are made to operate.The Universal House of Justice, 1988 Dec 29, Individual Rights and Freedoms, paragraph 6 Despite fierce opposition and persecution in many places, the Baha\u2019i Faith has been the fastest growing religion in the world in percentage terms since World War II according to various sources (World Religions Religion Statistics Geography Church Statistics and Encyclopedia Britannica) and has become one of the most widespread and diverse religions (second only to Christianity today). Additionally, many clerics and religious scholars of the other major religions (particularly Islam, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Judaism) have converted to the Baha\u2019i Faith over its history. Thus, the Baha\u2019i Faith is able to relate to the other major historic religions and reconcile their respective teachings and scriptures. As Baha\u2019u\u2019llah states: \u201cIf occasionally, in accordance with the exigencies of God's consummate wisdom, an untoward incident should befall the friends, it would undoubtedly serve as a means whereby divine gifts and heaven-sent bounties will be vouchsafed unto them. Ponder thou upon the tragic episode that hath transpired in the land of Ya (Yazd). I swear by My life, every single event associated therewith hath led to the exaltation of the Word of God and the advancement of His Cause. Indeed whatsoever doth happen during the days of the Manifestation of God, though to outward seeming it is but grievous abasement, there lieth concealed within it incalculable glory and honour; and though it appeareth as dire torment, in reality a myriad blessings are enshrined therein. If those that have erred grievously were aware of the hidden mysteries of martyrdom. they would in no wise commit such deeds. \u2026With their own hands they help the Cause of God, though they themselves are wholly unconscious of it. Verily God would at one time render His Cause victorious through the aid of His enemies and at another by virtue of the assistance of His chosen ones. Concerning those pure and blessed souls, Our Pen of Glory hath revealed that which excelleth the whole world, its treasures and whatsoever existeth therein. \u2026 \u2026they fondly imagine that they can exterminate the Cause of God, that they would be able to extinguish His effulgent light, and to put out His heavenly lamps. Vain indeed are their imaginings. I swear by the righteousness of God that the more they endeavour to quench His Light, the brighter will it shine, and the more they strive to smother its flame. the fiercer will it burn. God's invincible Will far transcendeth their devices, and His Purpose is supreme above all human desires, inasmuch as all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth have been called into being through a single holy breeze --the Word of His command--wafted from His presence, and all shall be brought to naught through but one letter of His. From time immemorial He hath been established upon the seat of His sovereignty and through eternity will He continue to occupy the inaccessible heights of His glory. Every created thing is impotent before the evidences of His invincible might, and all beings fade into utter nothingness when confronted with the revelation of His awesome majesty.\u201d Baha\u2019u\u2019llah excerpt translated in Fire and Light. The Baha\u2019i Faith has the most extensive, documented, and authenticated scripture of any major religion and has extensive documented evidences and proofs due to its more recent origin. (The Forerunner, the Bab, declared His Mission in 1844 and then Baha\u2019u\u2019llah declared His Mission in 1863.) See Authoritative Writings and Guidance. This literature addresses many issues in the prior religions and issues of concern relevant to modern times. The teachings also encompass and accept modern science and reason as bases for discovering truths. Baha\u2019i texts always predicted that the Faith would grow and eventually encompass the world despite the fierce opposition and suppression in Iran and in many Islamic countries. This growth would be the result of our demonstrated peaceful nature and explanation of the wisdom and evidences and proofs of our Cause. As \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Baha explained: \u201cWhen Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h appeared, He declared that the promulgation of the truth by such means [of force or compulsion] must on no account be allowed, even for purposes of self-defense. He abrogated the rule of the sword and annulled the ordinance of \u201cHoly War.\u201d \u201cIf ye be slain,\u201d said He, \u201cit is better for you than to slay. It is through the firmness and assurance of the faithful that the Cause of the Lord must be diffused. As the faithful, fearless and undaunted, arise with absolute detachment to exalt the Word of God, and, with eyes averted from the things of this world, engaged in service for the Lord\u2019s sake and by His power, thereby will they cause the Word of Truth to triumph. These blessed souls bear witness by their lifeblood to the truth of the Cause and attest it by the sincerity of their faith, their devotion and their constancy. The Lord can avail to diffuse His Cause and to defeat the froward. We desire no defender but Him, and with our lives in our hands face the foe and welcome martyrdom.\u201d Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h and the New Era Even in Iran, the Baha\u2019i community grew at various times until the late 1970s when the Islamic Revolution and subsequent persecution forced many Baha\u2019is (about half in Iran) to flee Iran. This growth occurred despite the opposition of many forces in Iran even periods of open and sometimes less open persecution and discrimination. But the Baha\u2019i Faith also spread out over time, despite Baha\u2019u\u2019llah\u2019s persecution, imprisonment, and exile. The Baha\u2019i Faith spread out of its core country of Persia later in Baha\u2019u\u2019llah\u2019s lifetime. Then it continued to begin to spread and develop elsewhere during \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Baha\u2019s lifetime, particularly in Europe and North America. The Baha\u2019i Faith spread much more widely and intensively after World War II with rapid expansion and growth in Africa (Southern and Central parts of Africa), Latin America, and Asia and especially in the Pacific regions. The Faith more than doubled from 1953 to 1963 and the number of countries with significant numbers of Baha\u2019is increased dramatically. That growth accelerated at times in the period from 1963 through 1988 in many regions. Some areas are still seeing quite rapid growth in the past 20 years. This spread has made the Baha\u2019i Faith the second most widespread religion and religious organization in the world and produced enough Baha\u2019is to elect National Spiritual Assemblies in approximately 180 countries and territories in the world. Finally, the exile of Baha\u2019u\u2019llah to Palestine and eventual release of \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Baha from restrictions created a base and Holy Sites from which the Faith could grow and flourish without the fierce opposition and oppression suffered in the Islamic territories. The Baha\u2019i World Center is located on Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel, and the burial sites of the two Messengers of the Baha\u2019i Faith, the Bab and Baha\u2019u\u2019llah, are located in Haifa and Akka, Israel respectively.

            "answer_text": "Baha\u2019i Faith is alive but it is diminishing. Many people are leaving this religion due to apparent contradictions which they were not knowing when they joined it. Former UHJ Member, Mr. Hooper Dunbar admits the slowdown of the growth of the Baha\u2019i Faith in the United States. Question: \"Do you think there has been a slowdown in the growth of the Faith in the West?...What can be done about it?\" Answer: \"It has slowed down...It needs to be accelerated.\" -Dallas, TX - Hooper Dunbar - 2017 (Youtube) watch from 20 seconds onward.  Following are some of the lesser known facts about the Baha\u2019i Faith that are driving people away from the Baha\u2019i Faith: 1) Women are not allowed to serve the most Supreme Administrative Body, the Universal House of Justice. So there is no Equality of Men and Women. 2) Baha'is are working to establish a Baha'i inspired New World Order, a Baha'i Super-state, headquartered in Haifa, Israel. 3) Baha'is shun (ex-communicate) Covenant-Breakers and execrate them. 4) Baha'is persecute the so-called covenant-breakers, they have desecrated the grave of Diya'u'llah who was buried next to his father Baha'u'llah. 5) Baha'is have as many as 15 splinter groups, sects. 6) Baha'is have their religious text Copyrighted and religious symbols Trademarked. 7) Baha'is teach their 'faith' everywhere except in Israel for unknown reasons! 8) Baha'is lie regarding their population, they claim their population in India to be over 1.8 Million, while the government census of 2011, reveals their figure to be 4572. 9) Baha'is selectively translate their writings for western audience and there is very heavy Baha'i censorship. 10) There is no independent Baha'i Scholarship, all Baha'i texts need to be approved before publication. 11) Baha'is see all other religions as corrupted and dead. They believe that every religion has a life of 1000 years. There is nothing like \"unity of religions\" - they believe their religion is superior to all other religions. 12) Baha'is believe that Baha'u'llah is the sender of all prophets, the revealer of all holy books and Lord of the Lords! 13) Babis (predecessors of Baha'is) have killed many Muslims in Iran. Baha'is have also killed a few Azalis. 14) Baha'is believe their supreme body (The UHJ) to be infallible, they call it as 'Seat of God'! 15) Baha'i guardian Shoghi Effendi was a closeted Homosexual, he used to spend months in Switzerland with Baha'i money.
