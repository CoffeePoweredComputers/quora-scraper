            "answer_text": "No. In fact, the heart of the Reformation, the church movement which defined and separated the Roman Catholic church from Protestants, was returning to Scripture alone. The Apocrypha were well-known to be extra-Biblical, that is, outside the Bible, but they were received as wise books which were traditionally respected. But Protestants insisted that we cannot equate tradition with Scripture itself: just because a book is old and reverenced doesn\u2019t make it on par with God\u2019s own word. Unfortunately, the Catholic Church doubled down and declared the Apocrypha to be Scriptural at the Council of Trent, in a move that further alienated Protestants. So to be truly called a Protestant, one cannot accept the Apocrypha as Scripture. That\u2019s going against the very definition of what it meant, and still means, to be a Protestant. Edit - To address some confusion going on in this question, the issue is not whether some copies of the Bible include the Apocrypha. Yes, that happens. But the question is how those books are held - are they Scripture or not? The question is not just about printing, as Cernowain\u2019s answer holds. It\u2019s about canonicity - as the word \u201caccept\u201d implies in the question. A few Apocrypha facts:The Apocrypha are not part of the oldest Scriptural manuscripts we have. The oldest manuscripts tend to be from the Hebrew Old Testament. The earliest complete book containing the Apocrypha was Jerome\u2019s Vulgate, and in that version, they were included in a separate section, clearly labeling them as non-canon. Luther\u2019s Bible followed this precedent, and while he included the Apocrypha in the same volume as the Bible, labeled them quite clearly as non-canonical material. The Apocrypha has been generally recognized to be non-canonical since about 500 A.D. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Ever since the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) came out with a version that contains the Deuterocanonical books in 1989, many mainline Protestants have bought the NRSV Bible with the Apocrypha as part of the Bible. These denominations include: The Episcopal Church, the United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Presbyterian Church (USA), the United Church of Christ, the Reformed Church in America, and the United Church of Canada. Some of these denominations do not include the Apocrypha in their Sunday readings (although they are part of the common lectionary), however, and whether individuals accept the Apocrypha as \u201choly scripture\u201d is another thing as well. But the fact that the mainline churches have accepted a Bible with the Apocrypha restored was a major step forward in Protestant-Catholic-Orthodox church relations. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is no- this is because the Protestant movement originated with the teachings of Martin Luther who could not see any reason to pray for the dead outside of purgatory that he felt it necessary to remove books that mention the practice such as macabees. Some protestants claim the OT canon should be a strictly Jewish affair - the Catholic and Orthodox church are the only Christians who accept these books as scripture. As the comment remined me we Orthodox and Catholics make up the majority of Christians. The Longer answer is some Anglicans might- as there is an Anglican Catholic movement which wanted to see the Church of England be more of a Western Orthodox Church than protestant. ",
