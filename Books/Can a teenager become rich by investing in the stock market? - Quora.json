            "answer_text": "Sure, but it depends on your definition of rich. For a teenager, $5,000, 10,000, or $25,000 may be considered being rich. You are very smart asking me about investing as a teenager. I don\u2019t claim to know everything that there is to know about investing, but I do have experience in selling and owning mutual funds. I hope that you will pay attention to what I am about to tell you. Becoming rich in one, two or even three years when you are a teenager is not likely to happen unless you have a decent amount of money to invest. Even if you had five or ten thousand dollars right now to invest there is a good possibility that you could take a sizeable loss on your investments if you make the wrong investment decisions. You MUST know what you are doing when you invest otherwise the money you invest can become pennies on the dollar. That is not what you want to have happen when you invest your money. First of all, there are a number of things to take into consideration. What will you planning on doing in life over the next 5 years? Are you planning on going to school? If so, I don\u2019t recommend you invest any money until you have finished school and have a job. Keep your money liquid while going to school rather than investing it because the value of your investments could drop and stay down for several years. The last thing you want to do is sell your investments because an emergency has come up and you need the money to take care of this emergency. How much money do you have saved up for an emergency fund? I highly recommend that you have a minimum of six to nine months of income set aside as an emergency fund. Having said all of that, I would be OK with you investing $5, $10 or maybe even $20 a month, but no more, while you are going to school. Make sure that you will not need that money to live on. The sooner you start to invest for your future the better. You are at a good time in your life to start learning about money, money management and investments. The more you know about these subject matters the better off you will be in the long run. In particular learn about mutual fund investing. Stick with mutual funds rather than investing in individual stocks because the risk factor is extremely high when you invest in individual stocks. I would use no-load mutual funds to give you diversification. Fidelity offers a number of no-load mutual funds that have no minimum investment requirement. I invest very small amounts of money, just like I am suggesting for you to do, into five Fidelity mutual funds. You must understand that investing is something that should be done for the LONG TERM rather than the short term. Don\u2019t worry about the market going up or down because you are going to dollar cost average over the long term. Do this even when you are not going to school. As time goes by diversify your investments into 2 to 5 no-load mutual funds. Be sure that the funds are rated 5 stars by Morningstar. I have one fund out of 5 that is rated 5 stars, but I have no problem with this funds performance. As you get older and wiser you should start paying yourself FIRST. Get into the habit of setting aside 10% to 15% of every paycheck to pay yourself first. Learn to live within your means. Don\u2019t get into credit card debt. Credit card debt can ruin your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Highly unlikely. It takes years to grow, learn and get the experience to do really well. If you are willing to do the work then you can get a head start and master a trading style in two to 5 years depending upon your work ethic and focus. Your trades will teach you much but only if you review and learn from each trade. Start very small the learning process can be expensive, experience is often painful. Know your exits before you enter a trade and if the stock is stable enough (not prone to wild swings) use stops for entry and exits. And read everything you can about your chosen style and its top practitioners. Wear out the library card. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your idea of \u201crich\". There is no age problem with learning how to invest. But if you start young you have a much better chance of having a bigger pile when you reach 70 yrs This is because growing wealth thru investing take time and consistency. If I have started investing when I was in my 20s instead of in my 40s, I would have 5 to 6 times more than what I have today. So start learning. ",

            "answer_text": "In the US you can\u2019t get a brokerage account until you are 18, because minors (under 18) can walk away from contracts they sign. If your parents create the account and sign for it, you can do the trades and benefit from the earnings. It\u2019s unlikely that a teenager will be able to turn their $20/week allowance into millions in the short run. But starting early is a brilliant idea, and there are ETFs that can deliver very strong growth with nearly zero effort on your part. You can also try investing directly in stock, but it\u2019s a ton more work and you are unlikely to beat the ETFs. AVOID \u201ctrading\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a great way to go bust, and waste a lot of time and heartache getting there. ",
