            "answer_text": "The answer to this is always going to be a moving target as the industry evolves and changes from year to year. First, your agent should have your back and recognize when a contract offer is less than optimal. And they should be advising you whether or not to accept the terms of a given contract. The better you are paid, the better they will be paid. So they had better be working toward and recognize a good contract offer when it is made. In all honesty, most publishers expect they are going to be given \u201clifetime rights\u201d to your work. This means, they own the copyrights until you die and the copyright registration expires some seven decades later or so. So, this is what your agent is going to sell them\u2014unless you specify you want a time limit on the rights. This brings us to the second point: Negotiation. It depends on you (or your agent on your behalf) negotiating a time limit on the rights. It also depends on what publishing house you are negotiating with. Large, long-established publishers are likely to refuse to negotiate on this point and will show you the door. However, there are a lot of small publishing houses who are more than happy to accept a term limit on the rights. It also depends on your willingness and resolve to stick to your guns and demand an expiration date on the contract. You will likely be rejected by the larger publishers, but again the smaller ones who are just as successful will be more willing to accept negotiating with you. That being said, the larger publishers are beginning to wise up and be more willing to negotiate, because they are losing a lot of hit books going to the smaller publishers over this point. I hold that the shelf life of a popular book is about three years. From the moment it is published until the next hot author comes along and knocks the first book out of the popular list seems to be around three years. To me, a contract length of 5\u20136 years seems fair enough. If a publisher cannot get my book to sell within those three years, it probably just isn\u2019t going to happen. Either my book isn\u2019t good enough to sell or they aren\u2019t trying hard enough to sell it. It\u2019s best we part ways and take our business elsewhere. The opposite can also happen. The book proves to be enormously popular and continues to sell out demanding reprints. At the end of the contract, you can negotiate better terms and royalties and stick with that publisher. Else, you can take your rights to another company to get better terms. If your book becomes popular, it is likely the publisher will come to you with better terms in order to keep selling it. Third, there is one last option: reversion of rights. This is where you go to your publisher and ask them to revert the rights of your book back to you. If a book has sold out, meaning the sales have saturated the audience and they aren\u2019t buying any more copies, it is likely the publisher will turn over the rights to you without further comment. There are times you might have to take a publisher to court to get your rights back. I know enough friends that have done both. More often than not, the publisher relinquishes the rights. Going to court is expensive. About the only cases I know of where there was a problem getting their rights back, it was because the book was actually quite popular and still selling well. You may likely lose this case in court. However, it could be the publisher didn\u2019t want the author\u2019s book hitting the market because they feared it would compete with one of their bigger, A-list authors, so they suppressed the lesser author\u2019s book. This happened to a friend of mine and it took him a year of court action to get his rights back from the publisher. What won the case was the publisher could not show any sales data on my friend\u2019s book, so they had no argument that the book wasn\u2019t selling. They had it in their possession for over two years and showed absolutely no work on it. They never paid him an advance on sales royalties, so the court ruled the contract null and void. He got his rights back and published with another publisher. (I don\u2019t have all the details, but that was the general idea of it.) ",

            "answer_text": "Some of their rights, yes, but authors have to be shrewd and bring at least as much business sense as God gave a goat to the contract negotiations. Never (never) sign the first contract you\u2019re offered, no matter how many shiny rainbows and unicorns they promise you. That first contract is entirely in the publisher\u2019s favor, not the author\u2019s. From a publisher\u2019s perspective, writers are a cost-center, a swirling pit into which their money vanishes. The publisher has every reason to mitigate that cost, and their contracts reflect that. So authors have to know their rights, they have to know their own worth, they have to be willing to negotiate in their better interest, and they have to be willing to walk away if they can\u2019t tilt the balance of the contract more to their favor. Admittedly, as a first time author with no real reputation, your bargaining leverage is nearly zero. But you always have the power of \u201cNo\u201d, before you sign the contract. So don\u2019t sign until \u201cNo\u201d is no longer the best answer. ",

That is what is so great about it, you keep your rights and do what you want with your content. Use it for marketing, additional products, blog posts, etc I am not a fan of loosing your rights ",

            "answer_text": "If a traditional publisher publishes your book, you will have sold the rights to your book to them. So by virtue of publishing traditionally, you sell the rights. One can\u2019t happen without the other. However, it\u2019s possible to negotiate the sale of some rights, but not all. For example, some authors like to hang on to their ebook rights, but sell paperback and hardcover and audio. But, honestly, the authors who are able to do this are mostly established authors, not debut authors. If you want to hold onto your rights, you should consider self-publishing. I self-published my first novel and own the ebook and paperback rights to the book. I sold the audio rights and have sold some translation rights and hope to sell more. I also have a film/tv agent working on selling those rights. Whichever you chose, good luck to you! ",

With any luck they\u2019ll offer you a sizeable enough advance to make it worth your while. This is one of the areas where a good agent makes a difference. during the contract negotiation phase, you have to insist that they put in language that will allow you to recover your rights after they are done with your book. For a first time author, this is exceedingly difficult, because the agent will probably have nothing more to do with you after this one book. Statistically, that\u2019s the case, and for him to bust his ass so that you can recover rights to a title he considers soon-to-be-worthless, is hardly in his interest, especially if you getting rights back means a reduction in the size of his earnings.

These are divided by territory (e.g. US and Canada, UK and Commonwealth), language, and medium (e.g. print, digital, film, serial). As a first time author you will usually offer the publisher an exclusive licence for all these rights, and their rights department will sell them on, for which you will get a large percentage. You will often see in the publicity for a debut novel that it has been translated into several languages before publication \u2014 that is what has happened. The main reason to sell limited rights is that the publisher is not large enough to have a foreign rights department, in which case you say in your offer letter exactly which rights are available. ",
