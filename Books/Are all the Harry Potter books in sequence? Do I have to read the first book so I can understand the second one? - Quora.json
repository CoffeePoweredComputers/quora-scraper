It\u2019s because I watched the movies first from the first one to the last one. THEN, I read the books. As long as you\u2019ve watched the movies, you can read them in any way you want. (You\u2019ll still be able to understand the plot as clear as crystal, trust me) I read the seventh one first, then third, then fifth, then sixth, and then fourth. I haven\u2019t even read the first and second one. I will, though, one day. ",

            "answer_text": "You could jump around in the series if you wanted, I suppose. But a writer creates a series to be consumed in order. It\u2019s a gradual unfolding and progression. Rowling is particularly good at making tiny, seemingly unimportant details in the early books actually HUGE for the plot in later books. Read the series (and any series) however you want. But the story won\u2019t unfold as it was intended, so you might lose something in the development. I would at least not read books 5\u20137 before you read a couple of the first 4. Since the first 4 have an entirely different tone from the last. ",

If someone wrote a book series about your life, one book for each year, I imagine you would agree that reading the book about say, your sophmore year in high school, followed by 3rd grade, followed by the year you got married - it simply wouldn\u2019t make sense.
