            "answer_text": "I remember in the late 1950s, that when we went to Grandma\u2019s for a visit that included dinner with other friends beyond just members of the family, that the children were given a separate table, usually in the kitchen. My grandparents were considered \u201cupper crust\u201d in the small Southern Oregon town they lived in. The living-room also, was \u201coff-limits\u201d unless accompanied by an adult, and if there was to be a piano gathering with drinks and some music, we were sent to bed upstairs. Generally speaking in a holdover from the 19th Century affectation that \u201cchildren are to be seen, but not heard\u201d we were also constantly admonished to keep our voices down and play outdoors in the back yard only. One of the things that at twelve, drew me to my Grandma\u2019s husband, was that on occasion, he would ask my opinion of a subject. Sometimes, music, sometimes a current event, but that always took place when it was just the two of us, as if engaging a child in intellectual discussion was also \u201coff limits\u201d. I remember how stiff and formal portraiture of children was, from the colonial times until the early twentieth century. It felt as if adults really did not know how to think about children unless as small adults. ",
