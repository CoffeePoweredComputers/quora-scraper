            "answer_text": "In the US (other countries may be completely different), it is legal for you to publish an email that someone sent you, unless you have a pre-existing contract with that person to keep things secret (e.g. a mutual non-disclosure agreement). Contracts could be written or verbal. But when someone just sends you an email and ends it with some threats about publishing the email (or ridiculous titles like \u201cConfidential Legal Communication\u201d or \u201cNot for Publication\u201d) and you have no contracts of any kind with that person? Those threats have no legal authority, you are free to publish the email. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes we find significant differences between law and ethics. Yes, it is legal. The best protection against a libel suit is the truth, so by publishing an existing email, even a very damaging one, you just stated the truth. There are exceptions. If you had a binding agreement not to disclose it, then you are in legal trouble for publishing it. Ethics is a different matter. The standards of ethics are always higher than the legal standards. Publishing a private email is unethical. You should hold yourself to the higher standard. ",
