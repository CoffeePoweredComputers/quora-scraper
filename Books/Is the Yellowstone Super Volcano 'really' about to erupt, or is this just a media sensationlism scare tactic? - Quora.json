            "answer_text": "Answered 5 February, 2020 While a small volcanic event could occur with little to no warning, a super (VEI-8) or caldera-forming eruption is nowhere near about to happen. In response to dozens of clones of this question, a recurring answer is \u201cnobody knows,\u201d or, \u201cit could happen at anytime\u201d or the perennial \u201cit is overdue.\u201d (see collapsed comment after Tom Nathe's answer to Is the Yellowstone Super Volcano \"really\" about to erupt, or is this just a media sensationlism scare tactic?) For the record, Yellowstone\u2019s hot spot doesn\u2019t erupt nor has it ever erupted \u201cevery 600,000 years.\u201d Do the math, please. Jesse O\u2019Connor's answer to If Yellowstone eruption is 40k years late, why hasn't it erupted? At this time, the uppermost magma chamber beneath Yellowstone is only 9% fluidic. Yellowstone Volcano Observatory geophysicists say a great deal of measurable change which will take decades is required to bring it above 49%, to an eruptible state. Scientists Discover Massive New Magma Chamber Under Yellowstone Though most expert estimates agree (Jesse Lee O\u2019Connor \u674e\u6770\u897f's answer to If Yellowstone decided to finally go super-volcano on us, how much forewarning, if any, would the planet give us? Would it be instantaneous, or would we have days/weeks/months to prepare? What would any such forewarning look like?) the least conservative informed theory is: It could take weeks or months for those earthquakes to break up the rocks above the magma before an eruption What would happen if the Yellowstone supervolcano actually erupted? Because of the lack of large-scale crustal deformation (more than 1.6\u20134.5 cm/year) and lack of magmatic earthquakes, it is irresponsible to claim \u201cno one knows\u201d if it\u2019s about to (caldera-forming) erupt or not. Yellowstone\u2019s monitors are certain it is not able to super-erupt at this time. Volcano - Yellowstone National Park (U.S. National Park Service) Rather than increasing uplift, actual subsidence has been occurring: Jesse Lee O\u2019Connor \u674e\u6770\u897f's answer to The Yellowstone super volcano dome has risen 10 inches in the last decade. How much would the dome rise before a full blown eruption?  Why Thousands of Aftershocks of a 1959 Earthquake Just Rumbled Through Yellowstone 60 Years Later To disagree again with another answer, I can find no records that experts feared a Yellowstone super eruption in 1959; understanding of the magma chambers beneath the park was too undeveloped at that time. A book written then, The Night the Mountain Fell, 1960, Edmund Christopherson, doesn\u2019t mention the subject. 60 years since the 1959 M7.3 Hebgen Lake earthquake: its history and effects on the Yellowstone region The newest book on the event, The 1959 Yellowstone Earthquake by Larry Morris, 2016, also says nothing about feared links to an eruption. Yellowstone Ground Opens After 7.3 Magnitude Earthquake There has been other confusion over events in Yellowstone. While boardwalks were closed in Norris Geyser Basin in 2003 due to scalding mud encroaching on them, the infamous \u201cmelting pavement\u201d was actually in the Lower Geyser Basin in 2014. Jesse Lee O\u2019Connor \u674e\u6770\u897f's answer to Is Yellowstone becoming more volcanically active? These are occurrences of record which can be verified instead of only repeating as heard, furthering error.  Yellowstone National Park road melts into 'soupy mess' I agree wholeheartedly with another answer that fearful people are simply passing along uniformed, scare-tactic opinions. As for why certain non-science-based media wish to spread anxiety, it\u2019s all in the clickbait. If you see an intriguing photo and an alarming headline so that you open it up, sponsors hope you will see their adverts and thus grease the wheels of commerce. If someone spreads the rumours around, they have bought into and feed the disinformation machine. The same goes for Quora answers given quickly without benefit of researching first. If you don\u2019t see citations, links or documentation it\u2019s all just opinion and gossip.  Express online headline claiming Yellowstone volcano eruption was 'imminent' not supported by scientific research, IPSO rules - Press Gazette But those who are actually watching Yellowstone, or following those scientists who are monitoring it, do not throw up their hands passively nor wring them in trepidation. When the time comes, scientifically versant headlines will be broadcast. And, they won\u2019t be trying to sell you something. ",

            "answer_text": "No one knows. But the best indicators are chemical composition, and lift of land mass. Other than that the so called triggers have been inaccurate in the Yellowstone area. Back in 1959 a Major quake hit the Hebgen Lake Region northwest of Yellowstone. This quake caused a massive landslide and killed at least 28 people and caused damage to area shops, roads, and marinas. At the time \u201cExperts\u201d thought a Super Eruption at Yellowstone would be next. It never happened. Many of the folks crying like chicken little, must like to hear themselves talk. They for the most part have little to no background in Volcanology. They assume that this or that indicates an eminent eruption. They have said that the numerous eruptions of Steamboat Geyser (21 so far), indicate a Super Eruption is near. But back in 1964 they had Steamboat Geyser erupt 29 times, but No Super Eruption. Then they show how little work or research they have done, by posting really stupid items. They have claimed that since roads near Norris Geyser Basin have been closed due to the roads melting from thermal heat, that proved the Super Volcano was going to pop. But, if they simply took a side trip to Craters of the Moon National park, they would know that the Magma now under Yellowstone was once under Craters. Liquid Magma can move and has moved for centuries. So, the fact that some magma may be causing a road to melt proves nothing. This is why the Park Rangers strongly suggest visitors stay on Boardwalks inside the park. Since ground near features can become undermined and fail, killing the visitor. ",
