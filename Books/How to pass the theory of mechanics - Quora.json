            "answer_text": "In my opinion, there can be two ways to do that: First way is to identitify the professor who will be setting your paper. Then practicing the type questions, he/ she generally sets. I find this method much onerous than the following one, due to massive efforts and unpredictability. Second and the much easier option: try to take slight interest in the subject. I know, it is much easier to say rather than doing, but, it works. Before going into the details of the subject try to appreciate, how the subject would be useful for you in real life. For example, in the context of mechanics, it will help you understand that why you should not press your bike\u2019s brakes too hard while descending a slope. More simply, you can understand the mechanism of your cycle and may be able to repair it next time without paying a mechanic. If you are able to incite some interest for the subject, you will automatically start grasping the concepts. However, few concepts require more critical thinking than others. For those you can take help of your intuition, such as you can start imagining that \u201chow it wiul be if it was in reality?\u201d. Atleast, it has helped me a lot, while solving tough mechanics problems. Now, comes the exam part. If you are short on time and have some commabd on the basics, try to solve few questions on each concept to appearing in the exam. Also, make sure that while solving the problem you are not mindlessly applying the formula and know the actual application of that. Because the problem in the exam can be a higher level variation of the same formula which tests your understanding of the concept or equation. In thd end, i can suggest few excellent reference books for mechanics, which can be useful to you for understanding basics as well as solving some great and interesting problems: Concepts of Physics (Vol 1) by HC Verma (School level)Engineering Mechanics by Meriam and Craige (Undergraduate level)Engineering mechanics by Shames (Undergraduate level)Mechanics by Beatty (graduate level)Hope it will help All the best ",
