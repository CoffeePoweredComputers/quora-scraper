            "answer_text": "The comics code authority was a stamp of approval created in the 50s when comics were aimed at kids and there was a huge uproar against comics with a book called The seduction of the innocent that claimed Batman was a pedophile among other outrageous lies. The CCA was the industry trying to survive. The CCA was alive and well in the 90s when I managed a comic shop. But the 90s also saw the rise of mature comics like DC's vertigo line which were aimed at adults and my shop wouldn't sell some vertigo to kids. We carried things that were legally porn. Mostly comics showing sex or extreme violence. The owner required me to teach new employees about carding so we could avoid fines. The CCA was never a rating system like the MPAA. It was either on a comic (95% of the stuff we carried 20 years ago) or not (basically everything R Crumb did) There's always been comics that weren't aimed at kids. But in the 90s the big publishers started realizing there was good money in catering to adults. Mature comics boomed. Thankfully the CCA is dead now and there's a wide variety of stuff out there and not all of it is kid friendly. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost all Vertigo DC titles are R-rated. Europe Comics publisher has many titles R-rated like \u2018Tyler Cross\u201d comic. Dargaud has some of them too, like \u201cJazz Maynard\u201d. I recommend Source Point Press (Source Point Press) titles if you like horror genre, and Hard Case Press (http://www.hardcasecrime.com) if you like crime genre.Usually, Horror and Crime comic book genres are R-rated, happenig more unusual this kind of target audience in mainstream media. Eastern comics (manga, manhwa) have a gigantic R-rated comics library. Dark Horse published some titles in English. \u201cBlade of the Immortal\u201d,\u201cAkira\u201d and \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d are some of them. ",

Another post explains that they don\u2019t have that rating on them, just like video games and television use a separate rating system from movies, there are other descriptors for more adult material. To start with\u2026 Saga Criminal Sex Criminals Preacher are my favorites. Walk into any decent comic book shop and they can suggest twenty more. ",
