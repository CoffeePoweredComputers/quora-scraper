            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t need to; they could just read the data (text) before it reached graphics card(where it\u2019s changed into image and put on screen) and send commands, i.e. via USB port. If you\u2019d make a very bad implementation like the one you\u2019ve described(based on tags used), you\u2019d have to make robot with Optical Character Recognition capabilities. Much easier is just plugging it directly via i.e. USB or other port with proper drivers; hell, even plugging into video card output and using OCR would be better than camera+OCR (closer to the source, better quality) via USB you already have peripherials like keyboard or mouse - those things don\u2019t have to be physical though. Just send commands directly to the PC, without physical controllers. But now we\u2019ve reached the root of an issue. Why use 2nd computer (\u201cA.I.\u201d is just a computer, based on your tags, in physical self-moving shell) to control 2nd computer/application? Just put the \u201cA.I. part\u201d into the original application to automate as much as possible and maybe send results wirelessly or by cloud. What can\u2019t be automated/predicted with regular A.I. capabilities, probably should be done by human anyway - at least for a forseable future. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes this seems to be a reality in the future with the advances in science of machine learning and artificial intelligence that are taking place currently. AI brings about intelligence and the ability to think in machines just like humans. Slowly as machines gain intelligence , they also will have emotions to a certain extent and would become capable of doing most of the tasks that humans are doing now with much greater proficiency. So yes, to answer your question, an AI robot can learn how to type on computer screen and to understand what is being displayed . ",

Consider a dog that fetches its leash when it wants to go for a walk. A robot could be programmed to fetch the leash but it could not figure out how to do such a thing for itself. A robot could be taught to type commands at a keyboard but it could not figure out how to do it for itself. ",

To write you have teach it how to write intelligently. There needs to be intelligent algorithms which will enable such behavior. It is the future of modern day writing. ",

            "answer_text": "yes, but the robot would probably prefer to just plug into the USB port and do a direct interaction, which would be much faster. Of course, such a robot would enjoy finding computers with a least USB 3.0, or USB-C ports. Wifi or Bluetooth, could do as well. ",
