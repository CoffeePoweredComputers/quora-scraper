            "answer_text": "Since I was about 12 years old, I have wanted to be an English teacher. I had this whole plan for my life. I would finish middle school, go through 4 years of college, get a teaching job, wife, kids, etc. I planned on graduating college at 22. Due to my own flaws and some unexpected circumstances, I had to withdraw from college twice. I am now 22 and taking online classes as a freshman. Do I think you are a loser? Absolutely not. You just need to keep trying. If you don\u2019t have the career you want, work harder to get there. I have always been taught that it is better to make just enough money in a job you love, than to make millions of dollars doing something you hate. The key to success is to learn from your mistakes and correct them. Did you fail a test? Study harder next time. Are you not getting enough sleep? Go to bed earlier. So don\u2019t give up on your dreams just because you failed. As long as you still have the will to try, there is hope. ",

            "answer_text": "Only you can decide the answer to this question. I did not have the career I wanted, and never considered myself a loser. In my case: I wanted to be a research scientist and got my masters degree in physics. I was married to a medical doctor, and his practice took him to a rural area. There was no point in going further for my Phd. There were no universities or research institutes around. So I studied for a second career, and became an industrial accountant. I was controller (finance manager) of Allied Chemical. I did not think of myself as being a loser. I am retired now, and unfortunately lost my husband, he died 6 months ago. I am devastated, but using my time trying to catch up with science where I left it so many years ago. Not easy, because not only I need to learn what is new since then, and plenty, but I also forgot a lot. But I have all the time and this time around it is not for a career. ",

My parents told me that career choice would require a lot of math. I was only 11 or so, and I thought, I really don\u2019t want to be doing math all day. I ended up being a pharmacist and it requires more math than an architect. I wish I was an architect but I am happy that I am a pharmacist. Certainly not a loser. Also, I had a friend\u2019s dad try and talk me out of being a pharmacist and owning my own stores. People see the negative and not the positive. ",

However, if you are alive and not making your life by criminal acts and hurting people then you are basically successful. You can keep trying for the original plan. Or you can decide to be more successful in what you are doing. Or you can decide to do something else. Life is what happens while we are making plans. ",
