            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. I mull for days and even go into depression sometimes after I finish a sad book/ movie/ drama/ song/ etc. The last book that really made me 'emotional' for days was  the simple book- The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane by  Kate DiCamillo. I had a long wistful feeling after I completed the book. The last drama that really made me sad was- God's Gift- 14 Days. A dramas with similar theme as the above- 49 Days, also made me depressed for days because it connected with me emotionally and at that time I lost a dear childhood friend and watching this drama, was depressing but at the same time therapeutic.Some Korean dramas and movies and even some Chinese and Japanese ones can be just too depressing. Watching similar ones in a row can actually make someone depressed. The film that made me cry like a baby till date is- The Passion of the Christ and I really went into depression after I saw it and I am not even a Christian.  The song/ MV that got me thinking and emotional was- AKMU's Melted, 2NE1's It hurts, 2NE1's  Lonely, 2NE1's Ugly, Park Bom's You and I...etc...  It is absolutely normal to feel this way. If it didn't then the content was not strong enough to captivate you. If it did, then the writer/ maker/ creator/ etc have succeeded in their intention of storytelling/ narration. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I often get emails from readers of my novels who want me to continue writing a (completed) series they enjoyed. What I find interesting is how emotional some of them are about it. They feel a loss as though a relationship is over and it's a relationship they want to continue. When I get emails like this, I feel as though I've done my job well because I've created well-rounded characters people can identify with. On the other hand, I always feel a little sad and mean if I say \"No, I'm never writing another book with those characters again.\" (So I usually reply with \"I loved those characters too. I may go back there someday, but for now, I'm working on X, Y, Z.\") ",
