            "answer_text": "Publishing an adult coloring book is pretty similar to publishing any print book - the revolution of self-publishing and print-on-demand has made it a lot easier, and lower risk, for the author to attempt this.  Consider your market - who will buy your book and where do they hang out? Create your book - ensure you have the  right to use the images you are proposing. Format the book for print - consider the sizes and binding styles that will best work for a colouring book. Typically these books are printed on quite heavy paper stock, with wide margins. Ensure the gutter is wide enough for the book to lie flat for colouring.  I'd strongly recommend using a professional book sesigner rather than assuming a printer will do this for you  - they may offer but it's not their area of expertise. Get your book printed and work on offering it for sale where your audience hangs out (online or real-life). Warehouses and Distributors Work With Bookshops The large book shops  won\u2019t even talk to you as a self-published author. That\u2019s not because they hate self-published authors, more that they have a \u201ccentral buying system\u201d which is designed to work with distributors and warehouses not individuals. Their answer would be the same to you if you had a single plastic toy to sell, or a cute home-made widget. They only deal with distributors who offer them a 100 different plastic toys, widgets, or books. Now as a self-published author you CAN get your book into these retailers \u2013 but  you'll probably need a distributor who will take a cut. The process is something like this: Get a distributor to agree to take your book on (they will only take on what they think they can sell);Deliver around 500 copies of your book to the distributor;Expect to lose about 40% of the sale price to the books hop and another 30% (approximately) to the distributor, you pay for the printing.You will get paid once the book is sold on the terms of your contract with the distributor.Issues with this process for a self-published author is: You carry the up-front cost of printing and the risk of returns;You make a very small profit (if any) once you take into account the print costs and percentage required by the bookshop and distributor;Your book won\u2019t necessarily be featured in a bookstore \u2013 it will likely be down the back shelves, spine out, because your name is not Random House and you can\u2019t afford to pay for display tables near the front.Print-on-Demand Distribution \u2013 By-Passes the Warehouse With pure print-on-demand one copy of your book is printed when a customer buys it. The book is printed and shipped direct to the customer. The book is never out of print or stock. This is how Amazon (via their companyCreatespace.com ) delivers your book to anyone who orders it, whether they are in London, New York or Bangkok.  With print-on-demand it\u2019s literally set and forget for the author \u2013 I have one book that I\u2019ve never held a printed copy of \u2013 but its been sold all around the world as a POD paperback. There are two main issues with POD books: quality \u2013 the print quality is not as good as commercial off-set printing (used by large traditional publishers);price \u2013 the price is higher per a book than off-set printing (but off-set printing will of course need to print a lot more booksYou can of course still use this technology and then contract a distributor to get your book into bookshops. Or you can sell your book yourself direct, or you can approach smaller specialist bookshops who regularly sell indie books (Unity Books, some Paper Plus Franchises). Find Other Places to Sell Your Adult Colouring Book Adult colouring books are part of the larger \"mindfulness\" movement which is currently popular. I would consider contacting every mindfulness coach (and variations thereof) and offering them a  bulk discount  to buy their book for resell to their clients. Or for placement in their waiting rooms.  Consider trying to place books in places where people have time on their hands and are stressed: transport terminals, hospital waiting rooms, come to mind. Is there are market in retirement villages?  If you want to learn more - check out our 40 page guide to self-publishing - available free from  DIY Publishing Ltd ",

            "answer_text": "Adult coloring books have become really popular the last few years and we\u2019ve been busy helping our customers publish, sell and share adult coloring books. If you have the designs ready to go for your adult coloring book, the first thing you\u2019ll need to do is find a publishing company that offers the quality and creativity needed for these unique products. Paper needs to be the right thickness, pages need to lay flat for easy coloring, printing needs to be clear and high-quality, etc. Your files for the coloring book, including the front and back cover, need to be print-ready pdfs that you can upload to your publishing company for printing. Look for a company that is experienced in printing these unique types of products, can help you get an ISBN for retail sales, and can offer you A to Z services beyond printing, like listing on Amazon, working with your shopping carts if you\u2019re selling from your own sites, providing on-demand or bulk printing options, and fulfillment services if you don\u2019t want to do it on your own. Beyond that, here\u2019s a quick list of other recommendations I share with our customers for creating high-quality adult coloring books, I hope this helps: Spiral binding or saddle stitching is best so that the book will lay flat.Coloring books can be printed single-sided or double-sided. If you choose to print double-sided, use a thicker-weight paper to avoid bleed-through.Perforate pages to make them easy to tear out.Ask if you can print your book vertical or horizontal. Most are vertical, so having something horizontal will make yours unique!If you\u2019re interested in learning more about publishing and selling adult coloring books via your own website or on Amazon and other retail online sites, we can help with that too as we offer complete listing and fulfillment services. Or you can bulk print and have them ready to go whenever you need them. Check out our website or reach out to our team, we\u2019re happy to provide more information and free quotes for services. And good luck with publishing your coloring book! ",
