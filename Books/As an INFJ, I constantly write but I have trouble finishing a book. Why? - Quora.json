            "answer_text": "I think that this is a two part answer. While INFJ's are skilled at seeing the bigger picture, there are a lot of minute details that we sometimes miss out on. Other times, we don't even feel the need to focus on tiny details as we would find that tedious and annoying. (Probably because of our inferior Se.) As an INFJ, I do write often. But rarely do I ever complete a story. This is also related to the fact that we are perfectionists - for the most part. The way we envision a story is almost never able to be translated onto paper - as we would like it to. Sometimes our perfectionistic tendencies serve as an obstacle towards us accomplishing our goals; and that can frustrate us for real. ",

I am really trying now, though, to finish one of them. LOL I\u2019ve decided to just get it down - don\u2019t worry about whether it\u2019s perfect or even good - and tell myself I\u2019ll edit to perfection later. I wish both you and I the best of luck!
