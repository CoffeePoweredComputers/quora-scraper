Warning- The following answer deals with inside military humor and inter service rivalry. To answer the question means that I\u2019m going to be discussing some very non - politically correct descriptions. Every service has something of a joking rivalry with all the other services. When I find out someone was in a service NOT the Navy, I usually tell them \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, For Marines, I like to point out that they are the best army the Navy ever had, and when they tell me they were Coast Guard, I usually mention they\u2019re too short, since the requirement is that they be able to wade to shore if their ship sinks. I generally make the joke that I wanted to join whatever branch they belonged to, but that my IQ was too high, and they wouldn\u2019t accept me. So, it\u2019s with a lot of ribbing and humor that the other branches often depict Marines as enjoying a good box of crayons for a snack, or that their combat MRE\u2019s come in a variety of colors, such as Burnt Sienna or Aquamarine. This comes from the stereotype that children and some differently abled persons will eat crayons if they\u2019re given them. It\u2019s a dig on the mental capacity of our favorite jarheads. Many civilians will find this reference as being crass and insulting, but civilians aren\u2019t invited to comment on this rivalry. It\u2019s between the services. We respect and depend on each other as if we were old friends, and we treat each other as such. I meet a veteran out on the street or in a store, homeless or wealthy, and we instantly have something important in common. That we sometimes use politically incorrect references and terms is between us. If a fellow service member finds the joke in poor taste, then the joker will normally back off. We understand there are limits, and it\u2019s rare that those limits are tested.    ",
