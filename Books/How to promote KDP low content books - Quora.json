            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a common misconception that low-content or low-page-count books on the Kindle Direct Publishing platform don't sell well. There is a misconception that the lower the number of pages you have, the lower the quality or value proposition of your book. These don\u2019t necessarily go hand in hand because it all depends on perceived value. Let me repeat that - it all the depends on perceived value. You probably have heard that perception is everything. When it comes to buying stuff on Amazon Kindle, this is absolutely true. I\u2019ve seen completely trashy books sell like hotcakes. I\u2019ve also seen densely packed, high-quality books gather digital dust. It really all depends on how you sell them. So, it's not the amount of content, but it's the marketing that matters. For example, McDonald\u2019s makes burgers that a lot of burger purists and connoisseurs don\u2019t like. In fact, if you were to sneak them a Big Mac, they probably would vomit. However, McDonald\u2019s serves billions of burgers every single week. I hope you understand that it's all about marketing and positioning. This is why it's really important to not obsess about the content volume of the book and to focus more on the quality and positioning of the book. Different audiences have different expectations as to the number of words that would constitute a good book. For example, Machiavelli's classic, The Prince, has less than a hundred and fifty pages. It is a very small book, but people throughout history can\u2019t stop reading that book. That\u2019s how awesome it is. I can go on and on. There are lots of short books out there. The whole point here is not to obsess about word count or page count but to focus more on whether you are meeting the needs of the intended audience of your books. If you\u2019re worried about cost, don't worry about it. You can hire expert ghostwriters writers like Gene Eugenio who often write for $99 a book to create books for you. This is not a question of cost per se, but more of marketing and product positioning ",

            "answer_text": "You can start by running ads on Amazon and setting the price per click quite low. This will give you an idea as to which keywords are getting the most impressions. Other avenues would be through Pinterest or Instagram. The biggest piece outside of Amazon ads is learning where your audience spends time online, and go there. Finance folks may spend more time on Linked-In, where as stay at home moms may spend more time on Pinterest. So first research where your niche is, and go there! ",
