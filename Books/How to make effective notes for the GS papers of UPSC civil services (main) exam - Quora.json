            "answer_text": "Take 4 notebooks. Label them as GS1\u20134. Before making Notes: Read all standard and self-planned books at least twice. You will have an idea of the content and relevant portions. During making Notes: Read only the relevant books again and make crisp notes of the facts which need to be revised frequently and leave the basic understanding you already have. Don\u2019t write the whole story but only the key points or keywords which remind you of the story. Jotting down the keywords will help you create your own perceptions or else you will get driven away by the author. After making Notes: Read them repeatedly and to make it more crisp, take a bright highlighter and highlight the words which need to catch your eye before the D-day. Yes, You are ready with notes for GS mains! PS: You can always take your own call and do it as per your convenience. All the best! :) ",

I agree with it .. 1st of all you should understand what is the real purpose of notes making ?? if we read 2 hr a day a concept that will be there in our mind only for 6 days .. with revision on every multiples of 6 days it will be stored in our ROM . so ON D day you have to refer all the tons of information that u have read in a matter of hours..if dat is the case now think how your notes should be?every one will have their own art in notes making but do apply this also1. read a concept . close your book and eyes think for 2 min on what you have read then make the summary in your own words . repeat dis consistently u can set the thames on fire.HONESTY + CONSISTENCY + REVISION = SUCCESS.ALL THE BEST ",
