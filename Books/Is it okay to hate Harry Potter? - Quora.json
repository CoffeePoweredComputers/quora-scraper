            "answer_text": " NO!!! Listen you whiny, non-educated, misogynist, loser. Hate Harry Potter? That is not only un-American, it is inhuman. Crawl back under whatever rock you came. If you do not bow down and worship at the feet of the marvelous Ms. Rowling, I swear I will hunt you down, burn down your house, and kill your family as you watch. Cue golf clap Hermione:  Okay, seriously now. Is that what you think someone will going to say to you, if you tell people that hate Harry Potter? Hey, if they ever do, they are a psychotic idiot that you probably did not want to be around in the first place.   Do I like Harry Potter? Yes, I read the books, I watched the movies and I even took my mother that had also read all the books to the opening night for each movie. I bought the Harry Potter collection in hard cover certified first edition; over the years I have managed to collect several autographs within the book that has raised the value of the set. Two years ago, I took my mother for the first time to see Hogwarts and Hogsmeade at Universal Studios. She loved it and still talks about it and she even has her own wand.  Back to me. I said I liked the books and the movie. Do I love them? No. They are a nice easy read and enjoyable, but there are plot holes in the stories that you could drive a semi through. There are a ton of things you must gloss over and dwell to deeply upon. Why if James Potter came from such a rich family, he could not have some bodyguards and be in more protected place? Why did both James and Lily both not have their wands close by them? There are wizards after all and they knew they were on Voldemort\u2019s I hate you list, and I am to believe that neither had their wand nearby? Why could they just apparated, Rowling never even dignifies us with an explanation why they did not t apparate away. The ministry had time turners, which are prominently used in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Yet, they are never used again until The Cursed Child. The Malfoys are running around with not one but two time turners, an experimental one that Harry\u2019s son uses and a perfectly functional one that Draco still possessed. In Fantastic Beasts, when Grindelwald was captured why didn\u2019t he Magical Congress of the United States of America not simply execute him instead of holding him for 6 months and extraditing him back to England. Better, yet why did they let anyone close to him so he could switch appearances? Since we saw they had portkeys that could jump between countries, why just make a port key that allowed them to port back the ministry. You would think that the various major Ministries in the world would have ways to communicate back and forth instantly and ways to move between capitals with ease. But apparently not.  See? I have not even tried to go deep into the Harry Potter mythology, and I have stated half a dozen inconsistencies and remember, I like the series.  So, if you are a person that like more realistic storytelling, you will hate Harry Potter. If you are a person that finds stories that have spell casting in it and has wizards and witches as protagonist, you will hate the series.  There are a ton of reasons to hate and to love the series. Does it matter which you are? No, if you do not bash someone that has an opposite viewpoint than you have. So, please hate away upon Harry Potter, or love it. In the end, do what makes you happy and anyone that holds your viewpoint against you is a small-minded loser. Hope this covers why it is okay to hate Harry Potter. Thank for the request for an answer. Okay Harry, say goodbye to all the nice people:  ",

            "answer_text": "From what I see and who I meet, everyone knows Harry Potter and almost everyone has watched and/or read the movies and books. Pretty much everyone seems to like Harry Potter in the category who watch or read it. Some even have an obsession with it, which is nothing wrong with. Because it seems like everyone likes Harry Potter, it looks like you're weird or something to not like it. However there is nothing wrong with not liking Harry Potter. You have other things you are interested in and you like which other people hate. There is no rule you have to like the story. There is no rule which says that you're any different when you don't like (or hate) it. You like whatever you like and you hate whatever you hate. You are not any different of a person than anyone else who does like it. So yes, it is okay to hate Harry Potter. (Sorry if my English isn't correct. It is not my first language.) ",
