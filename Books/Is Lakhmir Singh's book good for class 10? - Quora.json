            "answer_text": "Bro,i am using lakhmir Singh since class 8 and it's the the best book for science If you are in class 9or10 then u should definitely buy this book its just amazing book .the concepts are so so we'll explained that u don't need any teacher to teach you . Some people will suggest not to buy lakhmirs Singh part-3(biology)and that's right but wait let me tell you the way to use the 3 part . Actually it's biology part contains some extra information .but to my personal experience u should first read the ncert biology chapters and take an idea about the concepts and information given ,then u open ur lakhmir for biology and read the text whichever part u feel is not in ncert just skip that \u2026.but i mist tell you that i experienced biology as the hardest subjct to understand from ncert buy hats off to lakmir sings bio ..i mean wow yarr it explained so so well that i scored 97/100 in 10 boards in science ..for physics and chemistry u can skip ncert because all the topics are included in lakmir Singh physics and chemistry and even the extra information given in these parts and just for making your ncert concepts more and more strong but the biology part contains extra information which will not help in the ncert context nor it is needed at the 10 level \u2026 Please please buy this book it's amazing but u have the keep the budget also .it's somewhat costleier i think the whole pack will cost around 1200 .. actually that's the only promlem with this book it's price is increasing with every new edition Hope it helps ",
