Now, if and when Mr. Trump chooses to author a book, he will hopefully have learned to avoid the accusations of plagiarism that have dogged his wife Melania and Conservative pundit Monica Crowley, Trump's pick for senior communications director for the National Security Council. In Ms. Crowley\u2019s book, What The (Bleep) Just Happened, the cable news network CNN found more than \u201c50 examples of plagiarism from numerous sources, including the copying with minor changes of news articles, other columnists, think tanks, and Wikipedia.\u201d(1) Further, Politico Magazine identified \"more than a dozen sections of text that have been lifted, with little to no changes, from other scholarly works without proper attribution\" in Ms. Crowley's 2000 dissertation, \u201cClearer Than Truth: Determining and Preserving Grand Strategy: The Evolution of American Policy Toward the People\u2019s Republic of China Under Truman and Nixon,\u201d for her Ph.D in International Relations from Columbia University.(2) At least Mr. Trump need not worry about the title of his future tome, as titles normally are not protected under either trademark or unfair competition law.(3) (1) http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/09/monica-crowley-plagiarism/96378590/(2) Trump Pick Monica Crowley Plagiarized Parts of Her Ph.D. Dissertation(3) http://www.copylaw.com/new_articles/titles.html ",
