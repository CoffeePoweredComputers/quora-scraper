            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know how close to average that I am, but on level ground and a firm walking surface, I walk about 3 mph. Since 50 minutes is 5/6 of an hour, multiplying 5/6 of an hour by 3 miles/hour yields 2.5 miles. If the walking surface is steeply sloped, the walking speed decreases (rolling downhill doesn\u2019t count as walking). If the walking surface is less than firm, the walking speed also decreases (try walking in knee deep mud). Given that you didn\u2019t describe the condition of the walking surface, I suppose that your question really doesn\u2019t have an answer. ",

This will vary greatly however depending on effort level, height, etc. Using that average, and knowing that 50 minutes is 5/6 of an hour, this \u201caverage person\u201d would walk a little over 4 K or 2.5 miles.
