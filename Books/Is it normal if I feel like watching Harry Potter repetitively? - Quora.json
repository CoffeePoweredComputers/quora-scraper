            "answer_text": "It is completely normal given the fact that the story detaches you from the rest of the world for those many minutes. I first watched it when it used to air during summer vacations on Pogo and i was #Flabbergasted by the imagination of J.K.Rowling and the how she connected all the scattered dots of the story eventually in the end :D And after that i never liked anything better than HP. Every single emotion, be it love, friendship, hatred, bravery, cowardliness, wisdom has been portrayed so well that as a die hard fan of HP, i find all my emotions heightened too :P I recently bought the set of all of it\u2019s books also, to gather the peculiar details of the story which are not there in the movies. I felt enormously happy when one day i was watching HP and my brother said, \u201cIsne Harry Potter Dus Crore baar dekhi hogi aur Dus me Paanch crore baar hame bhi dikhayi hogi!\u201d :D (English Translation) \u201cShe must\u2019ve seen harry potter Ten crore times and made us watch it too at least five crore times out of ten!\u201d :D So keep calm and watch Harry Potter. Again. And Again. And Again\u2026\u2026Till Infinity. :D ",

            "answer_text": "It happens usually. When you have just finished watching a movie (or finished reading a book) you have this overwhelming feeling where the end makes you heave and sigh and makes you feel empty. When you look at the end, happy or sad, you want to analyse the beginning of it and how far it has journeyed. This time you like to see whether there were any indications of how the movie would end, or see anything that you may have missed. Hence you feel the need to see the movie again. Harry Potter may be a child's fantasy but it has such complex story that each time you see it you find new things from it, you interpret many things. It is quite normal to watch Harry Potter repetitively . It just means you are becoming a Harry potter fan and on the way to become a lunatic ",
