            "answer_text": "The Russian Physics books are written for the love of physics. Yes... when you work out these books your love for physics increases. These books are not written just to crack an engineering entrance test but to make the reader love and appreciate physics. From the JEE point of view, these books are really concept strengthening material. But it only depends on reader how he uses the books. There are around 1800 problems in I.E. Irodov's 'Problems in General Physics'. If you consider these to be just 1800 problems and solve recklessly i.e. just working out mathematically and/or looking at the solutions without devoting much time, then this book is of no use. However if you work out each problem by first realizing the physical significance and working out using just the fundamentals then you can master problem solving. Each problem in that book teaches you to think is a large number of directions. This is what the JEE requires. You can use the books 'Fundamentals of Mechanics' and 'Basic Laws of Electromagnetism' by I.E. Irodov to learn some concepts required to solve the problems in his problem book. These books don't provide you solutions but they give you a direction to think in using a large number of examples.  Each problem in Irodov's book is beautiful and the examples in the later two books are carefully chosen to demonstrate the solving techniques. JEE physics will appear to be very easy (at least the Mechanics and Electromagnetism parts) if these books are solved religiously (Mechanics and Electromagnetism only). ",

Most interesting and challenging problems that i have come across in physics are from this book. If you develop the ability to solve 30-40% of all the problems in this book. You will crack the physics section of JEE like a 6th standard Math test. This book will test your very conviction towards your IITJEE preparation and will help you crack Physics portion of IITJEE. ",
