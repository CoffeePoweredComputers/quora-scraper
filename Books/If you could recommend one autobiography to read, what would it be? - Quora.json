Her diary ends shortly after her fifteenth birthday. 5. Chronicles, Vol 1 by Bob Dylan.  Bob Dylan needs no introduction. This is the first volume of his autobiography and it contains three chapters.

This beautiful piece of literature teaches us the hardships of life and the extreme racism the Black Americans used to face at one time. 7. The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Malcolm X.  This particular book is a solid example of the underside of 20th Century American life. Malcolm X poured out the details of his life, from the poverty of his childhood, to his criminal teen, and then his emergence as a national figure and world leader. The readers are never allowed to forget that converting to Islam was the major turning point in Malcolm X\u2019s life. This is considered a spiritual classic. 8.

This former world number one wrote about his life account, confessing to controversies, his love life, and his \u201chate\u201d for the game. This memoir is darkly funny and is regarded to be one of the National Best sellers of that time! 10. On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft by Stephen King.  This memoir is crafted exceptionally well and does not contain the slightest hint of horror in it (unlike King\u2019s other books!). After reading this, you will have learned about King\u2019s personal life, experiences, his struggles during pre-fame and post-fame, and what makes him such a popular horror novelist. The style contains good humor and good dexterity. Each part (there are three parts) is equally informative and enthralling. 11. A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway.  A Moveable Feast is a story of innocence lost. It tells the life events of the great American author and journalist, how he was shaped into becoming an author, his love interests, and his perspectives on things. Though the events are scattered, the book is still interesting in its own way. 12. Autobiography of Mark Twain by Mark Twain.  In this first volume of Mark Twain\u2019s memoirs, we see a colorful presentation of this great author\u2019s long life. The book is a classic itself, and every element, like style, scope, imagination, laughter and tragedy, prove it all. It also manifests the different roles he had in life \u2013 a family man, an author, a son, a brother, and a friend. 13. I Am Ozzy by Ozzy Osbourne.  The vocal of Black Sabbath may be not have a good reputation, but, at the end of the day, he is a human being too. And this is exactly what he tells us here. There are many things to learn from this man\u2019s experiences. This is a book written in details and humor. 14. Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler.  To understand Hitler, you must read this autobiography. If you start reading this book, you will be able to comprehend the \u201cother side\u201d of this tyrant and mass murderer. Mein Kampf is a German phrase meaning My Struggle. This book depicts his childhood, early aspirations, his conflict with his father, his rise to the politics, and his hatred of the Jews. The chronicles are poised frankly. Last, but not the least, 15. Dreams from my Father by Barack Obama.  This is a rendition of the struggles, of the relationships between families, of the racisms faced, and of the love affair of the current most powerful man in the world. Obama\u2019s writing style shows class and exclusiveness as he reflects on his personal experiences on the racial relationships in the USA. The knowledge one acquires from reading one autobiography is more than that acquire from reading a few novels. The readers can blend into the characters and witness the history from first-hand experience. I believe that people who love reading MUST have one at least one of these books in their collection. ",

            "answer_text": "I habitually read the biographies of British boadcasters, and also comedians. The Broadcasters tend to be an amazing bunch: Jon Snow, who fronts Channel 4 News, may have ended his career as a desk jockey, but until he retired from the field, he had a hell of a career as a war correspondent. Bell, Buerke, Bowen and Simpson are ALL -these days - \u201ccouch ornaments\u201d with some amazing stories to tell from their earlier lives in the field. Simpson\u2019s been in the game SO long that his autobiography runs to multiple volumes, all fascinating. During the American invasion of Afghanistan, it\u2019s widely joked that it was Simpson who \u201cLiberated the capital\u201d. At that time, the BBC World Serviice (on TV) had supplanted CNN as the Most Watched TV channel globally, and John SImpson had a popular program on the network, i which he and a tiny production team would turn up somewhere he\u2019d been before (Which could be almost ANYWHERE!) would meet up with someone he knew from there, and the two would stroll around the area in conversation about how life had change (or maybe hadn\u2019t changed) since he was last there. SO, as he wandered down the road into Kabul, he was arguably the best known face on TV worldwide. People came out to see him He strolled into Kabul surrounded by an \u201carmy\u201d of supporters. And the Taliban surrendered. Not to him, but he symbolised what they\u2019d been trying to keep out of the country. Comedians write interesting autobiographies. Eric Sykes is a comic I\u2019ve been lauhing at since I was a small child. TV, Big Screen, scriptwriting\u2026 and the UNfunniest autobiography ever written. Eric, I don\u2019t CARE who you\u2019ve met. I want you to be FUNNY\u2026 and you just weren\u2019t. Unlike Bob Monkhouse, who as a child I disliked, because he seemed \u201cSmarmy\u201dHe apparently suffered terribly from stage fright, and adopted a fake \u201cpersona\u201d that he could hide behind. A very VERY funny man, who while still just a child was driven around London\u2019s theatreland by his doting grandfather, so that he could go from stage door to stage door selling gags to some of the best known comedians in the trade. His autobiography is hilarious. (See, Eric - it CAN be done!) (He became one of Bob Hope\u2019s top gag-writers) Eddie Braben was the principal scriptwriter to one of the UK\u2019s all-time favourite comedy duos, Morecambe and Wise. Which clearly led to the choice of title \u201cThe Book What I Wrote\u201d. (a running gag, in the Morecambe and Wise show). I was amazed to discover that he began his career writing foor another top comedian named Frankie Howerd whose routine had always seemed to include a great deal of ad libbed dialogue involving his audience. Except, it turns out NOT to have been ad-libbed. It was carefully scripted and rehearsed. Eddie was a brilliant gag writer, and NOBODY KNEW IT, because everyone thought Frankie was the king of ad libs! Barry Cryer also produced a hilarious multi-volume autobiography.But probably my favourite Autobiography was by Sir David Attenborough. Who, in Britain at least comes close to having our very own Nelson Mandela. A man who through an amazingly long career has achieved so much. Botanist, broadcaster explorer\u2026 but how about TV Executive? Oversseing the first colour TV channel?! Wow! ",
