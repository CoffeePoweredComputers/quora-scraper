            "answer_text": "Dear Student, Being Quant Faculty, following answer will help you for Quantitative Aptitude section of GMAT. Quantitative Aptitude Section of GMAT is completely dependent on basic mathematics knowledge which everyone studies till 9th Standard. As you just completed your 12th standard, you are having a time of 2 years to prepare where I am assuming that you will be appearing for it in your 3rd year of graduation. During your first year, I suggest you to go through NCERT books of Mathematics from Class 5 to Class 8. At the same time concentrate on your college studies also so that you can end up with good results which are very helpful at the time of admission through GMAT. Once you complete basic NCERT books, I suggest you to purchase Manhattan books for further preparation. I prepare students on one to one basis. If you wish to contact me, you can visit my Quora Profile to get my contact details. Or Click Here. Anshuman Joshi Thank You. Best Of Luck !! ",
