            "answer_text": "BASE School of Economics is indeed a great institution. This is the third year running as on Oct 2019. A very beautiful campus is coming up in a faster mode along with hostel for boys and girls and will be commissioning by another year or so. The faculty are well knowledgeable, students are talented. If someone is looking for success and academic achievement, then I feel this is the right institution for an aspiring Economics student. Syllabus is very current and covers all aspects of student and industry interest. Foreign languages are taught in the course for example, German. Located near National Law School Bangalore, the campus is integrated with library, other various departments, hostels, and it is just a fact that the BASE SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS, is undoubtedly an institution sought after by the brilliant students spread all over India who want to be outstanding performers in the field of Economics. Students with a strong background in mathematics, good English skills both written and spoken coupled with sound and keen interest in Economics and outstanding presentation skills , will undoubtedly reach greater heights in this institution. Admission is through an all India entrance test. Anyone with good number skills, thorough grasp of English grammar, strong comprehension abilities, excellent logical reasoning and good general knowledge and current events can get through if they prepare well. It will definitely take an year or so for this institution to be in full swing with its infrastructure almost nearing completion and hostel facilities ready with classes now happening in the campus. The course is residential. The overall fee is One lakh per year with hostel food Rs.4000 extra monthly. ",

            "answer_text": "As far as i have read. It seems a good institute to join in. It looks like a visionary step is being taken to improve the economic skillset that India needs. Especially from the perspective of Dr. Ambedkar. India is a different country in many aspects from the rest of the world. Institute like this will help the country to address this issue. The curriculum combined with economic news and online support for economics will create a huge impact in India. I think people should take this up. We need economists equipped with modern thought. All the best. ",
