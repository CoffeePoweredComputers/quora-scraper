            "answer_text": "An Hour. Sometimes, 1.5 Hours.  I always used to be an avid reader, of fiction initially and branching out later in life. Now, I read anything from Jane Austin to Richard Feynman's lecture notes. Coming to my place, my pace used to vary drastically before around 7th grade, with my pace being fast with novels and other material I like very much, like comics and magazines and such. And I was relatively slower when it came to reading textbooks issued by school. I still am slower in reading certain texts, but they are mostly personal notes made by people, where I take time in discerning each word itself. A surprising thing that I discovered about myself is that I take around the same amount of time to reach around the same number of pages in 2 different books, even with relatively big differences in number of words per page and font size. I never thought about it much, but now that I'm writing this, I have a theory that I read by looking at a part of a page. And most books come in around the same size. Of course, with books like Narnia, where I tend to buy all the 7 books in one big volume, and the book is humongous and the words tiny, I take longer to reach 300 pages. But then, I find that I don't track time because once you get immersed in a book, you just float off into the book's world, and can actually 'see' the story unravelling around you. The main reason why I prefer books to movies and not because of the story or anything, irrespective of popular opinion. Unpopular opinion: I don't think a story can be better or worse. I sometimes find a movie's interpretation to make more sense that a book. But largely I prefer novels, but that's mostly because of practicality, where even if we live in a technological world of cgi and realistic graphics, it's hard to trump the boundaries of a novel, which are literally none. The sky's the limit is for movies. Novels have no limit. I went slightly off track but coming back, reading speed is one thing I'm happy I have. I know most people normally think about reading books in terms of days, but with the Advent of some reading-based apps, people tend to 'speed read' which I find a bit annoying, no offense to the speed readers. This could mostly be due to my adversity towards reading on screens in general. But I really feel that people should enjoy a nice book, and take it in as long as it takes for them to. Speed reading and all is ok if you have to study in a short time or something, but mindlessly trying to read faster seems a bit pointless. The book is there to be enjoyed. Enjoy it. Savour it. Find your style of reading and stick to it. And if you truly get used to reading and appreciate it wholeheartedly, you will tend to get much faster. That's it. Later. ",

            "answer_text": "When measuring reading speed, as many pointed out, pages/hour is a poor measure when even standard paperbacks vary the number of words/page by over a factor of two, and syllables/word vary too. Nobody has discussed the effects of age and education on reading speed. When I was young (10-13 yo), I used fly through books targeted to people several years older than me.  These were often narrative non-fiction or general science, with lesser amounts of fiction thrown in. Once I got to HS, things slowed down a bit for NF, largely because I was reading higher level material.  But it was also because my knowledge background had increased to the point where I could seriously compare the material to previous knowledge and ponder alternatives. College destroyed my reading speed, as it does for almost all, except for fiction, for me almost always SF at the time.  I still read that reasonably quickly, typically 1 page/minute and up.  I didn't have as much time to ponder, either, although I did most of this reading in the summer when I had no studies, but a full time job and a long commute that also involved a lengthy time with the newspaper. When I was 25 or so, I read the first two and a half volumes of Will and Ariel Durant's Story of Civilization, and surprised and disappointed to find that my speed had dropped to 20 Pages/hour, sometimes 15.  In retrospect, I should not have been.  The word density in words/page was high, and so was the information density.  I would also read technical works in my field, and often did a fast first reading which was not a true reading, but a run-through to find what was there and what any major conclusions were important.  I would later take much longer with sections of need or interest. Now I am nearing 60 yo, and I read much slower.  My mind usually wanders, but that is a good thing, because one of the benefits of reading for pleasure is to stimulate the mind.  Thanks to the internet, I often find things to look up, which I jot down on paper and look up at an opportunity.  My ability to remember details is less than it once was, so I find myself forgetting minor characters and incidents that later turn up as important, but that's life. Reading speed makes a difference with your professional and educational time.  Faster is not always better, it is appropriate learning per time that is important.  For recreation time, don't worry about speed, and enjoy it. ",
