            "answer_text": "we all evaluate people, and everything, unconsciously, and consciously (so not in a bad way sort of speaking) I judge people based on the overall impression they leave on me... their personality, how they talk, walk, treat other people, see themselves... that we perceive using our logical parts of the brain, and also by the way they make me feel (emotional parts of the brain) when we interact, that is perhaps the most important element here... and also there is some intuition involved, you can have certain feelings about someone, liking or disliking them, for no obvious reason first time you see them in your life... basically, I judge people based on how sincere, truthful, honest, persistent, hard working, openminded, helping, thoughtful, kind and loving they are. If someone is rude, to anyone, even stranger on a street, that can not be a nice and good person. ",

            "answer_text": "The worst specific way people judge others is to criticize them. Most always, unfoundedly, labaling or assuming they know from looking at a person what they\u2019re all about. A summing up of someone they know nothing about by merely looking at them. Or being assuming with someone closer, without asking. Some judge others by groups, language, skill, appearance, and rank, and by their standards. Who has the authority to make such judgments? I think before any person judges another, they should look deep into themselves first; a good practice to have, because every person alive has something someone can judge you for. Being judgmental is one of the worst things you can do to someone else, it\u2019s like a saying I read; \u201cdrinking poison and expecting the other person to die.\u201d Who dies inside is the judge, or accuser.
