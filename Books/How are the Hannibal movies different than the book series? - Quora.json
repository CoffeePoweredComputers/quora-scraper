            "answer_text": "EDIT: content review has merged this into a less appropriate question, so I will just note that this answer is about the ending (the main substantive change.) Ha! They chickened out. I have this theory that Hannibal, the novel, could not have been written without the movie adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs. Harris writes whole scenes which seem to anticipate being filmed; but then he also switches up the genre, so that while Lambs is a police procedural with a modern Gothic horror aesthetic, Hannibal is essentially a macabre black comedy in which a serial killer is a romantic hero. I read Hannibal as daring them to film it. Daring them to make a sequel that is a radically different kind of story with a different kind of tone. And the filmmakers chickened out: the ending is nonsensical, but preserves the genre that Lambs made loads of money in, and I guess the idea is that moviegoers would be put off by the big switch that Harris intended. (I suppose also that the end of the movie allows for a sequel, and the end of the novel is where Harris feels the Lecter story ends; when he went back to the well it was Hannibal Rising, a prequel.) I would really like to see a version of the movie which was faithful to Harris\u2019s book; although a lot of the exposition at the end is right in Lecter\u2019s head, and not obviously filmable, which I would cite as another reason why the film might have swerved it (but I think the main reason was: they chickened out.)

            "answer_text": "I believe there were many rewrites of the script in an attempt to make the story more palatable to Jodie Foster, who hesitated to return as Clarice. What primarily appealed to Foster in Silence of the Lambs was apparently the scenario where one woman comes to the help of another (the victim of the kidnapping). The sequel novel takes the story in a very dark direction, where Clarice ends up as Hannibal\u2019s lover and even partakes in cannibalism with him. This apparently did not appeal to Foster at all, and she even hinted that she didn\u2019t want to betray Clarice \u2014 her vision of Clarice \u2014 in such a way. In the end, no amount of tinkering with the ending could satisfy Foster, and she found an excuse to decline to return as Clarice, to the great dismay of Anthony Hopkins. The part was recast. Nevertheless, it was a rewritten script that was shot. ",

            "answer_text": "Because not only is the ending of the novel long, slow, and drawn out over weeks as Hannibal works on basically hypnotizing a still-recovering Clarice, and the climax turning on a very internal moment (when Clarice realizes not only what Hannibal\u2019s trying to do\u2014turn her in essence into a replacement for his dead baby sister\u2014and subsequently turns the tables on HIM, and, well, seduces him) the ending is, well, Clarice seducing/being seduced by Hannibal and running off with him in what is basically a Happy Maybe-Murderous Ever After. The book ends with Barney and his wife in Buenos Ares, there to see a Vermeer, when at the opera Barney sees a gorgeous woman in emeralds and a sleek-haired man and recognizes Starling and, though it\u2019s never spelled out, realizes who she\u2019s with and decides they need to leave town now.
