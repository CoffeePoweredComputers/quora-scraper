            "answer_text": "In the book, Ender was 6 when he left Earth for Battle School and 11 by the time of the *ahem* \"final examination\" battle. I haven't actually seen the movie to know if it actually states Ender's age, but the film-makers have said Ender in the movie is 12. They changed his age for a couple of reasons: (1) It's hard to find actors that young who could effectively portray a character as complex as Ender.  Hundreds of kids aged 7-14 tried out for the part.  The younger kids could either get the shy, contemplative part or they could get the angry, assertive part, but they couldn't get both.  They ultimately cast a 14-year-old who, aside from his height, could pass for 12 (he was 15 by the end of filming). (2) They went with a condensed time frame, (a) because the movie is only two hours long, and (b) because they didn't want to have several different actors playing Ender, such that the audience would just be accepting one version when he was replaced by another.  They feared that would take people out of the story. ",
