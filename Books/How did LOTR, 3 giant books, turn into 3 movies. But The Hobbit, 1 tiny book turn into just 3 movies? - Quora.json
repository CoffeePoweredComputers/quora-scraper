There was material, when you added in the other events going on, like the events at Dol Goldur and the military tensions, to make 2 movies. basically corporate greed forced Jackson\u2019s hand. There were 2 legitimate movies there. You could have ended one with Smaug and the other with the Battle of Five Armies. ",
