            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hasn\u2019t been confirmed or denied that Harry is bisexual, which means that everything is based on subtle details from the books. I personally think J.K. Rowling only accidentally made Harry bi, but I\u2019m disregarding her intentions. He\u2019s definitely not homosexual, having shown obvious interest in Cho in Ginny. He never explicitly states that he has a crush on any male characters (although, it takes him an extremely long time to confront his crush on Ginny, which hints that he could just not realize he\u2019s bisexual). However, he does repeatedly state several boys as handsome, probably more so than he does with girls. He also develops unusual interest in some of the boys that he consistently describes as attractive. Cedric: I firmly believe Harry had a crush on Cedric. He didn\u2019t realize it, but he didn\u2019t recognize his crush on Ginny for a very long time, either. He was very blatant about how handsome he found Cedric. He was also very shaken up when he died. It was understandable, considering it was the first death he saw, but it had more effect on him than any other character\u2019s death seemed to have, even though they weren\u2019t very close. Draco: If we compare Harry\u2019s crushes on girls with boys, we can see some similarities. When Harry is attracted to a girl, he grows slightly obsessive (like in the Deathly Hallows, when he watches Ginny on the Marauder\u2019s Map, or when he\u2019ll watch Cho Chang in the Great Hall). He also wants to impress them. Both of these things happen with Draco Malfoy, who Harry grows completely obsessed with in the Half-Blood Prince. He also cares a lot about how he acts around Draco. Tom: Harry describes Riddle as \u201chandsome\u201d and \u201ccharming\u201d many times, whenever he sees Riddle in the Pensieve or diary. In the Chamber of Secrets, he immediately trusts Riddle, even after receiving several hints that he\u2019s untrustworthy. Bill: Honestly, how many times does Harry have to mention how handsome Bill is? He also describes Bill to be handsome in an edgy way, which I don\u2019t think is something most straight boy think. Clearly, since Rowling hasn\u2019t confirmed Harry\u2019s sexual preference, it\u2019s impossible to be sure he\u2019s bisexual, but I think the clues in the books suggest that Harry is attracted to both men and women.

            "answer_text": "I am not sure but you could certainly make the case that he actually is. Harry does notice the looks of other men more than most straight guys would. I give some examples: Teenage Tom: \u201cHis was the most handsome face.\u201d Young adult Tom: \u201cHis hair was a bit longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollow but all this suited him well. He looked more handsome than ever.\u201d I am laughing so hard because Harry did the same with Tom\u2019s dad: \u201cOgden collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome dark-haired young man\u201d. Cedric: \u201cCedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen.\u201d Sirius: \u201cHe was carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it\u201d.
