One Advantage of this test is that, there is no time limit. So if you were not sure about some questions, then you can take Help from Internet.Guidelines Test:- According to me, it is most crucial and Important Test as a Chegg Expert as your Journey at Chegg is totally dependent on How you were Following the Guidelines. So, Download the Guidelines pdf. Read it carefully for 5\u201310 minutes. Put your Main Focus on \u201cHonor Code\u201d Section. Once you have read and Understand the test, Go through the Guideline test. It contains a total of 20 Questions out of which 70\u201380% should be correct.Documents Verification:- Keep a Scanned Picture of your Aadhar Card(as Address Proof), Your College ID or Marksheet as Education proof before starting the registration. Try to resize both the Picture upto 2MB. Upload it when required.Bank Verification and PAN Card:- This is also one of the crucial step in registation. If you Don't have PAN card, then Apply it as soon as you can as it has now become Mandotary Process. Keep a scanned photo of PAN card upto 2MB. Upload it.

You will receive a confirmation Email regarding your Onboarding Details and Grant of Answering privilege. Note:- I am not giving any assurity about, how much time it may take to receive Confirmation E-mail, when your Answering privilege will be granted.

            "answer_text": "There is proper selection procedure in CHEGG India. There are two tests you have to qualify to be a chegg expert: Subject Test : In this test 10 MCQs will b asked and questions will be GATE level if you are from Engineering , You have to score more than 90% in this test. In first attempt if you don't clear the test then you will have one more attempt to qualify and unfortunately if you make it this time again then your candidature will be revoked.Q&A Guideline Test : This test is very easy but essential to be an expert. I want to make it very clear that only after qualifying the subject test you can give this test. First they will mail you Q& A guideline ( Question & Answering guideline ) then you will be tested how effieciently you can answer questions.After clearing both the tests acknowledgemrnt letter will be sent to your mail and after scanning the letter you to sign the terms and conditions of CHEGG and revert in the mail.
