            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, Yes, indeed it's absolutely important for NEET, I loved this chapter, it was my one of favorite ,you are asking whether it's important or not, that means you think whether you can skip this chapter or not, so the answer is a Big No because It forms the base for furthur chapters in inorganic,most important is the concept of hybridization,VSEPR theory-as it describes various shapes in molecules,in furthur chapters it will be helpful in identifying shapes in a second when talking about properties of a particular molecule,also you will be able to know bond angles,And the topic H-bonding is also important and is used in other chapters too. Also every year 2\u20133 questions are asked from this chapter,especially about alredy told VSEPR theory- shapes of molecules, and how can we forget bond order, generally basic questions are asked on bond order i mean of most common molecules like O2,N2 and their respective colleague ions like superoxide, peroxide etc. Better remember them to save your time as there is not sufficient time to draw MOTs fully, and yes they are easy to remember,Also give importance to exceptions-in case of some bond orders like CO+(3.5 instead of 3) and in some bond angle variations due to lone pair, And.... Resonance-Uff,how can you skip this concept forming almost every second explanation for variations in organic chemistry,practice drawing resonance structures before starting of organic chemistry, you will not understand this much at first shot but gradually your understanding will increase. Try to understand each and every concept at first shot and revise it frequently. All the best!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi FATIMA BATHUL Chemistry 1. Inorganic Chemistry Inorganic Chemistry carries a weightage of 34 %. Among all the units, Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure carries the maximum weightage of 29.4%. All the major important topics are covered in this section. It is then followed by Co-ordination compounds from which nearly 17.6% of the question were asked on average from this unit. 2. Organic Chemistry Organic Chemistry carries the maximum weightage of 35.6%. From this, nearly 30 % (assuming total 100%) of the questions from previous year paper were fromOrganic compounds containing Oxygen. Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry is the second most important chapter and thus carries a weightage of 24.4%. 3. Physical Chemistry This unit was given high importance in NEET 2017 exam. Accordingly, this unit carries 30.4% weightage.(Assuming total 100%) Among all, States of Matter and Solutions (24.1%) is the most important of all followed by Equilibrium (18.2%). Rest of the questions were asked from the different chapter covering Chemical Kinetics and Nuclear Chemistry (14.6%), Thermodynamics and Thermochemistry (13.1%) and others.
