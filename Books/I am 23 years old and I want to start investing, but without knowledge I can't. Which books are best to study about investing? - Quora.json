            "answer_text": "hi you can check my profile in bio 2 links provided so join both link I have been an independent trader.I have traded through every bear and bull market since the mid 1970s. And this is what I would tell my own child if they came to me and asked the same question. First, do not sign up for any \u201ceducational\u201d courses from anyone claiming to want to \u201ctrain\u201d you to become an investor/trader. People that know what they are doing in this field generally do not hire themselves out as teachers. They are too busy actually trading/investing and making money at it. You don\u2019t see people advertising to teach you to perform neurosurgery do you? It takes years of diligent study and investing/trading is no different. Yes, there are savants in every field who are just naturals, but they are rare. For the vast majority it takes years of hard work and study. Learning to be a good or even great investor/trader is no different. Instead, find a good mentor who is already a successful investor or trader and see if they would be willing to perhaps take you on as an apprentice. But only do that after you have done the other things I mention below. That\u2019s what I did, or rather lucked into, and it was one of the most fortuitous things that ever happened to me. I would also suggest avoiding financial newspapers and financial TV news at first until you have learned the skills listed below. They will only teach you bad habits until you have learned to parse through the copious amounts of misinformation and BS that gets thrown at you by the financial media. Generally, the best reason to read the financial press or watch the financial media is to learn what NOT to do or how to do the opposite of what they say. If you have \u201czero knowledge\u201d about investing/trading, as you say, don\u2019t go near the markets yet. Instead first learn how to manage risk on a small scale. How do you do that? Practice with gambling games. Learn to be a skilled poker player, backgammon or bridge player. Learn to count cards at Blackjack. Learn to handicap horses and sporting events. Make your mistakes small in these areas first and learn to manage risk because that is how you succeed at gambling games. Besides, its great training for future investing/trading. Almost every great investor/trader you can name first developed an expertise in one or more games of chance before they ventured into markets. Victor Niederhoffer, the hedge fund manager, used to choose his interns by giving them a couple of hundred dollars and sending them off to the race track at Aqueduct to bet on horses for a few weeks. The ones that showed a profit he hired. Warren Buffet handicapped horses as a kid then became a top bridge player. Carl Icahn was a champion chess player. Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer were great poker players. Blair Hull and Ken Griffin excelled at blackjack. The list is as long as both your arms written in fine print. Next, once you have developed some skills at risk management, then start delving into books on investing and trading, but only then. When I decided I wanted to become a trader in college back in the late 70s I too knew nothing about investing. But I had a good mentor and I went to the library and devoured everything I could find on investing, economics, history, psychology, etc., etc. I recommend you try something similar After that, try your hand at some of the practice investing and trading simulations offered by most major brokers these days. See how you make out with the risk management skills you have already learned. Then, once you have done all that, you can go into investing and trading armed with the skills and knowledge you need to succeed. Until then just remember that the real key to being a good investor is pretty much the same as in the rest of your life. And that is to simply do the right thing, every day, as often as you can, as consistently as you can. But you have to know what \u201cthe right thing\u201d to do is first and that is why you first need to learn how to manage risk above any and everything else. ",
