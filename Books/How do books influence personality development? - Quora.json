Reading from an early age can influence the children to be patient, understanding and more intelligent. Reading stimulates our mind, making us think more. this way we are able to understand and enjoy the finer things in life that usually eludes everyone else. not to mention, a regular habit of reading makes us more understanding of other people\u2019s opinions. now we come to the effects of different genres of books. there are many, There are many genres of books out there, from fiction to non-fiction. Different genres of books influence us differently and make us think in a different way. of course, a fantasy fiction loving reader is not going to look at the world the same way an autobiography loving reader will. this way, different genres shape our world view and help us to perceive the world in unique ways. Reading however, is a lost art today. since we are already consuming so much content throughout social media platforms, we are kind of weary of reading long texts. however, reading makes for a deeper and more refined understanding of everything around us and it is incredibly important to mature and grow as a human being. you might even say that reading is what makes an ape a man. of course, giving a chimpanzee a book will hardly do any good. but us humans have a sound understanding of the world, therefore, reading will help us grow into more understanding, patient and steadfast species on this planet. and judging by what is becoming of the world society, i feel that we need the habit of reading more than ever now, today.

            "answer_text": "Hey Piyali, thanks for asking A2A, \u201cA reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.\u201d \u2015 George R.R. Martin, A Dance with Dragons It\u2019s not just another dialogue for poetic gratification. Effects of reading on one\u2019s personality cannot be expressed more beautifully. For people who have never read a book, or have never been into reading, this might come as a surprise. But, for all those crazy book lovers out there, let me raise a toast right away. Yes, reading shapes our personality and so delighted we are, that it does! The effects begin to show the moment you start reading. It\u2019s quite similar to taking a deep plunge, to explore the limits of underwater life, and never looking back. Ever wondered why there\u2019s a growing insistence on book reading as we grow up? Bedtime stories, childhood fairy tales, library books and what not! Reading is a lot more than being a mere knowledge enhancer. Yes, it imparts information to start, but that\u2019s not the end. Personalities don\u2019t change in a day. They develop over the time and change our attitudes, perspectives and opinions towards others.  Fiction is the biggest example of this fact. Habitual reading is more like fleeing your own reality. It\u2019s the best escape route one can opt for. As you flip through the pages, you enter an altogether new world, leaving your mundane reality far behind. In doing so, we develop an intimate bond with the book that satisfies our social need as well. Reading brings you closer to the ordinary and acquaints you to something extraordinary. Perfect bliss is more like it. On that note, I must emphasize that people don\u2019t just get lost in a novel. Sometimes, they relate strongly with a fictional character and thus experience its emotions, thoughts and beliefs, which trigger significant changes in people\u2019s lives. Re-reading a book strengthens the change that may occur in a reader\u2019s persona. While movies make the viewers mere spectators, reading induces imagination. This imagination works wonders in shaping one\u2019s personality. It facilitates better interpersonal understanding and improved knowledge of our own self. Paragraphs and sometimes even sentences change people. And, that\u2019s true. You read a health tip, and you try incorporating it. You read an interesting novel, and you metamorphose your thoughts and feelings to glide into its fantasy world. Every time you try such things, you add a little to your personality which gets ingrained over the time. Regular reading stimulates, improves, teaches and guides. It opens all scopes of personality development. What you may not learn from your parents or teachers, sometimes books teach the same and with such finesse that it shines in your personality. Be it through facts, morals, reading strongly influences the personality of the reader. Hope it helps. Happy reading. ",
