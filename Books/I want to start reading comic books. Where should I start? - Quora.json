            "answer_text": "Don't let others tell you where to start. It's all personal opinions. What I think is best and again, personal opinion, is that you should head to your nearest comic book store and browse around until you find something that catches your eye. You can also read comics online for free. Personally, this is what I done ever since I was a kid. Then my friends and I would trade comic books like cards and read those. However, my first comic book collection came from my family members around holidays but I never bothered to read them and just collected them because I always took interest in doing for myself. That means saving money to go out and buy my own. After I read my first comic, Batman (can't remember the issue) the rest was history. That's why I'm more of a DC fan than Marvel but I am a Hulk and Dr. Strange fan. Top 5 from DC for me would be Batman, Doctor Fate, John Constantine, Booster Gold, and Shazam (even though I started with Fawcett version before DC took over) and top 5 from Marvel would be Hulk, Dr. Strange, Captain America, Spider-Man, and Ghost Rider. A little over a decade ago I also took interest in Valiant and Wildstorm comics. And if you pick up a comic, read it and want to know more about his or her origins THEN start with the original issues\u2026for example Shazam and Static weren't always DC characters\u2026some characters were acquired from defunct comics like Charlton Comics and Fawcett Comics. Both of these defunct comics\u2019 characters are all in the DC universe. ",

            "answer_text": "#1 issues are always good jumping in points. But honesty you can jump in at anytime. Most story arcs usually only span 1 or 2 comics unless it\u2019s a major crossover event. Just find your favorite character, writer, or artist then jump in. The longer you read the more you\u2019ll understand things. Most stories are self contained, you\u2019ll have references here and there to past issues but when that happens you can easily google the reference and get caught up on what\u2019s going on.   If you\u2019re not one of those physical copy hardliners, I recommend downloading the Marvel Unlimited or the DC universe app. They give you access to basically the entire library in digital format and you can start reading anything you want at a Netflix style monthly subscription fee. Collecting single issues can be an expensive hobby especially when you get into back issues. If you must have something physical then trade paperbacks are the most affordable option. Trades usually collect 6 to 8 issues of a series and begin with vol 1 for each particular run.   If you have a library card, I recommend the Hoopla app. They have an excellent library of Trade Paperbacks and it\u2019s absolutely free with a library card if your library system participates. Also, your local library can be a great resource for comics.  If you are just hell bent on knowing everything and getting completely caught up from the word go, then I recommend checking out these guides: Comic Book Reading Orders | Start Reading How To Start Reading Comics In 2019 | New Readers Guide Where to Start Reading.
