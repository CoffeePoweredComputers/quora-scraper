Don\u2019t read too many books especially guidebook (kunji) without academic depth. For example, one recent book worth reading for GS-4 (Ethics paper) is ( see the link with my answer. Which is a trustworthy book on ethics integrity and aptitude for civil services preparation?) Note making and revision: Traditional note making that I too followed due to lack of mentoring, is highly time-consuming and may result in sub-optimal performance in UPSC exam. Most aspirants before becoming revenue collector perfect the job of notes collector and fail to remember or revise what they have prepared as notes. Preparing unmanageable notes or jotting down everything in copy like a student of secondary /senior secondary/ college class may be counterproductive for UPSC exams. UPSC questions test the intelligence, reasonable academic depth, inter-linking capacity and expression structure (in written and interview) of candidates. Prepare notes or important points on margins of the book and make only two copies. In the first copy, topic wise collate and interlink all the information and ideas you have studied. The second copy should be lean one and serve as revision copy. The revision copy should contain only key ideas or keywords that will be handy before prelims and mains paper. ",
