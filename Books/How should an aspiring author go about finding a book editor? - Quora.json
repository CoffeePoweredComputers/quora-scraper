            "answer_text": "To hire an editor is writer's choice dominated by his specific genre interest ,still following tips can give a brief idea finding and choosing a book editor: 1. Make clarity of the type of editing help you need: You should have a clear idea what sort of editing you require, this makes it easier for you to ensure that the editor and you are on the same page.You might require more than one editor/edit pass on your book, in such a situation prepare a team of good editors and assign them work into segments. 2. Know your budget: It is advisable to make a decision about the amount you can spend on editing.Have clarity on the different prices editors charge for each service. Be practical. It is not like that the amount you are spending on an editor will support the proportion you're hoping to earn. Spend wisely, you can not spend more than your expected earnings. 3. Ask the editor if they will do a sample edit: Asking to edit a sample of your actual novel for you is a mandatory step before you hire an editor.Or if possible ask from more than one editor for a sample . This will help to find the right editor whose style matches with yours. However in such scenarios you can choose more than one editor for your job. 4. Examine your time limits: Approach the editor before you are quite ready.You will be surprised to know that most reputable editors book out a minimum of a month or two beforehand. If you think you will contact the editor at the last minute, be ready to pay extra money or you wouldn\u2019t get an editor of your first choice, and this can result in delay of your project by a few days or months also (in worst cases). \u00b7 5. On the same page approach: It is important not to hire an editor who makes you feel good ,hire the one who can really work on your manuscript so that your book can be the best it can be.Its critical that the author's voice as well intention is respected by an editor.Hire an editor who specializes in your genre and can coordinate with you easily. 6. It's always good to look for referrals from your writing network or friends first. 7. Take note of editor\u2019s credentials.Has that Editor worked on and own experience in books of your genre? 8. Go ahead with the editor who will not take any job thrown at him. Quality professional editors look for projects they are sure about they can make a difference in a meaningful way. You can also ask for a free sample editing from companies like bookbaby or Edioak. Above mentioned statements simply define the roles you want to be performed by your professional book editor whether it's developing ideas to describe your information or identifying missing material , all aligned to your advantage. A professional book editor provides \u2018a second set of eyes \u2018to your book and can turn it into a heavy piece of gold. Keeping all this in mind, you should go for a professional book editor, whom you can work with and you can rely upon to hold onto them as it will be beneficial for both of you as both of you will frame something that is meaningful and is always enjoyed by the readers.

            "answer_text": "If by aspiring author you mean someone who has completed an entire manuscript and revised it several times (literally 3 or 4 or more times), then my first suggestion isn't actually to find an editor. There are several things to keep in mind, and I am assuming a few of them since the question doesn't have enough specifics. I'm assuming that the writer is planning to go the traditional route to publishing (not actively pursuing self-publishing). Second, by \"finding a book editor\" I'm assuming the writer is looking for an editor at a publishing house and not a freelance editor.  So to answer the question then, I'd suggest getting the manuscript as polished as you can, meaning several drafts and rewrites. Then, I recommend that an author find a critique group. There are numerous places to find like-minded writers who can offer constructive feedback on a manuscript long before it reaches an agent or editor. With them, an author only has one shot, really, so it has to be good.  A critique group or partner will help the writer get the manuscript ready for submission, but they'll also prepare the writer for receiving criticism and many of the vital aspects of rewriting and revising.  There are steps that follow, including query letters and synopses, but the way the question was phrased leads me to believe the asker is a first-time writer who is trying to figure out the process. Trust me when I say that doing this first will decrease the learning curve exponentially and increase chances of success when it is time to find a good editor for the book. ",
