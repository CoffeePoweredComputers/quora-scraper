            "answer_text": "Very much of course! Japanese modern culture has the influence of many other cultures including Western cultures. However, the Japanese usually try to adopt a Japanicized form of any cultural influence. Buddhism in Japan is thus different, and has strong Japanese as well as Indian and Chinese influences in it. Historically, the biggest influence was from China where they imported the system of writing, and Confucian as well as Buddhist ideas. Very often, you see a mix of ideas that shows how Japanese found them useful to their society and culture. But with the coming of the Dutch and Portuguese sailors and the Western customs they brought to Japan, further changes were made. The important difference is the Japanese attempt to make the final outcome a Japanese adoption of the influence, not just copying it. ",
