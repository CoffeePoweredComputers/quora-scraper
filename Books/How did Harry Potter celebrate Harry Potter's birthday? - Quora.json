            "answer_text": "Before his first year at Hogwarts, he most likely wouldn\u2019t have really celebrated it at all. The books state that the Dursleys never gave him presents, although most of the time they at least acknowledged the day as being his birthday. His eleventh birthday was celebrated by Hagrid bringing him a cake and telling him that he\u2019s a wizard. This was his best birthday in his life thus far. His twelfth birthday was ignored by his aunt and uncle, but Dudley remembered, and mocked him for not having gotten any cards from his friends. Dobby also showed up and warned Harry not to go back to Hogwarts. We all know how that ended. His thirteenth birthday was fairly normal. He was sent presents by Hermione and Ron, and a letter from McGonagall about permission to go to Hogsmeade. On his fourteenth birthday, he received a birthday cake each from Sirius, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid. His fifteenth birthday only granted him cards and chocolates from Ron and Hermione. However, he was mad at their lack of communication and secrecy regarding the Order, so he threw them out. His sixteenth birthday was celebrated at The Burrow, the only one thus far to be celebrated anywhere other than Privet Drive. The moods of the party changes for the worse once the death of Karkaroff, the kidnapping of Florean Fortescue and the disappearance of Olivander are brought up. His seventeenth birthday is the day before Bill and Fleur\u2019s wedding, and so a small party is held at the Burrow. He got lots of presents from people including Ron, Hermione, Mr. Weasley, Bill, Fleur, Fred and George. Ginny kissed Harry because she \u2018didn\u2019t know what to get him\u2019, even though they were broken up. Rufus Scrimegeour, minister of magic, interrupted the party to dole out items of Dumbledore\u2019s will to Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Onwards from this, we\u2019re unsure how Harry celebrated him birthdays, however I\u2019d wager that they were in relative calm, surrounded by friends and family. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course with his family, I wonder if the wizarding world found any carona virus medicine or maybe spell to get rid of it. Based on carona virus if they found he might throw a party with all of his friends invited but if not then maybe with his best friend and his cute family. And I guess harmione and ginny prepared a cake to take out on 12:00 \ud83d\ude09 ",
