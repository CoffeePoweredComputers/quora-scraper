            "answer_text": "Dear junior, Thanks for A2A! I know history is feared by many tenthers because of its sheer vastness and the humongous memorisation required. But just chill out! Follow these tips and you will surely find history easier: Make up your mind as to which chapter you are going to read. Many students pick up a chapter, read one or two pages, decide that it\u2019s boring, and skip on to another one. This won\u2019t help. Once you pick up a chapter, just go through it, no matter what.Read that chapter like a story. Once you decide which chapter you are going to study, go through it as if you are reading a story. Do this thrice. Then try to summarise the sequence of events in your mind. This way you\u2019ll be able to understand and appreciate the theme of the chapter.Now read it once again thoroughly. And here, thoroughly means \u201creally thoroughly\u201d. You\u2019ll find that things have begun settling down in your mind.Make questions from each line. Framing questions like this will help you to get a feel of what can come in the examination. Try to find the answers in the textbook itself.Start memorising. After all this, memorisation will become far easier. And this would be better than simple mugging up.Now go through study-guides/other books. I personally used \u201cEvergreen Self-Study In Social Science\u201d to explore questions. Try to answer the questions on your own and then have a look at the answers. Whichever answer is more suitable (your own or the guide\u2019s), jot it down in your brain. You might be able to improve your answers this way, and this will come handy in the examination.For maps, practice is the key. Try jotting down and locating places on rough political maps. This should be done on a continuous basis. Half-an-hour a week would be ideal for this.Hope this helps! Yours Ash Kumar PS: Thanks for the the request, Shubham Raj! And thanks for upvoting too! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, History is quite a lengthy subject and at times it becomes boring to read all the historical events especially if you are least interested in it. Here are some of the tips that I personally used while studying History subject. Read the History book as a novel and consider all the chapters as stories.Once you are done with the first reading, then out your pen and read it again. This time while reading, underline or mark all the important events or pointers.Then start making notes. Remember do not make long lengthy notes, make short ones. Make flow charts for important events or create some short tricks to recognise the battles and so on.Also, first, read NCERT book only.Hope it will help. Thanks!! ",
