            "answer_text": "Active Study vs. Passive StudyBe actively involved in managing the learning process, the mathematics and your study time: Take responsibility for studying, recognizing what you do and don't know, and knowing how to get your Instructor to help you with what you don't know.Attend class every day and take complete notes. Instructors formulate test questions based on material and examples covered in class as well as on those in the text.Be an active participant in the classroom. Get ahead in the book; try to work some of the problems before they are covered in class. Anticipate what the Instructor's next step will be.Ask questions in class! There are usually other students wanting to know the answers to the same questions you have.Go to office hours and ask questions. The Instructor will be pleased to see that you are interested, and you will be actively helping yourself.Good study habits throughout the semester make it easier to study for tests. http://...Studying Math is Different from Studying Other Subjects Math is learned by doing problems. Do the homework. The problems help you learn the formulas and techniques you do need to know, as well as improve your problem-solving prowess.A word of warning: Each class builds on the previous ones, all semester long. You must keep up with the Instructor: attend class, read the text and do homework every day. Falling a day behind puts you at a disadvantage. Falling a week behind puts you in deep trouble.A word of encouragement: Each class builds on the previous ones, all semester long. You're always reviewing previous material as you do new material. Many of the ideas hang together. Identifying and learning the key concepts means you don't have to memorize as much. http://...College Math is Different from High School MathA College math class meets less often and covers material at about twice the pace that a High School course does. You are expected to absorb new material much more quickly. Tests are probably spaced farther apart and so cover more material than before. The Instructor may not even check your homework. Take responsibility for keeping up with the homework. Make sure you find out how to do it.You probably need to spend more time studying per week - you do more of the learning outside of class than in High School.Tests may seem harder just because they cover more material. http://...Study TimeYou may know a rule of thumb about math (and other) classes: at least 2 hours of study time per class hour. But this may not be enough! Take as much time as you need to do all the homework and to get complete understanding of the material.Form a study group. Meet once or twice a week (also use the phone). Go over problems you've had trouble with. Either someone else in the group will help you, or you will discover you're all stuck on the same problems. Then it's time to get help from your Instructor.The more challenging the material, the more time you should spend on it.http://...Problem Solvinghttp://...Problem Solving (Homework and Tests) The higher the math class, the more types of problems: in earlier classes, problems often required just one step to find a solution. Increasingly, you will tackle problems which require several steps to solve them. Break these problems down into smaller pieces and solve each piece - divide and conquer!Problem types:Problems testing memorization (\"drill\"),Problems testing skills (\"drill\"),Problems requiring application of skills to familiar situations (\"template\" problems),Problems requiring application of skills to unfamiliar situations (you develop a strategy for a new problem type),Problems requiring that you extend the skills or theory you know before applying them to an unfamiliar situation.In early courses, you solved problems of types 1, 2 and 3. By College Algebra you expect to do mostly problems of types 2 and 3 and sometimes of type 4. Later courses expect you to tackle more and more problems of types 3 and 4, and (eventually) of type 5. Each problem of types 4 or 5 usually requires you to use a multi-step approach, and may involve several different math skills and techniques.When you work problems on homework, write out complete solutions, as if you were taking a test. Don't just scratch out a few lines and check the answer in the back of the book. If your answer is not right, rework the problem; don't just do some mental gymnastics to convince yourself that you could get the correct answer. If you can't get the answer, get help.The practice you get doing homework and reviewing will make test problems easier to tackle. http://...Tips on Problem Solving Apply P\u00f3lya's four-step process:The first and most important step in solving a problem is to understand the problem, that is, identify exactly which quantity the problem is asking you to find or solve for (make sure you read the whole problem).Next you need to devise a plan, that is, identify which skills and techniques you have learned can be applied to solve the problem at hand.Carry out the plan.Look back: Does the answer you found seem reasonable? Also review the problem and method of solution so that you will be able to more easily recognize and solve a similar problem.Some problem-solving strategies: use one or more variables, complete a table, consider a special case, look for a pattern, guess and test, draw a picture or diagram, make a list, solve a simpler related problem, use reasoning, work backward, solve an equation, look for a formula, use coordinates. http://...\"Word\" Problems are Really \"Applied\" ProblemsThe term \"word problem\" has only negative connotations. It's better to think of them as \"applied problems\". These problems should be the most interesting ones to solve. Sometimes the \"applied\" problems don't appear very realistic, but that's usually because the corresponding real applied problems are too hard or complicated to solve at your current level. But at least you get an idea of how the math you are learning can help solve actual real-world problems. http://...Solving an Applied Problem First convert the problem into mathematics. This step is (usually) the most challenging part of an applied problem. If possible, start by drawing a picture. Label it with all the quantities mentioned in the problem. If a quantity in the problem is not a fixed number, name it by a variable. Identify the goal of the problem. Then complete the conversion of the problem into math, i.e., find equations which describe relationships among the variables, and describe the goal of the problem mathematically.Solve the math problem you have generated, using whatever skills and techniques you need (refer to the four-step process above).As a final step, you should convert the answer of your math problem back into words, so that you have now solved the original applied problem.For Further Reading:George P\u00f3lya, How to Solve It,Princeton University Press, Princeton (1945)http://...Studying for a Math Testhttp://...Everyday Study is a Big Part of Test PreparationGood study habits throughout the semester make it easier to study for tests. Do the homework when it is assigned. You cannot hope to cram 3 or 4 weeks worth of learning into a couple of days of study.On tests you have to solve problems; homework problems are the only way to get practice. As you do homework, make lists of formulas and techniques to use later when you study for tests.Ask your Instructor questions as they arise; don't wait until the day or two before a test. The questions you ask right before a test should be to clear up minor details. http://...Studying for a TestStart by going over each section, reviewing your notes and checking that you can still do the homework problems (actually work the problems again). Use the worked examples in the text and notes - cover up the solutions and work the problems yourself. Check your work against the solutions given. You're not ready yet! In the book each problem appears at the end of the section in which you learned how do to that problem; on a test the problems from different sections are all together. Step back and ask yourself what kind of problems you have learned how to solve, what techniques of solution you have learned, and how to tell which techniques go with which problems.Try to explain out loud, in your own words, how each solution strategy is used (e.g. how to solve a quadratic equation). If you get confused during a test, you can mentally return to your verbal \"capsule instructions\". Check your verbal explanations with a friend during a study session (it's more fun than talking to yourself!).Put yourself in a test-like situation: work problems from review sections at the end of chapters, and work old tests if you can find some. It's important to keep working problems the whole time you're studying.Also: Start studying early. Several days to a week before the test (longer for the final), begin to allot time in your schedule to reviewing for the test.Get lots of sleep the night before the test. Math tests are easier when you are mentally sharp.http://...Taking a Math Testhttp://...Test-Taking Strategy MattersJust as it is important to think about how you spend your study time (in addition to actually doing the studying), it is important to think about what strategies you will use when you take a test (in addition to actually doing the problems on the test). Good test-taking strategy can make a big difference to your grade! http://...Taking a Test First look over the entire test. You'll get a sense of its length. Try to identify those problems you definitely know how to do right away, and those you expect to have to think about.Do the problems in the order that suits you! Start with the problems that you know for sure you can do. This builds confidence and means you don't miss any sure points just because you run out of time. Then try the problems you think you can figure out; then finally try the ones you are least sure about.Time is of the essence - work as quickly and continuously as you can while still writing legibly and showing all your work. If you get stuck on a problem, move on to another one - you can come back later.Work by the clock. On a 50 minute, 100 point test, you have about 5 minutes for a 10 point question. Starting with the easy questions will probably put you ahead of the clock. When you work on a harder problem, spend the allotted time (e.g., 5 minutes) on that question, and if you have not almost finished it, go on to another problem. Do not spend 20 minutes on a problem which will yield few or no points when there are other problems still to try.Show all your work: make it as easy as possible for the Instructor to see how much you do know. Try to write a well-reasoned solution. If your answer is incorrect, the Instructor will assign partial credit based on the work you show.Never waste time erasing! Just draw a line through the work you want ignored and move on. Not only does erasing waste precious time, but you may discover later that you erased something useful (and/or maybe worth partial credit if you cannot complete the problem). You are (usually) not required to fit your answer in the space provided - you can put your answer on another sheet to avoid needing to erase.In a multiple-step problem outline the steps before actually working the problem.Don't give up on a several-part problem just because you can't do the first part. Attempt the other part(s) - if the actual solution depends on the first part, at least explain how you would do it.Make sure you read the questions carefully, and do all parts of each problem.Verify your answers - does each answer make sense given the context of the problem?If you finish early, check every problem (that means rework everything from scratch).http://...Getting Assistancehttp://...WhenGet help as soon as you need it. Don't wait until a test is near. The new material builds on the previous sections, so anything you don't understand now will make future material difficult to understand. http://...Use the Resources You Have Available Ask questions in class. You get help and stay actively involved in the class.Visit the Instructor's Office Hours. Instructors like to see students who want to help themselves.Ask friends, members of your study group, or anyone else who can help. The classmate who explains something to you learns just as much as you do, for he/she must think carefully about how to explain the particular concept or solution in a clear way. So don't be reluctant to ask a classmate.Go to the Math Help Sessions or other tutoring sessions on campus.Find a private tutor if you can't get enough help from other sources.All students need help at some point, so be sure to get the help you need. http://...Asking QuestionsDon't be afraid to ask questions. Any question is better than no question at all (at least your Instructor/tutor will know you are confused). But a good question will allow your helper to quickly identify exactly what you don't understand. Not too helpful comment: \"I don't understand this section.\" The best you can expect in reply to such a remark is a brief review of the section, and this will likely overlook the particular thing(s) which you don't understand.Good comment: \"I don't understand why f(x + h) doesn't equal f(x) + f(h).\" This is a very specific remark that will get a very specific response and hopefully clear up your difficulty.Good question: \"How can you tell the difference between the equation of a circle and the equation of a line?\"Okay question: \"How do you do #17?\"Better question: \"Can you show me how to set up #17?\" (the Instructor can let you try to finish the problem on your own), or \"This is how I tried to do #17. What went wrong?\" The focus of attention is onyour thought process.Right after you get help with a problem, work another similar problem by yourself. http://...You Control the Help You GetHelpers should be coaches, not crutches. They should encourage you, give you hints as you need them, and sometimes show you how to do problems. But they should not, nor be expected to, actually do the work you need to do. They are there to help you figure out how to learn math for yourself. When you go to office hours, your study group or a tutor, have a specific list of questions prepared in advance. You should run the session as much as possible.Do not allow yourself to become dependent on a tutor. The tutor cannot take the exams for you. You must take care to be the one in control of tutoring sessions.You must recognize that sometimes you do need some coaching to help you through, and it is up to you to seek out that coaching.",

            "answer_text": "1) If you don't understand something, focus on mastering that topic before moving on to the next topic~It sounds simple, but it is absolutely essential. Lets say a student is learning Algebra, for example. Further, lets say he or she is having a hard time understanding how to add and subtract negative and positive numbers. All of us struggle with this in the beginning as it is a sticky point for most students. Some students in this situation, out of frustration that they \"can't\" learn this topic, will move on to the next lesson in the hope that they will be able to understand that one.This is a recipe for disaster.Math is very much like learning to read. If you don't know your letter sounds then you have no hope of being able to sound out words of course there is no way possible that you could read a book. All math courses are taught in a specific sequence because the every topic builds on the previous topic. If you are having a problem with a topic, continue working with that one until you understand it and can work problems successfully. Watch the DVD section over again, attend tutoring, read the book and examples a second time, or even get a totally different book to have it explained a different way...but whatever you do not turn the page and tackle the next topic. If you do, you will get even more frustrated and you in all likelihood will begin to give up hope.2)Work example problems and check your answers to gain practice with every lesson~The entire premise of the DVD series is to \"learn by example\" and it is quite simply the easiest way to learn Math. After watching the section on the DVD and reading the section in your textbook, begin working examples from the end of the chapter. Make sure to work the problems that have answers in the back of the book, and check every one. Always begin with the easiest problem in your book, even if you think it will be too \"easy\" to solve. It is very very important to build your confidence. This is why the DVD lessons begin with easier problems that no one will have any issue understanding. Gradually work harder and harder problems from your book and check your answer for each one. After working a dozen or more problems from the section (two dozen is best), you are ready to move on to the next section. Many students want to plow though a lesson just to make it to the next one. You cannot just read a section in a Math book and become an expert on that section. You must work problems. If you can't work problems then you are not ready to move on. The good news is that working problems will build your confidence, and confidence is 100% the name of the game in Math.3)When beginning to work a Math problem, do not \"map out a path from problem-to-answer\" in your head before writing anything down~I see this almost every day. It is very common when someone looks at a Math problem that they try to \"figure it out\" in their head before writing anything down. Take Algebra for example. When a beginning student looks at an equation, he or she will be tempted to solve the equation in their head and not write anything down. Students are tempted to do this most often with Word Problems. Since a word problem is written in sentence form, it is common to think that you can \"think your way to the answer\". I will tell you that I never, ever, solve any sort of math problem without writing it down. Ever.What you need to do is begin by first writing down the problem. Then you begin to solve it one step at a time. Write down even the simple things. What you need to ensure is that every single step that you write down is perfectly legal. In other words, if you are solving an equation for example and you subtract \"10\" from both sides....write that down. Then in the NEXT step actually do that subtraction. Then if you need to divide both sides by \"2\" write THAT down...then in the NEXT step actually do the division. This gives you a paper trail to check your work and also it allows you to break the problem down in to bite sized chunks. If you can be sure that every single little step is legal, then you will be in good shape. If you try to do too many things at one time, which is common, you will probably try to do something illegal and get into trouble.4)When you study and do homework, try to find a quiet place to do it~I was the worst offender of this while in school. I used to listen to music all of the time while trying to do homework. I'd also listen to the TV as 'background noise\" while studying. Over time I realized that if I had a quiet place without the background noise, I could focus much better. What I found is that when reading, for example...I would have to read something perhaps 3 or 4 times if I was listening to something else but only once if I had some quiet. People love to listen to music while studying, but I am convinced that it is much more effective if you don't. Try to find a quiet spot in your home or in the Library to get your schoolwork done and you will get your work done much more quickly because you'll be able to focus and absorb more.5)If someone asks you for help, try to explain the topic to them as best you can~This one is going to seem a little odd for this list...but there is one universal truth. Those who can teach others have a true grasp of the material. Many times when studying in groups there will be one member of the group who is behind and doesn't \"get it\". Try to help that person, even if your own work will take longer. Not only will you feel like you are helping someone else succeed, but the process of rephrasing information back to someone else and breaking things down into bite sized chunks will increase your own understanding. It will help you understand at a fundamental level what the stumbling blocks are for the topic, which will help you as you move on in your math studies.6)Never, ever work math problems in pen~This one is pretty simple. You will make a mistake; it is only a matter of time. When you do, you will want to completely erase your mistake and write over it. You will never, ever want to scratch something out and write next to the scratch-out. This will lead to a paper that is hard to read, and the scratch-outs will actually increase your anxiety about solving these problems. You want clean-neat paper with a clean well thought-out solution.7)Try to use a mechanical pencil with separate eraser, if you can~This one is pretty simple. You will make a mistake; it is only a matter of time. When you do, you will want to completely erase your mistake and write over it. You will never, ever want to scratch something out and write next to the scratch-out. This will lead to a paper that is hard to read, and the scratch-outs will actually increase your anxiety about solving these problems. You want clean-neat paper with a clean well thought-out solution. Thanks A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "REVISED Oct 2015, after notification of article merger  A moment\u2019s searching shows there are already numerous \"curriculum\" style replies to this question on Quora. Posting one more doesn\u2019t seem to add value, so my answer is intended to focus specifically on the \u201cHow\u201d, about which I\u2019ve thought long and hard. IMO: How one can learning maths depends on many things: - How far do you want to go? - enough to attain another goal, or as far as you brain will take you?  Ask yourself why you want to learn math - for pleasure, for university-level pure math, for application in a related subject like economics or engineering, to impress someone,...? (Your approach depends on this) - Ask yourself how you think when trying to learn maths: mainly in images, in purely abstract/symbolic terms (both encouraging signs) or mainly in words (less-good sign - See Jacques Hadamard's book from the 1930s \"On the psychology of invention in the mathematical field\")?  Or like Einstein, who also \"thought with his muscles\" (See my New Scientist lettert on this, if you can find it - It's on ResearchGate too) - What time of day are you best able to concentrate on math. For me, it's 5am, when I can't sleep - Don't just \"read\" math - do it and think about it A LOT, so do examples till you've worn your pencil to a nub, and think about the topics from many angles, especially how one thing can viewed as another, e.g. how a function can be considered as a vector... - When you're stuck, there are many things you can do (this could be the topic for whole new Question, if someone's willing to ask it), --- try easily accessible alternatives such as Wikipedia,** different textbooks, and math-oriented chat-rooms like Stack Exchange (** See further below)--- Do you know anyone who might help you if/when you get so stuck that you're scratching your head till there's brain matter under your fingernails?  - Do you have access to a library (or funds to purchase books) on the topics you're interested in? - Think about what you're studying/obsessing about when you're  not actively engaged in life's essentials: queuing, or trying to get to sleep, or otherwise.--- In particular, as maths educator Arnold Ross used to say                        \"Think deeply on simple things\" - As most people will recommend: Work progressively, starting with the basics - though it may be inspirational to jump ahead to more ambitious material, try to make sure you feel you understand most of what you're studying before moving ahead - And most of all, enjoy the \"click\" of understanding - it's almost as good as the other most pleasurable thing in life...  Finally, to add my ha'porth* on the \"curriculum aspect\": If you want a good elementary starting point, try \"What Is Mathematics?: An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods\" by the late Richard Courant (Author), Herbert Robbins (Author), Ian Stewart (Contributor)\" (I've already recommended this on another Quora post). Good luck! * \"half-penny-worth\" for non-UK readers (i.e. very little) EARLY UPDATE MOVED, OCT 2015, to below original answer.  Relevant bio:I\u2019m not a natural or gifted mathematician \u2013 just fascinated by math with a desire to achieve some understanding of mind-bending ideas. I sense that a large proportion of Quora posters are more like me than they are like the PhD mathematicians on Quora.  I started as a PhD chemist, and now, years later, trying to understand betterspinors and Clifford algebras. So I\u2019ve had to struggle (and still do), and as a result I\u2019ve learned some things about \u201cHow I learn maths\u201d (plural! I\u2019m from the UK). ** And while I\u2019m on the topic, one closely-related bugbear of mine is that while the WWW enables such fabulous sources for maths and physics as Wikipedia to be, potentially, enormously helpful to the aspiring student (so much better than pre-WWW, when often the only alternative if stuck was to throw the book at the wall), there is a tendency for the posts there to be written by those who are reasonably expert, but who write less to inform those who wish to learn, and rather more to show those who know the subject already how cleverly and succinctly the author can demonstrate their own expertise. Though some entries are improving, many tend to be a lot less helpful than they might be. My \u2018solution\u2019 to this problem is therefore to look for additional sources on a topic, and try to piece together what I\u2019m seeking to understand by working between the sources. ",

            "answer_text": "Socrates was asked about wisdom. Most expected an answer long and sour, but Socrates kept it short and sweet: \u201cThe beginning of wisdom is a DEFINITION of terms.\u201d   I. The DNA of MATHEMATICS  One day Bertrand Russell\u2019s elder brother (Frank) attempted to teach him geometry. Of course, before Frank could even dust off Euclid\u2019s Elements, his precocious little brother had already ignited a protest. \u201cI refuse to accept the axioms!\u201d Russell protested. Frank shook his head in disbelief. \u201cBerty, unless you accept the Euclidean axioms, such as \u2018all right-angles are equal to one another,\u2019 why, I\u2019m afraid will never be able to get on with the matter!\u201d Eventually the headstrong youth loosened the cranial vise-grip, thereby allowing them to get on with the matter. Aha! You see:  The \u201cmost obvious thing\u201d is the axiom, which must be assumed true in order to get on with it. And in the process of getting on with it, which always comes about \u201cin the least obvious way,\u201d a proof is born! In other words, as Einstein noted, axioms are nothing but \u201cimplicit definitions.\u201d And so, the sole function of a proof lies merely in rendering explicit what initially lay implicit. Bingo! To put it simply: every mathematical proof is akin to unpacking an axiomatic suitcase.  For the above reason, the intellectual secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles, best stated the key to learning mathematics as follows:  This \u201cFormal Apostles\u2019 Creed,\u201d so to speak, as championed by the likes of Wittgenstein, sheds light on one of history\u2019s most overlooked \u201cTrinities.\u201d Given that axioms serve as the very DNA of proof, and it lies with the philosopher, ultimately, to clarify such axiomatic assumptions, it\u2019s apparent the key to learning mathematics consists of getting a firm handle on each aspect of the formal triad. \u201cTo understand a science,\u201d noted Camus, \u201cit is necessary to know its history.\u201d For the above reasons:   II. The LOGIC of LOGIC and the MATHEMATICS of MATHEMATICS  Frank stressed the point to his younger brother that learning mathematics consists solely of grasping the nature of getting on with it. Indeed, the measure of mathematical rigour lies in the extent to which the rigor mortis has set in on an impending logical skeletal structure. Any unwarranted assumptions in the course of the meticulous step-by-step construction comes at a hefty price. Even Euclid\u2019s Elements\u2014once thought infallible\u2014fell pray to lack of rigour. And here lies the key to learning mathematics. After all, in mathematics there is only one \u201csin\u201d . . . and that sin is named:  From getting a firm handle on notation down to clearly grasping the axioms at play, the aim is to render a chain of reasoning that\u2019s airtight. In short, think of the axiom as the fertilized egg . . . logic as the process of gestation . . . and the mathematical proof as the entirety of the process\u2014from conception to the birthed theorem that screams: \u201cQ.E.D.\u201d  For the above reason, given the chief function of mathematics (correspondence exhibited between identities), Bertrand Russell rightfully concluded:  The result? For anyone who aspires to learn mathematics it\u2019s vital to have a precise meaning of the axioms and the resultant propositions. After all, every proof\u2014if properly formulated\u2014lends its steps to be retraced back to the self-evident axioms. And given that logic merely employs the transformation rule\u2014to render explicitly evident what lay implicit in the axioms\u2014to allow any vagueness or ambiguity to creep into one\u2019s chain of reasoning is to invite inconsistency. In short, treat the notion of equality relation (A = B), which is the very heart of mathematics, as though you were a blind man using identity for a walking stick.  You can only get off track if you fail to deduce precisely from your axioms. Just unpack the axiom\u2014step-by-step. \u2026  III. In CLOSING  I suppose there\u2019s a reason calculators and painstaking note-taking are synonymous with mathematics. Indeed, where mathematics most notably differs from other disciplines is she requires all her courters to pursue her with patience. After all:  Sure, chess and checkers are played on the same game board, as does mathematics equally partake of the tree of knowledge with all other branches. Chess, however, differs markedly from checkers on the account that its mastery hides in the details. Whereas the checkers player is prone to win the game in one fell swoop and most non-mathematical disciplines paint with the broadest of strokes, the eleventh commandment of mathematics and chess alike is simple: Thou shalt not take anything for granted!  To truly learn mathematics entails never straying from what the axiomatic definitions implicate. After all, what more is a function than the account of how one varying quantity derives from another quantity? x \u21a6 f\u2009(x) What more is a fraction (Latin: fractus, \"broken\") than the breaking of the whole into equal parts, which initially lay implicit in the original whole? What more is a a ratio than the expressed relationship between two numbers, namely, the indication of how many times the second number lies implicit in the first? Remember, the very DNA of proof\u2014those all-important axioms\u2014is noting but implicit definitions. Starting to notice a theme here? In ancient times those initiated into the mysteries were well-versed in the sacred symbol of mathematics:  After all, just as The Ouroboros is the serpent that eats its own tail, The Proof is the axiom that eats its own theorem! Mathematics is only the art of saying the same thing with different words! For the above reason, when the vaunted Socratic method is finally turned inwardly upon mathematics, what exactly does the ancient Greek roots reveal? M\u00e1th\u0113ma\u2014 \"what one gets to know.\" Bingo! To learn mathematics is merely an exercise in uncovering \u201cwhat one gets to know.\u201d And just as the father seated in the waiting room while his wife endures labor . . . labor derived from the fertilized axiomatic egg + logical gestation = newborn theorem . . . the proud father for the first time locks eyes on what one gets to know.  The beginning of wisdom is a definition of terms!    DOG fo DNIM ehT ",

            "answer_text": "I was exactly like this about 2 years ago.  Then I began studying in a new way. Instead of solving the equations given to me each week and going to class I read through my course literature more carefully. Spending time reading up on the math helped a lot. I tried to draw figures of how things looked. I tried to imagine what would happen if things weren't defined the way they were. I tried to learn what everything represented and the history to why it was represented that way. And most importantly, when I read a proof and they skipped a step in their calculations I did them myself and wrote them in the margin. Every other insight I had I wrote down as well (and drew figures). I made the literature \"complete\" for my own understanding. And I did it so that if I forgot a week later I could go back and re-check it and memorize it even better. By doing this I understood math way better and my grades improved. When it comes to math you must spend time with why you do each step. And you must also learn that math is a language that we invented to save time. Just as I gave an explanation quite similar to that in  Physics: Is mathematics really necessary for understanding the nature which is tinier and at the same time more massive than I can imagine?  But when you've seen enough math you start to see the beauty in it. That it is an art. Right now though, you need to see the system they (the mathematicians) invented to save time when describing our world. When you've come to this realisation, and really understand the system, then the math will not be as difficult. So take your time with it. And if you really don't grasp certain concepts, check out youtube videos, or google it, or ask us Quora users. We'll help you.  EDIT: I would also like to add that there's a psychological bonus to this. By writing down things we are supposed to remember we feel less pressure to remember it and will relax more. That has the effect that our brain will remember it better. So writing notes for you to remember will actually make your brain relax so much better that you don't need the note and can almost throw it away. Weird right? Yes, but a great trick to use. ",

            "answer_text": "A suggestion always try to go to the concept level of any problem.An interesting concept is  everything in math is mostly just addition (+).Here it is how. I you want to subtract 5 from 8. i.e. 8-5=? what you are actually doing is adding 8 to -5(-ve number)           i.e. 8+(-5) = 8 (+)x(-) 5 = 8-5 (since +ve multiplied by -ve is -ve) so 8 - 5 = 3.                                   (similarly, \"+ x + = +\"; \"+ x - = -\"; \"- x - = +\")   Same way in case of multiplication 8 x 5 = Adding 8 to 0(zero) 5 times       = 0+ (8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8). (.i.e. 8 five times) which gives you 40.     Therefore = 8 x 5 = 40.   Division is actually find out how many times we have to add a number to get the answer.     (.i.e) 6/2 = ? Now if we add 3 two times we get 6. So the answer is 3.                 6/2=3....   Everything in mathematics is derived from this. but decimal are a bit more complicated but the concept is still the above. It might sometimes sound different but it is actually easy when you understand it.    Similarly you form a sequence like this in everything you come across you can learn and understand anything in maths. Try to get books from school or college going students and get the contents of the book copied then search in google you will a large number of pages to help you out... Just try to have a sequence of flow it is the best way to make sense of what you learn and understand. Hope I helped. ",

            "answer_text": "This question can be answered in very different ways depending where you are in your fun journey of mathematics.However I will point you to the obvious approaches you could take. If you are still in college or even in high school,you learn mathematics by exposing yourself to more mathematics. You must however be mindful of two things in this stage,the first is if you are stuck between widening your knowledge of mathematics or going deeper in a specific subject,choose going deeper, or to rephrase my statement,for every class that widens your knowledge or exposes you to other areas of mathematics,choose two classes that goes deeper into the previous material. A good example would be if you completed the equivalent of calculus in U.S universities and wish to decide between taking an analysis course and an introduction to linear algebra course choose the analysis course. The reason I\u2019m advocating this approach is once you have a firm understanding of one area of mathematics,the other area can be tackled easier than if you had a basic understanding. Also if you are stuck between heavy computational/Mechanical courses that rely on computing an answer and courses that rely on proofs,choose proof heavy courses as those courses are what makes us different from computers and being able to do proofs and coming up with new proofs is much more important than doing derivatives or integrals and such. If you have taken at least 6\u20138 courses of math in college ,chances are you know which area of mathematics you are interested in,unfortunately beyond this level you have to start researching into the areas you are interested as well as taking heavier courses to really start learning.The problem in this approach is doing these \u201cresearches \u201c is very hard and tiring if you are not affiliated with a university or a research institute ,so start thinking about getting into one if you are not there yet. Most important of all,mathematics is a very fun and fulfilling journey. Best of Luck Ali ",

            "answer_text": "There is no \"one right way\" to do most math problems.  Draw a picture to represent the situation in a word problem (whenever appropriate).  If I'm helping you with math, I can see by your picture whether you understand the concept and did the arithmetic wrong, or whether you have a different idea than I do of what the problem is about. Try to understand the reason for doing things, not just memorize a bunch of formulas or a series of steps (you will have to do some of both). If one way of doing the problems isn't working, try talking to another teacher, going to Khan Academy or a different textbook, etc.  Sometimes one method will you just make more sense to you than another, and as long as you consistently get correct answers in a reasonable amount of time, the method is \"right\".  Some methods work for a greater range of problems than others; I like these better because I don't have to remember as many different things. Look for strategies to keep the number of digits small (reducing fractions, cross-cancelling, etc.), as this will help reduce arithmetic errors. Model the situation with \"easier\" numbers.  If I want to check whether something like combinations and permutations is being done correctly (a topic I don't remember too well), I can do an example with 2 or 3 things, and list all the combinations/permutations.  If I get the same answer I get with the formula, I'm probably using the correct formula.  I can check percent problems with 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%. \"Ballpark\" your answers with \"easier\" numbers.  If I use the percents above, 3 as an approximation for pi, etc. I can do many simple problems on paper or mentally.  Then when I actually have 48% (instead of 50) or 3.14159 as a value for pi, I know about where my answer should be.  If it's off by a factor of 10 or 100, I may have misplaced a decimal.  If the percent is way off, maybe I've confused multiplication and division. ",

            "answer_text": "They are many ways to learn mathematics if you are really interested in the subject.One way would be to hire a teacher or tutor.Another would be to go to a site such as YouTube , type the words 'learn mathematics ' in the search box , and choose the appropriate videos that teach math. Or just type 'learn mathematics ' , or something like 'how to self learn mathematics' in Google. You will find many online resources , tips and (free) courses for learning math. A site such as Math is Fun (for example) could be useful and fun .Or course materials at the MIT opencourseware can be interesting and profitable . Concerning the use of books or ebooks , a series of affordable books I used and found helpful is the Schaum series. Each book has chapters with course material and many solved problems and practice exercises with answers . You can set and organize a learning schedule for yourself and start working step by step with the easiest books for beginners , then move on to the books for intermediate learners , then to the more advanced books in the series. It might take time , dedication and lots of problem solving , but it would be worth it. Relevant Schaum's outlines books to choose from would include: Schaum's Outline of Basic Mathematics with Applications to Science and Technology, 2ed, by Haym Kruglak, John Moore, Ramon Mata-Toledo. Schaum's Outline of Elementary Algebra, 3ed: Barnett Rich, Philip Schmidt. Schaum's Outline of Intermediate Algebra, Second Edition: Ray Steege, Kerry Bailey. Schaum's Outline of College Algebra, 4th Edition: Murray Spiegel, Robert Moyer. Schaum's Outline of Beginning Calculus, Third Edition: Elliott Mendelson. Schaum's Outline of Precalculus, 3rd Edition: Fred Safier. Schaum's Outline of Calculus, 6th Edition:Frank Ayres, Elliott Mendelson Schaum's Outline of Geometry, 5th Edition:Christopher Thomas, Barnett Rich. Schaum's Outline of Trigonometry, 5th Edition:Robert Moyer, Frank Ayres. Schaum's Outline of Beginning Linear Algebra: Seymour Lipschutz. Schaum's Outline of Linear Algebra, 5th Edition: Seymour Lipschutz, Marc Lipson. Schaum's Outline of Beginning Statistics, Second Edition: Larry Stephens. Schaum's Outline of Introduction to Probability and Statistics: Seymour Lipschutz, John J. Schiller. Sometimes a combination of the above could be used: using an affordable tutor for a few specific lessons , working out the books or ebooks , learning from some YouTube videos , finding some helpful answers or courses online... The important thing is to set your mind to it , be organized , patient and methodical , never give up and go for it. ",

            "answer_text": "You don't need to be a math educator to realize that a ton of understudies\u2014and likely a great deal of guardians (it's been for a little while!)\u2014 are threatened by math issues, particularly on the off chance that they include substantial numbers. Learning systems on the most proficient method to do math rapidly can enable understudies to create more noteworthy trust in math and exceed expectations in cutting edge courses. In the event that you must instruct those, here's an awesome refresher. 10 tricks for doing quick math Here are 10 quick math techniques understudies (and grown-ups!) can use to do math in their heads. Once these procedures are aced, understudies ought to have the capacity to precisely and unhesitatingly take care of math issues that they once dreaded unraveling. 1. Including expansive numbers Including vast numbers just in your mind can be troublesome. This strategy demonstrates to streamline this procedure by making every one of the numbers a different of 10. Here is an illustration: 644 + 238 While these numbers are difficult to fight with, gathering them together will make them more reasonable. In this way, 644 ends up noticeably 650 and 238 winds up noticeably 240. Presently, gather 650 and 240 into a single unit. The aggregate is 890. To discover the response to the first condition, it must be resolved the amount we added to the numbers to round them up. 650 \u2013 644 = 6 and 240 \u2013 238 = 2 Presently, gather 6 and 2 into a single unit for an aggregate of 8 To discover the response to the first condition, 8 must be subtracted from the 890. 890 \u2013 8 = 882 So the response to 644 +238 is 882. 2. Subtracting from 1,000 Here's a fundamental run to subtract a huge number from 1,000: Subtract each number with the exception of the last from 9 and subtract the last number from 10 For instance: 1,000 \u2013 556 Stage 1: Subtract 5 from 9 = 4 Stage 2: Subtract 5 from 9 = 4 Stage 3: Subtract 6 from 10 = 4 The appropriate response is 444. 3. Increasing 5 times any number While increasing the number 5 by a much number, there is a snappy approach to discover the appropriate response. For instance, 5 x 4 = Stage 1: Take the number being increased by 5 and cut it down the middle, this influences the number 4 to end up plainly the number 2. Stage 2: Add a zero to the number to discover the appropriate response. For this situation, the appropriate response is 20. 5 x 4 = 20 While increasing an odd number circumstances 5, the equation is somewhat unique. For example, consider 5 x 3. Stage 1: Subtract one from the number being duplicated by 5, in this occasion the number 3 turns into the number 2. Stage 2: Now divide the number 2, which makes it the number 1. Make 5 the last digit. The number created is 15, which is the appropriate response. 5 x 3 = 15 4. Division traps Here's a speedy approach to know when a number can be uniformly partitioned by these specific numbers: 10 if the number closures in 0 9 when the digits are included and the aggregate is equitably separable by 9 8 if the last three digits are equally separable by 8 or are 000 6 in the event that it is a considerably number and when the digits are included the appropriate response is equally distinct by 3 5 on the off chance that it closes in a 0 or 5 4 on the off chance that it closes in 00 or a two digit number that is equitably separable by 4 3 when the digits are included and the outcome is equitably separable by the number 3 2 on the off chance that it closes in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 5. Duplicating by 9 This is a simple technique that is useful for duplicating any number by 9. Here is the manner by which it works: We should utilize the case of 9 x 3. Stage 1: Subtract 1 from the number that is being increased by 9. 3 \u2013 1 = 2 The number 2 is the primary number in the response to the condition. Stage 2: Subtract that number from the number 9. 9 \u2013 2 = 7 The number 7 is the second number in the response to the condition. Along these lines, 9 x 3 = 27 6. 10 and 11 times traps The secret to increasing any number by 10 is to add a zero to the finish of the number. For instance, 62 x 10 = 620. There is likewise a simple trap for increasing any two-digit number by 11. Here it is: 11 x 25 Take the first two-digit number and put a space between the digits. In this illustration, that number is 25. 2_5 Presently include those two numbers together and put the outcome in the inside: 2_(2 + 5)_5 2_7_5 The response to 11 x 25 is 275. On the off chance that the numbers in the inside mean a number with two digits, embed the second number and add 1 to the first. Here is a case for the condition 11 x 88 8_(8 +8)_8 (8 + 1)_6_8 9_6_8 There is the response to 11 x 88: 968 7. Rate Finding a level of a number can be to some degree dubious, however considering it in the correct terms makes it substantially less demanding to get it. For example, to discover what 5% of 235 is, take after this strategy: Stage 1: Move the decimal point over by one place, 235 ends up noticeably 23.5. Stage 2: Divide 23.5 by the number 2, the appropriate response is 11.75. That is likewise the response to the first condition. 8. Rapidly square a two-digit number that closures in 5 How about we utilize the number 35 for instance. Stage 1: Multiply the main digit without anyone else in addition to 1. Stage 2: Put a 25 toward the end. 35 squared = [3 x (3 + 1)] and 25 [3 x (3 + 1)] = 12 12 and 25 = 1225 35 squared = 1225 9. Extreme duplication While increasing expansive numbers, on the off chance that one of the numbers is even, partition the principal number down the middle, and after that twofold the second number. This strategy will tackle the issue rapidly. For example, consider 20 x 120 Stage 1: Divide the 20 by 2, which squares with 10. Twofold 120, which parallels 240. At that point duplicate your two answers together. 10 x 240 = 2400 The response to 20 x 120 is 2,400. 10. Duplicating numbers that end in zero Duplicating numbers that end in zero is very straightforward. It includes duplicating alternate numbers together and after that including the zeros toward the end. For example, consider: 200 x 400 Stage 1: Multiply the 2 times the 4 2 x 4 = 8 Stage 2: Put each of the four of the zeros after the 8 80,000 200 x 400= 80,000 Honing these quick math traps can enable the two understudies and instructors to end up noticeably secure in their insight into science\u2014and unafraid to work with numbers later on.

            "answer_text": "We learn math by analogy, association, and steps. I will explain in reverse order. Steps: All math beyond the elemental or basics is learned by building on a previous idea/concept. The way I used to explain problem solving to students is that is like trying to get to the second floor from the first floor. If you try to solve a problem all at once that is like jumping from the first floor to the second floor which only a few people in the world can do. But, if you one thing you know then another and another, eventually the problem solves itself. This is like walking up the steps from the first floor to the second floor, which most people can do. Learning a new mathematical concept is easiest when it related to previouslt learned concepts. Association: We take something we know or understand and relate it to a \u201cnew\u201d idea or concept. Like relating a swing to a parabola. Analogy: Using imagination to relate a \u201cstory\u201d or relationship to an idea. For instance when we are first learning to count, we use objects like fingers and blocks to assign the idea of \u201cnumber\u201d to how many fingers or blocks there are. Learning math is a process which is more about learning how to think than it is about manipulating numbers. Higher level mathematics is less about numbers and more about \u201crelationships.\u201d For instance topology is more about relationships of shapes, ie. a square, a circle, and a triangle are topologically equivalent because you can \u201cbend\u201d or \u201cstretch\u201d the boundary to make the others. But a doughnut is not because it has two boundaries. ",

            "answer_text": "You can't do anything efficiently without clearly articulating why you are doing it.  If you don't have a goal you can't know whether you are making progress toward it. Learning math isn't really a goal.  There's too much.  You could spend your entire life learning math and still not know anything of any use for what you wanted to learn math for.  Really, to learn math efficiently you mostly have to decide what not to learn.  You might find How to Become a Pure Mathematician (or Statistician) useful as a way to understand generally what areas of mathematics tend to be learned and what order they come in. So, if you want to learn math to apply it in some way, then that's one thing.  If it's science then that's different from philosophy which is different from psychology which is different from computer programming.  Get specific.  But for any of these you'll want to learn math as a tool, and to be efficient you can leave out pretty much all the things related to proofs.  That's a big deal.  And which things you pick lets you leave out huge swaths of mathematics that aren't useful for those things.  For example if you want math for computer programming you'll learn graph theory and logic but eschew complex analysis and topology. If you want to learn math just because it's wonderful and makes you happy, then you're probably talking more about pure mathematics.  That's more work because it's the proofs that are the heart of things: so less practice using the tool but lots more time understanding what it is and how it works.  The only way to be efficient about this is to figure out what sorts of math make you happiest and concentrate on those.  To some extent the logicians, analysts, and algebraists all get to ignore the details of the other areas. Lastly, if you want to learn math just to impress people, then you can be really efficient.  Learn a few calculation tricks and stay away from actual mathematicians.  Pretty soon you'll learn that knowing math doesn't actually impress anybody (except mathematicians) and you'll be done. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of my mathematics education has been informal; I took a few upper division math courses during undergrad (linear algebra and two differential equations courses) but have also read quite a few books on various topics on my own. Often while delving into a subject, though, I would read through books fairly quickly without spending a lot of time on the exercises which would result in a fairly superficial understanding of the material. How, then, should one study mathematics? Start at the Bottom Often you may find yourself wanting to learn an advanced topic for whatever reason and it can be tempting to want to drive straight in. Unfortunately, if you do not meet the prerequisites for that subject, then any attempts to learn it will be mostly fruitless. My first experience with linear algebra was an attempt at self learning. At the time, I did not know that undergraduate mathematics had two levels of linear algebra (lower division computational and upper division proof based) and ultimately failed trying to learn from Shilov\u2019s book. Be patient. Fundamentals may be mundane but they are important. Work Slowly Right now I am reading Lieb and Loss\u2019s Analysis. I am on chapter 1 and have been for a little while. Why? I don\u2019t find measure/integration theory to be very intuitive. What do sigma-algebras have to do with measurability? It can be tempting to want to move on to a new topic before you have attained a full understanding of the current topic and care needs to be taken to ensure that this doesn\u2019t happen. If you are not comfortable with how the formal definition of something is related to the intuitive notion (e.g. what open sets have to do with deformability in topology), then you are probably not ready to move past that topic. Read Actively Not all textbooks have exercises with solutions (in fact, not all textbooks even have exercises), but few (if any) are lacking in theorems with their proofs given as part of the main text. When you come across a solved example or a theorem and a proof while reading a textbook, take it as an exercise, not a passage to be read passively. Being able to do the proofs will test your knowledge of the material. Even if you can\u2019t do the entire proof without the guidance of the textbook, actively working through it while you follow along will lead to a better understanding than simply reading the proof. Bring Abstract Concepts Down to Earth As math becomes more abstract and formal it becomes much more difficult to comprehend the meaning and significance of the theorems and definitions that you are presented with. One of the most important tools for understanding abstract mathematics is to be able to connect these concepts to specific examples that you are already familiar with. Once you have found such an example, see if you can figure out how it relates to the abstract concept and after that try to find different examples that illustrate how, exactly, this new concept is in fact more general than the one that you are familiar with. Supplement Definition/Theorem/Proof Style Textbooks Many textbooks place the responsibility of connecting formal definitions with intuition on you. If you are not comfortable with this style of teaching or feel that you could use some assistance, don\u2019t hesitate to consult another resource. Quora and StackExchange are two such resources where students of mathematics often come in search of motivation for mathematical theorems and definitions. If you are feeling particularly confident, then you can take a stab at answering some questions yourself (even your own questions); if there were any doubts in your mind about your understanding of a topic before answering a question about it, they should be mostly gone by the time you\u2019ve finished constructing a clear and carefully constructed response. Take a Formal Course Self teaching is difficult. If you can, take courses in the subjects that you care the most about. In a formal course, you will have mandatory assignments and deadlines which will force you to stay focused and to practice. You will also have an instructor, a TA, and a group of peers to act as a support group as you work through the material. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the request. As a former math-phobe who later learned to love the subject, here are mt suggestions:  First, how do you approach math in general? I would suggest not thinking of it as \"doing math\", but simply \"thinking\". It requires no special brain regions: you are simply thinking about the properties of certain kinds of things. I used to be crippled by the idea that I was \"bad at Maths\". Once I started seeing Maths as just thinking, in a specialised domain, I found I wan't bad after all. Second, study techniques. When studying a work of Mathematics, take your time. Read a bit, then sit back and let what you've read soak in. Ask yourself questions. \"What if\", \"Why\", \"Why not\". Don't hurry. Put your pencil down, lean back, meditate. Then proceed further. After a few days, try and recreate, write down what you learned, without looking at the book. Maths is not logic, and learning Math is not a linear process. Draw pictures, sketch out schemes of the important ideas. Now Calculus. Machine Learning requires linear algebra and calculus. However, not terribly advanced material. Try and begin with \"What is Mathematics\" by Courant and Robbins, and \"Mathematics: a very short introduction\" by Timothy Gowers. Highly recommend both books. Do many, many problems. You can get lists of books all over Quora. Once you've gotten the hang of the terminology, stop when you get to a theorem. Try and prove it for yourself. If you can't complete it, glance at the solution, then try and complete it. Try the Khan Academy videos, the MIT videos: all are good. Learn where you can. Be patient with yourself: a lot of Maths is about getting used to the language and the concepts. The results will follow. Have fun with the subject: don't think of it as a chore, or merely as a way to begin Machine Learning. Cheers, and good luck! ",

A few are good resources for middle and high school students are as follows: SolutionInn \u2013 This is a simple model that supports not only MATH but also other business and science subjects too. This can help you with basic level questions, difficult, and advanced level questions for practice. It also has more than 1 million textbook solved questions that can help you learn faster and also to check your solution while practicing. Khan Academy \u2013 Another great site that teachers use in their classrooms for helping to reinforce concepts with lower level students, plus offer more challenging material to those with stronger math abilities. Video instruction helps to explain topics and give quick answers to students when needed. Some teachers assign topics as homework to help students prepare for the next day\u2019s lesson. Freckle \u2013 This site is a great reinforcement resource for differentiation and allows teachers to track the progress of their students as they make their way through ability-appropriate lessons. However, some find that the themes of the site are a bit juvenile, so it may not be as engaging for all middle school level students. Edulastic -Within this resource, you can create assessments based on learning levels or you can use pre-made versions, all of which align with standards. It integrates with Google Classroom, which helps to streamline the process and gives students easier access. Progress can be measured individually for immediate feedback or displayed head to head to bring a fun, competitive component to math mastery. BrainGenie \u2013 Allows teachers to set up the concepts in the units they are teaching as goals for student practice in class or at home. There are competitive applications within the concepts which are appealing to students. Data is compiled on student progress so that teachers can see where gaps need to be managed. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to answer the more general question. What is the best way to learn. The best way to learn is to genuinely enjoy learning. Why would anyone enjoy learning might come the reply. We teach from an early age that learning is not fun. It is imposed on us when we would far rather be playing games. But learning is a game. It is a game of discovery, where the more you learn the better you are at that game. One is constantly leveling up. I recently retired and decided to learn Quantum Computing. It is hard, but no harder than winning chess against a computer, which also most days seems impossible. But there is a difference. When I gain understanding I have something I can play with in my head for hours, and that\u2019s something I can\u2019t do with chess.. I can\u2019t keep all the pieces straight in my head. I can grasp the mathematics of how a Quantum computer works, I can understand some of the black magic that it by its computational power makes possible, much of it a bit mind blowing, and I can understand how to program it. I stand above most of humanity which imagines a Quantum computer capable of solving life the universe and everything type problems, and marvel that a Quantum computer has been proven good for anything at all, since its entire functionality (matrix arithmetic/linear algebra) is so incredibly restrictive. But I also marvel that I studied linear algebra, and never would have imagined there might be power in linear algebra to solve problems never imaginable solvable using a classical computer. I enjoy the knowing what I know. The study of mathematics is a study designed to extend what you know. By extending that knowledge you extend you own ability to discover new knowledge, and better grasp the foundations on which all it seems is built in this our universe. Putting mathematical skills to work is fun, exciting, but also rather challenging. Math is one of the few things that will remain long after we are gone. It is one of the very few ideas of ours that we did not ourselves invent. If you want to grasp something that will not fade with your passing, grasp mathematics. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is a subject that you cannot avoid. Some love it but, if we\u2019re being honest, most people hate studying maths. The importance of maths for students has never been greater. STEM subjects are the basis for technologies of tomorrow. Most university courses include some level of maths while almost every profession uses maths in some form on a daily basis. 7 Tips for Maths Problem Solving 1. Practice, Practice & More Practice It is impossible to study maths properly by just reading and listening. To study maths you have to roll up your sleeves and actually solve some problems. The more you practice answering maths problems, the better. Each problem has its own characteristics and it\u2019s important to have solved it in numerous ways before tackling the exam. There is no escaping this reality, to do well in a Maths exam you need to have solved a LOT of mathematical problems beforehand. 2. Review Errors When you\u2019re practising with these problems, it\u2019s important to work through the process for each solution. If you have made any mistakes, you should review them and understand where your problem-solving skills let you down. Understanding how you approached the problem and where you went wrong is a great way of becoming stronger and avoiding the problems Do not try to memorise the processes.This is counter-productive. It is much better and rewarding in the long-run to focus on understanding the process and logic that is involved. This will help you understand how you should approach such problems in the future. Remember that Maths is a sequential subject so it\u2019s important to have a firm understanding of the key concepts that underpin a mathematical topic before moving on to work on other, more complex solutions which are based on understanding the basics. 4. Understand your Doubts Sometimes you can get stuck trying to solve part of a maths problem and find it difficult to move on to the next stage. It\u2019s common for many students to skip this question and continue on to the next. You should avoid doing this and instead spend time trying to understand the process of solving the problem. Once you have grasped an understanding of the initial problem, you can use this as a stepping stone to progress to the remainder of the question. Remember: Maths requires time and patience to master. It is a good idea to study with a friend who you can consult with and bounce ideas off when trying to solve complex problems. 5. Create a Distraction Free Study Environment Mathematics is a subject that requires more concentration than any other. A proper study environment and a distraction free area could be the determining factor when solving complex equations or problems in geometry, algebra or trigonometry! Studying with music can help create a relaxing atmosphere and stimulate the flow of information. Having suitable background music can foster an environment of maximum concentration. Of course, you should steer clear of Pitbull and Eminem, instrumental music is the best thing in these times. 6. Create a Mathematical Dictionary Mathematics has specific terminology with a lot of vocabulary with all the concepts, terminology and definitions you need to know. You should include their meanings, some key points and even some sample answers so you can consult them at any time and recap. 7. Apply Maths to Real World Problems As much as possible, try to apply real-world problems when approaching maths. Maths can be very abstract sometimes so looking for a practical application can help change your perspective and assimilate ideas differently. Probability, for example, can be used in everyday life to predict the outcome of something happening and determine whether you want to take a risk such as if you should buy a lottery ticket or gamble. Oh and don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s also important to have confidence in yourself and face the exam knowing that you have prepared ",

            "answer_text": "Find a burning purpose or goal as to how to make it happen, and link it to the how by learning magical mathematical skills to help you attain it . Then learning math will be easy and fun. I was hating maths for 23 years of my life. Maybe because of the conventional ways it was taught: cut and dried. Nothing practical. Pure theory with rigorous derivations and no fun at all. I always used to love physics and started reading pure text-based books on it because I can understand English. My desire to master maths came to me because I cant go beyond a level of layman understanding in physics to the deeper and more fascinatingly-beautiful stuffs. Then I read a book, \"The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe\". In it there was a picture that struck me forever and gave me that first step forward to math.  Then, I seriously started learning maths. I got lucky finding the following website: How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist which had links to collections of great resources that the best colleges offer to students. Then, it opened my eyes that math is a more creative subject than poetry. Lots of practical applications can be made using it. All the math resources provided in the above link connects the math with the practical world which makes it fascinating. This simple thing is missing in INDIAN education. Yeah, somebody writes new books and saves millions of children here. I followed the same order as given in the website: Beginning AlgebraIntermediate AlgebraDave E. Joyce's Trigonometry courseProf. James Binney's course on Complex Numbers (*.pdf)(Nearly) Complete overview of Primary Mathematics (K. Kubota, Kentucky)I Stopped here and read a book on calculus: Calculus and Analytic Geometry (9th Edition): George B. Thomas, Ross L. Finney: 9780201531749: Amazon.com: Books and worked out the entire book.What I learned from the process is that the math is very creative when you do something from scratch. Just think of a simple problem and try to solve it without any external support. Internet, book, calculator or friend, NO anything. You discover cool stuffs this way and learn Math. PS: If you can\u2019t find a solution and are getting very frustrated, follow the Edison method of going into diffusion mode. Sleep with holding a pen in your hand. When you fall asleep the pen falls and the sound wakes you up. Now try to solve that same problem. You would be surprised to find that the solution all of a sudden pops up in your mind. ",

            "answer_text": "When I got my math degree and later in graduate courses I bought legal notebooks that had 3\u201d margins. This gave me room for additional notes. I would put Theory on the right side of the paper and samples on the left. Learn the notation and use it so you can simplify your notes. Often you\u2019ll read statements that say \u201cit can be shown\u201d if it isn\u2019t obvious take some time to work it out. Stay on top of it. Study s little ahead so you will be ready to ask questions. Ask questions. This is a general thing I do for all classes I take. I go and look at the textbooks before I take a class. This will give you an idea of what to expect. I have bought the textbook and worked through it in some classes. I have also taken graduate classes in place of lower level classes. For my liberal arts I took a graduate course in logic. The undergraduate course was too simple and verbose. The graduate course was a thin book called \u201clogic for mathematicians\u201d. I saw the Dean first to get his permission to substitute the course first. Here is a big one. If you you get in a class and you can\u2019t inderstsnd the professor, transfer as soon as possible! When you see \u201cstaff\u201dfor the instructor this may be a clue that this may happen to you. The math is hard enough without having to figure out the teachers english! There is another issue with first year Calculus, Physics and Chemestry. Many departments use these classes to \u201cweed out http://students\u201d.As a result in big universities they have huge classes and don\u2019t care if you fail. You may benefit by finding a smaller class and transferring the credit if they will allow it. Another thing. Buy your text early and look at buying a used text. If you find one that looks like it has been marked and has some good notes in it it\u2019s like having a free tutor. The other thing is grading. Some professors allow you to go with your final grade if it\u2019s better than your midterm scores. The rational here is that you may not understand things till then. I had my first statistics teacher offer this because when he took the same course he didn\u2019t understand things until the break before the test. The other thing is don\u2019t give up. The first student I tutored in statistics failed he mid-term. She aced the final! Sometimes instructors use grad students for grading and they can mess you up by their lack of knowledge. I had a graduate level statistics class I took through the Psychology department. Most of my psychology courses were on a graduate level, I had one PhD course. Anyway in using the statistical package I used If THEN ELSE in s compound statement. She didn\u2019t understand it and held my final grade back. I finally threatened to to take her to the Deans office so she can tell him she knows nothing about programming! SPSSx was written in Fortran so it followed FORTRAN protocols. Another thing some have success is study groups but sometimes that\u2019s discouraged. If a group of people turn in with the same errors math teachers see that as an honor violation. My PhD psychology teacher didnt which bugged me because apparently I was the only one turning in their own work! ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the youth nowadays despises Math, because they do not \u2018understand\u2019! Math, is one of the easiest subject\u2026 all you need is to understand the concept, which is basically short and precise. That is the best part, because you don\u2019t have pages in introduction, but hardly a 3 (max.) paragraphs as introduction. Math is a subject, which requires you to bend your mind to solve the problem, so obviously, it is interesting, and there isn\u2019t any memorising. Also, as you delve deeper into different concepts like \u2018telescopic series\u2019 and \u2018transformation geometry\u2019, math does wonders. It is one of the most fascinating subjects. Most of this youth, doesn\u2019t like to understand why things happen- they don\u2019t have that hunger for knowledge yet, so it\u2019s pretty obvious that they don\u2019t like this subject. The 3 most important tips for improvement:- Remove the mindset of math being a tough subject, that only a \u201cmath person\u201d can understand. (Please\u2026 no one is born with a math mind, that is yet another trend created by this youth)Do not just read and settle. Math is a subject which requires PRACTICE, and I know you have heard this a lot, but the emphasis is really true. When you practice, your brain automatically starts registering the formula, this way you don\u2019t even have to mug up formulas. Just solve the sums, or see examples, seeing the structure of the sum, the brain can register the formula and apply. (Only with immense practice).Don\u2019t be satisfied with school textbook or any one source. Always try to practice math from different books or online sources. You never know, you can find another way, which may be easier, and suits you. Extra practice is always beneficial. Try books like R. D Sharma, NCERT\u2026 and there are many more.",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is one of the most important subjects for every student. Even math is also playing a crucial role in our everyday life. But most of us hate to learn math because of its complexity. But math is widely used in many subjects for some of the top universities. Even math is also useful in some of the latest technologies, likewise machine learning and artificial intelligence. Apart from that, a shopkeeper to the businessmen is using math daily. Most of the students learn basic math easily, but they find difficulty with advanced math. Here we are going to share with you the best ways on how to learn math from basic to the advanced level. Best Ways on How to Learn Math Practice, Practice & More Practice Practice makes a man able to solve the problems with perfection. Most of the students think that they can solve the math problem by just paying attention to the class. What do you think? Is it possible to solve math problems by just reading and listening? Of Course not, because math is not similar to other subjects. You find problems in math, and you have to solve it using some math formulas. To solve any problems in math, you need to do a lot of practice. The more you practice to solve the math problems, the more you get better. There are lots of ways to solve math problems in different ways. Each math problem has its characteristics. Therefore these problems have different ways to solve it. Thus the more you explore the best ways to solve the problems, the better you perform in math exams. There is no shortcut to solve math problems without doing the proper practices to solve them. Review Errors Doing the practice to solve math problems is not enough. Because whenever we practice solving any problem in math, we face some difficulties. You should work on the process of solving each problem through various methods. With this, if you made any mistake while solving the problem, then you should review your errors and find the weak point where you have made a mistake. If you do so, then you may become more confident in solving these math problems in the future without committing any errors. Master the Key Concepts Most of the students try to memorize the processes. We all know math is not the subject to memorize. You can memorize the formulas of math. But memorizing the entire process of solving the math problem is not the best solution. Rather than memorize, you should try to learn these concepts. As I mentioned earlier, the more you practice, the more you will be able to master the key concepts. If you master the key concepts, then you will be able to solve the problems related to those concepts. By the way, you have to be logical to master the concepts. It will make you more approachable to face those problems in the future. Also, keep in mind that math is a sequential subject. It means that you have to learn it from the basics, and each concept is interrelated to each other. Therefore you have to follow the sequences and should not skip any concept if you want to learn math with perfection. Understand your Doubts It is evident that whenever we solve the math problem, we get stuck in it. And sometimes the problems take longer to solve than usual. In this case, we try to skip the problems rather than solve them. In this case, we need to understand the problems and try to clear our doubts. It may take lots of time. But math requires lots of time and patience from the students. You can solve the problem step by step and clear all your doubts in every step. If you prefer a group study, then this approach is quite effective. Because your friends may help you to clear your doubts and help you to solve the problem in a quick time. Create a Distraction-Free Study Environment The more silent the place you get to learn math, the more you can pay attention to math. As we know that Math requires lots of concentration than any other subject. Thus it requires a proper study environment and a distraction-free area. It would help you to solve the most complex equations or problems of math. You can also play some classical music while solving math problems. Because classical music creates a relaxing atmosphere and helps the students to process the information more effectively in their minds. Apart from classical music, you can also play your favorite music or songs. It will boost your energy and help you to think more effectively. Create Mathematical Dictionary Math dictionary sounds awkward? Maybe not because math contains various terminologies. Thus math has its dictionary with lots of vocabulary. It is hard to memorize all these terminologies at one time. So how can you have a strong command over math vocabulary? The best approach to remember these terminologies is to create a mathematical dictionary. In this dictionary, you can note down all the concepts, terminology, and definitions of maths along with suitable examples. Apply Maths to Real World Problems Math is all about real-life problems. Thus if you want to learn math, then you have to apply it to real-world problems. If you apply maths to real-world problems, then you can learn the math concept more effectively. And you can have a better perception of solving math problems. Most of the time, math helps us to predict the outcome of our actions. Thus we can take a calculated risk with the help of math. Play with the Math Play with math sounds funny? Yes, most of us think that playing with math is a silly approach to learn math. But did you know that practice is good while understanding is better, but playing is the best approach to learn math? Once you gain the confidence to solve math problems, the next step is to play with math. You can try to solve self create problems or various problems and make learning math as a fun activity. You can either change the equation of the problem or use the same equation to solve different problems. Refer from other to clear doubts As I have mentioned earlier, you can clear your doubts with the help of your friends during the group study. But not only can your friends help you to clear your doubts. You can take the help of experts like a math homework helper or your teacher to clear your doubts. Your teacher who teaches you in the classroom can help you to clear your doubts while in the classroom or after the class. Don\u2019t be shy to ask for help from our teacher. Clear your doubts as soon as possible. But if you don\u2019t have enough time to clear your doubts in the classroom or after class. Then you can also approach math homework help providers who can clear all your doubts online. Concentration Concentration is the key component to learn math. We know that concentration is the key to all subjects, but it is crucial to solving math problems. The more you put concentration to learn math, the more you can have a strong command over it. It helps you to identify the actual that might be hidden inside the problem. The concentration also helps you to solve complex math problems that require more time to resolve. Create helpful activities We know that math is considered as one of the boring subjects for the students. But you can make math as a fun activity for the students, especially for the school kids. In schools, use the chart of all the mathematical methods and formulas. Try to hang it in front of the classroom. Thus the students can watch the charts. In this way, the chart helps the students to understand the math concept easily. When we create math the fun activity, then the students identify the root problems unless they just find the solution. In this way, the students find the easy math subject rather than the tough one. Apart from that, the students also find creative ways to solve the math problem if we make it a fun activity. When it comes to mathematical issues, a person needs to maintain a calm approach while solving some mathematical questions. Never miss a math class You should also try to attend every math class. Because when we miss the single math class. Then it can cause problems for the students. Because when the students come to solve the problems without attending the classroom, then they get into trouble. Therefore the students shouldn\u2019t skip a single maths class. You should also be active in math classrooms. The more you are active, the more you grab the concept of math. Solving the problem in the class Most of the students don\u2019t initiate the math problems within the classroom. It is better if the student keeps working on problems with its teacher. If the students solve the problems with the same flow that the teacher is solving, then they get a strong command over the approach. If the students are stuck at some point while solving the problem, then they should write the problem and take the help from the teacher to get rid of the problem. Repeat the class work at home Most of the students don\u2019t do the math homework. Either your teacher gives you math homework or not. But you should try to repeat the class work at your home to understand the math concept better. Because when we do the homework after class. Then we get more chances to clear all the concepts. You should not do the same questions that your teachers have solved in the classroom. You should solve some more problems. Divide the subject in parts Math has lots of parts. The students should start to learn math with the simplest part i.e., arithmetic, algorithms, and geometry. While learning these concepts, the students also try to learn the art to divide the problem into small pieces and then try to solve those parts one by one. The students should spend more time understanding the most robust concept of math. They should not spend equal time to understand the easy concept and the tough one. Conclusion Now you have seen the best ways to how to learn math. There are also some other ways to show you how to learn math from basic to advanced. But this approach is more useful for beginners. If you follow all these ways, then you will surely get a strong command over math. As I have mentioned earlier, that math is quite helpful in every aspect of life. Thus math is also playing a crucial role in Python. If you are looking to study Python in the near future, then you should start implementing these ways to get a better command over math.

            "answer_text": "Many people think that studying Math requires you to be taught by a professor at school. With the abundance of free information, lectures, syllabi, ebooks, and MOOCS around, you can certainly self-study Math. The best part is, you do it at your own pace. No strict schedules, just self-commitment. However, you gotta think differently about this if you want to reap the rewards. That is, to recognize that the mental effort you spend practicing a Math topic is the price you pay for making future skills easier. Or more appropriately, it\u2019s the price you pay so you won\u2019t make learning hard for your future self. Mathematics is all about cumulative knowledge, you know. Unlike school, you\u2019re going to feel like crap because you\u2019re not changing topics with respect to time \u2014 you\u2019re now changing topics based on how fast you master a skill. Steps to Studying Math on Your Own I\u2019m going to interrupt you for a bit to make something clear: I created this guide to help people who feel like they\u2019re lagging with their Math skills and want to review it, or people who just want to study Math on their own for some reason. Each example that I\u2019ll give you is just that\u2013a mere example to help you get the point I\u2019m trying to make. It\u2019s still up to you to apply these steps to your own situation. Step 1. Begin with the end in mind Math builds upon itself, so if you want to learn a subject, say, Calculus, always ask: What subjects are the prerequisites of this subject? In my own study, I often ask myself a \u201cskill\u201d based question, rather than a topical one. \u201cWhat skills do I have to learn to get better at this one?\u201d Problem Solving is a skill, after all. You can\u2019t get better at problem-solving if you don\u2019t have the tools; the individual mastery of prerequisite topics. Which brings me to my next point. Step 2. Decide Your Topic using a Curriculum Now that you have determined your end subject, it\u2019s now time to decide which general topic to start with. For example, Calculus and its applications are easier if you have the knowledge of Analytic Geometry and Trigonometry. But Analytic Geometry has some Trigonometry elements included. So, you can decide to start with Trigonometry. However, if you don\u2019t have the knowledge of \u201cwhich is the prerequisite of which\u201d I highly recommend that you find an online curriculum. Here\u2019s one good roadmap for someone who\u2019s learning Math for Data Science. Step 3. Find a Syllabus If you\u2019re lost, you go to Google Maps. So what do you do when you don\u2019t have a roadmap or a sequence to learn Math? Use an already-designed Syllabus. They\u2019ll be the roadmap to your self-studying success. As I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, these can be easily found online. I mean, just a single Google Search will give you what you\u2019re looking for. Or, you can just look at your university\u2019s resources and check syllabi for Math subjects. Step 4. Gather your References, Solution Manuals, and \u201cSolved Problems\u201d Types of Books Conventional Math learning requires that you go to school, attend classes, do your homework, and then wait for it to be checked before you complete the feedback loop. I say that\u2019s highly inefficient. When there are solution manuals or Solved Problems types of books available, it\u2019s better to actually use them side-by-side to your own problem-solving routine. For this one, I like the \u201cSchaum\u2019s Outlines\u201d series of books. The problems are rather hard, the discussions are concise and straight to the point, but you\u2019ll certainly get better at problem-solving EASILY. Just to be clear, I\u2019m not saying that you should look at the solutions each and every time you\u2019re solving a problem, but whenever you get stuck, you can easily get out and actually learn the solutions faster. This tight feedback loop is what will allow us to learn math FAST and at our OWN pace. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t understand the material?\u201d It\u2019s either you don\u2019t have the prerequisites mastered (or not at all), or you\u2019re using an overly complicated book. Lastly, common sense says that this guide is not the \u201cend-all-be-all\u201d of self-studying Math. You can always consult others when you really get stuck even when you have a solution manual (perhaps it has a typo error or something). ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: This answer is completely based on my experience. I have no training in teaching. In my opinion, teaching mathematics from a tools perspective is the way to go. Let me explain using my experience. I lost interest in mathematics just around the time it started becoming more abstract. Concepts like matrices and vectors were introduced. I just assumed that my brain was not made for mathematics and did the minimum(memorize rules and practice problems) to get grades. However, I developed interest in Artificial Intelligence(AI) & Machine Learning(ML) in college. AI & ML opened my eyes to the fact that mathematics is the ultimate tool for expressing ideas. I also rediscovered Internet as a tool for self-learning. Internet is filled with series like this one, a must-watch: Essence of Linear Algebra I will just give you one example to illustrate how my perspective changed: Matrix Vector Multiplication. Before It was just a grid of numbers and another column of numbers. You mix them using this weird formula(that you HAD to remember) to get this other column of numbers. Why? I have no idea. After When I saw for the first time how matrix-vector multiplication was getting used in these real-world applications it clicked. Matrix-vector multiplication is just a neat way of expressing combination of vectors. As simple as that. Also, once I realized that, it was not important to remember the formula. Summary So, if we ground these mathematical ideas as an means to an end we should have more success. I do not think teaching mathematics as a collection of weird formulas and abstract concepts achieves anything. I always wonder, what would happen if we do this: At the start of the year tell the students that we will build a system to differentiate between different images. Then, structure the course into modules where each mathematical concept is tied to some aspect of that system. Will this communicate the ideas better and ground it strongly in a practical application. I think, yes. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have mentioned practice is the core component of learning math - much like learning an instrument or a sport. A few other things from my experience:1) Starting in the right place. I very often want to jump directly into a subject that interests me - while lacking knowledge required to understand the subject. You must choose the right place in mathematics to jump in - this depends on your current knowledge and skill. If you find yourself totally stumped by a book/class - figure out what people recommend you read/study before that one. 2) Figure out where you want to go! Have a goal in mind is great motivation. What area of math most interests you? What do you want to do with it? Are you interested in the abstract side of math? Applied math - in physics, engineering, statistics? Given a goal you can find the path to get there. Math is such a large subject - it is easy to get overwhelmed by the variety of things you can learn. 3) Work through the details. In any course and any text - proofs of key theorems will be outlined for you. Make sure you fully understand the proofs and fill in the missing details. Much like working with a machine - the best way to understand is to dig in and see how it works. Important : Simply reading a mathematics textbook is nearly useless. 4) Keep struggling! Keep making mistakes and keep learning from them. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is much shorter and you should use this advice in addition with other answers: Being shorter should not distract from it as the single most important point about studying math or any subject. If you use this than all the other answers will be much more effective: nomenclature! The first thing to do is look up the nomenclature that you are dealing with. if it is \u201cAlgebra\u201d look up the definition of it and make sure you understand the definition. Make examples with that definition in your head or on a paper. Do this for every word as you go along that is new or you have not looked up before. The only reason why someone gives up studying any subject is due to its misunderstood words. This is a proven fact by well over a million users that have been trained how to do this and how to spot misunderstood words. But you don\u2019t need to do the course just apply above to any text and you will find combined with the rest of the tips. You win and your speed goes up and up with that technique too. It has also shown to improve thinking skills / cognitive skills. Warning: It is a bit harder in the beginning especially as many definitions or explanations are very technical and often written for the person who already knows and not for a newcomer. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m quoting the answer that I wrote in Nicholas Cooper's answer to What is mathematics? because I think that it\u2019s relevant here. No one definition could or should work. The reason is that what mathematics is like a camera, giving different answers depending on the focus. Instead, it should be intuitively understood in various levels: At a very intuitive level, by abstracting the notion of \u201cgame\u201d philosophically, mathematics can be thought of as the study of \u201crules for games, and how those games can play out\u201d.At the most formal fundamental level, mathematics is the study of \u201cvirtual structures created from premises, and the logical consequences of those premises\u201d. In this way, it is the study of logic, and it shares some amazingly important similarities to programming (software development). When people speak of a \u201clanguage of mathematics\u201d they are talking about the similarities that it has to a programming language.At the next level, once relations are defined, mathematics could be said to be the study of \u201crelationships between things\u201d. It\u2019s important to note that, by studying relationships, one can derive logic systems again (even new ones). More importantly, this definition imparts the notion that there are connections far-and-wide between different areas of mathematics.At the next level, once relationships can be used to describe value, mathematics could be said to be the study of \u201cvalue, structure, and change\u201d. This recognizes that even shapes can be classified as structure, functions can be classified as values, and that computation can actually fall under change.At another level yet (and perhaps the most inexact here), one can say that mathematics is the study of computation.All of this is defined without reference to numbers, because value may be important, but quantity is not necessary when talking about mathematics, and quantity arises often due to the connectivity of mathematics, but not often enough to even mention it as being something mathematics is about. Others here have describe mathematics as a language. That is not 100% correct, but it\u2019s understandable why people say as much. It\u2019s more like a programming language, with various syntaxes described by humans, but semantics that are all its own (Nicholas Cooper's answer to Does mathematics possess its own syntax and semantics?).

What\u2019s the next thing I might want to do, now that I understand this concept - what other problems does this pose, or new ideas does this allow me to think about?\u201d That way, you have motivation behind your understanding of the concept. Step three: consider the concept in that light for a minute. Just give it a good think. Step four: solve a bunch of problems so that you have mastered use of the topic. Step five: Repeat for the next topic. Step six: Go back and compare what you did do to what you thought in step two. How did your predictions compare to what was actually the next topic covered? If they were the same, great! You understood the original concept. If not, why did it differ? Can you solve your original question, and if not, what else do you need? This last step is a sort of self-assessment which you should run on every topic - it\u2019s easy to \u201cconvince yourself you understand something,\u201d but unless you can use it (and not only to solve the mostly-algorithmic problems you find in your textbook!), you don\u2019t understand it well enough, and that will mess you up down the line.

It is the word that gives kids nightmare ( well i personally got in past!). But why it is so bad. Or is it? Or it seems? Or the way it\u2019s taught is wrong? Well we are human i guess, not a machine to mug up every step. I think the best way is to love maths. But how you could love maths? You need to understand that maths is the language of the universe. Ah!! Ok!! Everyone says that. Yeah but you need not believe that it is the language of universe but you need to know. Well if you start any topic say BINOMIAL THEOREM. Try to know about it, maths doesn't falls from sky , it is discovered by human mind, which is professional in finding patterns in nature. You'll get to know how the mathematician discovered and created the maths that describes our physical world. SECOND THING IS just find the real life application of the maths. Try to learn things that you can use to do while solving problems, a tone will come when you would get the whole idea to solve a particular question in mind in just second, then you would just have to write em down. Ah! What are you waiting for just go and find the history and development of tbe topocs that are being taught in school. Do the proofs of the equation. You would love doing em. ",

            "answer_text": "Learning mathematics is similar in many ways to learning a language. You start by learning some basic vocabulary, and pretty soon you are putting together statements that have some meaning. In mathematics you learn some basic vocabulary in elementary school. Oh, yes, there\u2019s the basic arithmetic facts, but along with 3 + 5 = 8, you are also learning what the operation of addition means. The equals sign is the verb in that statement saying the left side has the same value as the right. The next step up the ladder, algebra, requires developing an abstract understanding of the arithmetic operations. A key idea is that solving an equation is just a matter of undoing the operations that have been done to an unknown number. If the equation is x \u2013 7 = 12 you know that if you subtract seven from the unknown number you get twelve. So if you undo the subtract seven, you would know what x is. Since x \u2013 7 = 12 is a true statement (if they are lying to you, you wouldn\u2019t know anything anyway), undo the subtract seven by adding seven to both sides\u2014like keeping a teeter totter in balance. Yes, there is a tad bit more to algebra than that, but that is the glorious part about mathematics. The rest of it is just a matter of learning pesky details. My point is that mathematics is an interrelated structure of abstract ideas. Learning about abstract ideas is not building fairy castles in the sky. The principles of mathematics are the tools for understanding the universe. (The why of that relationship is an interesting philosophical question in itself.) Be sure not to let all the details of the computational complexities blind you to the overall simplicity of the abstract ideas behind them. Ask yourself, what do I have to do\u2014and why? ",

Now let us elaborate on other tips to learn math: Sign up for math classes: If you feel you are extremely weak at math then do not hesitate to get coaching from a math tutor. The math tutor will ensure that you get regular math practice. Also, never hesitate to ask them any of your doubts.Make notes: Make notes during the class and go through them afterwards. Keep the concepts fresh so read up your notes regularly. Another approach of making notes is to write down the problems that you face as a question and try to answer them yourself. For this you will need to go through the text book. I would suggest that you create step-wise how to solve notes for each topic. It will be handy for you at all the times.Refer old question papers: If you are preparing from exam point of view then do not forget to look up the old question papers. Try to solve them at home. Do not panic if you are not able to solve them. Look for the solution and solve questions by yourself and not by referencing.Seek help from internet: Most of us do so much time pass on the internet making it an evil in our parents eyes whereas we can clearly use it to our benefit. You tube is filled with videos on math topics and so many youtubers have entire channels where they give math instructions. Check them out, they are really very helpful.In fact check out this math blog where they have great tips wrt how you can make math more interesting. I am a regular visitor to their blog and have also bought few of Logic Roots\u2019 math board games in order to tutor kids. In the end I will reiterate with what I started. Practice math as much as possible. This is the single way of learning the subject. Merge your math practice with the above tips and you would be able to really excel at the subject. ",

            "answer_text": "By Mathematics is a subject that every student has to study at one time or another. Some love it but if we\u2019re being honest, most people hate studying maths. The importance of maths for students has never been more prominent. Most university courses include some level of maths while almost every profession uses maths in some form on a daily basis. The problem many students have is that they don\u2019t know how to study maths to get good results. Maths is one of those subjects which you can easily spend hours studying but end up none the wiser. However much you have studied, if you can not solve the problem on day of the test, you are lost. Thankfully, there are some techniques for studying maths that you can do regardless of your level. You may even end up loving mathematics by the end of the blog post!  7 Tips for Maths Problem Solving 1. Practice, Practice & More Practice It is impossible to study maths properly by just reading and listening. To study maths you have to roll up your sleeves and actually solve some problems. The more you practice answering maths problems, the better. Each problem has its own characteristics and it\u2019s important to have solved it in numerous ways before tackling the exam. There is no escaping this reality, to do well in a Maths exam you need to have solved a LOT of mathematical problems beforehand. 2. Review Errors When you\u2019re practising with these problems, it\u2019s important to work through the process for each solution. If you have made any mistakes, you should review them and understand where your problem-solving skills let you down. Understanding how you approached the problem and where you went wrong is a great way of becoming stronger and avoiding the same mistakes in the future. 3. Master the Key Concepts Do not try to memorise the processes.This is counter-productive. It is much better and rewarding in the long-run to focus on understanding the process and logic that is involved. This will help you understand how you should approach such problems in the future. Remember that Maths is a sequential subject so it\u2019s important to have a firm understanding of the key concepts that underpin a mathematical topic before moving on to work on other, more complex solutions which are based on understanding the basics. 4. Understand your Doubts Sometimes you can get stuck trying to solve part of a maths problem and find it difficult to move on to the next stage. It\u2019s common for many students to skip this question and continue on to the next. You should avoid doing this and instead spend time trying to understand the process of solving the problem. Once you have grasped an understanding of the initial problem, you can use this as a stepping stone to progress to the remainder of the question. Remember: Maths requires time and patience to master. It is a good idea to study with a friend who you can consult with and bounce ideas off when trying to solve complex problems. 5. Create a Distraction Free Study Environment Mathematics is a subject that requires more concentration than any other. A proper study environment and a distraction free area could be the determining factor when solving complex equations or problems in geometry, algebra or trigonometry! Studying with music can help create a relaxing atmosphere and stimulate the flow of information. Having suitable background music can foster an environment of maximum concentration. Of course, you should steer clear of Pitbull and Eminem, instrumental music is the best thing in these times. 6. Create a Mathematical Dictionary Mathematics has specific terminology with a lot of vocabulary. I suggest you create Notes or Flashcards with all the concepts, terminology and definitions you need to know. You should include their meanings, some key points and even some sample answers so you can consult them at any time and recap. 7. Apply Maths to Real World Problems As much as possible, try to apply real-world problems when approaching maths. Maths can be very abstract sometimes so looking for a practical application can help change your perspective and assimilate ideas differently. Probability, for example, can be used in everyday life to predict the outcome of something happening and determine whether you want to take a risk such as if you should buy a lottery ticket or gamble. Oh and don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s also important to have confidence in yourself and face the exam knowing that you have prepared properly! ",

We are so much comfortable from these invention and we should acknowledge the same. As far as learning the math, requirement more adherence, concentration which now days have diverted our mind in Mobile, internet, FM and TV and these taking out large amount of time of 24 hours. Once have to enhance the effort to solve the math on your own time and again. Leave no room until in solving the problem and taking help from other are avoidable. I can remember one incidence reported in Newspaper about math teach in Mexico. He rarely solve the math from the test book as it left for the students to make effort to solve the problem and performance the of the school in Math had improved by several time before assuming the duty. In addition to that one should read the books of great mathematicians how to solve the some maths with the occurrence of of incidents from their daily life. In conclusion, learning math not to divert mind, adherence, attempt to solve the math by a number of times on your own, avoid taking help from other will surely improve the learning process the math.

            "answer_text": "A practical way to learn mathematics that worked for me, is to learn about basic circuit theory. Learn Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL). Get a breadboard with binding posts or 'banana plugs', a cheap DMM, a 4 x AA battery holder, a pack of AA batteries, a bunch of 1 watt metal film resistors, say from 1000 (1k) Ohms to 10000 (10k) Ohms. Measure each resistor's Resistance value R Ohms, and write the value down. Connect up each resistor to the battery, measure the voltage across it, then measure the current through it. Start with Ohm's Law:Write down V = I*R Volts (the * symbol means to multiply; this is used by computer interpreters or compilers to multiply two numbers together, as well as Applications Software such as Microsoft Excel), from the measured value of the current, multiply it with each resistance value, then compare the calculated voltage with the measured voltage; there will be a small difference due to the measurement error that is inherent to the DMM's design, but that is OK, as along as you're within the % error of the measurement error of the DMM, as given in the DMM's manual in the specifications.Divide R to both sides of V = I*R, i.e. V/R = I*R/R reducing to V/R = I Amps or as some people prefer I = V/R Amps, then divide the measured voltage by the Resistance value. Next, you may try to calculate the Power dissipated by the Resistor, starting with P = V*I Watts, then calculate the power rating of the resistor by using the measured voltage and current values. Then by substituting first I = V/R Amps, into P = VI = V*V/R Watts, or P = (V^2) / R Watts (the ^ symbol in computer language means to raise to the power of; some compilers or interpreters use **). Another learning vehicle, may be to calculate the Power dissipated by the Resistor, starting again with P = V*I Watts, then substituting V = I*R Volts, into P = V*I = I*R*I = (I^2)*R Watts. Then plug in each measured value of current into I, squaring it, then multiplying by plugging in the measured resistance value R. Kirchhoff's Voltage Law and Kirchhoff's Current Law require constructing resistor networks, and deriving simultaneous equations, for solving for the unknowns. The above may be a non-tedious way to learn basic algebra, and see how algebra has practical applications. ",

Otherwise, you end up having to reinvent the subject on your own, which on the one hand, may lead to developing new insights, but which is also very time consuming and challenging. Exercises can help. For understanding algebraic system, ask yourself if the axioms can be satisfied by an empty set, a set with one element, a set with two elements, \u2026, and see if you can enumerate all the possibilities. Do the same thing with topology. Particularly in topology, but also generally, whenever you encounter a theorem, don\u2019t look at the proof until you\u2019ve tried to construct your own proof. If you\u2019re having trouble finding a proof, try to construct a counterexample. See if you can identify what is frustrating your efforts. to sharpen your attempts, going back and forth. You might find a cleaner proof than the one in the book, in which case tell us about it. Or you might not find one, but you\u2019ll be in a much better position to understand the proof you read.

            "answer_text": "By practice practice and some more practice... Maths is a subject which cannot be mugged up. You can do whatever you want to but if you don't practice math you won't learn a thing in maths. Let me ask you a real question. Have you ever wondered how the shopkeepers tell you the exact amount before your fancy calculators do? Or when you have to get tiles for a wall or floor the shopkeeper can tell you the exact no. Of tiles to be fitted? They can do this because they have been doing it for so long now its very easy for them. I am not telling you that you have to practice that much but just a little hard work pays off. I would like to share my own story. So in my class 10 (board year its very valuable in india) i was not too worried about math. I used to make registers but slowly stopped. I didn't even open my math book at home. And sure enough when half yearly came i had no idea what to do. I was a mess. Somehow gave the exam went home crying.. Ended up with 50 on 80( i know its not bad but for someone who never got below 67 in math it was a great deal) my percentage also decreased. S OK i started my first ever tuition at my school teacher's hous only( i never had a tuition till class 10) she knew i was bright and i can do it. With only 4 months left for preboards she taught me whole syllabus of the year and i worked real hard i had never filled a register in a whole month but started finishing one every 15 days. And sure enough praticed well. Hardwork does payoff. Got 76 out of 80 due to sone minor error which i realised just after handing the paper in. But 76 is also great. Just gave my boards now and waiting for results. Hopefully will score 100 in math. So this was to tell you that hard work does help. Hope my answer helped... Signing off ",

As far as I know, here are some of the methods: Practice daily until you are familiar with the topics and understood each and every bit of it. Remember, all the topics you learn are equally important and correlated to each other. So, you cannot skip any topic that doesn't interest you (especially in basics of mathematics). Don't practice blindfolded, meaning, you have to make sure that whatever you practice is correct( perfect practice makes man perfect- as said by one of my math professor himself).Make a quick note after every equation that describes the equation, which is nothing but putting those equations into sentences.Ask your teachers, friends or anybody who can help you. You should be clear with the topic. Discuss with your friends about the topic. Sometimes your assumption may be wrong, by discussing you will be sure that you have learnt a topic correctly.Self evaluate yourself regularly. After you learn a topic, you can take up a test and start solving few problems that you never solved before. Be honest to yourself while evaluating, point out all the mistakes you did (even the smallest), you can give yourself a percentage of perfection in that topic. You can figure out the scope of improvement and practice accordingly.Conclusion Once you start developing interest in mathematics, you shall excel. MK ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone can learn math whether they're in higher math at school or just looking to brush up on the basics. After discussing ways to be a good math student, I want to show you the basic progression of math courses and will give you the basic elements that you'll need to learn in each course. 1.Show up for class. When you miss class, you have to learn the concepts either from a classmate or from your textbook. You'll never get as good of an overview from your friends or from the text as you will from your teacher. Come to class on time. In fact, come a little early and open your notebook to the right place, open your textbook and take out your calculator so that you're ready to start when your teacher is ready to start.Only skip class if you are sick. When you do miss class, talk to a classmate to find out what the teacher talked about and what homework was assigned. 2. Work along with your teacher. If your teacher works problems at the front of your class, then work along with the teacher in your notebook. Make sure that your notes are clear and easy to read. Don't just write down the problems. Also write down anything that the teacher says that increases your understanding of the concepts.Work any sample problems that your teacher posts for you to do. When the teacher walks around the classroom as you work, answer questions.Participate while the teacher is working a problem. Don't wait for your teacher to call on you. Volunteer to answer when you know the answer, and raise your hand to ask questions when you're unsure of what's being taught.3. Do your homework the same day as it's assigned. When you do the homework the same day, the concepts are fresh on your mind. Sometimes, finishing your homework the same day isn't possible. Just make sure that your homework is complete before you go to class. 4. Make an effort outside of class if you need help. Go to your teacher during his or her free period or during office hours. If you have a Math Center at your school, then find out the hours that it's open and go get some help.Join a study group. Good study groups usually contain 4 or 5 people at a good mix of ability levels. If you're a \"C\" student in math, then join a group that has 2 or 3 \"A\" or \"B\" students so that you can raise your level. Avoid joining a group full of students whose grades are lower than yours.",

            "answer_text": "Make a habit or spending 15 distraction free minutes a day with a pen, a notebook, a calculator and a math book. In addition to that, read riddle books and solve at least five problems daily while walking or whenever you are bored. Look around; math is logic that can be applied. Think constructive procrastination.     Start with self-help books like Math DeMystified and Idiot's Guides. Use them to get a feel for algebra, geometry and calculus. After you are at ease with the preliminaries, move onto introductory college textbooks for the same subjects and read them in depth. Once you can understand standard notation and solve most college math problems within two minutes, study books on different branches of math that interest you or that complement your mathematical abilities. When you have a good grasp of the basics, start studying graduate level math and reading math journals. Finally, move onto doctoral math and write papers. Finally, submit your work for publication, compete in math competitions and write books. Note:    Books can be found online for free and curriculum books from Asia are fairly affordable and cover the same material that western textbooks do.    The more problems you can solve, the better. Sometimes, having an idea of how to solve a problem is more important than getting the right answer.     It is a slow process, but within a few years, you should be able to handle thick stuff like statistical mechanics (Einstien's theories/ theoretical physics) and non linear dynamics at an advanced level.   Youtube, Edx and Coursera, etc. have lecture videos and course content that you may find useful. ",

Sit back and relax, tell your maths book you love it. Now open the first page of the chapter ( you wish to learn) start understanding. ( Usually maths chapters give you a brief up of the concept\u2019s history or derivation, either of the one is given for the child\u2019s curiosity to build up.) Take a note of the formula you learn , continue and then start solving examples. Understand the logic, once you get them, you get the answers of all the questions. Some questions are pure application of formulas. Don't think that you're wasting ( it's taking a lot of time) your time in understanding, it's crucial and important. This is what I used to do, since I couldn't learn all the formula at once. I used to write them on a white sheet, remember once then paste it on the almirah, once a day , one look, at once in my mind in one week (at max) . You have the formulas in your mind, congrats! The second step is crucial since it has to be done without cheating, take the book, challenge yourself to complete the exercise once you go through the formulas. Keep the sheet handy, once you use the formula, you'll learn it. Once the chapter is done, you've had learned it and would be searching for more such books to apply your understanding, not your learning. Learning is restricting yourself, understand Assumption : You've chosen maths, now finding it difficult to keep pace with it. This is not a time to worry, it was your choice, your interest, this simply means you have the capability. Go through the same procedure above, understand your topics well, learn to experiment ( you know what I mean) , practice, and you will love, understand, learn \u2026maths. Use your understanding of logic to multiple questions. In both the cases, practising is a must at first. Hardwork, determination comes along. The will to study deeper will also come once you will love it. Don't be afraid to ask your doubts. Never, maths teachers know them. They criticise first ( sometimes, so you apply your own mind first before asking) ( I do it with my younger brother when I know it is simply a doubt marked with a pen because he hasn't used his mind yet) But they teach you brilliantly after that ( So do I) \u263a\ufe0f Once you have learned MATHS, do let me know. Please do ask if anything particularly is not letting you \u201clearn\u201d MATHS. ",

What are the different parts of math. 2: determine your scope Now that you have gotten a grasp of math you can then choose what part you would like to study. Keep it smallish at first 3: define success what is your goal 4. Find recourses Literally just go on the internet or something. Websites,books,courses even a friend. 5. Set up a learning plan Split your goal up into modules. eg if you were learning arithmetic, split it up into addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bigger numbers and so on. 6. Filter your recourses Now that you know all the things you will be doing through your learning plan, you can get rid of any of the recources that you clearly won't need. Step 7 through 10 must be repeated through each module. 7. Learn enough to get started This essentially means, get the bare minimum understanding of the module you are learning so that you can get by with applying it 8. Play around You need to use the tools that you have learnt to use ever so slightly and begin asking questions. (For maths this could be taking out a calculator and adding numbers or working them out on a book) 9. Learn enough to do something useful Now that you have just been playing around, I'm sure you have developed quite a few questions. This when is when you fill in all the gaps in your knowledge. 10. Teach someoneAfter filling in the gaps from your perspective, it's time to share your knowledge with someone else. This provides many benefits: It allows you to see if you missed anything while explainingIt may cause everything to click and you to see the full pictureThe person you are teaching may uncover gaps that you weren't aware ofMake sure you repeate 7\u201310 with every module. This is an awesome learning process that really helped me and hundreds of others through their learning. Goodluck!! ",

            "answer_text": "Earlier on in life, I didn\u2019t like maths/didn\u2019t think they could do it and now having gained an understanding in high school level maths I am hungry for more. Reflecting on what changed, I can answer this. All harder maths is based on knowing these things inside out: Times tables. Memorise them. Knowing that 8 \u00d7 9 = 72 or that 8 \u00d7 6 = 48 without working it out in your head or using a calculator frees your mind to focus on the concept. It means that upon seeing 8x(9y - 6z) you very easily turn it into 72xy -48xz without much stress. Knowing your times tables also means that any number that\u2019s at least under 144 can be easily broken into its factors. Also, memorise the numbers 1- 15 squared and cubed. The same applies to adding and subtracting. You should never waste time working out what single digit numbers add up to. Just know that 9 + 8 = 17 because it just does. Memorise how positive and negatives work: 2 positives have a positive result. +2 +(+2) = 4, 2 negatives have a positive result. -2 -(-2) = 0 Mix a positive and negative together. Negative wins. +2 +(-2) = 4, +2 -(+2) = 2, Learn to look at the equal sign as having two different things either side that mean the same thing. Maths is a language. 2 + 2 = 4. 2 \u00d7 2 = 4. 16 / 4 = 4. Everything to the left of the previous equal signs is just one of many ways to say 4. Given the infinite quantity of numbers and many different mathematical symbols, there\u2019s an infinite number of ways to express 4 or any number. Understand that adding and subtracting, multiplication and division, and squaring and square root and the same things in reverse. You turn any of those functions into its opposite just by moving it to the other side of the equal sign. 7 \u00d7 8 = 56. Move the \u201c\u00d78\u201d from the left to the right and it becomes \u201c\u00f78\u201d 7 = 56 \u00f7 8. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot more to maths that just those concepts but many things that come later have those concepts hidden inside them in one form or another. Get a good book and drill these concepts to the point that they become laughably easy to you. If you did half an hour a day you could have these concepts down in 6 months. Ask someone who\u2019s good at maths* to explain what you don\u2019t understand. *My current maths teacher at college is really good at breaking things down. I\u2019ve had some terrible maths teachers at school that would ridicule students for not understanding things. Many people just say they\u2019re not good at it but it\u2019s probably because it causes them anxiety. If you\u2019re feeling anxious you can\u2019t think logically and mathematical thinking only uses logical thinking. ",

            "answer_text": "161075Martin White gives good advice about this.That is to say, it seems very sound. Actually ,apart from Paul who seems somehow bewildered by it all, everyone of the eight other answers i\u2019ve viewed is a plus for you. A plus, get it. ++++++ I\u2019m kind of wondering about Archimedes\u2019 answer. And why a Greek, of all people, would ask a question about math. But then the AGs were more into philosophy and theatre which are probably more important. However, when the gods allow war, someone has to keep track of the dates and bodycounts. So you might well be better off asking an historian. Or maybe someone who works in Banking or on Wall street. But you are asking me. Which means that you might think I\u2019m some kind of oracle. If i am it\u2019s only because the gods are \u2026..well, perhaps, pleased or amused with my answers. They might be turning me into Tiresiias which explains why i\u2019m going blind. Which is, as best as I understand things, is so much better than being a sexual deviant as gaysod, it is tantamount to being blest! Because, still as best as I understand things, they were given a golden opportunity to redeem themselves, but for sone strange, more likely implaccable perverse, reason they failed to grasp it or just simply didn\u2019t want to because they had or have what they believe is an air/water tight alibi, defense, scapegoatt excuse for being a sicko sod. I should point out that i personally am not prejudiced against them. I personally have known some very nice gays, but maybe they were simply created to make it all appear to me that gay was the only thing to be, especially if you wanted to live in a nice type of world and not a horribl.e violent one. But when i think about that virus that almost wiped them out, i can only conclude that if you really are pro life, this is not the sort of thing you should be. Same goes for hetero diseases. When i think of horses i think of the horse flu that almost wiped out the racing industry, but that might also have had something to do with gay. Or some other type of ungoodly, and therefore unhealthy, behaviour. There are more unpleasant thoughts occurring to me, (who never actually thinks about gays, despite the fact that they actually rent a room in the same house as me and make their presence all so very obvious) about the inevitability of death when it comes to gaysods or analsexperts if you prefer. It is just a thought, but there are some reports/sources that have led me to believe that some of them, if not all, are going to end up with their throats cut and trashed at some garbage landfill dumpsite. Here\u2019s where the scapegoat excuse enters into things. And that idiotic Mozart laughter thing they do, if the guy who wrote Armadeus gave true to life character depicction. laughing like an idiot can be ,i expect, regarded by many as somehow eccentric, if not deranged, and therefore definitely not someone who can be held accountable for their actions, This, of courrse,means that they cannot be held responsible for their obscenities and suggests that they were simply the creation of perhaps an irresponsible society, or one that took no interest in their sexxual development and deviations / inclinations. They might also be trying to blame drugs ( and therefore the suppliers) like marijuana because that drug apparently possesses the power to render the one partaking of it, a feeling of euphoria which can perhaps in a lot of cases, turn into uncontollable laughter at almost everything. But I\u2019m not so sure it can turn you into a deviant. But if drugs and the mind altering effects of them are their defense, they might be clutching at straws. Apparently some drugs can alter your thinking, but they can't turn you into a gay. I expect that if gay equates with happiness then marijuana can make you appear gay. But i think it\u2019s a seduction that makes a person want to be gay. It\u2019s definitely sexual. I would have thought that that virus would have deflated their enthusiasm. Apparently it brought their\u2026.er\u2026.fun and games ( fag) to a resounding state of something akin to awareness that there are still deadly consequences, even if the nukes don't fly. Later it occurred to me\u2026Queens. Apparently these creatures will do anything to each other and anyone who gets involved with them, Hell, when they\u2019re up in arms theyll even involve kids especially if that child has or will inherit something they want. When it comes to all\u2019s fair in love and war it\u2019s very possible that these creatures wrote the book on skullduggery and underhanded tactics to get what you want. I\u2019m not singling them out for special attention, but wait, why not? Maybe it is just evil or really desperate type queens/kings/rulers who resort to horrible. I guess it can always be justified somehow. Consider that every Queen and maybe king wants absolute power. For what reason\u2026very possibly the belief they are born to rule. And very possibly, to avoid revenge, in the form of avenging angels perhaps who have seen one of their kind abused terribly in cruel attempt to turn them into drug crazed killers. Something to do with God vs devil, Cath vs CoE. Anyone more popular than themself has to be discredited somehow. Especially someone who can make formidable babies that can be used against them. Best way to eliminate this threat might be to assume that threat\u2019s identity and rape someone which will result in creating a questionable character of the threat at the very least. After the rape, the rapist goes back to the gay world which was created by the queens. No one believes a queer is capable of rape so no one accuses/suspects them, But one would think the victim knows who her/his rapist is. Yes, one would. But this need not be the case, especially if the rapist wears s the threat\u2019s personality perfectly . This sort of thing happened in ww2 with General Montgommery apparently. They are called dopplegangers. Near perfect duplicates. As far as i\u2019m led to believe, rape is real. And as best as i understand things, some girls, as mean type girls, will have rivals for a certain guy they\u2019ve set their sights on, but not necessarily their heart on, raped. To me this is unbelievable. As for kings, who perhaps are less inclined to employing underhanded tactics to get what they want, apparently there have been cases of kings raping or bedding people of their kingdom whenever the urge was upon them, I know that this might sound flippant but one can only wonder if they kept count or score. Later it occurred to me that the sexual exploits of the king is most likely to do with creating more children who will grow up to maintain and safeguard the kingdom. And anyone good at arithmath, as in counting and keeping count becomes, it seems logical to consider the possibility, a count. Which means you are looking for a title. I think you\u2019ll most probably need the noble blood as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Start from scratch, get hold of your school Math books, if you still have them. If not go to your local library. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is child's play. 10 years is a long time, you will need to repair the foundations. Once you get up to where you left off, keep following the syllabus that would be normally taught to kids in your part of the world before they left to pursue Science or Maths ( so called STEM) subjects in college. Go for the actual Maths, not Math literacy. Once you are done with that, and it will take quite some time to get there. The choice to proceed or not is up to you. Maths beyond school level such as Multivariable Analysis/Calculus, Matrix and Linear Algebra, Modern Algebra, Topology etc. demand extensive study and there is no single right path which you can follow. Since you have been studying Music, I suggest taking a look at the fields of Maths most closely related it. So pay special attention to Trigonometry since musical notes can be represented in terms of trigonometric functions. To look for patterns, look up Group Theory, a very abstract field with surprisingly real world applications. ",

They can guide you the best.In the same way as a personal trainer is better than training on your own, so can be a good math teacher. 2.  If there is no teacher in your area, look at khanacademy or ALEKS -- Assessment and Learning, K-12, Higher Education, Automated Tutor, Math  Both are known for great courses.  KhanAcademy is free, ALEKS costs $20 a month. 3.  Whatever you do, the most important thing is to practice daily and deliberately.  That is not simply a \"common sense notion\" or old wives tale; but, research that I can supply (bj80klunder@outlook [dot] com) shows that daily practice trumps over more massed practice.  Deliberately (cf. research by K. Anders Ericcson) shows that it is the number one factor in improving performance, even more than intelligence. It is one thing to practice very hard for a day or a few days, another to make a daily commitment to do it over and over again (as an example, look at why so many weight loss diets fail).  That applies as much to you as it does to me or anyone else. 4.  Of course, I love educational consulting.  Feel free to talk to me at bj80klunder@outlook [com] or visit Joe Klunder - International 4-subject teacher \u2013 Joe Klunder is an international who has taught in 5 countries. He teaches 4 subjects: English as a Second Language, Language Arts, History and Geography. for more details. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was younger, I did not like studying math at all. I used to run away whenever my mom asked me any math questions. Over the years, I tried my best to learn as much math as possible, and I am currently learning math at a high grade level. As a young kid, I was put into extra mathematics lessons outside of school. The program focused more on problem-solving skills rather than just memorizing concepts. Later on, I started self-learning concepts as well as taking online courses. What I found out was that self-learning allowed me to absorb the material in the best way possible - I could speed up and slow down the rate of my learning to fit my needs. In terms of websites that I found helpful to learn math, I would suggest using KhanAcademy or Purple Math to start learning precalculus topics. However, I used KhanAcademy to self-study for the AP Calculus AB exam and I did well.  Image Credits: Google When learning math, it is important to always practice applying the theoretical concepts learned. I found that no matter how much I thought I understood a concept, I always absorbed it better by doing practice problems to test my knowledge. Always ask for help if needed - my math teachers were very supportive of my learning math outside of school and helped me out with concepts if I didn\u2019t understand them (even if they were outside the curriculum). Finally, no matter how hard a question is, always persevere to find the answer. Thinking creatively and working hard is the key to solving difficult math problems. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite a few answers\u2026 I\u2019ll give my two cents anyway. People talk being good at math, but the thing is, you can be good at math and not understand it, simply because of the way schools are structured. So if you\u2019re looking for understanding, here\u2019s the answer. To understand mathematics is like understanding a philosophical position or idea. You have understand how and why something is logical. Mathematics, like all forms of study, utilizes logic to form conclusions. Mathematics, to put it simply, is the study of models and patterns. That\u2019s why there\u2019s more than one way to view a situation in math and why numbers can be used in different ways and represent different things. For example, 0/0 in most cases is undefined, but some situations, it makes sense for it to equal one (at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard) and is used accordingly. Another example is infinity, many don\u2019t consider it as number, but that\u2019s actually false. It is a number, but like 0/0 and imaginary numbers, it\u2019s only used in certain situations. To understand mathematics, you have to understand why each theorem is true and why each axiom is appropriate. In summary, in order to understand mathematics, you must analyze the conclusions. Find out why they make sense. And if they don\u2019t, who knows, maybe you can be the one who corrects it. So far in my journey, I haven\u2019t found any errors. At least in the more simple math topics. If anything, I\u2019m still asking questions and trying to find answers. I haven\u2019t found any good reason to say something is false and should be fixed. But that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t analyze the material for yourself. You understand it, at least not fully, if you don\u2019t analyze the material. ",

At its core, Math entails and necessitates a thorough understanding of each and every variable, and their inter-relationship, in the formulas and equations. You also need to spend an inordinate amount of time to understand and work on the proofs, in most instances. In class, you simply need to pay attention to all the worked examples as shown by your lecturer or professor on the white board, or from your textbook, and then you put your acquired knowledge into your solution working, covering a myriad variety of new problems given in class by your lecturer professor, or taken out from your textbook, all on your own.

Morrow (1970), p. 57. \u1f00\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2 \"road, trail, track\" here takes the more specific sense of \"short cut\". The Latin translation is by Francesco Barozzi, 1560)One thing I have found is that some textbooks are easier to understand than others. If a particular textbook, even the one you are using in a course, seems confusing, go to the library and look at the same material presented by a number of different authors. You have a good chance of finding one that communicates the ideas to you in a way that you more easily understand.Others may strongly disagree with this next point. I have found that Schaum's guides, or other, similar books with a collection of solved problems related to what you are doing, is helpful, rather than simply seeing the derivation of fundamental relationships that is often presented in textbooks without sample problems (or only trivial problems). Also, the internet is a tool that became available only shortly after I finished my undergraduate education. I think it is a great resource for finding various presentations of the same material. Many ebooks are now available for free, in addition to sites like these where others may direct you to relevant material. I have never looked at videos such as those available through sites like Khan Academy, but you might consider those, as well. It is unfortunate that most course material is presented far too quickly, and you may find that you just muddle through the courses, only to understand the material years later when you go through it at a leisurely pace without the stresses of impending homework assignments, exams, and a set of other courses.  Looking back, it seems that a full-time suite of courses every semester is just too much to ask for developing a thorough understanding. ",

I don\u2019t recall saying I cheated on my math exams\u2026 Good Luck. Disclaimer: I don\u2019t recommend cheating, and I actually can proudly say I never cheated in my education and only said that for comedy purposes. But I honestly think that there is no easy way to understand math, just like there is no short cut to learning anything. Math can be a very brilliant subject. Those who study it have a great amount of intellect and can do great things with that knowledge If you are struggling with your math education, I recommend that you take it slow and go back to the basics. When I studied Calculus in high school, the best thing in helping me understand the concepts was to often go back to square one and understand the basics and build my foundation upwards. Math is a cumulative subject. Your foundation helps you understand the more difficult concepts. If you are struggling with math, maybe you were struggling at a much earlier time and need to fix your earlier concepts first. Khan Academy is a great resource for self-tutoring videos. Make sure to communicate with your teachers, mentors, parents and friends too. Good Luck! ",

I was playing on the roof of my home And We're playing cricket to be honest  But Because of certain misunderstandings created there a fight was started between me and my friend and I got my arm fractured Anyways after three months i got recovers and the class of 8th was just started that time And there was a exam called NTSE is held in India IN 8TH class that time but now it is held in 10th class So there were many students my friends who started preparing for it And Due to jelousness you know i also started studying NO MATTER MY MATH WAS ENOUGH WEEK But what i did was very impressive I did the whole book of mathematics class 8th just in 10 Days without any help That doesn't seems to be a big deal but TBH it is It is very difficult for a boy who was very poor in maths And those 10 days changed my life Now i was able to solve any 8th level problem I mean very hard problems too Without joining any coaaching institute So what i want to say is Do math yourself If you are not able to get the answer of problem Do it again again and again Do it 100 time if possible do it even 1000 times but never ask anyone for the solution And Do it just 20 Days I am sure your mathematics will be like mineYou can directly contact me vivek.sindhwani503@gmail.comif you have any more queriesThank YouVivek Sindhwani ",

            "answer_text": "This is the best \"secret\" I learned about doing better in Maths - and I got it quite late, when I was in Grade 12. I share this with most students I teach, either teaching them Maths, Science or Physics.  The main thing I learned from that teacher was I had to form a habit/routine to study the subject every day. I have written a few pieces on the subject and this is one bit:  SECRET TO STUDYING MATHS A Grade 12 Maths teacher influenced some of us to appreciate this subject and later pursue studies which are related to it.  The late Mrs K. M. George from Kerala, India, taught us the most important habit that is essential in mastering concepts in the subject. (I count that as one of the most important life-lessons that I learnt from a teacher.)    She said decades ago: \u201cIf you want to do well in Maths you must spend at least one hour a day on Maths work\u201d. When I heard that, I was shocked because I, like most people, spent only 20 minutes a day on Maths. But I could spend more time on other things \u2013 like reading a book. With her urging us, I tried her method and found that it worked.  Nobody would master concepts learnt in class if s/he spent only 20 minutes studying those daily. It has got to be one hour or more.  With Mrs George, I learnt that I was not studying Maths properly for the first 11 years of my school life.  I learned that I needed to fit in a one-hour daily routine to study Maths.    NOTE: It does not matter if you are studying Algebra, Geometry or Calculus - just ensure you put in the one hour daily going over notes, correcting mistakes in exercises, doing exercises and summarizing material for you to easily assimilate later on. If you can do that, you would definitely improve your marks in Maths.  ",

            "answer_text": "I'll give you the simplest answer which would require tremendous efforts from your side. Maths isn't any normal subject like your regular examples of Chemistry, Biology, Physics and what not. Maths is a language, it is the language of the universe. Using this simple analogy you'd find it easier to study math. Allow me to clarify;Take French for instance, inorder to learn the language (if you're not already familiar to it) you must apply what little you've learnt from rules and vocabulary by practicing French regularly and gradually you'll develop. Maths is similar. It requires practice. Learn the rules and apply them by solving questions almost instantly. And the more questions you solve the better you'll be. Keep practicing and you'll gradually develop. It may seem pointless at first when you dont understand the why? and how? things add up in maths, But hey! The same goes for French or any other language. At first you dont understand the why? and how?. But if you wish to learn the subject you must learn the rules first and practice what you've learnt regularly. In time when you've gained a certain degree of skill in the language, ask yourself the questions of why? and how? things came to be, and to your amazement you'll know the answer. Now isn't this right?...I tell you this out of experience. I had difficulties with the subject and I did fail a countless number of times but I kept going and I kept practicing. Now Im able to read mathematical equations like they were sentences in English.I've begun to admire maths. And to be honest its truly a beautiful subject. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat is the best way to learn math? How can I learn math more effectively?\u201d I suggest you learn a lot about how to study first, then start to learn math. Study is actually a subject, it is not a few tips or suggestions on how to take notes, how \u201cto listen\u201d, or someone saying everyone learns differently, or how to memorize some things. Life could be considered to be a game. Where a game consists of freedoms, purposes and barriers. What are the \u201cfreedoms\u201d, \u201cpurposes\u201d and \u201cbarriers\u201d of the subject of study? How do you make life and the subject of study a happier game to play? A slave confined in chains below ground to a silver mine, or to a cotton field, or to increasing debt working in a coal mine may definitely feel he or she is not very \u201cfree\u201d to learn anything they wish. A student may feel he or she is not as \u2018free\u2019 to learn as they might wish. A suicidal person may feel they have no reason or purpose, to live. A student that has no reason, or purpose, to learn something is not likely to learn much about it. But what if they had a strong personal reason to learn it? If there is no purpose, there is not much fun in the game called \u2018study.\u2019 What if you new the exact \u2018barriers\u2019 to study, how to recognize them, and how to avoid or handle them? It is quite a different level of game if you know the rules of the game. Here is a principle from the subject of study: A student must have a purpose for what he or she studies. This is also a barrier to study. Just as a suicidal person may have no reason to live, a student with no reason to learn something will not be successful. So a student can learn this principle and create his or her own reason to learn something. He can ask, \u201cHow can I use this in life?\u201d Each answer is a reason to learn it. Each answer is a purpose. What if a person learns his basic purpose in life? He or she could then relate each thing they study to their basic purpose, or what they most want to do in life. That would be a whole new kind of game to play, wouldn\u2019t it? Here is a link to beginning course on how to study, called the The Basic Study Manual, and the Extension Course for that book: Basic Study Manual Once you know a little more about how to study you might want to ask yourself, \u2018How do people use math in life?\u2019 I suggest doing demos of this. Use little pieces of things like coins or keys, or paper clips and rubber bands. Do each demo to another person, like you are teaching this idea to young child. Then test yourself. Check if the other person fully understands what you intended. This is a Self Check you can do with any concept you are learning. Good luck on your studies and please let me know how you are doing.

In many schools (and university), mathematics is taught as a series of, apparently unconnected, algorithmic problems to solve through drill and routine. Mathematics is much more than routine problem solving. But to really appreciate the joy of mathematics, you need to appreciate and understand mathematical proofs. To do so, see if you can actually reconstruct a proof from memory, that way you will know that you really understand it. Studying mathematics is motivated by the enjoyment of rediscovery or rediscovery. You need not only need to learn how proofs work, but you will also need excellent intuitive skills to guide you. In summary, mathematics is all about understanding, intuition and reconstructing proofs. Such fun! ",

Being a STEM major student in the U.S has proven me that to succeed in my classes I have to strive for my own knowledge, and make sure I have my concepts clear even when I do my homework. The basic objective of doing homework is to increase our knowledge and improve our abilities at doing something. If this is the case, why do we take so long completing our homework every now and then? Sometimes I\u2019m tempted to leave some excersices untouched because I don\u2019t understand the topic very well and I believe they are not relevant to the class, but it is an unpleasent surprise to see them pop on my exams. I hate feeling that I could have done better if I gave 15 more minutes to understanding the topic better. I\u2019m too conscious about my grades, so even when I have a question about a topic -even if the topic is not relevant, I ask or research on my own to eliminate any doubts. However, I uderstand why for some other students this can be frustrating. Information is available in the web, but it\u2019s all over the place, and to be able to find something related to the question or find something that actually helps to understand the problem better might take more than the time we have available for the assignment. I don\u2019t blame them. In fact, it is common to see students getting stuck when doing their homework, -even after they attended class. Frustrated, they decide to skip the problem most of the time.We live in a very fast-pase environment. Students have other responsabilities, and they can\u2019t spend all their time in ONE assignment for ONE class. It is likely though that, if we don\u2019t understand a problem given in the homework, our second chance to face that same problem is on a midterm or even on a final.

            "answer_text": "I would just share my story.  Till class 10th I used to be a regular student in maths as 85% students in india(I never bothered to understand the beauty of math - the most creative art). I passed class 10th with 9.2 cgpa.  At this point I thank different from everyone , my friends moved to kota but I did'nt because I felt I would need to compete to learn ( I heard from many students that after 2nd batch they just give you losts of problem so that your skill develop , but I knew I am a slow learner I would not survive at kota and would engage in some other activities , so i ended up with the decision of staying home and just going for a board class tution in my hometown). Then the most popular jee race started - The first two chapters of maths sets and functions - i did the way I used to learn till 10th( due to parents pressure I used to mug up things rather than understanding and this inertia continued) . Then started the chapter trigonometry - I don't know why but this chapter impressed me a a lot , in my tution class uor techer told to write all the formulas on a sheet of paper and use it while solving the trigonometry problems . At starting it was very tough for me to solve a question but I noticed aone thing that the question is created in such a way that you have to find out which formula fits better - it was same as I am having a dish on table with pasta now just I have to searh which spoon(here fork) would be best to eat( problem as a dish and formulas as bunch of spoons) , then just I started enjoyed solving problems , I used to  approach the problem differently. Now I find myself at a better place in maths , my skills ,thinking and creativity has improved which only I can know no one else. Now I use to do math every day for atleast 3hrs - I don't know why but I get  a satisfaction. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Just imagine when you start a car it resists i.e you need to accelerate it - the same is with every object . The same is with many of us till 10th we mostly bother just about marks and just do to get a good rank in class but the effect you can see know(the one you are suffering now) . So just take a deep breathe try to stuydy first basics , ask questions to youself why the thing is so , start enjoying it you will firstly feel the heat but then after a point of time you will get a satisfaction by doing math Life is an open book full of blank pages, you write your story as  you go. But remember don't let anyone else hold the pen, while writing  your story ! Life is awesome, Just feel it and live to the fullest ! try to see this - https://brilliant.org/profile/sandeep-125d73/sets/some-lovely-problems/ all the best ",

There is no way to avoid that. There is no easy way to achieve mastery. Time and practice are required. Break down mathematical topics into The objects of interest. (i.e. numbers, sets, symbols,etc.)The subsets of objects with similar character. (integers, rationals, reals,etc.)The defined operations among the objects. (addition, etc.)The rules that define the behavior of the objects. (Associativity, commutativity, etc.)Perform the defined operations on the objects of interest until you are comfortable that you have achieved the desired level of competence. Move on to the next topic. Mathematics beyond computation is a symbolic classification system. Axioms are derived from the classifications, and logic is applied to them to produce new results in the system. Making such logical extensions takes much experience with abstract mathematical systems. This usually requires expert guidance to achieve mastery. ",

However, you need to relearn something when you are not so sure you understand Maths. Firstly, you should know that (almost) all the Mathematical functions and equations include the concept of elementary arithmetic (including trigonometric functions). For details, please refer to Peano axioms - Wikipedia. Of course, some mathematicians suggests that elementary arithmetic is not \u201ccomplete\u201d enough to explain all the things, but it's still ok. Secondly, do you know how to solve an equation? It is just as easy as using a balance. For more details, check out this: Solving Equations. Also, prove everything yourself at least once. This will help you a lot. That's it. P.S. : Be more logical. Never say something like this: \u201dI don't have to prove this one since it's too easy for me!\u201d I always make that mistake when I was young. And here are two more relevant videos:   ",

Your answer to this question will dictate the approach and the depth of learning you require. Depending on your current level, I would start from school books. You will be surprised how useful they are once you are no longer in school and really want to learn maths (rather than being told that you have to). Once you have thoroughly studied and worked through the school course all the way to the top level, you\u2019ll be well on the way to asking yourself another question: What area of maths do I want to concentrate on? In any case, to gain true understanding of a subject one needs to study and spend a lot of time practising and applying the skills. Layering the skills with the new ones and making sure that there is gradual development of knowledge. Mathematics is not something one just happens to understand. It requires development of a way of thinking about numbers and problems and takes time to train your brain. Good luck! ",

You can use addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. Here\u2019s how my friends and I played: You flip the card over and the first to say \u201cMath 24\u201d has to share how they achieved 24 using all 4 numbers. If they messed up, they are no longer eligible to win this card. Whoever does win the card gets the number of points specified by the difficulty of the card. This is represented by the number of dots present on the card, where the difficulty ranges from 1\u20133 (the above card is a 2). For example, the above card\u2019s solution is: 9\u22126=3 6+2=8 8\u22173=24 There may be multiple answers to a problem, but so long as you achieve 24 while abiding by the rules then you\u2019re in the clear.

The importance of maths for students has never been more prominent. Most the university courses include some level of maths while almost every profession uses maths in some form on a daily basis. The main problem that occurs in many people that how can you learn math. Practice: It is not possible to study maths properly by just reading and listening. To study maths actually, you have to solve some problems. The more you practice answering maths problems, the better. Review error: When you\u2019re practicing with these math problems, it\u2019s important to work through the process for each solution. If you have made any mistakes, you should review them and understand where your problem-solving skills let you down. Master in key concept: If you are practicing more then make yourself in master in problem-solving. It is much better and rewarding, in the long run, to focus on understanding the process and logic that is involved. This will help you understand how you should approach such problems in the future. Hire a Math Tutor: If you are not getting a result then you can hire a Singapore Math tutor for more learning. ",

Maybe it means spending time with a friend who knows her maths.Don\u2019t get discouraged. Maths is hard for everyone, and takes years to learn. In fact, you can never finish learning it. Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you find something difficult to understand.Work with other people. Working with friends makes the whole experience way more fun. This shouldn\u2019t be a slog. Maths can be intensely social.Some specific advice: This is where you start: Khan Academy https://www.khanacademy.org/math. Start at the appropriate place in the Khan Academy course and work your way through it.",

Its in that spot before we opened our eyes, not in the systematic sense but rather in the fundamental sense. A youngster figures the amount to weep for nourishment, and afterward the amount to cry when in agony. Indeed, even an unskilled individual needs to know cost of products on the off chance that he needs to survive (regardless of the possibility that he deals). Presently consider creatures. Indeed, even they need to know how to number! A flying creature needs to make sense of how long will it take to fabricate its home, on the off chance that it doesn't then it won't survive. A predator must have a feeling of what number of steps it ought to be behind its prey and the amount of constrain it needs to apply on the ground so it can get its prey.  Nature? yes, yet its simply one more name of inherent systematic motor inside living things.  Indeed, even non living things are ruled by science. On the off chance that you glance around and see nature itself demonstrates how critical scientific comparisons are. We toss a stone and its administered by the comparison of parabola! What's more, who does not know the stunning event of Fibonacci arrangement in nature! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Ive sat and passed many maths exams in my younger days\u2026.some were difficult to pass and looking back I am almost certain that was because of my poor exam prep. When I was at Uni I studied applied and pure maths. I found the applied maths highly interesting and in the main..easy. The Pure maths I found a real uphill struggle because it was presented from first principles and my brain tended to fog up trying to make sense of it all. Now when it came to the final exams you would logically think that I would breeze through the applied maths and just scrape the pure! WRONG, I got a second for my applied whereas I got a First for my Pure. Now I hear you all asking How was that? I will now answer your original question, \u2018what is the best way to pass a maths exam?\u2019 For the applied I had good assignment marks but fell down in the final exam BECAUSE I didnt prepare correctly. I didnt look at any past exam papers just flicked through my notes and did a few text book examples and thought I would walk it. Now, 8with the Pure maths I was bricking the finals as I really didnt feel as if I knew the subject. In desperation I bought 8 years worth of past papers and began a strategic breakdown of how the questions were laid out. I found in most cases that the various topics were asked in a logical format e.g. 1,2,3 and so on, so I formed a cunning plan\u2026..hmmm, yes I was desperate, scared, had bad guts, didnt sleep etc etc I decided to \u2018pick\u2019 my favourite topics and just concentrate on them first ( I didnt avoid the more yucky topics but put them on the back burner for study at a later date), so I religously went over all the papers, compared similar questions on different papers and repeated this until I could repeat them in my sleep. I know some people will say \u2018but did you understand the topics or was it all done parrot fashion? \u2018 To be honest, it was a bit of both, remember maths is a language and if you want to learn a foreign language what do you do\u2026..you carry out repetition and speak the new words over and over until your brain remembers and saves it. So getting back to the maths I really went to town learning how the 8 pure maths papers were laid out. For example, once you learn how to solve matrices its just a case of practising \u2018exam type\u2019 questions and that way you are in a way \u2018sitting the exam\u2019, albeit you have the backing of your notes to refer to and there are no time limits! When the dreaded day arrives you sit down in the exam room, open the paper, open your eyes and WOW, you see a replica of what was in your past papers\u2026a few number changes but basically the same exam you sat last week and passed with ease. Do you get my point? I would advise all you guys out there to study hard and practise solving examples but to pass the exam there is no better way, in my opinion, than to study past exam papers and in addition if you can get a marking schedule even better then you can see the examiners comments. GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL Alex ",

            "answer_text": "To quote a well known math person to a royal person who asked the same question as this, \u201cThere is no royal road to geometry.\u201d Of course, math people will know the famous math person, but I think the quote itself is sufficient to say there is no \u201ceasier\u201d way to learn math than another. There might be some things a person can do to make the experience less stressful, but most people learn math in about the same manner. Examples; Person A and person B are learning the same math. Say, in the first example, arithmetic. Person A learns that 1 + 1 = 2. Person A doesn\u2019t really have any particular tangential \u201creal world\u201d reference. Such as, if I have an apple and increase this with another apple, then we say I have two apples. This has a little more meaning to the person that just saying 1 + 1 is 2, but you would probably be hard pressed to find someone who didn\u2019t have that kind of a visual idea in mind. Set ahead in mathematics to calculus. It is easier to find people who do not have applicable understanding of concepts at this level. Take a relatively \u201csimple\u201d derivative. For the function f(x) = x^2 (x squared) the derivative fprime(x) = 2x is known by most people who have studied calculus. However, if you have not studied calculus, then you would not know that, and you don\u2019t have much context to place this in. If someone then asks what is the derivative of x^3 one might stumble on the right answer, but stumbling on the derivative on the function sin(x) is unlikely. To understand its derivative if one understand the underneath concept then they simply compute the answer with the underlying concept. Otherwise they struggle. So, one might think there is an \u201ceasier\u201d way to \u201clearn\u201d calculus, but unfortunately there is not. ",

People will try to teach you tips and tricks and stuff, but the truth is you need to figure out a way that works for you and practice it to death. I would like to tell you that there is an easy pedagogical way to always learn math, but my experience in teaching has tought me that nothing works for everyone. I would suggest you figure out the way you learn the best. If its through books and reading, then buy a good basic book. If you need things visualized you can find some great videos online (see e.g. StudyNova where there is a couple of free videos about highschool math). Maybe you need to talk with someone as you learn, in that case you could hire a tutor. In the end the most important thing is that you are willing to learn and to take the time and put in the efford required. In that case you will eventually learn it. Good luck with your effords. :) ",

Once you get interested in something, you can ask for sources about particular topics or find some on your own. You can also solve logical riddles and puzzles and once you solve them, you can think about various modifications and how to correctly adapt the solution - if it is possible. If you enjoy playing with numbers, you could try Diophantine equations (equations were you are only interested in integers as solutions) - you can learn most of you need on the way and if you get stuck, just look up the solution and investigate the new method you have just learnt. If you want to become a mathematician, I would also suggest starting with popular books to get an idea what higher mathematics is about and then learn the subjects by watching university courses on youtube. You could try to read mathematical books, but they are tough to read and take a lot of time (unless you have enough time and interest to do so). ",

If you have the will, and work past this period of from 2 to a couple of years depending on your work-rate, skill set, and other factors, I guarantee if you work properly you will get most concepts.

If you believe you\u2019ve found an easier way to think about it yourself, you need to understand whether it\u2019s genuinely practical or fraught with the possibility of error. It\u2019s also why you need to do all the exercises. Do them carefully, and mindfully, paying attention to the kind of thinking you\u2019re having to do to get them right. Find more exercises to do if your current course material won\u2019t give you enough (I\u2019ve found the \u2018Schaum\u2019s\u2019 books a really good source, and for calculus there\u2019s any number of problem collections).

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is a subject that every student has to study at one time or another. Some love it but if we\u2019re being honest, most people hate studying maths. The importance of maths for students has never been more prominent. Most university courses include some level of maths while almost every profession uses maths in some form on a daily basis. The problem many students have is that they don\u2019t know how to study maths to get good results. Maths is one of those subjects which you can easily spend hours studying but end up none the wiser. However much you have studied, if you can not solve the problem on day of the test, you are lost. Thankfully, there are some techniques for studying maths that you can do regardless of your level. 7 Tips for Maths Problem Solving 1. Practice, Practice & More Practice It is impossible to study maths properly by just reading and listening. To study maths you have to roll up your sleeves and actually solve some problems. The more you practice answering maths problems, the better. Each problem has its own characteristics and it\u2019s important to have solved it in numerous ways before tackling the exam. There is no escaping this reality, to do well in a Maths exam you need to have solved a LOT of mathematical problems beforehand. 2. Review Errors When you\u2019re practising with these problems, it\u2019s important to work through the process for each solution. If you have made any mistakes, you should review them and understand where your problem-solving skills let you down. Understanding how you approached the problem and where you went wrong is a great way of becoming stronger and avoiding the same mistakes in the future. 3. Master the Key Concepts Do not try to memorise the processes. This is counter-productive. It is much better and rewarding in the long-run to focus on understanding the process and logic that is involved. This will help you understand how you should approach such problems in the future. Remember that Maths is a sequential subject so it\u2019s important to have a firm understanding of the key concepts that underpin a mathematical topic before moving on to work on other, more complex solutions which are based on understanding the basics. 4. Understand your Doubts Sometimes you can get stuck trying to solve part of a maths problem and find it difficult to move on to the next stage. It\u2019s common for many students to skip this question and continue on to the next. You should avoid doing this and instead spend time trying to understand the process of solving the problem. Once you have grasped an understanding of the initial problem, you can use this as a stepping stone to progress to the remainder of the question. Remember: Maths requires time and patience to master. It is a good idea to study with a friend who you can consult with and bounce ideas off when trying to solve complex problems. 5. Create a Distraction Free Study Environment Mathematics is a subject that requires more concentration than any other. A proper study environment and a distraction free area could be the determining factor when solving complex equations or problems in geometry, algebra or trigonometry! Studying with music can help create a relaxing atmosphere and stimulate the flow of information. Having suitable background music can foster an environment of maximum concentration. Of course, you should steer clear of Pitbull and Eminem, instrumental music is the best thing in these times. 6. Create a Mathematical Dictionary Mathematics has specific terminology with a lot of vocabulary. We suggest you create Notes or Flashcards with all the concepts, terminology and definitions you need to know. You should include their meanings, some key points and even some sample answers so you can consult them at any time and recap. 7. Apply Maths to Real World Problems As much as possible, try to apply real-world problems when approaching maths. Maths can be very abstract sometimes so looking for a practical application can help change your perspective and assimilate ideas differently. Probability, for example, can be used in everyday life to predict the outcome of something happening and determine whether you want to take a risk such as if you should buy a lottery ticket or gamble. Oh and don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s also important to have confidence in yourself and face the exam knowing that you have prepared properly! ",

            "answer_text": "What I suggest first is identifying what type of Math education you are missing on. There is a big difference between the math you were taught in high school and higher, university-level math. While high school math focuses on very specific applications of very specific subjects, university math focuses on the bigger picture. From your comment, you seem to want to learn university math. I want to study mathematics itself, I want to understand mathematics. Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t many great resources online to learn university math from. If you want to get an intuitive glimpse without needing to devote a lot of time, I suggest watching youtube channels like 3Blue1Brown, Numberphile, Infinite Series. But if you want to learn math in its fully technical and functional way (which is 100 times more satisfying) you should start learning from textbooks and online university courses. platforms like Coursera, edX, and MIT OpenCourseWare have amazing courses that you can learn from, at your own pace. you can also Google \u201c<topic> lecture notes\u201d and find many great learning resources. Be careful with textbooks, though. Sometimes you will fall on a very bad textbook and lose the will to learn. In this case just find another textbook. ",

If you are in school or college or pursuing anything that has math on it tertially, just realize why it's necessary you pass that paper. Secondly, do a lot of practice. Find time and work on your areas of difficulty. Do lots of test papers & exams to determine the areas of difficulty. Also, get some few Friends maybe 3 and form some sort of a discussion group. However, you'll need to have something on you before you dive into discussion groups. These should only polish your knowledge and maybe provide you with easier ways of tackling problems. You should know that there's no easy way with maths. You need to work. (It gets easy as you work) ",

So whats happens here is LOGIC TO LANGUAGE now let me give you a example of that... -1 \u00d7 -1 = +1 ! We always says this! But why what's the logic besides it.... Its simple.... Stand on 0 in a number line Trun left and jump backwards... Heres all you will go to the positive side! So we have said -1\u00d7-1 = +1 \u2026. But whats happiness now a days.. We convert languages to logic! \u2026 So its makes us difficult! To get the logicc.... Teacher's are not teaching the logic because They don't know how to!...... So... Get the logic first... Know which chapter you are readingknow a how it have been discoverd and why?#maths is all about understandings \u2026. tip:-read the questions carefully and think before you solve #practice and practice that will make you better but never over train your brain!

Go to a used bookstore, pick up a textbook that matches your level, and start working your way through the exercises.Master algebra. If you are rusty at algebra, then you will have trouble with most subjects in mathematics. Make sure that you thoroughly understand algebra.Take the time to fully understand one topic before moving on to the next. In mathematics, it is relatively easy to work problems mechanically by following the steps in a textbook. This allows you to work beyond your level, and eventually that catches up to you and everything kind of falls apart. Don\u2019t be too eager to move on to the next topic. It is better to thoroughly understand basic algebra than it is to only partially understand trigonometry.",

You should understand the underlying concepts behind what you are doing. If the concepts are not clear in your mind, it is not easy to solve problems successfully. Practice problems: Study your textbooks and pay attention to the definitions. Then work on any practice problems. Solve extra problems: Practice makes perfect. This applies to math as well. If you have difficulty in solving a problem on a topic, you can improve by reading the definitions again, understanding the concepts, and solving additional problems on the same topic. Advanced mathematics requires moving from the concrete to the abstract scenario. Apply math to real life: Think of real-world examples where you can apply math and consider what math concepts you would need to use in these conditions. A simple real life example is grocery shopping. You need to see the price, figure percentage discount, and calculate the final price. Love what you do: If you love math, you spend extra time and effort to learn more and enjoy more. ",

Like differentiation, first I learnt the rules, then I studied in detail sketching functions, then applications like speed, then I went back to the start of differentiation and retaught myself limits but in more detail with a shallow understanding of everything else.

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. When I was coming up (taught under the old-school model of algorithmic memorization with little concept), I struggled horribly with math. Back-in-the-day, all I knew was that I didn\u2019t learn math in the same way I did everything else, which I excelled it \u2014 even science (until numbers came up). I was (and always have been) good at memorizing basic math facts, formulas, and even long series of numbers (i.e. multiplication tables, the Quadratic Formula, bank acct. numbers, debit/credit card into and such). The thing that caused me to suck at math was the algorithmic memorization (mostly). I couldn\u2019t remember algorithms I didn\u2019t understand. I\u2019m the kind of person that needed to be taught (and understand) something like the Distributive Property BEFORE being introduced to the standard algorithm of multiplication. I work my way through problems, relying heavily on number relationships and mathematical concepts and logic. My brain doesn\u2019t just jump to a standard simply because it exist. Speaking of which, I tend to prefer to do problems outside of the standard algorithms. Part of this stems from the fact that I don\u2019t view numbers as digits \u2014 but for what the numbers represent, if that makes sense. I need to see things in expanded form FIRST in order to transition to \u201cshortcut\u201d methods. I also like to diagram problems and use Area Models and things of this sort. I\u2019m that person that prefers to add to solve a subtraction problem (or typically sees them as positive and negative numbers on a number line) or that views a division problem through the lens of multiplication. If you were to ask me what 255/5 is, I would think, \u201c5 X what = 255\u201d? It depends on the problem and context. I\u2019ve also found that video REALLY quickens the rate at which I learn things. Finally, I would say that I view math as a language (the language of numbers). With the way my brain processes things, I really see no difference between a traditionally-spoken language or even a gestural language like American Sign Language. They are all just different ways to communicate. ",

I thought I was going to do work with Computers anyway and it didn't seem very necessary. To bad I was a Physics major, so every major Physics course I took after that required Calculus. It was hard because I neglected to learn it properly from the start. So I had to catch up. But as I caught up, I found incrementally learning a new concept simpler. Moral of the story is to work at it properly from the start. It is easier to learn it properly, slow and steadily than catch-up later on. ",

So the \u201ceasier\u201d choice to make it \u201clike it\u201d. Start enjoying the process. No matter how much time and effort it takes, master the basic concepts. Getting the foundation strong is fundamental towards success in math. Seek the assistance of your friends or teachers who are gifted in the subject. They will explain it in a manner that makes the learning process more interesting. They will use real life examples that will make it more intriguing. The result is that it improves your analytical and logical ability. It improves your power to reason. It improves your critical thinking. It improves your attitude towards problem solving in life. Isn\u2019t it worth it? Good luck! ",

You may also want to be evaluated for a learning disability, which would help you understand if you have additional obstacles to learning math. If you aren\u2019t having trouble with math, then, strangely, the best way to proceed is not to ask questions like this. I don\u2019t mean by this that you should never optimize the way you learn, but that you will do so by meeting other people who do math and reading about mathematicians, on top of doing lots of problems. Sports can be used as an example. Players watch endless amounts of film so they can understand themselves and other players. But when they get on the field, they have to do it. It\u2019s not passive on the field. So, it\u2019s a balance. ",

            "answer_text": "You should start with a good pre-algebra book.   It will basically be a review of all the math you learned from 1 - 7 grade.   This will give you a good sense of what you do and don't know.   You also need to do exercises for even those things you do know.   This will increase your proficiencies and understanding.   So much of math just builds on top of each other.   Once you've completed the pre-algerbra book from beginning to end, you can move on to algebra, then learn trigonometry.   The next thing you should do is study a basic course in probability and statistics.  After that you'll have to decide if you want to learn more advance math like calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and additional course in probability and statistics. EDIT:I see C.C. Glashaus' answer and up voted it.   Math is more than formulas.  It's about learning how to think in a structured and disciplined way.  Having said that my professor in college of the most advance math class I took in college said something the first day. Math is not a substitute for intuition.  It's there to refine your intuition.

Where you need to start, in my opinion, is your understanding of the structure/progression of mathematics in academia. Arithmetic leads to algebra which leads to geometry which leads to\u2026 as far as you can with a decent amount of effort. Within this find how far your understanding reaches. An example being that you are cofident in your understanding of trig but dont know anything about calc. Once you understand this use it as a path way to learning mathematics. This is what I found useful my first year of college and it really helped me get a better grasp on understanding what a course was about before I took it and why I was taking certain courses for my major. If you do not have a school system that you are learning from khan academy is probably your closest thing to it. ",

Maintain a notebook for the same.Now, over time you need to keep brushing your concepts. That's where that formula notebook and the main notebook will come in handy since you don't need to solve all questions, just the main ones. This saves time and will allow you to work on even tougher problems.  Hope this helps :) ",

Advice: Find a good teacher - whether inside of a classroom or outside of it. Sometimes classroom teachers are too busy to address specific difficulties on concepts, so be humble and seek remediation with a tutor. Mainly, practice hard every day you can. Work problems. And most of all, don\u2019t expect it to be easy. Nothing that provides life-long benefits of a power like mathematical reasoning is \u201ceasy.\u201d ",

That\u2019s my advice, make it play, make it fun, do what you like. Mathematics is an Art that is utterly without limitation. I advise people to have some sort of applied mathematics that they like, preferably tied to art rather than business or science. Do not specialize, study a little bit of different areas of mathematics then take the gems to heart. Something like Computer Game Programming plus Calculus would be enough to understand all of mathematics. It is a big territory though, so only go where you like. Mathematics is an Art that literally translates to following your heart and keeping track of it in some coherent fashion. ",

But maybe my math school teachers were just bad, and you don\u2019t need that. Anyway, I would recommend introductory lectures in higher schools or universities.

The same is true for math.  Go slowly and master one small step, then go on to the next one.  If you try to jump ahead or race through the fundamentals, you will find yourself confused at one point or another -- and if you try to force your way through a concept rather than backing up and learning the more basic concepts that lead to that point, you will find that confusion becoming exponential. For methodology, you could do a lot worse than signing onto Khan Academy and just doing whatever is the next exercise they recommend, for the rest of your life.  Start with their \"counting to ten\" exercise and just work forward until you find something difficult -- then look at hints and watch the videos (and use any outside source you like) until it's no longer difficult, then continue.  It's not fast, but it's *thorough*, and without that, you'll have nothing. ",

Write down stuff that you might want to ask to test a thorough understanding of the concepts and applications. (This step may require several references and more understanding, which is the purpose of this exercise).The above may seem to take more time than usual, but it reduces the time and effort substantially when practiced (not to mention the quality of understanding requiring little revision later).

I read these two books the summer after a difficult first year in college mathematics (but I was a straight A student in chemistry, initially my chosen major). Another recommendation is to see if you can find a teacher that\u2019s effective for you. About halfway through that difficult first year I got lucky and wound up with a couple of better teachers. One teacher in particular was so inspiring that I owe him a great debt. Mathematics itself became inspiring when my mathematical universe expanded into higher and higher levels. Eventually, I switched my major to mathematics (although I also had the credits for a degree in chemistry) and went on to graduate school in mathematics. ",

It depends on how you summarize your chapter. Try to look up for the Feynman technique of learning, I'm sure you'll appreciate it and it will help. Well, you can proceed as follows: (1) Read first the chapter. (2) Do some simple to medium exercises. (3) Read the same chapter again, but this time more intensively and try to think about what you read a bit more. (4) Do the hard exercises. ",

Do you learn better/faster from books or by watching videos (having something explained to you). I know others have already mentioned but KhanAcademy is a pretty good start. I personally would get a book though.  A highschool Algebra book, study the basics from the book and then go online and look up that particular subject to see more examples or different ways to approach the same subject. Good luck and get back to us again when you start learning. I'd really be interested to know how you progress. ",

If you find a few problems too hard, ask your teacher to give you the hint/s to get them solved.    3.I would not ask you to do mathematics day and night. There are more equally important subjects for studies.Whenever you get some time , glance through your math. books, Try to recollect mentally how to solve them .If you cannot recollect the process, just open the exercise book in which you have done it earlier and go through it.  4. Do not be afraid of Mathematics.Take it as easy. Learn to love maths first! ",

Make sure this tutor is well educated in math and experienced with instruction. Be attentive during the sessions. A good tutor will help you discover why something is true for yourself (which in turn helps you better retain and understand it) rather than just telling you something\u2019s true. If, however, you are like most people and could not possibly afford that, the next best way would be to use online software like Khan Academy or IXL and go through each lesson you want to learn until it rates your performance as satisfactory to move on. You may still wish to meet with a tutor weekly to go over the concepts you had more trouble with - or at least talk with a mathematically inclined friend about them. Speed seems important to you, but making sure you do fully understand each concept should be of higher importance in my opinion. ",

Then, when a new topic comes along, figure out how best to teach that to yourself.Try the Life of Fred series.Every day do 20 minutes of Khan Academy exercises (not the videos) to make sure you keep what you have learned. In the math section, set your mission to \u201cWorld of Math\u201d.

Khan Academy and other tutorial lessons and other online sources often have an effective way to teach you what you need to know. Also, if you have an opportunity for study sessions, that is a good opportunity to learn in groups. Of course, pouring over your notes and studying your text and doing your homework assignments is the standard way to learn, which is still a good way to learn for some. I will add one other item and that is to write on 3 by 5 cards maybe a couple of equations or related formulas or a main concept on each card, and review these cards (5 max--so you don't overwhelm yourself)) like 5 minutes before class, and it helps jog your memory.

They are extremely easy to understand, and provide a simple hack to major problems. They also justify the logic behind it. Arun Sharma's qualitative aptitude book for CAT would be very helpful for the same. Also apart from that one should focus more and more on practise as it the only way to succeed in mathematics. It's same as to learn to drive. You know all the mechanism but its just that you will gain confidence only once you practise it and thus practise has no alternative. Hope this helps.

For a mathematician, The aesthetic part of mathematics is essential. A mathematical world borns when we explicit an ensemble of rules, or characteristics, or initial conditions that this world should follow, and then continues with a question; given these rules, what kind of world we are facing? How it works, what beautiful symmetries it hides, what simple closed formulas can describe it in a concise and intuitive way? Pi-Greco is not a truth, is a way to acquire knowledge about circular things, and the map is not the territory. It happens that a mathematical world gives us some important answers about the real world and its mechanics but this is only a fascinating and beautiful mystery, not a religious belief. It is just a fact. We and the bees, we both look for wonderful flowers. ",

Do yourself a favour and utilise that document. That said, you cant learn driving without actually sitting in the driver seat and turning the steering wheel. Practice questions are especially important to reinforce concepts and theories. Else, these concepts and theories would be lost.

I have recently learned I have a specific learning disability based on a portion of comprehension, that 'caused' a huge section of my learning to be very tough, (Grade 6) and I can fix that issue.  I tell you this to ensure that there is no other reason for your struggles so that you don't compound the issue at hand.Additionally, I have learned that music is based on mathematical principles so there may be a way, as mentioned by Mr. Ghosh below, to put your previous study to use.  I understand your fascination, as I too find mathematics to be an enigma I must solve.  Music, art and maths are universal communication methods, what could be more important to know? ",

It started about 10 years ago, when I was in my mid-40s, and I can\u2019t shake it - so I teach myself as I go along. That said, I seldom learn more math than I need to understand at a fairly basic level the problem I\u2019m interested in. That\u2019s because I think about solutions in a different way than most people do. My principle for learning and for solving is Occam\u2019s Razor - I\u2019m a minimalist.

Mathematics usually scares each and every child (even I was scared of Maths in my School) as it is not one day's practice! You need to practice every day if you want to score good! Instead of scoring good marks, understand the concepts clear, write down the formulaes, practice the formula daily, and then you can see the results!! So there is just one thing you can do to learn Maths faster, practice it daily at least half an hr to one hr!! And trust me, you will learn faster and your marks too will shoot up! ",
