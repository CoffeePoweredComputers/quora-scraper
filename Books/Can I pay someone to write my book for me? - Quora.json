            "answer_text": "Absolutely! This is called ghostwriting. There are tons of professional writers who, for a variety of reasons, would gladly write books under their client's name. It's really important to make sure you find the right writer. Don't worry about whether someone will write your book for you. You can safely assume that somebody would want to write your book for you. The question you should be asking is how do you pick the right ghostwriter. The answer, of course, all depends on your selection criteria. You have to find somebody who has experience in your subject matter area. For example, if your book is a historical romantic fiction, then look for a fiction writer who has written similar materials in the past. Second, you have to also pay attention to cost. Some writers would love to write a book for thousands of dollars. Other writers would be as eager in writing your book, but they would only charge you a few hundred dollars. It really depends on the track record of the writer as well as their turn around time. Which brings me to timing. You don't want to retain a ghostwriter that's going to hang on to your project for ages. There are many writers out there that are just allergic to deadlines. They keep kicking the can down the road and you end up paying the price. As you probably already know, the longer they delay the publication of your book, the longer you will have to wait to see if your book will be successful. It can be very frustrating. I suggest you look for as many different sources of freelance writers and ghostwriters as possible. I suggest using an eclectic mix of Upwork, Craigslist, as well as individual ghostwriters who've made quite a name for themselves like Gene Eugenio writer. Mr. Eugenio is world-renowned for writing books for only $27. You can also look for similar writers on Linkedin. I mentioned Gene Eugenio because of the fact that he's gotten quite a lot of attention for writing books for clients for less that a hundred dollars. Regardless of how you plan to get a ghostwriter, make sure you come prepared. You should have a clear idea of your topic and you should also be able to clearly explain the kind of book you're looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure you can! And many people do. Working with a ghostwriter has four major benefits for an author: Saving yourself a lot of time. Writing a book is a time-intensive task, requiring weeks or months of consistent focus and work. Not every would-be author has the bandwidth to make that happen, especially those who are also entrepreneurs or business owners. Most people in those situations recognize how helpful a book can be to boost their authority and grow their reach, but are too busy actually running their business to make time for consistent writing. Bringing in a ghostwriter can reduce the author\u2019s time from dozens or hundreds of hours to fewer than twenty.Delegating a task you may not want to do or may not have the skills for. Another problem that authorpreneurs tend to run into is knowing a lot about their industry or topic, but very little about how to write about it. This isn\u2019t a huge block if the author really wants to learn how, or at least take a stab at doing their best (and works with a book coach and/or editor to help them), but while learning how to write a book on the fly is definitely possible, it\u2019s not always practical. Good business owners and entrepreneurs learn early on to differentiate between what they can and/or should do themselves, and what they can/should get someone else to do for them\u2014someone who knows those things better than they do. Working with a ghostwriter is a solid way to delegate the aspects of writing a book that you don\u2019t want to do (or aren\u2019t prepared to do) while still staying involved with the parts that require your specific touch.Working with a dedicated partner. There\u2019s really something to be said for knowing that you\u2019re not alone on a project, especially one that you\u2019re not familiar with or completely sure how to do. A ghostwriter is more than a contracted writer, they\u2019re an expert in writing whose goal is to get to know you and your message better than you know it yourself, and who is at least as dedicated to making your book amazing as you are, if not even more so. Their job is to have your back. Or at least your book\u2019s back. (And front. And interior. Just go with it.) Working with a ghostwriter is a really good way to make sure that you aren\u2019t the only one who cares about your book\u2019s quality\u2014and that the other person is someone who knows writing really well.Ensuring quality control for your idea(s). It\u2019s a sad truth that not every book idea or every book is actually all that great, especially at first. If you know your topic well but you\u2019re not a trained or experienced writer, there\u2019s a good chance that your book won\u2019t be as good as it could be\u2014not through any fault of your own, but because you\u2019re working in an echo chamber where every idea is your own and there\u2019s no outside feedback or guidance. A good ghostwriter doesn\u2019t just take your ideas and turn them into text, they also work with you to make sure those ideas are (1) powerful and commanding enough to be worth writing about, (2) clear and straightforward enough to be understood by anyone, and (3) relatable and connected enough that your ideal audience will feel drawn to them in word form. A great editor can do this if you really want to do the writing yourself, but by taking on the writing personally, a great ghostwriter can start the whole project from that premise and make sure it\u2019s happening from the beginning.So that\u2019s the good news: it\u2019s both very possible and can be highly beneficial to hire a ghostwriter to write your book for you. Now here\u2019s the bad news: ghostwriters ain\u2019t cheap. If you want a qualified, trained, experienced expert to take on the majority of the work in creating your book, you\u2019ll need to pay them a lot. Five figures is very common, and many of the best ghostwriters will not work for less. Oh sure, you can find writers for less than that, for four or even three figures if you look hard enough, but let\u2019s be clear about one thing: in book ghostwriting probably more than any other kind of writing, you get what you pay for. If the quality of the book that will bear your name for the rest of your life doesn\u2019t matter to you, you can hire a cheap writer to write it for you. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Even if you don\u2019t have five figures, try to work with the best ghostwriter you can afford. ",

I am a ghostwriter, and I can tell you that - depending on the subject - one ghostwriter may absolutely enjoy it, while another may not enjoy it that much. The key to getting the best book from a ghostwriter is two fold: pay them well, and listen to their needs. Not every ghostwriter will be able to deliever X words in Y days, but they know their abilities. Listen when they say it will take them ABC to do XYZ, and you will get a better product. Pay them well, and they will be more likely to be flexible with deadlines. (Plots and genres, maybe not, but this is where asking is always a good idea!) Depending on your ghostwriter, you may be able to get edits from the same person. Yes, editing is important for publication - even if it is a ghostwriter that does the writing! Even if the writer works off a plot, there could be plot holes or character development issues that the writer doesn\u2019t catch before turning it in. ",
