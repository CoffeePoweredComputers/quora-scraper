            "answer_text": "I would say not. And I say that as a huge fan of the show. The violence, especially in the early episodes, is reduced to comic-book, 300 movie level\u2014ie, made to look video-game cool. I actually didn\u2019t care for the first few shows. The sex depicted is not loving sex, but all about dominance\u2014nearly softcore porn. I don\u2019t think the depiction is necessarily wrong, given the storyline in which everybody is trying to get over on everyone else, but I wouldn\u2019t want my kids growing up thinking that\u2019s how a normal loving relationship is conducted. The way people conduct themselves in Spartacus may be historically correct (thought I\u2019m not really positive about that\u2014it\u2019s not exactly a documentary about Roman morals), but it\u2019s certainly not how adult people should conduct themselves now. Unless you\u2019re willing to sit there watch with them and explain that to your kids, then no. ",
