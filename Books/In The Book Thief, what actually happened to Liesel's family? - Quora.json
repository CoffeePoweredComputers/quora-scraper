            "answer_text": "In The Book Thief it is said that her mother is a communist, which was taboo during that time, and may have been taken to a concentration camp because of it. Liesel asks, \u201cIs my mother a communist?\u201d Staring. Straight ahead. \u201cThey were always asking her things, before I came here.\u201d Hans edged forward a little, forming the beginnings of a lie. \u201cI have no idea- I never met her.\u201d \u201cDid the Fuhrer take her away?\u201d The question surprised them both, and it forced Papa to stand up. He looked at the brown-shirted men taking to the pile of ash with shovels. He could hear them hacking into it. Another lie was growing in his mouth, but he found it impossible to let it out. He said, \u201cI think he might have, yes.\u201d (115) We don\u2019t know what happened to Liesel\u2019s father, though it is implied that he too was a communist. It is likely that both of her parents are dead, and as we know, her brother dies while on the train to Molching. ",

If they were open with their beliefs, it would only have been a matter of time before her mother was taken away too. This is why she attempted to save her children by sending them to the Hubermanns. Some of the earliest victims of the concentration camps were political \u201cdissenters\u201d the Nazis believed would try to overthrow them. ",
