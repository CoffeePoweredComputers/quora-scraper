            "answer_text": "OK, it\u2019s time for a history lesson. The 1919 World Series was the turning point for the game of baseball. First off, ballplayers generally didn\u2019t make much money from playing in those days. A few of the game\u2019s bigger stars did make some extra cash through endorsements, but most had to have another job in the off-season to make ends meet. Any attempts to unionize were quickly squashed by the owners, who wanted to keep player salaries down. There was no free agency in baseball. Once you signed with any team, they held your rights for life through something in your contract called the \u201creserve clause\u201d \u2014 which meant you couldn\u2019t sign with anyone else unless your team released you or traded you. The Chicago White Sox owner was Charles Comiskey, one of the stingiest executives in baseball. There was no love lost between Comiskey and his players because he simply didn\u2019t pay them much \u2014 in fact, he forced his players to launder their own uniforms. Comiskey was a smart man, and built one of the top teams in the American League \u2014 the White Sox even won the 1917 World Series. His players felt it was reasonable to ask for raises, considering they were the best team in baseball, and the players thought they should be paid accordingly. Comiskey never renegotiated contracts, and his players grew to resent and despise him. Despite all this, the White Sox won the 1919 American League Pennant, and were favored to win the World Series against the National League Champions, the Cincinnati Reds.  Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey Charles Comiskey was not alone in paying players very little. One way players found to make extra money was to cooperate with gamblers \u2014 who would pay players to throw games. Historian Paul Gardner wrote: \u201cBaseball had for some time been living uneasily in the knowledge that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. It quite obviously did not pay to be honest.\u201d Even though the owners knew about the bribes, they did nothing about it, because they feared a public scandal. If fans didn\u2019t believe the games were fair and impartial, they would stop going to the ballparks (there was no radio or television in those days) and revenue would dry up. It would destroy the game. However, rather than do something about it, the owners basically decided to ignore the problem, do nothing, and hope the gamblers would go away. Even though the White Sox were playing for the title, they were generally unhappy. A gambling syndicate (led by Arnold Rothstein) approached a group of disgruntled White Sox players to throw the series for $100,000 \u2014 and seven players were believed to receive payouts: pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Claude \u201cLefty\u201d Williams, infielders Charles \u201cChick\u201d Gandil, Fred McMullin and Charles \u201cSwede\u201d Risberg, along with Oscar \u201cHappy\u201d Felsch and \u201cShoeless\u201d Joe Jackson. George \u201cBuck\u201d Weaver did not take part or accept money, but he knew of the plot and said nothing \u2014 because he didn\u2019t want to \u201crat out\u201d his teammates.  Rumors began flying the series was fixed, but most people were still convinced the White Sox were the better team and bet on them to win. Many fans were surprised when the Reds won the best-of-nine series, five games to three. The rumors persisted, but no real evidence came out until 11 months later, when a Chicago grand jury investigating sports gambling heard testimony alleging the previous year\u2019s series had been fixed. The eight White Sox players were indicted for fraud and immediately suspended by Charles Comiskey \u2014 even though the White Sox were in a tight pennant race late in the 1920 season. The whole sordid affair quickly became known as the \u201cBlack Sox Scandal\u201d in the newspapers. Baseball had surged in popularity after World War I ended, and the owners were reeling about any perception the games were crooked. They got together after the 1920 season ended and decided something drastic had to be done. The answer the baseball owners eventually came up with was a stern federal judge with a no-nonsense reputation for imposing heavy sentences on those found guilty in his courtroom \u2014 Kenesaw Mountain Landis.  Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis The judge drafted his own employment agreement, which itemized his powers as baseball\u2019s new commissioner. Under the terms of the contract, Landis had virtually limitless power over everyone from owners to batboys \u2014 to act in the best interests of baseball. He took the job in late 1920. Speaking at a church shortly after his hiring, Landis stated, \u201cNow that I am in baseball, just watch the game I play. If I catch any crook in baseball, the rest of his life is going to be a pretty hot one. I\u2019ll go to any means and do anything possible to see that he gets a real penalty for his offense.\u201d In July of 1921, the criminal case against the Black Sox players began in a Chicago courtroom as the prosecutors pursued convictions for defrauding the public by throwing the series. But the prosecution had unexpected setbacks when evidence mysteriously disappeared. The trial lasted a month, and all eight players were found not guilty by the jury. The players and jury celebrated the verdict by going to dinner together and partied well into the night. They thought they had won and their troubles were over. Their victory was short-lived. Regardless of the verdict, the next day Judge Landis handed down lifetime bans to all eight players for their dealings with gamblers. In the 99 years since the ruling, all eight are still banned \u2014 despite attempts by living relatives, other players, and fans to reinstate Joe Jackson and Buck Weaver. None of the eight Black Sox ever played in the major leagues again. Judge Landis continued to clean up the game and its reputation. In all, he banned 18 players for gambling incidents. His iron-fisted rulings were well-publicized, and public perception of baseball\u2019s gambling problems quickly disappeared. He always kept his word about zero tolerance for gambling \u2014 in 1943 he banned Philadelphia Phillies owner William D. Cox for betting on his own team. Cox was required to sell his stake in the Phillies. The baseball owners were grateful and generous to Judge Landis for saving the game of baseball. His contracts were continually renewed, but only a week after signing a new seven-year contract in 1944, he died at age 78. Only two weeks later, a special committee elected Judge Landis into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. ",
