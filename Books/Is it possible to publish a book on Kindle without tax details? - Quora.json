            "answer_text": "Put it in another way. You can complete the tax interview without filling in the TIN. If one opts for that, then the tax withholding will be 30%. In any case you have to complete the Tax interview. You will not be able to publish the book without completing the Tax Interview. If you do not provide any tax details, which means that you only provide your address in the Tax interview and refrain from providing TIN and that is allowed then you will be issued the form W-8BEN-E. After that you can publish the book on Kindle. It is assumed the query is raised by an Indian living in India. This information is for such persons. In case, you have PAN number and you select non-US person, then PAN will be accepted. There is no need to show any aversion from filling in such details. If you provide PAN number, then you will be issued W-8BEN form. The tax withholding will be 15%. Now if you have an hidden agenda of publishing a paperback so that you can get an ISBN number and add this information in your CV, then you will probably buy books for your own and pay out of your own pocket. In that case, go ahead without filling in the tax details. But you have to complete the Tax information. Further, if you are a new author and self publisher, this aspect should not hold you back. You complete your tax interview without providing the tax details. You may apply for PAN number at your leisure. It is now an easy affair. You update you tax information at a latter stage whenever you get your PAN number. You should not halt you publishing activity only for the non-availability of tax information. But you have to complete that section. I have discussed all such nuances of Indian mindset and milieu in my book A Golden Kit for Self Publish a Book Written in Hindi as a Kindle ebook. The language of the book is Hindi. I believe that there are similar more issues like the one which is raised in this query and I have tried to address them. ",

They do, however, have a form you can fill out and sign electronically (and it makes you liable to your country) stating that your country has no income tax or withholding. Your country can use that form to take you to court if they do have income tax!!!! ",
