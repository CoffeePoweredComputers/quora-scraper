            "answer_text": "Well technically you can\u2019t really earn \u201cfree diamonds easily\u201d but still you can earn a few like 2 or 5 or even 10 if you have some luck. Anyways they won\u2019t help much since you will eventually find nothing to purchase with atleast 20 diamonds (unless you have 25 you can purchase weapon skins which would also be a time based weapon skin!). Now earning free diamonds depends on each season. Since it is easter season you can earn diamonds from bunny\u2019s egg which you can redeem for 15 blue eggs and 2 red eggs. Maximum a player can redeem is 6 so be careful to utilise it before others utilise it! Now I advice you to use bunny\u2019s egg at classic if you don\u2019t want almost every player to run for it. Start a classic match. Before the game starts all the players will be on a common island. Here\u2019s your chance, keep a close watch on the time and quickly distance yourself from the other players and plant the tree close to you. Run into the lucky tree you planted and quickly stop when an option appears. Click Ok. Then that\u2019s it you will get gifts but don\u2019t expect it to be diamonds only, you will mostly get 20\u201350 coins or 100 if you have atleast a bit of luck. If you are expecting diamonds it would be very rare like in all the 6 bunny eggs you plant, you can only get like 2 diamonds from 1 bunny egg and that too if lady luck had felt pity for you. If you want to earn more you might need to depend on other players. Start a match in ranked mode or sometimes you can try solo modes (but don\u2019t expect beginners to have a bunny egg like the ones in ranked mode) Now before the match starts you all will be in a same place. Look st the right hand of every player and be quick (atleast be a pro in running into a lucky tree). If you notice something glowy in their hand thats it- its a bunny egg. Be close towards the player and when the player is about to plant be in front facing the player. If you are too lazy to do this wait for a message to appear on the top of the screen. It looks like this: Player1 has planted a lucky tree. If you see this quickly find out where the lucky tree is and sprint at your best towards it-remember to jump because it boosts you forward a little bit than other players! Be quick and go inside the lucky tree and quickly tap OK before other players get inside as only few players can obtain the gift. In this way you can earn about 12 diamonds I guess \u201cif you are a normal player\u201d. If you are a pro player and hell as online all the time on the game you can expect to gain more maybe even 25 or even 50 diamonds (remember this technique only applies for pro players and whatever their skills in playing and if you play many matches as well as if lady luck is currently your best friend/girl friend  otherwise you can only earn 15 if you are normal or 5 if you are to be the unluckiest guy like me!) And finally I need to remind you that whatever diamonds you get by following this trick you can\u2019t buy anything entirely awesome, cool or anything at all. You can\u2019t even buy a pet or a character or elite pass with this. You can just buy some few boring items. Last but not least if you want to earn like 7000- 50,000 diamonds there is a contest called as outfit design where you need to design an outfit for the characters. The best artwork will recieve 50,000 diamonds and the lowest prize is 7000 diamonds. More information is in the news section of the game and quickly design the outfit and submit it before the specific date or if you are too late don\u2019t blame me! I am currently designing an outfit too and please follow the rules of drawing! ",

            "answer_text": "Free Fire offers many attractive skins, character bundles, pets, and several other items. Most can be purchased directly from the in-game store by spending diamonds. These items are also obtainable from various in-game events and the Elite Pass, a tier-based reward system. The players are required to spend diamonds to make most of the in-game transactions. This currency is even needed to change the current in-game name (IGN). Check out my youtube channel- Vadmin Gamer  For many, diamonds are costly, and purchasing them is not a feasible option. So, users look for alternative ways to get them for free. In this article, we discuss some legit and legal means to obtain this in-game money. How to get free diamonds in Free Fire The users must note that these methods involve individual efforts to be put in, and they are not just a matter of a few clicks. In a conversation on how to get free in-game currency, the first name that comes to mind is Google Opinion Rewards. It is one of the most popular and trusted apps used by millions across the world. The app has also been downloaded over 50 million times on Google Play Store, underlining its popularity. Users have to answer short and simple surveys to get Google Play Credit, which can then be used to purchase diamonds in Free Fire. It is one of the most popular GPT (Get Paid To) sites. Users have to complete several tasks, like answering quizzes and surveys, downloading apps and more to earn SB, which are available to cash out. The option to cash out varies according to the region. However, players can withdraw their earnings as PayPal money, which can then be utilised to purchase diamonds from the Sea Gamer Mall. There are several other reliable GPT sites like YSense and PrizeRebel that can also be used. Source: google ",

            "answer_text": "In this answer, I will cover all the possible and working ways in detail, to earn free diamonds in the game, Garena: Free fire. One of the major online multiplayer battle royale games, in both Android and iOS, Garena: Free fire is rapidly gaining popularity in recent times. The game got an award for the \u201cmost popular game\u2019 by voting in Google Play Store in 2019. Also, it was among the most downloaded games in 2019. A major chunk of players is actually moving from PUBG to this game, for more interesting gameplay experience. Diamonds in Garena Free Fire are one of the important currencies besides the coins. You can purchase exclusive in-game items i.e. character, outfit, weapon and vehicle skins, etc. with the diamonds. You can purchase them from the shop by paying real money in the diamond section. Still, if you do not want to shell out that amount or want something extra, you can always try the other ways and tricks, which will give you free diamonds. Giveaway collection: This is the best way to earn some diamonds for free, without spending anything and any hidden costs. Go and follow the big players who stream their matches or the channels that are new and want to grow their follower base. Often, they organize a giveaway, even on a weekly basis.  You have to like, comment, and share their status, image, and videos. If you are a lucky winner, or fulfil their conditions perfectly, you can win thousands of diamonds for free. This positive publicity is what moves their account forward. Top-up bonus offer: This trick is not completely free, as you have to spend some money first. However, you will get more than what you pay for. Go to the top-up section of the game, and buy 100 diamonds at least. On average, it will cost around $0.99 or 75 INR. For your 1st purchase, you will get an exclusive free reward for the first diamond top-up, which is 100 diamonds more. Also, you can get diamonds along with other items at a discounted price in the weekly offer section.  Besides this, the game offers seasonal top-up offers i.e. \u201cDiamond top up 100% bonuses. Using this, you can pay a fixed amount for some diamonds. Over the fixed amount, you will again get the same number of diamonds, without any extra cost. Membership: This is the most efficient way to earn diamonds, on a regular basis. You do not need to buy the top-up diamonds, but a weekly membership, for \u20b9 159, or a monthly membership at \u20b9599. This will give you some in-game benefits, an S-VIP card, etc. But even beyond that, the major benefit is the daily diamonds for free. In a weekly membership, you will get 60 diamonds daily i.e. 420 diamonds in total with the weekly membership. In the monthly subscription, you will get 2000 diamonds i.e. 200 diamonds extra. At the same time, if this is your first purchase, you will get 100 diamonds extra too. In this way, you pay for a monthly subscription with \u20b9599, and along with it, you get a total of 2100 diamonds for free, without having to pay anything more. In-game methods: The first one of these methods is a long-way approach, as you need the help of luck for getting these. You may get 2, 5 or a maximum of 10 diamonds at a time from this method. Depending on various seasonal festivals, the methods change a bit but stay the same at the core. The pre-game lobby method: During Easter, you will get bunny\u2019s eggs, which can be redeemed for diamonds in the pre-game moments. Start a classic mode match, and when you are away from other players on the starting island, plant the tree with it. Run towards the tree, and when you reach there, you can see the option to collect it. The gifts vary from coins to diamonds.  In the ranked mode, you can also hijack the lucky tree of other players, but you have to keep your eyes peeled. Look at the hands of the opponents to see a glowing bunny egg in their hand. If you miss it, still you have another chance with the plant notification. Find the player, stay in front of him, and sprint towards the lucky tree when you see it. You may try a combination of jump and sprint to reach before other players. In this way, you can get 10 to 50 diamonds easily. Elite pass mission: If you already have some diamonds, you can always go and buy a premium elite pass for 499 diamonds. You will see missions in the elite pass section of the game. Complete them perfectly, and you will end up getting more diamonds than you have paid for. Competitions outside the Free Fire game: Often, some organizations or fan forums organize for some competitions related to the game, and they reward the best entries with free diamonds. You can earn up to 50,000 diamonds in this way. Third-party top-up options: Some third-party apps like Hago, Helo, Qureka Pro, etc. offer in-app short games. You can win money in it, and transfer the amount to your wallet in PayTm, or Google Play. Then you can directly buy Free Fire diamond using that wallet balance. Hacks and mod APK: (NOT Recommended) Often you can see YouTube videos for tricks of Free Fire diamond generator, hacks, and mod-APK. In a number of cases, using those does not yield any result, some steal your account details and your diamonds.  Even though some of these work, there is high risk that you will be caught, and the account will get banned. It is just not worth the risk. Hope this answer is helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "Region: India You have to top-up or should have a membership to get Diamonds in Free Fire, but in events like \u201cwatch Ads and earn Diamonds\u201d (players get 14 or 15 Diamonds per day for watching ads) and it lasted for a year I think.  The below way is completely removed or outdated! \u201cActivity Mission\u201d points reward of 3 Diamonds was removed. We can earn Bonus Diamonds in \u201cActivity Missions\u201d, you have to spend at least 1 Diamond to earn 3 Diamonds as reward [2 Diamonds will be the bonus as your spending one on your purchase], it was been useless as we had no items for 1 Diamond in the store but now, from 16 January, they have got a Pink Diamond (current watch Ads event reward ) for 1 Diamond which you can spend on and collect 2 Diamonds per day. In this year you can actually get more than 600 Diamonds as a reward.  Apart from these events, you can get Diamonds only by doing a Top-Up or having memberships and if your lucky enough, you'll get 1 or 2 Diamonds from \u201cLucky Tree\u201d in the players lobby (players place it occasionally if they have one). If you're ready to spend some money, spend them on Special Crates which sometime offers you 299 Diamonds for 10 or 29 INR (tax excluded). Note: 10 INR = 0.13 USD and 29 INR = 0.39 USD I advice you to not to spend money on games like these. Thanks!  Update: You can also get few diamonds from Booyah! app. ",

Vous pouvez bien s\u00fbr. mais pourquoi? Pourquoi devez-vous pirater Free Fire ou n'importe quel jeu!? Hmm, c'est la grande question. Pourquoi voulez-vous pirater? Vous n'avez aucune comp\u00e9tence ou vous voulez juste que tout soit rapide. Regardez en piratant, je sais que vous pouvez \u00eatre un joueur Pro, mais vous n'avez pas besoin de pirater pour devenir un Pro Right. Les pirates aggravent l'environnement de ces jeux. Ils trichent avec les autres joueurs. Les hackers sont des imb\u00e9ciles qui ne veulent pas compliquer leur jeu avec des strat\u00e9gies et des niveaux de QI. Ils trichent juste en scriptant et en piratant. Ce qui cr\u00e9e un mauvais environnement dans chaque jeu. Il s'agit plus de Free Fire ou PuBG partout o\u00f9 les pirates aggravent le jeu. De nos jours, l'organisation de jeux s'y oppose \u00e9galement, mais vous devez \u00e9galement prendre la responsabilit\u00e9 de ne pas faire ces merdes dans le jeu. Les hacks ne vous rendent pas cool, mais plut\u00f4t fou. ",
