            "answer_text": "Yes, sure. Reading fiction keeps you on talking terms with yourself. As you go through the written word you in a way are listening to what the person behind the book has to offer to you. Then you have your own thoughts and then the conversation sets off. The only thing to be kept in mind is that you should choose nice books for reading. Nice means which hold thoughts of some good thinker and should be pleasing to you also. ",
