            "answer_text": "This would be a judgment call about which critics might disagree. The English epistolary novel, which employed first person as various fictional correspondents write to each other about their goings-on, preceded Jane Eyre by more than a century. Writers in Germany, France, Russia and the United States had produced successful first-person novels (and short stories) before Charlotte Bronte\u2019s was published in 1847. A look at the list below of both epistolary and non-epistolary novels will show a link between the Gothic tradition and the first-person narrator, which is, of course, the tradition which includes Jane Eyre. Which of these might have been read in the Haworth parsonage would make an interesting study, but they certainly show the ascension of the first-person novel preceded the works of Charlotte Bronte: James Howell, Familiar Letters, 1645\u201350 [English] John Bunyan, The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, 1678 [English] Samuel Richardson, Pamela, 1740 [English] Tobias Smollet, The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker, 1771 [English/Scottish] Denis Diderot, La religieuse [Memoirs of a Nun], 1796 [French] Charles Brockden Brown, Wieland, 1798 [American] E.

            "answer_text": "I do not say that I would credit this novel specifically for the prevalence of the first person narrative, but it is a classic piece of literature that has influenced many modern writers and authors. When it was written, Jane Eyre was not highly valued by society at large. The book was too revolutionary for its day, opening us up to the intimacy of a first person point of view. Yet, I feel this is also a product of the difference in society, the development in the psyche of our culture. We want to be understood and to understand others. First person narrative gives us that and allows us to step into another's thoughts, feelings and actions. However I am sure there are people on this site that have much more knowledge on these matters. ",
