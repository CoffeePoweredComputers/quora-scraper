            "answer_text": "I shall assume that we begin with page no. 1. For the first 9 pages, we use 9 digits to number those pages - 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. For pages 10 up until 99 we use 2 digits to number each page: so for pages 10 \u2026 99 we need [2 * (99\u20139)] = 180 digits. (Remember, for 10 upwards we begin with 10 - think, there are 10 pages from page 10 to page 19, and so on). For pages 100 until 199 we use 3 digits to number each page; for pages 1 \u2026 99 we have used 9 + 180 = 189 digits, so there are 3 more digits available to number pages. Hence only 1 more page (page 100) may be added to the total number of pages in the book, using (9 + 180 + 3) = 192 digits to number them all. So there are 100 pages in this book. ",
