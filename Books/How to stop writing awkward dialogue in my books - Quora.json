            "answer_text": "\"How can I stop writing awkward dialogue in my books?\" Every character is a protagonist in their own story. Start with that, and see that the dialogue shouldn't be one-sided. Make sure that each character responds from their own frame of reference and does so to further their personal goals (which could be compliant with the other person's goals, but doesn't have to be), so that an argument is two- or three-sided.  I'll give you an example: Bram Merleyn is a blind musician. The day before, he picked up a tsuba for a friend at a gallery owned by Klaas Dolfijn. When Bram collected the tsuba, a strange woman was alone in the gallery, claiming that Klaas had urgent business elsewhere. Now Bram is having lunch at his sister's luncheonette, and gets unnerving news: Bram Merleyn listened to the whirling ceiling fan and the hum of the diner\u2019s refrigerated counter while his sister Bianca leafed through Het Parool, cleared her throat and said, \u201cHere it is. \u2018Gallery Owner Killed With Own Sword\u2019.\u201d Her voice echoed slightly in the deserted diner. The newspaper brushed the back of his hand and Bram pulled the plate with sandwiches onto his lap. \u201cDon\u2019t drag the paper through my food.\u201d \u201cAfter you heard this, you probably won\u2019t even want your food anymore.\u201d \u201cAre you sure you want to read it to me?\u201d Bianca riffled the newspaper. \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t want to hear it?\u201d \u201cNot if it will spoil my appetite.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d \u201cJust read it.\u201d Bram took a bite from his sandwich. She folded the paper. \u201cLate last evening the police found the mutilated corpse of Klaas Dolfijn in the office of his gallery in the Amsterdam Jordaan quarter. The victim was stabbed with a Japanese sword from his own collection. The gallery owner seems to have been killed in the course of a robbery. The police have no clue yet as to the identity of the perpetrators, but are following several leads.\u201d Bram swallowed. \u201cThey follow leads without clues?\u201d \u201cNewspaper jargon.\u201d The paper crackled. \u201cWhen you went to get that\u2026 \u2018thing\u2019. Was he still alive?\u201d \u201cOf course. You think I pried it from his cold dead fingers?\u201d \u201cHis gallery is two hundred meters from here.\u201d \u201cTwo hundred and sixty-eight.\u201d Bram shrugged. \u201cAnd he was skewered for the contents of his safe. You don\u2019t even have a safe.\u201d \u201cHow can you be so callous? Someone we knew got murdered in broad daylight!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t \u2018know\u2019 him. Neither did you. All you \u2018knew\u2019 was Klaas preferred ciabatta over rye.\u201d He chewed his food. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think there was much daylight in his gallery.\u201d \u201cI made the poor man breakfast yesterday.\u201d \u201cWell, at least he didn\u2019t die on an empty stomach.\u201d \u201cJesus, Bram.\u201d She scrunched up the paper. \u201cWhy do I still talk to you?\u201d \u201cBecause your boyfriends are too stupid for conversation. Did you kick Olaf out yet or do I have to help?\u201d \u201cI gave him notice to get out by the end of next week.\u201d \u201c\u2018Notice\u2019?\u201d Bram put down his sandwich. \u201cWhy not give him your wallet, so he won\u2019t have to ransack your apartment?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t kick him out, he has no place to go.\u201d \u201cTough. He should\u2019ve kept his fingers from your money.\u201d \u201cIt was only fifty euro, and he promised\u2026\u201d \u201cOnly fifty euro.\u201d Bram took her hand. \u201cWe really have the same genes?\u201d \u201cYours are warped.\u201d She pulled her hand from his grasp. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what \u2018compassion\u2019 means.\u201d \u201cOh, but I do. Compassion: listening to a month\u2019s worth of snivelling when you break up with yet another asshole.\u201d She scooted from the booth and stalked away, shoes clacking on the tiles. Bram tossed the folded paper over his shoulder into the empty booth behind him, put his plate back on the table, and resumed his lunch. So Klaas had been killed with one of his own swords. Ten to one the woman who gave him the tsuba was responsible. Explained her volatile attitude. He finished his last sandwich, licked his fingers and wiped them on a napkin. \u201cCan I have another cup of tea?\u201d \u201cI have to prepare for lunch hour.\u201d A refrigerator slammed shut. \u201cYou better get going.\u201d Bram pulled out his cane, the parts clicking in place. As he walked to the door he felt her gaze on him.  \u201cKick Olaf in the nuts for me.\u201d \u201cViolence never solves anything. You told me that.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an exception to every rule.\u201d \u201cRight. Have a nice weekend.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d He paused with his hand on the doorknob. \u201cUnless a city bus runs me over.\u201d Bianca sighed audibly. \u201cWhy would a bus run you over?\u201d \u201cDrowsy from your tasty sandwiches, I pay less attention to traffic, step from the curb and get turned into a grease spot.\u201d \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t make jokes about that.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no joke. They paint them yellow, but I still can\u2019t see them coming. And as those big wheels grind me into the pavement, my last thoughts will be of being kicked out of your luncheonette without so much as a good-bye kiss.\u201d Bianca approached him, put her arms around his neck. \u201cInstead of telling me morbid fantasies you could just ask me for a kiss.\u201d \u201cMy way is more fun.\u201d Bram kissed her cheek and left the luncheonette. - Reprobate, by Martyn V. Halm   If you want to practice writing this kind of dialogue, try to make the conversation more interesting by shifting your own perspective every time someone responds to the other, so you're arguing with yourself. As an author, you should be able to pick any topic and write down an argument between someone who is pro and someone who is anti. And make sure they both want to be considered right. ",

            "answer_text": "I find dialogue very easy to write. When I\u2019m writing dialogue rich sections, it goes very quickly. I believe one of the secrets to good dialogue is to be chatty yourself. If the writer isn\u2019t an extrovert by nature, and a conversationalist, I will advise spending time in public areas, just listening in on conversations. What this does is show you how a conversation flows. Observe what is not said, but implied, which you can mould into well-written dialogue and actions. Perhaps you find your dialogue is a little awkward because it is to perfectly written. I think the narrative should be written properly, but quoted speech should be more relaxed. While I disapprove of starting sentences, paragraphs, and even chapters with \u2018and\u2019, it is quite natural in real conversation. Watch your own replies when you next speak to someone. We often tend to continue sentences without ending. It\u2019s like one big run-on sentence for large portions of the conversation. \u201c... and then what happened?\u201d Tom leant forward with a grin. \u201c... then I bought a Ferrari!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201c... and that\u2019s not all!\u201d He slammed his hand on the table in jest. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me ... you got a purple one.\u201d Of course, too much of this becomes tiresome. While the characters are speaking, have them pause to do things, or continue speaking while actively participating physically. The best advice is to watch people having a conversation. Listen and watch. People all have habits and ticks when they are nervous, excited, or even just bored. If you learn dialogue from real people, you will also avoid the awful clich\u00e9s that make dialogue sound forced. ",
