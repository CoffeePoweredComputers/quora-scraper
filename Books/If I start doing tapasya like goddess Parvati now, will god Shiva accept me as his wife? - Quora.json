            "answer_text": "A2A Its a curious question that is a little funny but whats wrong with it being funny :) I will try to present various viewpoints which you may assume as being sarcastic or mocking but it has a purpose. Bhakti marg and case of appearance.Bhakti marg Role playing is very common in bhakti marg. A women and in some cases even a man become/feels/imagines themselves as radha and pour out their devotion. So yes you can, at least you can get the feeling if not the actual marriage. Case of appearance Gods are usually shown with a perfect figure and features but are they actually so? Sai baba is being shown fair now and blueish in case of krishna instead of dark shade, add to that a very fit figure in case of the later. Though shiva is mentioned as fair and handsome but similarly what if he is not so and he looks something like this  OR this  Imagine them as shiva, will you want to be their wife? Can you imagine yourself living with a person who lives like that, completely opposite to how people live in a normal samsaric life :) For the majority practically speaking, its a big NO. Daksh prajapati had some very cruel words to say about shiva because of his appearance which he saw with disgust. I am mentioning appearance because it greatly influences us all like maya, in our decision making. Many a times we miss out on good things just because they do not appear attractive :) But you can see these stories literally or even better as metaphorical or philosophical.So if you take them literally then shiva is already married so you cannot But if you consider their philosophical aspect, he is already part of you. Eg. Shiv and shakti are shown as one, ardhnarishwar. Now as female form has been symbolically used to represent the sustaining and creative power of shakti. You are shakti, you are already part of him and he is part of you. Another story symbolically represent male Gods as bones and female Gods as the flesh. You are both, shiva and parvati. And so on\u2026 On a side note True worship of shiva is not about pooja and rituals alone. They are just the initiation process, the main part of shivas worship is to meditate and learn from characteristics that define him like vairagya, not to discriminate, forgiveness, changing yourself for others(parvati) etc and implementing them in our lives.

            "answer_text": "Without any doubt, First fact is that you are NOT separate from Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. (You) Atma is Shiva and Your Body and thoughts and energy is Parvati. This whole creation is the play or Leela of Supreme Consciousness (Purush) and Nature (Prakriti). And you are already Purush and Prakriti both. If you realize that you are not body, you will realise you and Shiva are already one and not two!! You will immediately realise this oneness, This is higher than marriage. There is no question of Who will marry whom? (This is Gyaan Marg- Read Ashtavakra Geeta to know more) However, if you specifically asking for a SPECIFIC ROLE in the entire Leela and want to marry God and be His Wife.. you may not be able to replace Aadi Shakti as wife of Shiva; or for that matter not even Lakshmi as wife of Vishnu or Saraswati as wife of Brahma. They are all forms of the Prakriti or Durga or Aadi-Shakti. But as a Bhakt, you can marry one of the Avatars. For example, Vishnu doesn\u2019t accept any new wife, but His avatar of Lord Krishna does ..and even now!. You should read about Goddess Aandal for example, who was accepted by Lord Krishna. If you live every breath with His name so that He breathes and not you, You eat every bite with His name and feed Him (in You) and not to yourself, perform every act for serving Him (in you and outside you in all the beings) and not to yourself, you will achieve the peak of Bhakti. You surrender completely to Him- by Mind, Thoughts, Action and words and dedicate all of these all the time to Him. God Loves this relationship the most! (This is Bhakti Marg) However if you want to follow Bhakti Marg and still want to His wife, Please note you should choose the Avatar form that accepts another wife. For example, Lord Rama, is committed to one wife. However Lord Krishna is not, Though both are forms of Lord Vishnu. Therefore, Rama will never accept you as His wife, even if you achieve the climax of Bhakti. Lord Shiva is committed to one wife, Lord Hanuman is committed that He will never marry. Therefore, Bhakti is good. But i would like to ask you a question: if you truly love the Lord (and you know He already committed to one wife) you will not put him in any Dillemma.. isn\u2019t it?? You can ask to be one with Him as a Devotee and He will surely accept. ",
