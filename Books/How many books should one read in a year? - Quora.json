            "answer_text": "It depends. Reading books isn\u2019t about checking something off the list; it\u2019s not something you have to just get done. It\u2019s about what you get out of it. It\u2019s more about the process of experiencing the book than it is saying, \u201cI\u2019ve read this number of books, and therefore I\u2019m an accomplished person!\u201d Read as many as you can. But make sure you\u2019re really reading them, really enjoying them, not just hurrying through thinking, \u201cWhen will I be done with this book?\u201d Try to see what the author\u2019s trying to say, and notice whether the author says it well or not.Read good literature so you\u2019re not wasting your time. I can\u2019t give you a number, because some books are longer than others. How much free time do you have? Take a little piece of your free time each day and read. When I\u2019m very very busy, I sometimes read for ten minutes a day. When I\u2019m very busy, I read half an hour a day. When I\u2019m just busy, I read an hour a day. An hour idea is ideal, in my opinion, but not for everyone. What if you\u2019re an athlete? In that case maybe half an hour a day is better. That way you can focus your free time on physical improvement. What if you\u2019re a baker? Read cooking books sometimes and kill two birds with one stone? If you really desperately want a number, here\u2019s my estimate: One book a year is probably too few. Even if it\u2019s as thick as a brick. (If it\u2019s thicker than a brick. . . you seriously might need more than a year to finish it. But anyway\u2026) 365 books a year is probably too many. If you\u2019re reading one book a day on average (unless they\u2019re super short), you\u2019re either reading too fast to really enjoy the books or you\u2019re spending too much time on books and not enough time on real people. Or you\u2019re a superhero with the power to speed-read. How fast of a reader are you? Fast readers can go through a normal-sized novel in a week. I\u2019m not that fast\u2026 it takes me a month at least. Don\u2019t sweat it. The key is not to be able to say, \u201cI read THIS many books per year!\u201d It\u2019s to be able to say, \u201cI love books. I read them as much as I realistically can because they\u2019re wonderful.\u201d ",
