            "answer_text": "Here are some news you should read regarding jee and neet Syllabus reduction. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has reduced the syllabus of Classes 9 to 12 for the academic year 2020-21 by 30%. The decision has been made due to the loss in classroom teaching due to the health emergency brought on by the COVID-19 oubreak. The syllabus reduction has affected all subjects including physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology which are critical for the engineering and medical entrance exams, JEE Main and NEET. The reduction will result in several topics from these subjects not being taught in schools and, in one way or the other, impact aspirants who are set to write NEET and JEE Main 2021. The HRD minister, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank\u2019s announcement on the CBSE syllabus reduction immediately invited numerous questions on whether the National Testing Agency, or NTA, too, will dock the syllabus for NEET and JEE Main 2021. Despite the prevalence of coaching, many students still rely only on classroom teaching for their JEE Main or NEET preparation. They depend on the textbooks of the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and what is taught in the classroom. ",
