            "answer_text": "Surely you can! Firstly you should not think that CBSE portion is very different from state board. I have gone through it and more than 80 percent is the same! Secondly you should change the way you study since most of the toppers of state board just mug up the textbook and vomit it out during the exam.You should understand each and every concept in all subjects(even biology!).Most importantly COVER 11TH GRADE SYLLABUS RELIGIOUSLY(Since most stateboard students study 12th grade for both the years) If you cant afford coaching, watch Youtube videos of Examfear to understand the basics.Then for reaching advanced level(NEET level) in the subject watch videos of Egr. DUSHYANTH KUMAR ,Dr.PRADDEEP KSHETRAPAL Dr. NEELA BAKORE for Chemistry,Physics and Biology. It's better you focus on Ncert first and try to understand each and every concept (I repeat each and every concept). Next buy Ncert at your fingertips by MTG and solve each chapter atleast 3 times before the D-day. Make sure to complete 100 questions in 60 minutes. You will be able to complete the bio part in the real exam within 25 to 30 minutes That's enough to get 320-330 in Biology . I suggest you to focus the rest of your time in Physics and Chemistry instead of mugging up scientific names from insane guides like Arihant. Lastly don't get sick during the exam(happened to me and trust me it was the most painful experience of my life). All your pain will go in vain:( And all this pain will be amplified by your parents,relatives and friends. All your hardwork depends on those 3 hours. So stay healthy! I am suggesting you these methods by the mistakes I made during my preparation.I was definitely the most hardworking and may the smartest but I didn't do smartwork. P.S. The only right thing that I did was that I didn't focus on boards and instead focused almost entirely on entrances. All the best! I am sure you will do well! Joel Jack ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, sure. Anyone can crack neet if he/she studies in the right way. The board doesn't matter only the preparation matters. First of all, the most common myth that only cbse students can crack all entrance exams is a big lie. Anyone can crack NEET if he has prepared well. The board of study doesn't matter. The prescribed syllabus of neet is moreover same as cbse class 12 and 11 syllabus. But, state board and cbse has nearly the same syllabus. But, the way of study matters. State board students are trained to memorize and vomit the same. They are never taught to understand and to use their application skill. But, cbse students have to use their application skill. So, it is easy for them to crack entrance examinations which solely needs understanding and application skills. When you understand and know to apply your knowledge by reading the state board books, it's enough. For example, my friend whom I have already mentioned in one of my answers is a state board student. She scored 290 marks in neet,only with what she have studied in state board book even without mere preparation. That too, only 12th standard books. I scored 130 in neet with zero preparation. I didn't even study state board books properly. If you study both 11 th and 12 th books, you could surely crack neet with flying colors. ",
