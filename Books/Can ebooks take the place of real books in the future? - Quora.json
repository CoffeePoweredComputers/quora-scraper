            "answer_text": "They already have. This happened a couple years ago, and by now what's left is the mopping up. Those of us with a few decades behind us, will remember having heard this discussion several times before. You can still, if you try, buy film-based as opposed to digital cameras; and get the films developed. It's a hassle, and really only for enthusiasts, but you can. The real battle between these formats is however long over. Convenience and features won, and they did so EVEN at a point where quality was still on the side of film. Features like being able to see the images instantly, and being able to conveniently and easily share the images with people across computer-networks trumphed disadvantages in quality, and today, of course, the quality too is excellent. You can still buy music on CD or on LP, and some people do so, but nevertheless it's clear to most people that the future of music is digital and online. (yes I'm aware that CDs are digital) The same story repeated here: people changed from listening to CDs and to mp3s at a point in time where the latter had inferior quality. Because conveniences like being able to carry a 1000-song library in your pocket trumped pure quality. Today, we're seeing the same question again, this time about books. And people will field the same arguments again. A ebook-reader is not as pleasant on the eyes as a paperbook, they will say. It lacks the tactile FEEL of a book, they will say. And they'll be right. Except they'll fail to notice that the same arguments are RIGHT if you're comparing a LP-record to a mp3-file too, and yet that helped not at all. Ebooks have convenience-features that paperbooks quite simply can't compete with. This is true even today, and it's getting MORE true with every passing month. This battle is over; even though you'll probably be able to purchase paper books, especially large-format color-print books for decades to come. Among those advantages are: Portability. You can store thousands of books on a pocket-sized device, rather than need to fill every room of your house with bookshelves.Availability. Millions of books available for instant purchase and instant reading, even if I'm in some tiny village somewhere, as long as Internet is available in some form. (even slow internet will do!)Ebooks can comfortably be read in the dark due to built-in backlight.Highlights and quotes can be marked, and are instantly available for you complete with correct quotation. This is a life-saver for anyone doing reading for research, and REALLY neat for students of all kinds too.More social; because you can (if you like) share favourite quotes with your friends, ask for book-recommendations and/or read what your friends think about the books. Now you CAN do this with paper-books too, it's just more of a hassle.Cheaper. Paperbooks go trough several cost-inducing steps AFTER the final proofread manuscript is done. Printing, binding and distributing paper costs money, and consequently eBooks will be cheaper -- even if the author and editor still earns the same per book sold. (and it's possible they can make do with less per copy if the lower costs results in higher sales measured in units)Safer. My physical books are at risk from things like fire. My electronic books can easily be backed up; they take a trivial amount of space, and so storing several copies of them for safeguarding is a easy and effortless thing to do.",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays, almost everywhere we go, we encounter people with tablets who are reading them. People prefer to use e-books, as they became trendy and convenient things for those who do not want to carry a big book. And to the question is, whether the e-books can replace paper books I would answer YES? First of all, let\u2019s define what an \u201ce-book\u201d is. \u201cE-book\u201d is an electronic version of a printed book which can be read on a computer or a specially designed handheld device. People carry it everywhere, as it is precisely very convenient for those people who are busy all day, and have no time to go to a bookstore, or to carry many books around. The advantages of the e-book are many; It is straightforward and easy to purchase and download e-books through the Internet, no trees are required to manufacture paper for the pages of e-books and so forth. However, many people put into a question, whether they are as useful as paper books. Since the 1980s there have been hundreds of debates about what is actually better for the human brain: to read ink on the paper or to read from the screen of the tablet. More than a hundred investigations have been dedicated to this topic, and the results are diverse. Moreover, an interesting experiment has been applied to finally understand whether there is a difference between reading on a screen or a real book. A 2013 Norwegian study of the reading pattern showed that students who read a real, physical book scored much better in reading awareness than those who read texts digitally. This is connected with the fact that paper gives spatiotemporal markers; the touching of the paper and the act of shifting pages serve as memory markers that are absent while scrolling down an electronic screen. In two separate 2013 and 2014 studies, one of the school pupils and one of the grown-ups, Anne Mangenand, a professor at the University of Stavanger in Norway gave groups of people with similar reading skills several texts to read, with half reading electronic and half reading text on an actual paper. Afterward, the readers completed a test to gauge reading comprehension. Eventually, the people who read the texts electronically did worse than their paper reading counterparts. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no substituting the feeling one gets as they flip a page or underline an interesting quote using a pencil. As of now, several market reports suggest that paperbacks are enjoying a revival while there\u2019s either a dip in eBook sales or a flattening. It\u2019s not very surprising, one could argue that since technology has invaded almost every sphere of human life, there are certain activities people prefer the old-school way, like reading books.  But it would be rash to dismiss eBooks so quickly. Here are some factors you ought to keep in mind\u2014 1. Self-Publishing: With the rise of the internet and social media, self-publishing has become easier than ever. Over a million books are self-published every year, a considerable chunk of which are eBooks. Many stats simply consider ISBNs issues and conclude that eBooks are on the decline, but they ignore a very crucial chunk of books out there\u2014those on self-publishing platforms. For instance, Amazon\u2019s KDP that assigns its own number (ASIN) to books, not to mention websites like Wattpad and Juggernaut that offer readers both free and paid books. 2. The Young Readership: The older generation might face occasional hiccoughs when it comes to adopting technology, but not the new one. Their life is closely tied to the devices they use and most of them are pretty comfortable with technology. Reading on a screen feels natural to them. Be it for entertainment-related or educational purposes, youngsters are comfortable whipping out their phone and reading stuff. No wonder reading apps are on the rise and even print media has taken to opening their online counterparts. 3. Others: In general, technology has invaded many aspects of our life and we\u2019re moving towards a no-paper era where more and more things are being digitized. Not to mention, eBooks are a great option for those who are low on space and budget. Things like accessibility become even less of a problem. Students no longer have to scour their college library for hours and bemoan the fact that the book they wanted is unavailable. Everything is available\u2014thanks to the internet. To conclude, it would be rash to claim that paperbacks have no future, that\u2019s not true. They are probably here to stay. But it would also be presumptuous to underestimate eBooks. The need of the hour is to revolutionize reading itself. To take both paperbacks and eBooks, harnessing the power of the internet to access the large digital audience. This is what we at Juggernaut do. Our founder, Chiki Sarkar, recognized the potential of the internet and decided to bring together self-publishing, paperback publishing, and eBooks. On our writing platform, writers both new and old post their work and have it read by millions of smartphone users in India. We also have a publishing wing, open to book proposals. Not only do our expert editors sift through the hundreds of manuscripts they receive, but we also select five new authors from our writing platform every month and develop their book for formal publishing. Lastly, we bring together all these books on our reading app and give people the chance to consume quality content at extremely affordable rates, some even for free! ",

            "answer_text": "To a large extent, probably. But eBooks will Never entirely replace Physical books. We are a perverse stubborn species, we hang on to things long after they are replaced by other newer Technologies. We call ourselves Collectors while we stockpile relics of centuries past, how else can you explain people who still own and lovingly maintain 14th century or older Swords, or other similar relics. Now, eBooks will much faster replace periodicals, though not comic books (collectors again) and paperbound (Trade paperback and mass market paperback) they will even once they get eBooks up to a decent editing standard replace reference materials (already a considerable number of encyclopedia, Dictionaries, and even college level textbooks are digital) but there will still be a niche market for legacy binding physical books for the foreseeable future. /rant What I feel, and I have said this before in other places hurts acceptance of eBooks is that there isn\u2019t a single format usable by all readers, now there are projects like Project Gutenberg working with open domain titles to make them available in the widest number of formats but there remains a vast number of titles not yet in open domain not available in any digital format, in addition to a large number only available in one or two niche formats. Additionally there is the editing problem. I have a large-ish collection of books including a considerable number in physical and electronic form. Far too frequently, serious errors crept into the digital editions, misplaced entire pages, entire chapters, words replaced with words that sound the same but mean entirely different things, or misspelled, or just gibberish. I would understand if these were from the above mentioned Gutenberg project but no, this is from major publishers and new books /off rant ",

I get on the plane and read them; deleting the ones I don\u2019t want, keeping the ones I do to buy \u201clater\u201d (the more honest word is \u201csoon\u201d.) I often buy the physical copy of the book when I get to my destination. Having read the sample, I know exactly what I want.  Or, a friend recommends a book and instead of making a note of it I immediately download the first chapter, feeling giddy. Or, I\u2019m in my Sunday spot (my sofa) reading book reviews, downloading samples of recommended books that interest me.  I can own any book in the world in seconds without ever leaving my house. I don\u2019t even have to turn on my computer. And it doesn't feel like a purchase. It feels like....well, a download. (Oh oh.) There's more. If you\u2019re reading a book and come across a word you don\u2019t know the meaning of, you can look it up. This has prompted me to look up words even when I do know what they mean, because it\u2019s so quick and easy I can satisfy my curiosity about, say, their etymology. (Did you know that \"disaster\" means \"ill-starred event\" because it was believed a disaster was caused by the position of the stars?) If I wake up with insomnia at 3:00 a.m. I can read the New York Times before it even is available in print. Books that aren\u2019t the latest bestsellers can be yours (in under a minute) for a dollar or two.  I can send a book to a friend via email, instantly.  I can carry hundreds of books at one time, take notes, \u201cclip\u201d pages and archive them (in order), and listen to music. Or, use the \u201csearch\u201d feature to find anything online. (What are the seven deadly sins? Give me a second.) Books have their own kind of magic. I like their smell and heft and how the paper feels in my hand. Fortunately for everyone, this is not binary. I don't have to choose, nor replace. I can read a book any time I want to, and use my e reader when I travel.  ",

            "answer_text": "Aha! Books *_* Thanks for the interesting question Anjali di :) The mesmerizing smell of books- Ah! Isn't it enough to fall in love with the books in a moment?! Yes, it's not the only thing that attracts us towards books. Actually they are not just the books, they are emotions and this basket of emotions comes with varieties of life. They fill the canvas of life with amazing colours of memories, sorrows, smiles, fears, confidence and what not! They are the unbreakable parts of our lives. But the time changes and so do the things. E-books are somehow the new trend, new refreshment(?). But, will they replace our paper books? Can they take place in our heart which has been locked by our lovable paper books? The answer simply goes for a NO. Old is gold! Some things cannot be replaced. Before concluding why paper books are one step ahead in our mind, check out some pros of ebooks. Okay, so they are easy going and flexible, then their hassle free attitude. We can carry a portable library within it. And imagine the hundreds of books stored in a single place. It's just so casual and comfortable.Well, if ebooks come up with such ease then why do we still tend to fall for the paper books? The answer is we miss so many things in the case of e-books! Umm\u2026 Didn't agree?  Let me take you to the world of books and memories then. Reverse psychology is in our blood. It's the funny human tendency to do the exact opposite from the thing which is to be done. We apply our psychology here also. Our mind strikes us, \u201chey, open the first page.\u201d But, no\u2026 We don't give a damn. We will turn the book and always open the last page! Our resisting power becomes zero. Haha, but still it's fun, isn't it? We always keep turning the pages what is next, what is next! And sometimes also end up revealing the suspense and then scolding ourselves. And that eagerness- how many pages are left? Still 30! Still 20\u2026 That feeling when we complete our book! Oh, it left something heavy. We think, \u201c now what is the upcoming thing? The journey with my book is over.\u201d It left some emptiness but that emptiness is what we need at the time. It's adorable I guess.  Then those butterflies in your stomach or rather a zoo itself, when we are just about to start our favourite book. A train of thoughts keep running in our minds, \u201chow will the book be- as per my expectations? What about the characters?\u201d And this eagerness, butterflies are missing in the company of e-books!When we read the books, we are not just reading. We feel each and every character, we try to put ourselves in the shoes of the characters. Words are magical. But, somehow digital thing ruins this crisp.So, it's not just phases, it's a relation, it's a beautiful journey. You know what is the best thing about books? The box of memories. When you look at your mini library in the house and sometimes you are just lost in the precious past with these books. You tend to take out a book and recollect the golden days with the book. Then you take out another one and again the loop continues. Books give us a chance to experience the thrill in life. Yes, I am not kidding. Remember the childhood days, when you used to hide these books inside textbooks and faking like you are reading your textbook, but actually you would be reading your book. When you come down or go to another room at late night to lessen your curiosity about book and want to read at late night. When you are spending more and more time with your books in a library or a corner in your house- just you and your book, for hours and hours.And the frustrating part is whenever you are reading some interesting topic or chapter, only at that time someone will call you or ask you to do some work. I literally feel like killing them at that time. And those moments when you are half leaned on your sofa and go to a deep sleep while reading. You are asleep in the same position with the book on your head or in your hand. What a satisfaction that sleep gives us. Will those virtual books ever give this thrill? Never. And that craziness and obsession for the attracting cover pages and amazing collection of bookmarks! You won't find this craziness with those e-books.This recollecting your past with books is missing while walking in the land of e-books. You may have a numbers of books in your kindle but there is no point as they are not able to make you realize the charm of your past, your quality time with books.Then, those magnetism of yellow pages! To read a book with yellow pages gives you some extraordinary feeling. From where will you find this oomph in your boring kindle? You just swap and read, swap and read. You take utmost care that any of the pages doesn't get torn. And if someone even mistakenly tears or folds the page, abort the mission to explain the person anything. I repeat abort the mission! Paper books makes you more classy. Yeah, I mean it- roaming with a book totally carefree. And roaming around with your kindles?!- It's just the tedious common thing. People will call you a nerd with books. But, being a book lover you would love it.  Being with books is an awesome thing. If you are lonely and want to go on a date- don't worry! Books are there for you. Imagine the scene when it's raining and you are reading a book in the balcony with a cup of coffee. It would be the best date ever. And will the e-books ever be able to create this lively atmosphere and beautiful evening? No.  It's fun to tease someone that I own this book and make the one jealous. It's kind of show off. Then that jugaad factor when we don't have a particular book and apply some jugaad to get the book. Jugaad is the common Indian talent. When you go to buy a book, nah you don't buy just one. You will be confused which should be taken, which should be left for the next time and finally you end up buying more than 2-3 books. Reading a paper book is so flawless. Everything seems to be in its place and happens to a great song of correctly tuned music. Our kindles don't know this music between a reader and a book. You struggle with every word to be concentrated  on the digital screen. E-books can't replace paper books anyhow! Digital words are emotionless. Technology cannot carry the feelings. It's tacit. Maybe you increase the ease but you will decrease so much flavours that books bring. And a life without flavours and emotions is useless. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think so. As long as people want to buy them, books will exist in the paper form. E-books already exist but I think that not many people would decide to read 300-page book, from the beginning to the end, from the computer or the e-book reader screen. It would be a draining torture for a lot of people. E-books amd tablets are great for some people, especially for reading recipes, news, e-mails or short literary forms, but who would like to read almost 900-page Anna Karenina from a tablet? The problem is that the screen light is artificial and some people simply hate looking at the screen for a long time. I believe that people get more tired when reading an e-book than when reading a paper book. Eyes hurt more. There is also a difference in the way that people read books and e-books. While reading a paper book people usually like to sit back in a cosy armchair or a sofa and enjoy the process. While reading an e-book, some people want to finish reading as soon as possible: they are skimming, scanning, scrolling down and skipping parts of texts or sentences just to get over with it. Therefore, comprehension suffers. Another thing that book lovers are missing when reading digital books is\u2026paper. The smell of paper, the book covers, flipping the pages, putting cute page markers inside and the habit of underlining parts of texts. Paper books and coffee are two best friends.  E-books are perfect for business. Paper books are perfect for pleasure. ",

            "answer_text": "Eh, ebooks can take the place of paper books. However, I don\u2019t believe they will ever fully replace paper books. For me, ebooks have completely replaced physical books, but only for ones that I don\u2019t want to add to my physical collection. I have a personal library at home which consists of mostly free books, advanced copies of books, and those that I physically want for my collection (Harry Potter, Stephen King novels, LotR, etc). I use ebooks for all other reading, because half of the time my physical collection consists of books by a certain author that I want to have or books that I have already read. This also helps me save money, because I rarely buy books on my Kindle that aren\u2019t on sale (Stephen King is the exception, and I also buy some of his books in print and Kindle because of the ease my Kindle gives me to read his big books) or I rent them from the library. It really boils down to a matter of preference and no matter how digital the world gets, ebooks won\u2019t just replace paper books altogether. It would have to take a reality like Fahrenheit 451 for that to happen. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that this will happen anytime soon, especially if we take a look at the statistics. eBooks user penetration is currently 10.5% and it is expected to hit 11.8% by 2022 (eBooks - worldwide | Statista Market Forecast). While the user penetration is still relatively low, sales attribution is not proportional to it - 25.8% buying of total book sales worldwide refers to e-book sales in 2018. More importantly, eBooks are definitely changing the industry and the way we write, publish, distribute, consume written words. Technology is moving the whole industry upfront and directing everything towards the end-users. If we look at the industry itself, there are a couple of things that I would love to highlight (taken from Britannica\u2019s History of publishing): The history of publishing is characterized by a close interplay of technical innovation and social change, each promoting the other.Publishing as it is known today depends on a series of three major inventions\u2014writing, paper, and printing\u2014and one crucial social development\u2014the spread of literacy.The invention of printing transformed the possibilities of the written word. Printing seems to have been first invented in China in the 6th century AD in the form of block printing. The Chinese invented movable type in the 11th century AD but did not fully exploit it. The invention of printing in Europe is usually attributed to Johannes Gutenberg in Germany about 1440\u201350, although block printing had been carried out from about 1400. Gutenberg\u2019s achievement was not a single invention but a whole new craft involving movable metal type, ink, paper, and press. In less than 50 years it had been carried through most of Europe, largely by German printers.In that way, it\u2019s safe to say that the whole industry was pretty much static from 15th to 21st century. And eBooks disrupted the publishing industry. Kids are now using tablets and smart phones since they are babies. This will affect the eBooks consumption and user penetration in the years to come for sure. I also wrote a blog post on Digital Publishing: eBooks Statistics Indicate Growing Popularity with a brief overview. ",

            "answer_text": "While ebooks are far more convenient, physical books are much more stable. That stability is, in many ways, a safety that convenience can\u2019t replace. On top of that, reference material being pulled from a book is often easier to access through physical books than through their electronic counterparts. Flipping back and forth through a physical book is still faster than doing the same electronically. There\u2019s also the sensory aspect of books. Reading from an ebook allows you to read, but reading from a book incorporates all of the senses but taste (Except, of course, for infant/toddler books. They do wind up stimulating taste as well, though they\u2019re rarely deliberately flavored.) Could ebooks entirely replace physical books right now? Yes. Should they? No, not at all. Ebooks and physical books fill different roles within the same sphere of influence. And, in the event of some critical catastrophe, the physical books are more likely to survive for those who need to pick up the pieces. That sounds like paranoia, but people still keep candles, lamps, and flashlights for when power is lost. We keep spare tires in cars just in case one blows. This is no different except that if the ability to access electronic data occurs for an extended period, the only way to fix it will be retained within the physical books that could have been replaced by electronic ones.

But in the coming generations where children would spend more time on their gadgets than anything else , they would prefer everything in the electronic form , because they will not know any other form. Already there is a rise in E-book sales . A few reasons for choosing an E-book over a paper book are  Cost - E-books are cheaper than paper books any day, because after all they are nothing but large files.Environmental Concern: A sustainable future requires us to change our habits and shifting from paper books is one such change Portability : I f I wanted to carry a 1000 books to any place I travel ,an E-book would a better optionPaper books have an appeal that E-books don't , they are more real , for many of us they carry memories, the folded pages , the smell of old books , finding an old note,leaf or a feather pressed between pages, but charm and appeal are giving way to optimization as a future with a resource crunch looms ahead , no matter how much you re-cycle, there will always be  a requirement for new paper and that would mean taxing natural resources , in a few decades it will become a necessity to save trees and not a choice and so  E-books will not be an option but an only choice.

As it turns out, it appears that eBooks had surpassed the sales of paper print before that year ran-out. That was 2016. If you take a look around town you would be very lucky to find a new release bookstore. Even here, where I live, Chapters had closed down, and that is in basically University town. I regard print as real books but before print came along all books were written out, by hand, and often illuminated by hand, too. To those who were thrilled at the mass production of print, those who got accustomed to hand-scribed books regarded those as real books. Tomorrow, who knows? Maybe directly implanted books, into the brain, will replace eBooks and eBooks will be regarded as the real books. Having said this, however, although we saturated the world with printed books, we still value and highly prize the hand-written ones. We value the print ones now, as we will eBooks. What we must keep in mind, not the material books have been produced in, but really keep in mind the content and meaning behind what is written. ",

As I put it, hot media is packed to overflowing with data, or message content. Cool data, by contrast, were those which required the audience/reader to fill the gaps. Their participation quotient is higher. Now, with iPad, Skype, cell phones,iTunes,iPhones - the media are evolved well beyond what was seen as excitingly new ( colour TV! Wow! 30 years back). So, the distinguishing mark of the cool is now much more available. are the Kindle, ibook hot or cool? the ebook is much more than a book. Among other things, it's an archive. Not a library book, but a book library. Secondly, a device for receiving and transmitting texts, not merely delivering them. Thirdly, it is formatting device. Buy a book from the bookshop and you are lumbered with the typography and font size. More novels are read in large font size and large print is available in e-book. The e-book has daunting potential. In the very near future, it will, for example, allow soundtracks- as in movies. Or voice-over Illustration can be added. Above all, the annotation can be appended or inserted. The ebook of the near future, it is safe to say, will need as much instruction and tuition in using as driving an automobile. And, like the automobile, it will revolutionise. ",

Almost everything is in digital format today, and more often than not, even those who prefer things the old-fashioned way feel inclined to go to the Internet and assess your options first. Yeah, old-fashioned me found the convenience of e-books take over my love for paperbooks. I still adore them but I had to become practical. It all started from me being too lazy to step out of the house to downloading loads of e-books just because they were available and in the process I simply got accustomed to them because that is what technology does to people. It presents itself as the easiest and most viable option, always at your disposal. And over time, that becomes the only option you consider with the thrill of buying the newest book written by your favorite author being the only other one. But e-books don\u2019t get soiled over the years like paper books (although that musty smell adds to their charm), and neither does the issue of storage, cost, availability, or durability arise with them. With so many unparalleled advantages that e-books have, they will soon be prominent in every educational institution, completely erasing the need to study from a book. I haven\u2019t studied from a textbook in two years. And that is how the coming generations will be introduced to studies, which will only be carried on further with the mindset that everything is possible online, thus slowly rendering the old bulky book obsolete.

            "answer_text": "This is a hotly debated question, and one that I still go back and forth on. Here's where I land. Some physical books will ultimately be replaced by digital books, but others never will. I think that certain books will be replaced by digital copies. Textbooks are a big place where I see a real possibility of this taking place, even in the very near future. Textbooks are expensive to produce, and are quickly becoming more cost-prohibitive to purchase. Textbook resale also hurts producers, who can only profit on a physical copy once. Digital copies make it easier and cheaper to produce and update the same material, and to control distribution for the maximum payout. Same thing with reference books. The Encyclopedia Britannica is a great example. It takes several shelves to house in a library, it's expensive to produce and purchase, and the point of it is to provide clear and accurate information, not to create an experience. It, and other reference books like it, are perfect candidates for digitization.  I don't think we will ever truly transition children's books to digital. The physical action of turning pages and reading to a child from a real, tactile book is something that technology will never be able to replicate, and frankly, it's not even something most parents want. Digital children's books exist, sure, but they're not hugely popular. The same thing applies to many novels, to a lesser degree. The action of reading a physical book is sensual on many levels, and that's the point. The point of a novel is to create an imaginative, immersive, sensual experience which captivates the reader. Sometimes, perhaps even often, a digital copy is more convenient. Nevertheless, physical books will always be available to people who desire them -- and the demand will always be there. ",

Interestingly enough, recent (2017) statistics show that sales of the eBook are going down compared to printed books. Sales of consumer e-books plunged 17% in the U.K. in 2016, according to the Publishers Association. Sales of physical books and journals went up by 7% over the same period, while children's books surged 16%. The same trend is on display in the U.S., where e-book sales declined 18.7% over the first nine months of 2016, according to the Association of American Publishers. Paperback sales were up 7.5% over the same period, and hardback sales increased 4.1%. Source: CNN Other sources: Print Books vs. Ebooks: Who's Up, Who's Down, and Where Are We Headed? As someone who reads on both Kindle and physical books, eBooks for me win in terms of convenience and cost. You can even annotate, bring them out where ever you want, write down notes, etc. This makes for convenient reading - especially when you\u2019re on a crowded train and you don\u2019t have space to pull out a physical book. But nothing beats the tactile experience of thumbing through an actual book, smelling the fresh smell of the printed page and having them on display on your bookshelves. Physical books make for excellent conversation starters too! ",

There is still a vast majority in the world who rely on printed books for their reading material. And this is some consolation because the old-world charm of paper books and their emotional connect is something which is unique in itself. E books are most convenient, versatile and can accommodate large volumes of matter and maximum number of books in electronic form. You can read on the run and can be real fun too. You can switch books at the click of a button and can carry a library with you ! And many more advantages that one can think of. While welcoming the era of E books, I certainly miss the emotional experience with our good old paper books. I still love the printed books and continue to use them for my reading purpose.

But the kind of romance voracious readers have with their hard copies of books cannot be felt with Ebooks. You do not get to experience that wonderful smell, every time you open the book. I can proudly call myself a book sniffer, as that is the first thing I do whenever I open a new book.The elated feeling you get when you add a new book to your already stacked book shelf, I am sure ebooks can not give you that joy.Even after years when you open your old books, and find some things you wrote on them, always bring back some memories of the years gone by, and you get to time travel back to those times. E.g. Every time I open my copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and find the note \u2018Love, Papa\u2019 written on it, reminds me how my father had gone to the bookstore at 6 am in the morning on the day the book released, to surprise me with it.So, I am sure hard copies would never become obsolete, as they have much more emotional value attached to them.

I still remember walking down the aisles of book stores browsing through the books, reading through the synopsis of those that seem to be interesting and then finally picking the ones that are intriguing. When I got married, one pleasant surprise I got from my husband was to allot a separate room in our home dedicated to my entire collection of books. It is our mini library with books ranging from fictions, non fictions to even the comics that I collected since my childhood. However the collection has now come to a halt not because I have stopped reading but because I don\u2019t get to buy the books from the book stores. They are all mostly out of business in my city. The conventional reader in me still does not opt to read from an ebook. So I have stopped getting my collection of books and decided to get books from library instead. Having said that, I will always go for the paperback books whatsoever just for the emotions associated with it and still have the plans to gift a paperback book for my daughter on each of her birthday starting from this year (as she has just begun taking baby steps of reading this year)!!!

I ordered the very first Amazon Kindle the first day it was available because I traveled from California to Germany every six weeks, and I\u2019d often carry many paperbacks with me. Half the time, I\u2019d finish all my books on the way over and have nothing to read on the way back\u2014and there aren\u2019t many English-language bookstores in the area of Germany where I spent my time. I buy most of my books as e-books today because I can have dozens (hundreds! thousands!) of books with me on every plane flight I take. But given the choice, I prefer reading paper books. It\u2019s a more relaxing experience and it engages more of the senses. A ScienceDaily study actually showed that people get less emotionally engaged with e-books than with paper books. This isn\u2019t a \u201cyoung folks and their technology\u201d thing, either. Millennials\u2014both older millennials and college students\u2014prefer paper books to e-books by a much wider margin than their Gen-X and Boomer counterparts. (The Los Angeles Times cited a 2016 report showing that 92% of college students preferred paper books.) So\u2014can e-books replace paper books? In most cases, they probably could. If paper books disappeared tomorrow, with only Kindles and iPads and Kobo Readers left, people would read e-books. But will they? I believe it\u2019s unlikely: the younger generations simply like their dead trees too much. ",

Obviously they haven't, but at the same time, no one can tell you when you should use one or the other.  Maybe because I am not used to reading, and maybe because I don't have the large collection of books that other readers have from before ebooks, I love ebooks. I love the fact that the book I am reading is on me all the time, I don't even need an e-reader. I love that I have a dictionary right there. I love that I can clip, comment, rip the book apart and still leave it in tacked. I love at the end of the book, I can take the notes, as if they were the recorded meetings with the other and add them to my evernote, give them to anyone.

They are just a wonderful device. Easy to use. Ergonomically designed. Do not require charging. Can take some rough and tumble. Suit their purpose perfectly as in transmitting information into your brain ( assuming you have the language skills ). They also look good and are easy to store as they tend to be vaguely uniform in shape.  Ebooks have their place as well and I believe we will see more and more of them in the future but I doubt books will be replaced by them in my lifetime as they are such a good piece of design. ",

If paper books are replaced today by ebooks, then one day they too will be replaced by something more advanced. But at the same time, after laying low for sometime, they make a comeback. Take the example of Vinyl records, which are slowly coming back to our lives!!!  Each and everything has its own peculiar quality which makes it unique. I like to take advantages of both worlds. Paper books will be my all time favourite but I don't mind taking advantage of ebooks as well. While the first one adds a sense of belonging and so much pride in owing them. I buy them from bookstores or order them through sites like Amazon or rent books through online rental libraries such as ememozin. The second option (ebooks )makes life so much easier. So many things at one place small device.  The market trends shows that eBook reading is increased while paper books have decreased but I am sure paper books are here to remain. ",

Other stories claim that print book sales are up, but that's mostly due to the new rage for adult colouring books, which hardly counts. Basically, the more that high-resolution screens penetrate, the more that people use them for all of their media consumption including print. I certainly have given up on all of my print books, and there's almost no second-hand market or library willing to take most print books these days.  ",

And,we can't carry more than one book at a time. 3)It doesn't allow us flexibility to read. Hope,I have given some vivid answer to ur query. Thank you..!! ",
