            "answer_text": "As an ex employee of Indusnet I can say there is no stability, the outsiders just think about the perks but the employee evaluation is pretty bad. No buffer time in work. Money always can\u2019t be the only parameter of success but self-esteem, self-respect and dignity matters for me. I consider my time with Indusnet Techshu as a brutal training session of one man army, but learned a lot from them.I also got the opportunity to work with a lot of big Indian brands like SRMB TMT, Skipper, Birla Cement etc I would like to thank them for giving me this opportunity.
