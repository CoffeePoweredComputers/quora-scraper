            "answer_text": "Of course but most meditation is unclear of its purpose , even the founders of Buddhism really had no idea of the energy involved they knew the practices increased mental and physical heath made society better but they really did not know why , as an Evolutional Goodhist I see goodness as energy in its most efficient state in an energy driven universe where energy drives evolution as it seeks the most efficient use of itself , so the purpose of my meditation is to increase energy efficiency if we approach meditation in this manner we can choose our practice more wisely .

            "answer_text": "Yes you can learn meditation from a book. You also can learn meditation by joining or searching for a spiritual church. Spiritual churches are non denominational and they usually have a night where they have group meditation. My favorite way to meditate is by loading You Tube onto my tv. On You Tube I find a You Tube channel that has ocean sounds, rain sounds, the wind, or sounds of a fire place. When meditating focus on your breathing and try not to have your mind wander. If your mind starts to wander think that your thoughts are leaving on a boat and watch as that boat disappears into the distance. I am a life coach. I studied the success principals of the most successful people and entrepreneurs. They all follow many of the same success principals. Discover these principals (The Fifty Points Of Light) by contacting me at (562) 544\u20139039. The first 100 customers will only pay as much as the value they believe they get from each lesson for a total of 5 lessons. ",
