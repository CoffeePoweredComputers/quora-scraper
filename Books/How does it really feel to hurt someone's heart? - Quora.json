            "answer_text": "It feels bad. Really bad. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a lump somewhere in your heart, weighing you down. The closer you are to the person you hurt, the heavier it gets. True, it depends on the character of the said someone as there are people who can hurt others easily, but I personally believe human have compassion in their heart. No matter how stone cold your heart is, hurting someone bounds to hurt you back all the same. The bad news is, if you let it be, it\u2019ll going to haunt you for years and years. I made a mistake once, a very big mistake. It cost me my best friend and since then, our relationship is never been the same. I thought I was doing it for her own good when the truth was, I did more damage than helping her. I didn\u2019t know I was hurting her and when I knew, I was too afraid to apologize. I was scared that if I talked to her, I\u2019d see how much she hated me. So I kept avoiding her until I moved out. I thought I\u2019d forget her and moved on. I thought time would heal but\u2026 no. I could see clearly the pain in her eyes when she confronted me as if it happened yesterday and the memory still repeating itself over and over. The guilt eats me up every single day since then. I couldn\u2019t forgive myself for hurting her and for even thinking of forgetting her. And even now, more than six years later, I\u2019m still not in peace with myself and my memory. Hurting someone isn\u2019t a good thing to do, for you and for the one you hurt, no matter how \u2018big\u2019 and \u2018small\u2019. And if you did it, accidentally or not, I suggest you to apologize right away and free yourself from the pain. ",
