            "answer_text": "I believe they are all worth reading. I own every book in the series (the count is at 19 right now [not counting Road to Dune and Dreamer of Dune]) and have read them all multiple times. There are people who will tell you to only read the first 6 books that were published because Frank Herbert didn\u2019t write the rest of them. They are known as OH\u2019s (Orthodox Herbertarians) and believe that the books by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are far inferior and don\u2019t live up to Frank Herbert\u2019s legacy and therefore shouldn\u2019t be considered canon, just glorified fan-fiction. They have this mentality of \u201cFrank Herbert didn\u2019t write it so it can\u2019t be good\u201d so they start reading the book with a preconceived negative mentality about it and that in turn affects their ability to enjoy it, thus, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I disagree with them. These books are as much canon as the new Disney Star Wars movies are to to George Lucas\u2019 original franchise. Just because a property changes owners doesn\u2019t mean you can arbitrarily declare it no longer canon. These books have acquired what I like to call \u201cNickelback Syndrome\u201d. It\u2019s become cool to hate them and think that anyone who does happen to like them doesn\u2019t know anything about Frank Herbert, Dune, or good writing. That being said I feel the BH/KJA books are just as intricate and well written as FH\u2019s books. I will admit it can get a little slow at times, but that is to be expected in most genres of books. You can\u2019t get around the fact that sometimes you need to get through some exposition and background to properly setup a character, scene or story arc later in the book. So, my advice is to read the first 4 books (Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune) to gauge your interest in the Duniverse. If you liked what you read, then continue with the rest of the books. keep an open mind and I think you will enjoy them thoroughly as I have. ",

            "answer_text": "Overall, I wouldn\u2019t consider Frank Herbert to be a particularly commercial writer. Even at his best, his ideas are so complex, and arguably cynical (whether or not he was cynical himself) that it often takes some effort to read any of his work. Really, despite being a fan, I found it work to read through some of his shorter novels of about 100 pages. That said: Definitely read the original Dune. It\u2019s a true masterpiece, and was extremely groundbreaking in SF for not only its focus on the cultural influences of ecology, but the complex interaction of ecology, society, religion, economics and politics. And it is an extremely entertaining read and well worth the effort of understanding all its nuances. And it is probably Frank Herbert\u2019s most commercial work despite its complex themes (Dune series, or otherwise). The problem, if you start to read any of the sequels, is that they don\u2019t have particularly satisfying endings (and I\u2019m not complaining about a lack of a happy ending \u2014 I do mean a satisfying ending) \u2014 with the second book it does indeed become a \u201cseries\u201d \u2014 so you may find yourself reading the next book, and the next, each with diminishing returns, and no sense of satisfaction. And by the time you get to God Emperor of Dune you wind up with a real dud. It has some interesting ideas, and it\u2019s a testament to Herbert\u2019s ideas that I remained invested enough to make the effort to read through all the books, but trudging your way through God Emperor of Dune in particular is a real chore, especially when some of the characters become extremely annoying. And the subsequent books seem little more than the denouement to God Emperor, even though they were less of a chore to read. And that\u2019s coming from a reader who did acquire a taste for Frank Herbert books outside of just the Dune series. And, in my mind, Dune isn\u2019t the only series where Frank Herbert lost focus. I thought the same of his Destination: Void series. And while few did better to portray the alien than Herbert, I found that was sometimes at the expense of expressing any humanity in his works. I didn\u2019t bother reading the Kevin J Anderson / Brian Herbert novels, so I cannot give you advice on them. The only work by Brian I read was co-written with his father, and it came off as decent but one of Frank\u2019s lesser works. And the Kevin J Anderson solo Star Wars work felt to me like fan fiction. But I suppose it is possible that the two balance each other. ",
