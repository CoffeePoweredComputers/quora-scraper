            "answer_text": "Warning: this answer contains some disturbing content. Reader discretion is advised. Here goes nothing.  Think about your parents. Your parents are supposed to love you unconditionally. Whether you make a mistake, lie to them, break something of theirs, etc., they\u2019re supposed to always forgive you and always love you just as you are. Because love means never having to say you\u2019re sorry, right? Now think about this. Would your parents still love you if you\u2026 Got a tattoo?Came out to them as gay?Married someone they didn\u2019t like?Left your faith for another?Oh, come on. There\u2019s nothing wrong with any of those things. You do you, and if your parents don\u2019t like it, they\u2019ll just have to deal with it. They\u2019ll probably get over it in time. On to a different note. Would your parents still love you if you\u2026 Stole money from them to buy heroin?Drugged and raped someone while they were unconscious?Killed innocent children and teachers in a school shooting?Smashed a baby\u2019s head in so it wouldn\u2019t cry?Killed innocent women and made furniture from the skin?Kept a young girl in their care tied up and starving in the basement, and later forced her to shove coke bottles up her vagina\u2026in front of other children? If you were a parent\u2026 Would you love the ten-year-old girl that killed a six-month-old baby so it would stop crying? Would you love Ed Gein? Would you love the horrific woman who tortured and murdered sixteen-year-old Sylvia Likens over the course of three months? Would you love Adam Lanza?  I have an estranged aunt. She is not present at family gatherings. Her name comes up in the occasional family story. No emotion crosses my grandparents\u2019 eyes. My dad and uncle say her name as though it were any other. Lisa. She married a man. A terrible man. A man who was bad news, involved in crime and all sorts of things. I don\u2019t know exactly what, but I know he went to jail. This terrible man hurt my cousin. Left a tiny baby boy out in the cold. My dad beat the shit out of him once. She wanted to stay with him. She cut herself out of all our family photos. Lisa. I ask my dad, do you still love Lisa? No.  Some parents don\u2019t love their children for stupid reasons. Who cares if you\u2019re gay? Who cares if you get a tattoo? If you\u2019re happy, do whatever the fuck you want. But if you do something disgusting and immoral? Ruin the lives of many in service of yourself? Sure, they may love you for a while. But once you press your shoe into that baby\u2019s skull\u2026 Once you pull her panties down without asking\u2026 Once you press the knife into the skin and start to peel\u2026 They might not want to anymore.
