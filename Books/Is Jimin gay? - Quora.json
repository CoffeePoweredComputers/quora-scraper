            "answer_text": "hellooo I\u2019ve been an army for about five years and I wanted to answer this question. Being a closed minded seventh grader in 2015 the first thing I said when my sister introduced me to kpop in general was that all of these men were gay. I wanted to learn their names and got sucked into the whole of Bts. I watched as much videos as I can and I stayed updated and became a super fan. i never had a bias until save me where Jimin became my bias and Yoongi my bias wrecker. So as a Jimin stan I began to watch a lot of Jimin stuff. Being a a true kpop stan now I never question who was a gay but Jimin kinda made me begin to question him. He would openly flirt with the members, even when they came back to America and met with Tony whom they met through American Hustle life. A fan recorded them hugging him while saying good bye. Everyone gave tony a quick hug and Jimin hugged him for a long time and even lingered behind before they had to go with a smile on his face. During American hustle life Jimin dressed up in a A dress and hugged Tony\u2019s arm. Now yes we can say Jimin was happy to see Tony and all and that they were there to make a music video about girls but at the same time we have to remember Bts wasn\u2019t exactly themselves in 2013. If we go back to the video of them watching pass videos of themselves you can see the members say that they weren\u2019t them selves and some even suggested during that time Jimin was full of anger and he\u2019d get pissed really easily. Now time went by being an army and I\u2019d question it more and more I\u2019d even began to question Taehyung who says his favorite movie is \u201cCall me by your name\u201d which I warn is a very explicit gay movie between a young man and an older man who\u2019s room is connected by a bathroom. My mom watched the movie and she watched it with an open mouth the whole time. Once during pride month Taehyung came on live and even said some lines from \u201cCall me by your name\u201d. In the movie the main character who was questioning his sexuality put a red string around his wrist. After watching the movie we began to notice among Taehyung\u2019s many bracelets he had a red string tied around his wrist. Now lets move on since this is about Jimin lol. last but not least. The Army kit membership 2020. Now we know in Jimin\u2019s photoshoot he has tattoos on his arm. I never paid any attention to them until I bought the membership myself and watched the behind the scenes of the photoshoot. Jimin has a specific symbol on his arm which was the bigender/ bisexual symbol. During the behind the scenes you can see Jimin flaunt it in every way he can. He was pointing to something, he\u2019d make sure the symbol was showing. If he was showing us the \u201c L O V E\u201d He had drawn on his fingers he made sure the symbol was showing. Now we can see that the stylist didn\u2019t just draw them on him. He told the stylist what he wanted and he explained almost every drawn tattoo to the camera EXCEPT the Bi gender/ bi sexual symbol. im not trying to be a crazy fan or anything but either way if he's bisexual or not I\u2019m a supporter these are just my input. Don\u2019t attack me lol!! ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, young people in Korea who are gay aren\u2019t really open about it even if they\u2019re in a homosexual relationship as they don\u2019t want to face all the hate from conservatives (who are mostly the older generations). They\u2019re open about it with their group of friends and perhaps even their families, but usually they\u2019re a lot more silent about it than in the west. This is slowly changing with our generation, though. Kpop idols have a lot of pressure on them and careers can be ended overnight because of a scandal, which being gay would be over there. If Jimin, or any other kpop idol, would come out as gay he would lose a lot of korean fans and it would make BTS as a whole look bad and they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to perform in as many places or come to as many variety shows etc. (it sucks but it\u2019s just the way their society works). Because of this companies, like Bighit, don\u2019t approve of idols coming out and they work actively against that happening and hide evidence. They also have no choice but to say what their ideal \u201cgirl\u201d is since all male kpop stars get that question because the companies they\u2019ve signed with make them do it, and therefore that can\u2019t be used as evidence for them being straight or liking girls at all. I believe, as a bisexual guy, that most members in BTS aren\u2019t straight (honestly I think Jin is the only one). I think Jimin is either gay or bi, mostly because of how he acts around certain men (like when he was excited over how handsome Shawn Mendes was, and when he wanted to hug that guy for a long time whose name I don\u2019t remember and his overall behavior around him, being flattered when certain men are attracted to him, etc.). But of course we have absolutely no idea until they actually come out. Right now everything we think is just based on assumptions and stereotypes (this goes for both thinking they\u2019re gay or straight, or anything else). Assumptions and sterotypes.. At least for the most part. For example Suga has openly said in a Japanese interview he\u2019s not \u201climited to girls\u201d and he once rapped that he could make both guys and girls come with his tongue = confirmed bisexual/pansexual. Taehyung has worn a pride shirt and a \u201clegalize it\u201d hoodie, as well as many other things that he\u2019s done and said.. I\u2019m very convinced he\u2019s gay. Short answer: we don\u2019t know until they tell us, therefore we can\u2019t say or assume anything about their sexuality. What I do in every situation when I meet someone is that I just assume the person I\u2018ve met is \u201cpansexual\u201d until I know for sure whether they\u2019re straight, gay, bi, pan, or anything else. I don\u2019t talk about it with them unless they bring it up or want to share something, and I also don\u2019t say what I assumed and it\u2019s not something i obsess over. It simply doesn\u2019t matter unless you\u2019re trying to get in their pants. Just keep an open mind and don\u2019t expect anything, this goes for every person you meet/see.  ",
