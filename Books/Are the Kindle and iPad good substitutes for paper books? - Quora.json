            "answer_text": "I'm an avid reader but I'm a library dork. I like finding things to read serendipitously based on what is on the shelves or what a friend hands to me or what I get as advanced reader copies in the mail. I don't have a Kindle but I have an iphone and an ipad and have readers on those and just don't use them that much. They're fine, I just don't use them. No big deal, if other people are really into them I'm happy with that, I think reading's great and it doesn't really matter to me how other people do it for the most part. My personal opinion is that these devices turn reading into more of a commerce thing than a person-communing-with-books thing. So if you're someone who already was going out and buying books based on what looked good in the bookstore and reading them, this is not that much different from that. But if you're someone who deals in free culture situations where you use the library and friend networks to inform your reading habits, at least in my world, this doesn't happen. And can't happen because of how right of first sale doesn't translate to ebooks. The sharing that doesn't happen around ebooks [except in pirate/underground ways] is something that's important to my reading experience. And ebooks don't have the same place in the library world because of this. And that's a struggle. I know digital content is the future in many ways, but the DRM involved in ebooks right now is making it a non-starter for libraries. Moving to subscription/licensing models for permanent cultural repositories is no good, doesn't scale and doesn't right now seem like a good use of public money, at least in smalltown USA where I live. I know there are open standards for both ebooks and readers, but as long as we've got people trying to use a lot of DRM to preserve their revenue streams, the popular ebook market is all about shopping and buying and product and licensing and I can't really get beyond that to cuddle up to my ipad, no matter how convenient it may be otherwise.

            "answer_text": "I like dead-tree books. I have a room dedicated as a library. I have six shelves overflowing, and more stacked in the guest bedrooms. In the past five years I've moved to a new location five times. Let me tell you, packing, hauling, and unpacking the collection has been a great source of pain each year. Ever since I heard of the flexible e-ink technology way back in 2000 (http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/30/technology/flexible-displays-for-electronic-ink.html), I had been collecting digital copies of my dead-tree books. However, I wasn't looking forward to the day I can ditch this tortoise shell of dead-trees. I wasn't dreaming of wandering about nomadically, packing across country, laptop in one hand, ebooks in the other. I had something else in mind.I had always been curating a collection intended as an heirloom archive. Certain books are far more valuable preserved on the corpses of trees. And conversely, many books have no business being printed at all. These digital copies are a part of my overall archival plan. They complement my dead-tree collection because digital copies can do things that dead-tree copies cannot ... and likewise, dead-tree copies can do things that digital copies cannot. There's more to than simply feeling good about flipping through pages.  Some people have talked about kinesthetic experience of being able to flip back and forth among pages. As a kinesthetic learner, so this is much more important to me than for a visual learner. When I use my Kindle, I feel disconnected from the author. Maybe that's because the Kindle exposes badly written books. Or maybe, manipulating pages with my fingers helps me absorb information.  I also agree with Brewster Khale's efforts in backing up digital books with paper. (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/06/internet-archive-backs-up-digital-books-on-paper.ars). I can imagine a future where vested interests subtly and invisibly spin dangerous ideas. We're already seeing sanitized versions of Mark Twain. Unlike Wikipedia ,where a determined researcher can go through the revision logs, no such history exists for the different editions of Mark Twain's books. What will we find when we start seeing sanitized versions of other banned books? (http://www.banned-books.com/bblista-i.html) Ebooks are great for searching. Dead-tree books are great for browsing. Back before Border's folded, people would browse the Border's shelves and order books from Amazon. Trying to browse the collection on Amazon.com does not cut it, and it isn't just because Amazon's site has terrible UX. We're more likely to see commercial bookstores or libraries even look more like museums: a place where we can walk and mingle among artifacts in a curated collection, and when we stumble across a muse, we purchase instant copies on our portable electronic devices. So the Kindle and the iPad are not good substitutes for dead-tree books. However, these device can do things that dead-tree books will not ever do. When I got my second-generation Kindle, I checked out a copy of Hunger Games. Within reading the first chapter, I noticed something -- a highlight and annotation for a particularly good turn of phrase. \"1700 people have highlighted this.\" I try to maintain my allergy for group-think. When I read a book, I have a conversation of ideas between myself and the author. I avoid reading something simply because a number of people have upvoted it -- here, or at Reddit, or Y().news. Yet at the same time, I had not noticed this particular passage in Hunger Games. I had read it without thinking too deeply about it. Seeing that 1700 people highlighted it stopped me. I had to wonder, \"what made this passage poignant for 1700 people?\" Despite the dangers of group-think, I also saw potential here. Perhaps if we mediate highlights through Google+ circles and selectively share them. Perhaps if I read someone once through without shared annotations, then read it again with highlights. I may feel more connected to authors of dead-tree books, but when I use the Kindle, I feel more connected with other readers. Blogs started offering monthly Kindle subscriptions. (Example: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004SE1ZXU/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&camp=213381&creative=390973&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B004SE1ZXU&adid=13CWMK2M7D3CCD7KQ6MK&) I can catch up on these long-form blog posts without printing out reams of paper. However you skillfully design a blog layout, I prefer reading e-ink over screen. Furthermore, blog posts often contain hyperlinks elsewhere. I can click on the link and go to pages to check out what the author wants to say.  Blog articles published through Kindle can do this because the blog authors designed their writing to take hyperlinks into account. Authors of dead-tree books do not, though some have been experimenting with using QR-codes. What will we see when we publish books primarily as ebooks? Ebooks may supplant dead-tree books, but they do not, and will never replace dead-tree books. When we start focusing on the what ebooks do that dead-tree books cannot, then problems with the Kindle pops out.  The Kindle UI/UX sucks. If I click on a link in a blog viewer and it takes me to the browser, I have no easy way to hit \"back\". iPads don't have this problem since you can read the blog posts through the browser. You still depend on the blogger's ability to publish in a tablet-friendly format.Since I'm interested in curating and archiving my collection, I have my particularly quirky way of organizing my collection. The Kindle's UI/UX for managing collections blows. I cannot nest collections. The sorting has bugs. These issues tempt me to hack my Kindle and fix them.The Kindle is slow. The visible refresh rate of the screen and the lag in response makes working with the Kindle requires more patience. I lose my immersion in the book I'm reading. I'm reminded that I'm working a device rather than conversing with the author.When we stop thinking about substituting dead-tree books, we also start seeing new ways of interacting with books. For example, we'll see a form factor much like books where you flip them page by page, yet uses an active display and respond to touch.  And even still, I'll keep my collection of dead-tree books to do the things the Kindle cannot do: safeguard the transmission of tribal wisdom to future generations. ",

            "answer_text": "Paper books vs. eBooks is a great case study in why so many new technologies are underestimated at first and then go on to completely subsume legacy industries. We are all \"anchored\" to the technology we current use, so we look at new technology through that lens. This \"anchoring\" effect is applied in a few ways: Nostalgia - \"I grew up with books and love them. I would never read an eBook because the smell of paper reminds me of my grandfather's library.\"Assuming the new technology will never improve - \"eBooks will never catch on because that Kindle keyboard sure feels funny, and I'm not spending $199.\"Discounting new features - \"Who needs to buy a book over the air. I have always been perfectly fine driving down to the bookstore.\"Overweighting old features - \"eBooks will never catch on since their \"page numbers\" don't match the old ones.\"A good way to break through the anchoring effect is to ask, about the old technology, \"if it didn't already exist, would we invent it?\" So let's fast forward a few years and say that you grew up with eBooks and had never seen a paper book. This describes your world:  You could download and read almost any book, anywhere at any time. You only carry around a small eReader with all of your books, and you've never lugged a pile of textbooks anywhere in your life.You could play videos and sounds and interact with your book.  You click a word to look it up in the dictionary. You add comments and bookmarks and share with friends.  If you have vision problems, you'd just blow up the font, backlight the screen, or have the book read itself to you.  You can read it on your phone, tablet, PC, or a dedicated reader.  Then someone comes along and says, hey, I invented something better: it is called the paper book! Let me tell you about my new \"invention\":  You chop down some trees, put them on a truck, grind them up, dye the pulp white, make paper, run it all through a giant printing machine.You try to guess, over the next several months, how many of each \"book\" people will buy, and you print that many copies.You put the books on trucks and drive them around the country to \"stores\".The customer gets in a 1000-lb car, burns gas going from store to store trying to find the book they want (each store can only hold about 1% of all books.\"The book is so heavy you can only take a few on a trip with you.If you lose the book, it is gone forever.When done, you just leave it on a shelf and never touch it again, and they pile up or go to additional retail stores devoted to old books.  If the stores order too many books or can't get rid of the old ones, they go to the landfill.  You'd laugh at them. How could anyone possibly think this is a good idea? We grew up with paper books, which gives us a certain nostalgia for the feel of the paper and the smell of the ink. That will fade over the next decade, and paper books will become vinyl records: interesting to collectors but irrelevant to anybody else. ",

            "answer_text": "Regardless of which you prefer, the Amazon Kindle (product) or the iPad, they will never replace a solid book. The feel of the paper. The smell when you crack the binding. There is something inherently magical about opening a real book and reading those first pages. Feeling the paper between your fingers. I am a serious reader. I have a weird habit of smelling my books before I read them to get adjusted to their history. That doesn't transition into the digital world. You can't notice the rough edges of a Kindle book. There is no protocol for noticing the unique texture of an iPad book. There are certain living parts of a book that only exist in real paper. Carlos Ruiz Zafon wrote about a graveyard of books where the forgotten books go to be remembered. That's what I think about when it comes to the iPad or Kindle. there is a certain romance to feeling the weight or texture to a book you are about to read. A real connection in the nuances of flavor. You can tell if a publisher is cheap or dedicated by the weight of paper. These are important qualities. Digital content is for penny novels and the sporadic reader. If you are truly dedicated you will sacrifice some trees and break the spine in order to discover a new world. It is worth every memory to smell the beauty that lies within a newly cracked book. Forget the digital world. It is a cheap knock off of the real thing. Tangible is the only reality that can affect our living world. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to be like Eunji Choi, but I have embraced the Kindle. It has made me an even more avid reader. I think that before I had one, I overweighted certain characteristics of physical books and failed to consider certain characteristics of the Kindle. In particular, I think I nostalgically romanticized the physical characteristics of a book -- the feel/smell of the paper, the heft of the volume itself.  For a long time, I have disliked reading hardcover books because they're so bulky, but somehow I didn't extend this to paperbacks.  But once I had a Kindle, I realized that an even lighter, slimmer reading experience was worth it.  Regarding the Kindle itself, here are the elements I have grown to love: Portability.  Yes, real books are portable, but the Kindle works better in some environments like the gym, since real books tend to snap shut, turn the page, or slide off when they're sitting on the elliptical.  And, as mentioned, it's so lightweight and slim that it fits in a normal-sized purse.Never running out of something to read/instant gratification.  I guess I understood the fact that you could load up your Kindle with books before a vacation or whatever, but I didn't really appreciate that you could, for example, read a review in the Sunday NYT and instantly zap it to your device.  It is deeply fulfilling.  Yes, I know going to Amazon and ordering the real book isn't exactly hard, but this is that much easier.Reading something embarrassing without everyone knowing.  I never thought of this before I owned it, but the Kindle lets literary snobs read, for example, the Twilight series, without everyone else knowing. Speed.  I am not sure exactly why this is, but I read books faster on the Kindle, and the faster I read, the more books I can read in my numbered days, and that makes my mind feel sharper and less prone to Alzheimer's.  This may be because it shows you what percentage you've read, and that makes me feel motivated to keep going.  I know that you can tell how far you are through a real book, but this somehow keeps me moving better.Kindle Shortcomings I prefer bookmarking/taking notes in real books, even though the Kindle lets you do this.  I find it easier to skim back to find things I had read in a real book.  Updated on 7/9/10: I wanted to add that that this is now my major gripe with the Kindle.  I've read a couple of longer, more complicated books on the Kindle lately (The Passage by Justin Cronin and The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet by David Mitchell), and I dislike the inability to flip back easily to an earlier part of the book.  Sure, you can bookmark things as you go along -- if they're obviously important (such as the map that appears in The Passage), but in well-crafted fiction, the author often mentions something early in a book that you don't realize will pay off later, and it's very hard to flip back to it on the Kindle, whereas it's much easier in a physical book. You also can't let someone borrow a Kindle book, but if you and, say, your spouse both have Kindles, you can trade them from time to time. One final note: I like that the Kindle doesn't have other capabilities like the iPad does.  It keeps me reading more, rather than getting distracted.  I suspect most other people will prefer the additional features of the iPad, which is probably not good news for writers. ",

            "answer_text": "My wife, children, and I probably have about 6,000 books between us.  I am beyond the stage where it has become worthwhile to actually track them - I have, however, just wandered round the house, and counted 43 bookcases. I'm also a techy - I've been programming computers for about 30 years, and my degrees are in mathematics and computation, so I'm not frightened of bits rather than atoms. There are a number of good answers already, giving functional reasons why ebooks have advantages over paper books. I will not argue with these - I am perfectly willing to accept that the advantages of having ones library to hand are huge, and searchability and annotation is clearly better with the ebook format. Please, therefore take it as read that I do 'get it', and this is my explanation as to why, for me, these reasons aren't enough. 1: The availability argument I've bought two books in the last week. Neither would have been (as far as I can tell) available for either Kindle or iPad Exhibit A - 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance', which (mea culpa) I'd never actually got around to buying until Friday. As far as I can make out from Amazon UK, it's not actually available for the Kindle. A quick Google search shows that I could download a free epub, but I'm not sure that this would be legal, and it's not at all clear that the top results have the author/publishers approval. (Bear in mind that the copyright period for books is longer in my country than in the USA.) Exhibit B - Go the F**k to sleep - a spoof children's book (bought on a recommendation through Quora), that is hilarious, but the beauty is in the illustrations, not just the text (of which there are probably fewer than 1000 words.) The resolution of the screen I'm typing this on (a 19 inch laptop) is lower than that of the printed page. 2: The economic argument Yes, I'm aware that, when I wanted Wikinomics, or The Long Tail, or ReWork, then the Kindle editions would have been cheaper. However, here in the UK, ebooks appear to be about 20% cheaper than the dead tree versions. However, about 50% of what I've got in my library was bought second-hand. Typically for \u00a31-2 per book. This means that, based on my current library, it would have cost about \u00a325,000 more to have the books bought as ebooks than the way I actually did it. Quite aside from that, if I could ever bring myself to sell some books, the paper version's resale values are (just) non-zero, which makes the 20% price gap feel lower still... ... or (as I tend to do with the duplicates that inevitably appear) I could donate them to a local charity, making them some money. I don't believe that I could do that with the Kindle version. But, to be honest, the economic argument is a bit of a red herring. Books are sufficiently cheap IN ANY FORMAT, that the actual cost of acquisition is nothing like the limit to my reading. 3: The format wars Remember laserdisks? I do - I still have about 50 - including the original Star Wars Trilogy. I really ought to get around to buying them on DVD, or should I replace my DVD player, TV, and processor, and move to Blu-Ray, or actually will a download from iTunes be my best bet??? All I know is that the investment I made isn't actually playable on any kit currently set up in my house. Oh, and about the kit 'not set up', it applies to hardware as well as software - I have a Dolby ProLogic processor in a crate in the garage. Make me an offer? I thought not. I am concerned that the same would happen to ebooks. The dead tree book - 'A Day in Fairyland - that my mother recently gave to my daughter, however... the one that her father gave to her when she was a small girl... now that is still readable. Now, I am told by people more knowledgeable than me about the current state of the technology, that 'a good solution exists.' I'm sure that, at some time, I'll buy an ebook reader, but THAT'S the point at which I'll ask them what that solution is :-) 4: The real reason The reasons above are, of course, sophistry. Anyone with any background in sales realises that we all make decisions emotionally, and then look to construct a backstory to justify what we did :-) Books just do it for me... They aren't just about the words, it's not just the combination of letters, it's the whole experience thing. Midnight at the Well of Souls was set on a Markovian planet only as far as Nathan Brazil was concerned... as far as I am concerned, it was set on the deck of the Brindisi-Patras ferry, on the voyage from the south of Italy to the West of Greece, in the summer of 1991, while resting on my backpack... it was preceded by haggling with an Italian ferry operator about the best price, and was followed by finding a phone box from which I could make the weekly phone call to my mum and reassure her I was fine (this was 1991, remember.)... oh, and in that phone call learning that a last-minute room in college had become available for my final year at Oxford, and mum had told the college that I would definitely take it! Now, maybe I'd get the same resonance from simply thinking of the title.... but here, in my hand now, it falls open on page 198 (the Penguin edition - 'We're in some kind of trouble', Nathan Brazil says.... The cover is typical sci-fi - you get the feeling that the artist read a few pages of the story, or got a list of keywords (though it's better than some), but the crease, ah the crease.  And that, dear reader, is the end-game, the killer argument. I am a Bibliophile as well as a lectoholic and an infovore... I'm a hopeless minority, sidelined by 40, and locked into a set of technologies that have had their few centuries in the limelight, but really need to fade into the wings and let the new bright young things come out to play. Books are, alas, the Eric Clapton in a world where Justin Bieber is King. But I'm happy. So, no, for me, the Kindle and iPad are not good substitutes for paper books. (This, too, shall pass.) ",

I love paper books and many older titles are not available electronically, so ebooks are not any kind of substitute for those.I live in the same city as Powell's Books, the greatest English language bookstore in the world, and no one has yet invented a browsing experience for ebooks that even approaches the joy of browsing a great brick-and-mortar bookstore.I own thousands of paper books, and browsing my own book collection is more fun than scrolling down a screen.Sometimes copyright / publishing issues make an ebook that I want unavailable in my country (I can always lay my hands on a paper copy if I'm willing to wait for overseas shipment).It's much easier and more fun to browse within a book when you can flip paper pages.As Erica points out, censorship is often an issue when a distributor decides that certain kinds of content are somehow less worthy.Having said that...  I own enough paper books that I often can't immediately lay my hands on the one I am looking for, which is annoying, and not a problem with an ebook.I travel a lot (and for the past two years and the next two years at least I have two residences), but my ebooks are always \"there,\" wherever I am.I'm greedy, and I like knowing that I have a huge number of books to choose from whenever I want to read. For this reason, I've given up on Kindles, because I fill them up! I now do most of my ebook reading using the Kindle app either on my iPhone 6 or my iPad Mini, which both have sufficient capacity that I will never fill either of them up with books. (The first generation Kindle came with an expansion slot for a memory card. That's the only Kindle I never filled up.)I like to read in bed at night, and I can read as much as I want without having to have an unstable pile of books on the nightstand.I'll always love and own a lot of paper books, but in recent years I've begun duplicating some of my paper book collection in ebooks, just so I can read them wherever I am in the world. I couldn't do without either format these days, and I'm glad I don't have to choose one or the other exclusively. ",

            "answer_text": "The Good.I didn't want any propriety book reader like the Kindle so I started with a Kobo reader and said \"well I still like the feel, the experience of paper books\".  I read on the Ipad and on an Android phone (Motorola Atrix).  I have broken two Kobos through negligence (stacking stuff on top of them in a book bag).  Over time, I've lost any real attachment to paper books.  I now read, almost exclusively on the Ipad.  I read from a variety of places - kobo books, ibooks, books on board, ebooks, - mostly of which require separate apps. Only recently did I find the Kindle app, and I've enjoyed their variety of books.Why did I leave paper books behind?  Convenience and Variety.  I can buy books from anywhere in the world and read them immediately.  Just reading a book review and instantly go get that book is wonderful.I now have hundreds of books on my ipad, many I had never seen before, some I had read over the years but lost track of, some I would never have taken from a library or bookstore. I can read them anywhere, at a restaurant, a bench, Yes I did all that with paper books but I carry ALL my books anywhere I go.  I switch between them, reading 10 books at the same time, or open a new one I bought long ago and forgot all about.  And let's include magazines.  I love many magazines but I would only read them at one sitting or they would get lost or pile up.  I subscribe to the ones I truly like, and they download each week (or month) with miminal effort. The BadThe ipad is a computer so it is reading on a computer (so is the android phone). The kobo and the kindle are e-readers which employ a special e-ink (yes it is a lame name) that makes it much easier to read.  You actually need a book light as it is not backlit which would make the e-ink irrelevant.  I don't get tired reading on the ipad but I can appreciate that many people don't want to be staring at a computer screen. The UglyThe Ipad is Apple.  So they make annoying rules to try to force you buy ibooks. The other bookstores can no longer take orders through the ipad (you have to go their web pages) because Apple decided they should pay 30% for the privledge of ordering through the ipad.  As that is exactly the entire profit margin, they all had to remove that functionality.  It's just stupid.  I try very hard to never buy from ibooks.  Going to a web page on the ipad is only a little annoying and then they download easily.  The exception is downloading Books on Board (to the Bluefire Reader) which is a little complicated but manageable).The kindle only allows you to buy from Amazon though you can do a conversion of epubs and get them loaded.The kobo is agnostic (except for Kindle format) but to load books from anywhere but the Kobo store is a bit of a pain. So I buy from the websites, use the Kobo app, the Kindle app, the Bluefire reader and a number of others and I like it very much. All in all, if I have a choice, I get the ebook. ",

            "answer_text": "One thing about reading on devices: the backlighting might not be so good for you.  I am an avid kindle fan, and read books across all my devices. But I try never to read from my iPad at night.  According to several studies, the light emitted from some screens (tablets, smartphones, televisions) can disrupt your sleep patterns. (http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) This is because light with a blue wavelength (the kind of light emitted from most backlit devices) can disrupt the production of melatonin in your brain, fool your brain into thinking it's daytime, and thus disrupt your circadian rhythms.  Reading from a paper book or a device with e-ink does not have the same effects (provided you are using a non-blue light to read by.) http://authoritynutrition.com/block-blue-light-to-sleep-better/  In fact the American Medical Association \"Recognizes that exposure to excessive light at night, including extended use of various electronic media, can disrupt sleep or exacerbate sleep disorders, especially in children and adolescents. This effect can be minimized by using dim red lighting in the nighttime bedroom environment.\"https://download.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/csaph/x-pub/a12-csaph4-lightpollution-summary.pdf?cb=1443043725&retrieve=yes So if, like me, you tend to read at night before you go to sleep, reading from a tablet or phone could mean you're not getting the best rest you can get.

The optimum device is now the Google Nexus 7 http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/07/divine-intervention-googles-nexus-7-is-a-fantastic-200-tablet/ But  it does not have an SD Card slot and the USB does not work with Thumb  Drives.  Not accidental.  The answer is the Kingston Wi-Drive. According to xda-dev it is possible to \"root\" the Nexus 7 and use stickdrive to add storage via the USB port.=================================================== I have been using an Archos PMA400 for years.  It is smaller than a 300 page paperback.  The only problem for reading is having to hit a button to update the screen.  A speed controlled automatic scroll would be a tremendous improvement but I still prefer it to a book.     It does not play Flash or Divx files so my next step is a Sensation 4G smartphone which is 16 times as powerful, bigger and better screen and camera.  This stuff is fantastic. But for a textbook replacement I would prefer a bigger tablet.  Books are obsolete it is just a matter of time. A Kindle is a VON NEUMANN MACHINE! An iPad is a VON NEUMANN MACHINE! My PMA400 is a VON NEUMANN MACHINE! www.youtube (dot) com/watch?v=7dg96tefnEU The brand name of these devices is irrelevant.  Which consumers like or dislike which devices is EXTREMELY SUBJECTIVE. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm actually surprised to see these answers. I own an iPad, and I read a lot more now than I have before. I consider myself a pretty voracious reader, and I have become even more of an enthusiast since owning an iPad. I have used a friend's nook and a friend's kindle in the past and would say the iPad trumps all other reading methods. It has the portability of an e-book reader (albeit slightly larger and heavier) in addition to the book selection (kindle for iPad app). The Apple iBooks app has a gorgeous interface that mimics real books (color pictures and everything if you have kids or like them yourself), but unfortunately, a paltry number of books. It's better than reading a real book because you can pretty much lie or sit in any position holding your iPad whereas with a book you can't exactly lie flat on your back holding the book above your head (try it, your arms get tired) the way you can with an iPad.  I would encourage anyone who hasn't actually used an iPad or an e-book reader to try it out. One of the reasons I got an iPad is because a friend had told me she read so much more with her nook (I was extremely doubtful myself as well). I found her assessment to be accurate. The backlight on the screen hasn't bothered me once yet, and I have read a whole book in one night on it.  As someone who still buys cds and dvds, I would agree that there's something to be said about owning books. Your book collection says a lot about you (in my opinion), and I have always been the type to flag certain passages that I find particularly lucid in some of my favorite books. I would say on the whole, however, that I am extremely satisfied reading on my iPad and read a lot more because of it. ",

            "answer_text": "I really like the Kindle.  I travel quite a bit and it's great to be able to take lots of books around without all the weight they would have in print form.  I like the ability to change font size.  Sure, you don't get the look, feel and smell of a printed book, but it's more than made up for by the convenience factor.  Plus the books are cheaper. And there's the Whispersnyc technology which works very well. Overall it's great value for money There are some drawbacks, however.  For example, I am a keen student of military history.  I find that books with maps and photographs do not transfer well to the Kindle itself, the resolution is not good enough.  But they are OK on the MacBook I use (I don't have an iPad so I can't comment on it). Sometimes older books have not been transferred to the eBook format very well and they suffer from typos, which is most unfortunate.  I have complained to Amazon about this. ",

            "answer_text": "Like many changes of the last few hundred years, the move from reading and capturing knowledge from a three-dimensional object (book) to a two-dimensional screen strikes me as a shift that will require adaptation by our brains.  Reading a book, for me, has an element of three-dimensional experience.  I can remember what happened in the plot based on how thick the left and right sides of the book were at the time.  The little bar at the bottom of an e-book doesn't quite do that for me, yet.   I am also interested in the research about reading retention rates (http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2012/03/21/speed-and-retention-are-e-readers-slower-and-more-forgetful/).   Wouldn't it be interesting to do an FMRI on someone using a book vs an e-reader?  Some peoples brains may adapt more quickly, so they may survive and thrive in our environment of competitive information consumption.   I recently experienced a classroom that had gone mostly paperless.  It was a little unsettling to me to see the students doing their math \"worksheets\" on their tablets then switch to reading a history assignment - great for conservation, a bit jarring relative to my school experience.   Then what about shared cultural narratives around reading?  Like Abraham Lincoln reading books by candlelight.  Where will the next knowledge-hungry young person of little means be able to find a 50-cent used book to carry home and read on the bus or by flashlight under the covers when there is no power?  No one would try to steal it either. ",

I currently live in a small, rented room which simply doesn't have the space I need to put all the books that I left at my family's house on display, or even in storage.  With electronic media I can enjoy all of them as well as my comics and manga collections in one place, that I can also take with me, while listening to some music appropriate to the thing I'm reading, and then can quickly switch to the next book/chapter/whatever. It's a no-brainer that I like books, but I also have a habit of giving books away once I'm done with them,  making re-reading opportunities scarce. With a tablet or phone I could simply read them again, all while allowing my printed books to proliferate. Of course, none of the statements in favor of print media are wrong, and as we move ever forward in this world print media and electronic media are going to be more interspersed with each other than ever before.

You know, those cheap paperbacks you get and carry around with you and ultimately end up donating to the library?

What they absolute do not replace is the thoughtfully printed book. Well-bound, well-set books are not going anywhere because they are an art and an experience unto themselves. These are the books I think people are really attached to, and will live on no matter how compelling e-books become. ",

After all, your smartphone is already part of your everiday luggage, right?... Or, even if you don't fancy e-paper, it's still thousands of books on the size and weight of ONE thin paper book. Worth a thought, don't you think? Because e-paper looks and feels like real paper, the \"feeling\" argument is somewhat diminished - but I know many people still strongly attach to it: maybe they'll be sensible to the next point?Ecology: So, saving a lot of trees says nothing to you?...do you really have to cling on to paper?... You know, ideas aren't any more effective and palpable because you read them from a piece od cellulose material... You could hear them, see them on TV, or read them anywhere - their punch and value should be the same... Or not?...Cost, money, dollars, euros, yen, pounds, dirhams, whatever currency you use: savings appeal to you?... E-books are cheaper, period. There are more arguments, however book totters will say they prefer paper ... Because.  P.S.  I believe this post is IAW the Quora guidelines. If not, please excuse me, I hate little petty tyranny. It may well be that I'm not mentally formatted for mental and expression regulations. Please expel me from Quora if I appear to be a chronically \"non-conformant\" person. A rocket scientist *may* not be needed to explain this... This rant will auto-dosintegrate on indifference, thanks. ",

The invention of e-readers, however, is good in that it limits which books I will actually purchase in print because I actually want them on my shelf. Sometimes, I will read a book on my kindle and love it so much that I seek out the actual book so that I can have it on my shelf and/or loan it out to friends. With e-readers, unless you're collecting illegal/pirated copies of the book, it is impossible to loan out the book without giving someone access to your cloud or your account passwords or giving them your e-reader/tablet which just seems silly. Also, items like the Kindle Fire and iPad are more than just a way to read books electronically. They serve as multimedia tablets and therefore comparing them to actual books seems kind of a moot point. ",

            "answer_text": "In a world of intrusive technology, we must engage in a kind of struggle if we wish to sustain moments of solitude. PhotoThis answer is by one of my favourite authors - Mohsin Hamid. The advantages of e-books are clear. E-books are immediate. Sitting at home in Pakistan, I can read an intriguing review of a book, one not yet in stores here, and with the click of a button be reading that book in an instant. E-books are also incorporeal. While traveling, which I do frequently, I can bring along several volumes, weightless and indeed without volume, thereby enabling me to pack only a carry-on bag. Nonetheless, often I prefer reading to e-reading. Or rather, given that the dominance of paper can no longer be assumed, p-reading to e-. I think my reasons are related to the fact that I have disabled the browser on my mobile phone. I haven\u2019t deleted it. Instead, I\u2019ve used the restrictions feature in my phone\u2019s operating system to hide the browser, requiring me to enter a code to expose and enable it. I can use the browser when I find it necessary to browse. But, for the most part, this setting serves as a reminder to question manufactured desires, to resist unless I have good cause. Similarly, I have switched my email account from the attention- and battery-consuming \u201cpush\u201d setting to the less frenzied manual one. Emails are fetched when I want them to be, which is not all that often. And the browser on my slender fruit-knife of a laptop now contains a readout that reminds (or is it warns?) me how much time I have spent online. Time is our most precious currency. So it\u2019s significant that we are being encouraged, wherever possible, to think of our attention not as expenditure but as consumption. This blurring of labor and entertainment forms the basis, for example, of the financial alchemy that conjures deca-billion-dollar valuations for social-networking companies. I crave technology, connectivity. But I crave solitude too. As we enter the cyborg era, as we begin the physical shift to human-machine hybrid, there will be those who embrace this epochal change, happily swapping cranial space for built-in processors. There will be others who reject the new ways entirely, perhaps even waging holy war against them, with little chance \u2014 in the face of drones that operate autonomously while unconcerned shareholding populations post selfies and status updates \u2014 of success. And there will be people like me, with our powered exoskeletons left often in the closet, able to leap over buildings when the mood strikes us, but also prone to wandering naked and feeling the sand of a beach between our puny toes. In a world of intrusive technology, we must engage in a kind of struggle if we wish to sustain moments of solitude. E-reading opens the door to distraction. It invites connectivity and clicking and purchasing. The closed network of a printed book, on the other hand, seems to offer greater serenity. It harks back to a pre-jacked-in age. Cloth, paper, ink: For these read helmet, cuirass, shield. They afford a degree of protection and make possible a less intermediated, less fractured experience. They guard our aloneness. That is why I love them, and why I read printed books still. ",

Working in a field where you either constantly improve and learn or you GTFO, meant that I was carrying 2-3 300+ page books with me when I traveled. My office was also quickly being taken over by a quickly outdated library of technology books.  Moving to digital meant saving money and space. I started with a Kindle but since I mainly read nonfiction technical books, it wasn't the right solution for me. The iPad has now replaced all physical books except the rare book that's not available digitally and enables me to read research papers on the same device. I couldn't see going back to physical books now, the convenience of using an iPad out weighs any negatives that there might be. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Do you prefer the film or stage version of \"West Side Story\"?\" I ask this question as a rough parallel to your own, in that it does a disservice to the value of both media, when we present them as \"either/or\" propositions. The Kindle (in my opinion, the superior e-book reading option to date, by virtue of e-ink, HW/SW offering, and available titles) provides me with a readily portable and vast library of reading options. I can now catch up on magazine articles, PDF papers and presentations, and other books I might not usually appreciate in \"paper\" form. I purchased my Kindle (DX), in order to read new books, listen to Audible books, and transport my \"work\" reading with me in a digital format. I find myself using it for the last of these with great success, as well as for reading non-fiction titles that I previously thought myself to have no interest in. I have yet to read fiction, simply because I have little time left to do so! (re. Audible books, I have discovered, much to my chagrin, that I'm not a \"books-on-tape\" kinda guy...my mind wanders!). Meanwhile, I am surprised when I find myself holding a hard copy publication: if it is non-fiction, magazine, newspaper, or other form of \"informational\" publication, I yearn for the ease of use of my Kindle, which lets me pause my reading at my leisure, switch publications with ease, and manage my \"info downloading\" on my terms. I still enjoy, however, the pleasure of \"leafing\" through a favorite tome, discovering long-cherished passages as I hop around the narrative in a manner that the Kindle does not yet permit. So, in much the same way that I thoroughly enjoy Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, and Rita Moreno in Jerome Robbins' classic film, I am thrilled in an altogether different way when I have the chance to attend a great live performance of \"West Side Story\" on stage. My experience, at each instance, is uniquely different from the other, but no less valuable to me. I hope that we can find a place in our literary lives to recognize the enormous value brought by the advent of e-book readers: socially, creatively, intellectually, economically, and environmentally. This does not diminish my continued hope that we shall never think it \"efficient\" to dispose of altogether those books that sit in treasured repose on our private and public shelves. ",

The kindle is too slow for any \"reference\" book where you'd want to flip through, and kind of clunky to random-access search.  I'd prefer html on a computer, or iPad, for those kind of documents. The Kindle DX is currently my favorite novel/biography/sequential-type book reading device.  The only negative is it's too big to carry in a pocket; it basically requires a case and a bag.  I purchased a 13\" bag just for iPad and Kindle DX use. For the iPad, the Kindle app is vastly superior to Apple's iBooks -- I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon ends up winning the \"book marketplace\" market on all platforms. The only books I'll buy in hardcopy are \"art\" books, or books unavailable in ebook format (I'd take a bad scanned PDF though), or books where the Kindle book is priced at $30-50 and a used physical copy is $4.

I can keep 1,000+ books in a package that weighs less than a pound, or two, and can fit in a note folder. It keeps my notes, bookmarks, and page places for several books. And, I can travel with nearly my whole library in one small package (two actually as I use a Keyboard in daylight & an HD at night)! Regretfully, I have many physical books that I'd like to be on Kindle. Some are, but at full price with no pre-owner discount, or are not present at all. ",

I bought a Spanish -> English electronic dictionary for my Kindle, and now when I read a book in Spanish and I come across an unfamiliar word, all I have to do is touch the word and I get the English definition for it. It's wonderful in that regard! Trying to read a foreign language book in paper, with a paper dictionary at my side, is tedious and I quickly lose the momentum of the story due to having to pause and look up words. With the Kindle Touch I do slow down to look up a word, but I don't lose the thread of the story. ",

It makes reading a series of book a lot easier.3) FREE books :)  There are almost always about 10 free books for the kindle that you can browse through.   ",

MyPustak is a platform that provide books for free. You can also donate books on the site. Buying paper books is better than buying kindle for many reasons. You don't have to strain your eyes on electronic appliances and obviously the feeling of paper books are much better. ",

However, it does have it's advantages: reading in bed using one hand, carrying copious amounts of books with you when you travel, reading in the tub with Kindle in a plastic bag (you know, in case you fall asleep or drop it), books tend to be cheaper when compared with actual books from Amazon.com, and books are delivered within seconds... no waiting or driving.    I prefer reading on the Kindle when compared to the iPad because at least with the Kindle I forget very quickly that I'm not reading an actual book.  The iPad feels too much like I'm just staring at a computer screen, and I hate reading anything meant for enjoyment that way. ",

Despite stereotypes to the contrary, reading is not a solitary persuit, at least for me. It is a highly social one. A book that exists only in a format that I cannot transfer easily to others is a book that has lost a significant amount of its appeal to me. Also, I worry about the permanence of the medium. I can still read a book that was printed on paper and bound in leather three hundred years ago. It is not reasonable to expect to be able to do that with books disseminated in electronic formats. ",
