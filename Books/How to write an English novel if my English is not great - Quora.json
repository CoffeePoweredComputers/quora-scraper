            "answer_text": "I write in Finnish, but the venue for my stories is Italy 1250-2000. I know very little Italian, even though I have sung a couple of operas in Italian. To get in the mood, I watch Italian films, in Finland they are not spoken in Finnish, so I hear the rhythm of the language, its feel and the taste of life. And I'm watching Sophia Lorenia. I would watch Sophia Loren even if I didn\u2019t write. If I live I watch Sophia Loren. If I do not look at Sophia Lorenia I'm dead. Life is Sophia Loren. ",
