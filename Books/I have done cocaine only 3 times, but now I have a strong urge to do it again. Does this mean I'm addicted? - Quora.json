            "answer_text": "There are several different conditions that we consider addictions, and each family of \u201caddictive\u201d drugs interacts with them differently. Think about each of these and decide how they apply to you. Rebound. if you enjoy the way you feel on cocaine, this means that you don\u2019t enjoy the way you feel without it. Rebound is where you start feeling like you just can\u2019t live life the way you want to without a drug. If you start thinking \u201cI\u2019m going to need this drug to make it through this\u201d, then you have this form of addiction. Conditioning: Opioids will rewire the brain so that, when you consider what would make you happy, the opioid will feel, emotionally, like a far better idea than it really is. Alcohol does this, too. This is primarily an issue with alcohol and heroin, but can be found in dopamine agonists like cocaine, too. Withdrawal. You\u2019ve probably had a hangover. Some of us crawl under the covers and wait for the hangover to go away. Others try hair of the dog. This probably isn\u2019t your problem, but it\u2019s a strong contributor for nicotine and methamphetamine. The Rational Belief That The Drug Is Useful. This is actually the opposite of an addiction, but it needs to be teased away from the other factors in order to recognize which components of your desire to do it again are actually the addiction taking hold. The biggest issue with the world\u2019s dialog regarding drugs is the idea that there are no rational reasons to be taking drugs. There\u2019s no rational reason to want to be happy, either, when you think about it. This mentality makes it difficult if not impossible to recognize an addiction because, for drugs without major corporate sponsorship, any desire to use them can be called an addiction. ",

If you can stay strong & never do it again ~ you will save yourself a ton of heartache and the ones who love you a ton of heartache IF YOU NEVER DO IT AGAIN .

You are now at the crossroads of addiction. Please don't take that left turn but take the right one. RIDE THROUGH THE URGE TO DO COCAINE....I am a recovering cocaine addict please don't ever do it again. I lost a lot in my life because of cocaine and I'm not talking materially either. I don't think you or anybody else is ready to lose what I've lost because of cocaine. I did powder coke I did crack Coke none of it none of it is good for you and both of it will take your life in one way or another. Take the right turn before it takes on a life of its own in addiction. If you have any questions about my personal journey through addiction and women on the streets message me. ",
