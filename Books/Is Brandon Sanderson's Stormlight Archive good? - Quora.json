            "answer_text": "I am really opening myself up to criticism here, so let me begin with a reminder that whether ANY novel is \"good\" is a very subjective matter.  Let me ALSO state that I know Brandon, LOVE his work, and while we're only acquaintances, I've interacted with him primarily though his writing as a TA for his classes.  FIRST PRO: the concept of the Stormlight Archive is brilliant. As most of his books are actually intertwined and take place in the same universe, this series--where other characters from other works and overall story arcs begin to come together--is just breathtaking in scope.  It's really fun to read this series and recognize plot lines and characters you've seen hinted at before.  FIRST CON: This can also make the books very much about inside jokes and fan service. He manages it well, but as someone whose read his works before they were even published, it was strange to have to go to the Internet to tease out things in the Stormlight Archive books that even I didn't catch on the first reading.  If you're someone who loves digging up theories and subtle hints and clues, it isn't quite as off putting though . . . EXCEPT-- SECOND CON: The books are absurdly long.  They're so long the book binding process had to be altered to publish them in hardback. That's a bit insane when you think about it, and while the books are still fairly well written in Brandon's style, it means that you have a LOT of room for missing dropped hints or clues.  This was astonishing to me as I've heard Brandon teach about novel length in Fantasy, and yet he seems to be oblivious to his own advice and wisdom in this case: longer does NOT mean better.  It's a bit like Nolan, or Jackson--with notoriety, an artist tends to be less likely to trim, shorten, and kill his or her darlings for the betterment of the story itself. I've never heard anyone compliment a book JUST because it's long.  This length is also unusual because of the format: SECOND PRO/THIRD CON: Each book is massive, because they have multiple POVs, prologues, epilogues, a separate book worth of flashbacks, interspersed short stories, and artwork.  I don't actually hate any of these things, but all together it makes for a LOT of different material that is limited in its direct influence on the story at hand.  It's also difficult to read such lengthy flashbacks when I've heard him speak about how they should be used sparingly. The flashbacks also either didn't surprise me, or surprised me in ways that didn't matter (oh, I knew that character was like that, or did I just spend a third of a book just to find out this character isn't who I thought he/she was?!). These things are all lovingly done, but they ARE a distraction to the stories. It also feels a bit kitchy to me--we're including ALL possible alternative narratological methods? The short stories of American Gods, the multiple POVs of traditional large scale fantasy, massive flashbacks, artwork, etc? Is it really necessary? And if it is, then what does that say about the stories ability to stand on their own? All of this contributed to a sense that the length of the books were primarily due to \"extra stuff.\" THIRD PRO: Brandon's typical strengths are still present here: a fascinating world, diverse characters, an epic setting, and complex systems of magic.  He does this well here, no question.  Although it isn't done any BETTER than usual, so 1000 or more pages of it didn't make it feel more impressive to me. In fact, I felt like I got a BETTER quality (maybe lesser scope) of story from The Emperors Soul (his 75 something page, Hugo winning novella) than I did from either Stormlight book.  Damn Emperor's Soul made me weep at the end.   FOURTH CON: Finally, I wasn't exactly thrilled with some of the way Brandon broke certain tropes that I've HEARD him warn individuals of. No spoilers, but if something is stated in the Stormlight world as FACT, I don't know if I can trust it anymore. And not in a good, I should have seen it coming kind of way.  Brandon has a law of writing named after him, an important and logical one! And he basically breaks it, which shattered my suspension of disbelief.  OVERALL: the books are good. Yes. I actually agree to that. But for as long as they are, and as supposedly \"magnum opus\" as the series is supposed to be? I don't think it pays off enough.  I probably won't read the next ones unless I hear raving, and different responses from others.  If you're on the shelf, I'd pick up the first one on e- book or from a library and give yourself a free pass to put it down if it isn't your thing.  But be open to enjoy it. Many people do. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the best series I have ever read. Some reasons why: His writing is phenomenal. Many writers have great stories but their writing style is lacking. Brandon writing are a work of art. It literally gives me chills the way he can transform a simple sentence.His characters are amazing! They are so way to love or hate. They all have so much depth and real emotions. The majority of these characters are \u201cbroken\u201d it makes them seem so real and makes them all the more beautiful.And let\u2019s not forget about the character interactions. This may seem to go in the universe category, but it deserves its own spot. The way the characters talk and agree or disagree. It gives you chills to see two characters exchanging banter or see one hold a secret that can change the whole book.The story is captivating. It is so incredible to be three books in and still have so much to look forward to. The story line will keep you reading and on the edge of your seat the entire time. It also holds an important role in the cosmere. We see important things come to pass.The magic system is a dream come true. There are so many powers and even the ones without powers have such amazing devices to keep up. If you love super powers this is the book for you. And even if you don\u2019t, you will see those without powers taking charge.This book is amazing. I understand that it is quite long, but it is worth it. This book may not be for everyone, and I understand that. But if you love to read I highly recommend giving it a chance. ",
