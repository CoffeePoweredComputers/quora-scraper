            "answer_text": "Hi Roksana, According to my Knowledge of the Bible in general, I love the KJV, Scripture tells me there is 3 heavens. Although Islam believe in 7 heavens. we shall look into what the KJV says, For a start it says in 2 Cor. 12\u20134, Paul is talking about himself, \u201c I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago, whether in the body, I cannot tell, or whether out of the body I can not tell. God Knoweth, such an one caught up unto the third heaven. it was paradise. It was so real, such a glorious event in Paul\u2019s life, he is not sure how he went there, with god all things possible. I lean to a glorious vision Paul had from God, he was taken there in vision by God. That is the 3rd heaven, so, if there s a 3rd heaven , there must also be a 1st. and 2nd heaven. In Gen.1:6\u20138 \u201c And God said, let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters\u2026\u2026..and God called the firmament heaven, and the evening and the morning were the second day.\u201d This firmament is what we call the sky, where the birds fly, \u2026..The 3rd heaven is the starry heavens, \u201c David is saying, \u201c When I consider Thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained. Psalm 8:3. So there we have it. The heaven of heavens 1 Kings 8:27 where Paul went, it was paradise.\u2019 is the 1st heaven. The starry heavens, sun, moon and the stars, is the 2nd heaven. The firmament or the sky where the birds fly, now planes fly is the 3rd heaven. God Bless you as you travel along your walk with Jesus Christ. ",

            "answer_text": "How many heavens are there according to the KJV Bible? Genesis 1:8 King James Version (KJV) 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. God mentions only one heaven. In Hebrew parlance there were three heavens. The first was everything above the ground up to the sky. The second was where the sun, moon and stars are. And the third was where God lived. Other people speak loosely of other numbers, without explaining what they mean. ETA correction: 2 Corinthians 12:2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. So the bible confirms the Hebrew tradition. ",
