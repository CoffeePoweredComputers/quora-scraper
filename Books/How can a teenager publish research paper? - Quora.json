            "answer_text": "It is done from time-to-time by hard working dedicated teenagers. As an example, teenage students (seniors from high school or undergraduate students) can approach a University Professor or a Research scientist performing research and has Ph D students and/or post-doctoral fellows in the group. If the teenage student shows promise and demonstrates knowledge/capability, the professor can add the student to the team and they can mutually work out a targeted problem for the teenager to pursue. Depending on the progress and the result, it would be possible for the teenager\u2019s work to be noticed and published. It requires a lot of persistence, dedication, commitment, and ability to communicate on behalf of the teenager to convince a Professor to commit her/his time and energy with a budding mathematician. I have seen it done and successfully but it is not very common. ",
