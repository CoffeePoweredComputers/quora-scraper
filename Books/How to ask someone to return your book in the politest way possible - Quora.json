            "answer_text": "This is not the politest way possible. Only attempt with family and close friends. Last week my sister and I were going to meet up for a cup of tea. A few hours before I was going over there, my sister called to say that her husband (my brother in law) said I was not allowed in the house unless I brought back their copy of American Gods. (I may have slightly borrowed it and forgotten to return it for about six months, despite several requests.) When I got there, he was looking menacingly out of the window. I held the book high over my head as my passport to entry. He mouthed something that looked quite a bit like the words \u2018about fucking time\u2019 and then came down to open the door. I got my usual big hug AFTER he got his book. (In case it's not clear, I adore that guy and he was entirely in the right. Nobody messes with one\u2019s Gaiman.) ",

I was just worried it got lost because he hasnt returned it at expected time and he said he got hurt that i had to remind him again and again as if he cant be trusted with stuff. But really, if it belongs to us then we have the right to take it. Just say you need it because it\u2019s one of your fave book and cant live not seeing it around your room. :) ",
