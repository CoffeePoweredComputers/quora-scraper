If non-fictional does this come with a complete rough draft or is the writer to come up with a non-fictional piece with little background knowledge? If it is fiction, do you supply the idea or do you have a rough draft? How many rewrites are you asking for? How many corrections? What kind of deadline are you looking at? ",
