            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on the content of the book if it is worth reading more than once, like it is informative and it can also widen your horizon, open your mind or reflect on yourself about your personal life, even help you achieve your ambition and reach your goal. Of course, it is of your level you can read it well. In a book, you can find a lot of something new that you have never learned it before. Just like, wow, this is the new world to me and I wanner explore it more. So, for the first time of reading,nce to just like opening a door for you to know the unknown world you never got the cha know and then, you know it well. For the second time of reading, you will get to know deeply about the thought that the author wanner expressed. What\u2019s the main idea? what kind of true meaning that the writer desire to express? For the third time of reading, I think at that time, you will feel that the main character\u2019s psychology activity, the way he or she think and why did he or she wanner do that, then you will obtain a better understanding. For the fourth time of reading, you will feel like doing the same thing as the main character did, try to think the way as the author wrote. Just like me, I really like to read \u201cLittle Prince\u201d for multiple times, like a million times that I couldn\u2019t count. This book is amazing, it is definitely worth reading for once more. I mean, it is way suitable for both adult and child, especially for grown-up like me. It will help me find peace after I am babbling about or complaining about something that is trivial in daily life. It will help me stay cool and know the thought that deep down inside of me. I shall always remember that don\u2019t forget the beginner\u2019s mind, and you will reach the bright end. And for the French version of little prince, petit prince, I have read it in different version too. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no right or wrong about it. It's what you enjoy or what you are trying to do. I have repeatedly read Huckleberry Finn and The Great Gatsby because I love those stories. I love the writing. I forced my way through Democracy in America (what a chore), I never want to read it a again, but I might after viewing some lectures on it. And knowing that there is a better translation out there.  Tocqueville did have some interesting things to say. Other books I want to read again: Crime and Punishment Pere Goriot Moby Dick Blood Meridian many years ago I read a few of the books by Erich Fromme. I remember how intrigued I was by his thinking. About a year ago I went back and read \"Escape From Freedom\" my impressions now were very different. I now believe his thinking was greatly flawed even though his general theme, (that modern man seeks security from his own freedom - some personality or character types anyway), is still  a true one. So, rereading a book can be illuminating on your own growth, or how time can change perceptions. but there are many reasons for wanting to re-read a book and your's might be unique. Of course you don't want to retread a book if you didn't enjoy it or you think it's a total waste of time. one more reason: Sometimes a book might be so abstruse that it takes repeated readings to grasp it's real meaning. I began reading Karl Marx's Das Kapital. I retread each chapter twice and then sometimes I had to go back a few chapters and reread a chapter again before the meaning would finally sink in.  I never finished the book. If I pick it up again I'll have to start over.  ",
