If you want to start RD Sharma than you start the book from starting of the class. At the end of the class like December and January if you don't touch the book, their is no need to touch it. Because you will only be puzzle. The main thing is RD Sharma book is very difficult book. If you complete it with full focus no one stop you to get 80 marks. If you have standard math you can complete this book. But if you have basic math it is only your decision that you complete it or not. Thankyou very much\ud83d\ude04 All the best ",

Please don't leave Level-2 questions as taking a risk on your 100/100 dream is not ideal. If you are unable to solve Level-2, try to understand it through Examples or through your teacher. One last advice, as you are seeing CBSE is going for conceptual based question papers, please DON'T ROTE LEARN NCERT. Thanks ",
