            "answer_text": "By expressing your question a bit more. Your question is too broad and too vague. You know what would make it better? A little bit of details. That may be the key missing ingredient to the way you express yourself. That you might be lacking details. Instead of painting using only black stick figures you need to use broad brush strokes and use a lot of colors. When someone asks you how your day was, instead of saying \"Great\", tell them what made it great. Don't be afraid to tap into the emotions you are feeling. Which brings us to your emotions. There are several different words for you to express your emotions and feelings. Take a look. Play with these words. Mix and match them.   You also need to take risks, especially the risk sounding stupid. Often times we hold back what we want to say because we feel others might judge us the wrong way. But this also means that what we express is limited. We really want to be safe, but that is harming us because we are not fully saying or expressing what we think or what we want. If this is you, then learn to say what's on your mind. Doesn't matter if it's right or wrong, funny or not, just open your mouth and say it. ",

            "answer_text": "It all starts from childhood when you are developing yourself and trying to find your passion. Creating essays, joke poetry and express your opinion. To my mind, writing speaks louder than words. Each life path is a miracle, each opinion is unique. If you think that all the words were already used and every statement was already said. Think again. No one can be you and no one can gain the same life experience as you did. Maybe someone\u2019s thoughts were similar to yours, but you can add your own opinion to a common saying. Writing can be very therapeutic, you can start a diary or your own blog to find out the real you. I can recommend you to read a book, called The Vein Of Gold by Julia Cameron. The author explains how you can define your true life mission by means of storytelling. If you want to master the art of writing and weave breathtaking articles, the only thing you have to do is practice. There is a challenge for aspiring writers, who want to attract attention to their works. MonsterPost offers a platform with over 1 million readers for you to publish engaging posts. Creators can express themselves and earn $3000 with their pieces. Curious to learn more? The details of a contest can be found on the official page. Monster Content Challenge 2017  ",

            "answer_text": "Hi ..! Lets understand what expression is. Then we will see what we can do to improve expression power. \u201cExpression means you translate your mind and heart.\u2019\u2019 Expression is very simple. You are in a particular state of mind and heart and that is confined within you and you want to let it out. For that you express. Expression can be in words or in gestures. If someone made me super happy I can express it words by saying \u2018 I am happy' or I can simply give a tight hug to that person. How to improve expression? Understand your state of heart and mind first . By this I mean first feel your emotions by yourself and be clear about them.Do not look for right words and just simply let it out and please make sure you are polite enough. You are not supposed to sound offensive. Else it will make others feel that you are not worth listening.Express in the language you are comfortable in. I think I express myself better in hindi and urdu so please find your language.Actions are better when it comes to expression then words. If someone makes you happy , give him/her a tight hug, pass a bright smile then saying that they made you happy.Understand, that it is not a task to express. Its your way of liberating your emotions out of you and this will come with patience.All the best :) ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on what you mean by the question.  Do you mean creatively, politically, or socially? If you want to express yourself creatively, you should pick an art form you are comfortable with trying and play around with it.  You can keep a journal of your thoughts, and then you might try turning them into a song, poem, or play. You might try listening to music and painting while you focus on the shifting sounds. See if there is a local coffee house that does art shows, poetry readings, or open mic nights when you are ready.  That can be really fun and it enables you to express yourself in a light and fairly stress-free way. If you want to express yourself politically, try to find a group that shares your beliefs and see if you can attend some meetings.  Maybe you could start an internet blog expressing your ideas.  You could also start a local group to discuss your ideas. If you want to express yourself socially, meaning you want to better communicate and interact with people, you need to find opportunities to do this.  See if your local community has a toastmasters club or something to that effect.  Participate in community events where there will be light chatting but not heavy conversation if you are uncomfortable in social settings and want to improve. I know this advice was pretty broad.  I hope that it helped somewhat.Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "How people express themselves? Easy! Figure out what you like, and what you want people to know about you, and do it! It can be a bit tough at first to figure out exactly how to express yourself in a way that isn\u2019t over the top, or obnoxious. Eventually who you are and what you enjoy will become a part of your personality, so you don\u2019t have to try to express yourself, it just happens naturally. :) For example, I\u2019m a musician, I love music more deeply than anyone I personally know, because of this, I sing to myself, hum tunes, and tap my foot when there\u2019s no music playing. I never sat down and said \u201cI\u2019m going to do these things because I want people to know I\u2019m a musician\u201d, they\u2019re just so rooted in my personality that they happen anyway. Who you truly are will always rise to the surface, and people will like you for who you are, and what traits you have. Expressing yourself is as automatic as breathing, and blinking. Thank you for the A2A, hope I answered your question. :) ",

For letting go?If for people, you can use verbal communication while being cautious of what you are saying. Along with this you need to take care of non-verbal communication too like your facial expressions and body language. If it is for letting out your emotions, you have many many options. The most effective one being writing. You can write about anything and everything. You may also talk to yourself in a mirror if the need arises. In this case, I would ask you not to depend on people to lend you an ear. Be your own ear. Hope this helps. ",

You have to find what you love and rock it with the upmost confidence. For me, expressing myself means wearing what the hell I like and having no time for judgmental people.
