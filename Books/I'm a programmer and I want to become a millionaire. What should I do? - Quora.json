            "answer_text": "There are two ways of becoming rich as a computer programmer. Frugality + Saving + InvestingStock OptionsNote, you are way more likely to get rich with option 1 than option 2 in the long run. So, let me run through both of those for you. First is the idea of being frugal, saving as much money as you can, and investing it reasonably. This is a pretty standard formula for becoming rich and you don\u2019t have to be a computer programmer to go this route. It works like this\u2026 Say you are making $100,000/year as a software engineer. Assuming you aren\u2019t living in Silicon Valley, you can live cheap on say $40,000. If you do it right, you could save and invest around $50,000 each year. If you saved $50,000 each year, and invested it into a low cost S&P 500 index fund getting 8% returns, the final value after a decade is $782,274. That\u2019s not enough to retire on. To get that number it\u2019s roughly 25 times annual expenses or in this case $1,000,000. In the above scenario it would take 12 years to hit that number putting away $50,000 each year earning 8% returns. Practically speaking, I\u2019d say this route usually takes more like 15 years of dedicated effort to put you into a position where you can 100% retire or at least no longer be working just to get paid. That\u2019s option one, now let\u2019s look at option two. Option two is about getting paid company stock options that end up becoming worth a lot of money. This is something that is more of an outlier in the industry unless you work for a larger company. You see, many programmers are sold the \u201cstartup dream\u201d of having stock options become worth millions of dollars. But unfortunately very few companies ever go public. Most go out of business or are bought out and stock options become basically worthless. In a few cases someone is early enough at Facebook, Shopify, Uber, etc. to bank millions of dollars when they go public. That is possible if you are lucky enough to be in the first 200 or 500 employees. If you are employee number 4,582? Maybe you get 500 options that vest over 4 years. That\u2019s a nice little bonus, but it\u2019s not quit your day job money. (NOTE: those numbers are made up to illustrate a point. I\u2019m not sure that employee will get any options at all\u2026) The best case scenario for a large amount of programmers is stock options at a large company like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Why? Because those stock options are basically liquid. That is to say\u2026 you can actually sell them! Unfortunately, it\u2019s still a bit of a gamble, but you\u2019re more likely to get those stock options to be worth at least hundreds of thousands of dollars over time than at most companies. If you are a higher level software engineer, the total compensation can be hundreds of thousands of dollars, but 25\u201350% of that might come in company stock options. There is one upside to getting paid in stock options. The current US tax system gives preferential treatment to long term capital gains, so if you exercise your stock and hold it for a year or more, you can pay like 18\u201320% tax instead of 35% or higher. WARNING: I\u2019m not a tax accountant, so this Quora article is no substitute for real expert tax advice. Anyway, stock options can be a great way to build wealth if you are wise in understanding them. I\u2019d say at 80% of companies stock option based compensation is not worth the trouble at all. I have horror stories about friends who got stock or options in these tiny little companies that went nowhere. If you are at a great company that is a public company or becomes a public company, stock options will become a significant portion of your pay at some point. It is worth learning about them. For most people, I\u2019d say focus on frugality + saving + investing as your primary wealth building machine, and if you can add public stock option based compensation on top of that, you\u2019ll build wealth faster than fast. That\u2019s a fairly rare deal, but it\u2019s great if you can get it. -Brian P.S. I write about code and career issues elsewhere too\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I suspect it\u2019s mostly by being in the right place at the right time. Facebook is far from a unique or original concept, and was pre-dated by several other similar concepts. What separated it out was the personality, but it was horrendous, overtly narcisstic and controversial which only helped get it some recognition (look at its early origins. A drunken Zucherberg talks about comparing ugly students\u2019 facebook photos with photos of animals.) Flappy bird. Just a viral bit of insanity, which could have been worth millions. Probably around 250 lines of code. MS-DOS. Marketed aggressively and to the active detriment of its competitors. Gates and Balmer were almost thuggish in their approach. Candy Crush. The empire of King (Worth several billion $$$ now) is based upon swapping candy to make 3, 4 and 5 combos. Wow. What\u2019s important to note is that the guys who got rich from these did through a combination of programming and marketing. Getting rich as a programmer without that is nigh on impossible. Very, very few programmers get to work in places where the salaries are awesome, mostly because project sizes for big apps, games etc., mean big teams. The director will be worth millions. The programmers will earn decent salaries, whilst the big name guys at the top are yachting around and spending their wealth. The other thing is that having money, being rich, and being wealthy are disparate concepts. Rich isn\u2019t always \u201cnice\u201d. I\u2019ve known people with lots of money who are far, far worse off in life that myself. Buying cars they didn\u2019t like, striving to live in places they didn\u2019t connect with, running successful companies, but hating it. Being wealthy is far more interesting. I bought my first house with over 1/4 of the value saved up (I started saving when I started working). I paid a deposit and bought the furniture I wanted. I\u2019ve walked into motorbike dealers with the cash in my pocket wrapped up in rubber bands. It\u2019s kinda fun, and it\u2019s honest. I\u2019m not talking about tens of thousands of pounds here, but it\u2019s understanding that the money in your pocket that you DON\u2019T spend is money that you can spend later. The money that you keep is your wealth, and that\u2019s how you live your life. Friends of mine who make really good money (say twice what I make), still buy their dishwasher tablets out of a bargain store, and go on camping holidays. Sorry, that\u2019s a bit of a long way of saying that looking after what you have, and working hard will make you rich, or wealthy, or whatever you want, if you\u2019re happy and look after what you have. Getting into a position where you can get megabux is being in the right place, speaking to the right people, and largely down to intangible luck. ",
