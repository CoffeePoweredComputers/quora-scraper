            "answer_text": "Friends always suck; As they say a prophet is never welcome in his home town. First of all you need to figure out a couple of things - who are your audience? How are you going to reach them? Lots of people aren't interested in instant cash - they have enough without having to worry about a possibly spurious scheme. There are thousands of get rich schemes after all - most which don't work. So decide who you want to appeal to. You also then need to think about how to get them to watch the videos. Do they have the internet or smart phones? Do they share content? Do they browse youtube? What do they watch and look for? Once you know all this you then need to start doing experiments. What content gets you better results? What video titles are the best? Would you do better to get a semi naked girl with erect nipples showing to be giving the voice over? Fail once - you are every man. Fail 50 times and you are becoming an entrepreneur. Fail a 1000 times and you are a millionaire. ",
