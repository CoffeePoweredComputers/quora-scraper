            "answer_text": "Genres and sub-genres (urban fantasy, historic fantasy, etc) in speculative fiction go through cycles. Right now we\u2019re in an interesting state where SF and Fantasy works are both selling similarlyy. However this is more-or-less meaningless. The statistics on average income for genre writers has been stable for at least two decades (in case you\u2019re interested, that figure is well below $10K USD). But even this is meaningless in thinking anout a single book. Well written good stories with interesting characters, style, location, and plotting sell. Stories from established, well-known, authors generally sell. Other than these two broad \u201crules\u201d, projecting sales for a given book is a crapshoot \u2014 with loaded dice. If you want more consistent \u2014 and usually better \u2014 sales figures, write self-help and how-to books. <g> ",

            "answer_text": "Fantasy genre sells well in USA but there are hardly any books of that genre being written in India. Again, in the USA fantasy genres have sub genres as well. I don't know the break up between the various genres within fantasy. however, from the number of movies that have fantasy as a backdrop, form some of the highest grossing films from Hollywood, which is a sort of indication that fantasy works do well, provided they catch the fancy of serious reader. In cinema fantasy with space, robots, computers etc. take pride of place. There are many writers, which you read about in FB talking about their books, but it is the established writers, with proven track record or those with new ideas and ways of representation that matter and sell most. The basics remain the same - good versus the bad, bringing people together versus diving people, old family enmity playing out in the next generation. ",
