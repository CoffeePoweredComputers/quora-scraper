            "answer_text": "(USA context) The sheer act of writing the book shouldn\u2019t offend anyone. Well, it might, but the Internet is the Internet so, no matter what you do you\u2019ll make someone mad. What will offend a lot of Black people is if you throw in a ton of stereotypes and such, and pass that off as authentic.  The difficulty with this kind of thing, speaking broadly, is that White people don\u2019t really know Black people that well.  I\u2019m not talking on an individual level either; I mean as a people, a culture. Kyle Phoenix has written about this before but I will take a quick stab at it. If you think about it, Black people have to navigate White culture constantly, just because we\u2019re a minority -there is no option but to do so. White culture permeates everything, White businesses run everything, and that is the world Black people navigate. There\u2019s no real reverse. White Americans don\u2019t need to go into Black neighborhoods and business districts to find work, they aren't surrounded by Black culture nearly to the same extent, and so on. White people just deal with us less than we deal with them. That of course isn't OP's fault, nor is it reason not to write. And in most cases, that wouldn't be a big deal. Black people don't really care that Morpheus was written by a White duo. Everyone loves Morpheus, and if they don't they're lying.  But slice of life demands an authenticity that sci-fi doesn't. You can't just half-ass it, you gotta really make it as realistic as possible. And given the realities of American society, most White people lack the knowledge. Does that mean don't write it? Of course not. Just make sure your research is on point. ^_^ ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, a white person could write a romantic, slice of life type book about black people. But the problem is the same for this writer as it is for other writers who write about a different culture than the one they are from. If the writer doesn't understand the culture and the people they are writing about, they usually end up using offensive stereotypes. Or the character is completely ruined because they don't act in believable ways. Readers can't even enjoy the story because they can't immerse in the story and suspend their disbelief. They spend the whole time annoyed like \"This. Is. Wrong.\" That's the biggest thing. People love to see themselves represented in stories, in books, and in movies. They're really only going to get mad if you mess it up. Of course, every creative work has haters and critics though. Do the work, put your creation out there, and let your sales speak for themselves. If people are buying your work and it mostly has positive reception, then you're doing a great job. Everything isn't for everyone. A few critics and haters don't matter if the audience you want loves what you're doing. I would recommend that while you're researching that you make friends and speak to culture experts who are from the culture you're writing about, and from the place you're writing about. An American black person from big city New York is going to be different from a black person from the country part of France. Your location and how your characters fit into your location matters a lot. Have them look at your story and your character and point out details you might miss or places where you might have misunderstood things. You can definitely write an amazing story though. As a writer, it's sometimes incredibly challenging just to get the story out. But really taking the time to carefully craft your work and get the details right can make a huge difference. A good editing team who can support you and call out things you might have missed is also going to be super helpful too. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "This has been done for centuries, going back to Shakespeare\u2019s Othello and more. Good writers can write about anything and some of the best books about other races and cultures have been penned by non-members. I love detective stories and particularly like the Spenser novels by Robert B. Parker. He was a big huge white guy and so was Spenser, a man who could hold his own. but he has no pretensions he\u2019s invincible. So he enlists the help of his good friend Hawk, a sophisticated yet tough black man who Spense knows is not only his equal but superior in many ways. I think the books people have issues with are ones who tell false or uninformed narratives, where people even make stuff up that wouldn\u2019t happen in real life. But well-told stories usually have basic truths about all people, so the writer doesn\u2019t have to be black to convey the human condition. They just have to care enough to know their subject and do it truthfully. ",
