            "answer_text": "The explanation as to Superman's powers has varied throughout his long history. In the very earliest stories he was written for as a more advanced human. Subsequently, he became an Alien and all native Kryptonians had superpowers. I have seen a reproduction of an early comic where a Kryptonian on Krypton is seen lighting a cigar with his heat vision while joking about the lack of powers of earthlings. However, as his powers became more outrageous, the question arose: \"If Kryptonians on Krypton were that powerful, how come they couldn't save themselves?\" His sensory powers and invulnerability were explained by earth's yellow sun while his muscular powers were attributed to earth's lighter gravity. DC writers were completely inconsistent in how they wrote for him using this explanation. Because, theoretically he should retain his muscular powers on a red sun planet with lighter gravity. Yet he was always portrayed as losing everything under a red sun. For example, there are older stories where Lex Luthor is a hero on a planet named after him (\"Lexor\") which had a red sun. Lex walks around quite happily without anti-grav boots, so we must assume the gravity is the same as earth's, yet Superman loses everything when on Lexor himself. Increasingly the yellow sun explanation came to be the dominant factor in explaining Superman's powers, but in the 1970s it was postulated that the ultraviolet rays were all-pervasive so he retained his abilities no matter where he travelled, but providing it wasn't in a red sun environment. They did a number of stories where a \"sun screen\" could render him powerless. In later times, Superman was described as a \"solar battery\" (as Clark also is described by Pete Ross in an early episode of \"Smallville\"). With this theory, his alien DNA is able to absorb and retain vast amounts of solar energy, so that he can operate at night and under no sunlight conditions. How long he could operate without a recharge was put to the test in \"New 52\" (2012) where, without recourse to sunlight Superman benchpressed the weight of the earth for 5 days on the trot shedding a single drop of sweat in the process, but saying he could push far more.

            "answer_text": "Superman gets his powers from being in a Solar System with a Yellow Sun. It doesn\u2019t mean that he has to sunbathe all day. His body is \u201clike\u201d a solar battery. That doesn\u2019t mean that it IS a solar battery. The \u201cCommon Sense\u201d of his story is that Superman was written to have received his powers from Earth\u2019s yellow sun, starting from the time he landed here and gradually increasing with time. This means that a 12 year old Kal-El is simply not as strong as his 20 year old self, due to naturally development and time exposed to Earth\u2019s son. It also means that, when Young Clark goes in the house at dusk, his body doesn\u2019t simply turn off because it\u2019s now nighttime. Again, Common Sense story-writing, though most of us know that \u2018Common Sense\u2019 isn\u2019t very common. I really dislike the idea of \u201cUnlimited Anything\u201d in terms of a comic character\u2019s powers. It just makes for lazy, cowardly writing and \u201cOver-Nerdism\u201d. Seriously, ANYONE who favors \u201cUnlimited Power\u201d for any character, likely lives in mortal fear of having his self-worth stripped away by losing a debate\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..over Fictitious Characters!\u2026.. WEAK! To simplify this, let\u2019s pick some arbitrary number up in the millions. Now, Superman\u2019s powers increase with each day on Earth. Again, he Does Not have to be directly in the sun. He\u2019s still in Earth\u2019s yellow sun atmosphere. Let\u2019s say that Superman\u2019s powers, or exposure, goes from Zero to 1 million, by the time he\u2019s 25 years old (again, Arbitrary!!\u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t want to make anyone cry here). This means that, by age 25, he\u2019s close to his peak core strength, or where he needs to be in order to make Superman stories make sense. If Superman\u2019s power level is at 1 million (ARBITRARY!!!!\u2026\u2026NOT to be confused with the STUPID Superman One Million), he does not go from 1,000,000 to 999,999 just because the sun sets. Now, if the sun gets snuffed out, or if Superman is, somehow, not exposed to Earth\u2019s yellow sun, For A Period of Time, say a month, his powers will start to subside. But, unless he exerts himself to an extreme level (fighting a big-ass monster or something), he essentially grows weaker but not \u201cnoticeably\u201d weaker. I hope this helps. ",
