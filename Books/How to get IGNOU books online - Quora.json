            "answer_text": "Hello Friends, As far as Ignou Text books material are concerned it is not avaiable anywhere online execpt egyankosh website launched by IGNOU. However I am sure this is not the useful for most of the student as this is the soft copy pdf format which is divided into Units and is bit difficult for new Internet Users to assemble them for study. Most of the time Ignou is unable to deliver the Text books to students by courier due more admission then available printed materials with Ignou. In case you do not receive the material from IGNOU on time then you can visit their study centre and ask for the status of the Study material as there is no provision to check the status of the text book through online means. But one need not to be depressed as there is always an alternate solution for everything. Yes You can\u2019t get IGNOU Text Books online BUT you can get Ignou Help Books/ IGNOU Guides books Online. I would suggest two websites here which you may visit and place order for the Guide books of different publishers online from these two online platforms. IGNOU Help Guides 2019 - COD Available & 20% OFFExams Guides - All SubjectsOn these websites you will get all Ignou Guide Books and other study materials related to Ignou which is very helpful for exam preparation. You will get all the payment options like Debit Card, Credit Card, Net Banking as well as Cash on Delivery Service. I would recommend these site as they good delivery system across the India, as well as Overseas. Hope this answers will meet your expectations.Regards ",
