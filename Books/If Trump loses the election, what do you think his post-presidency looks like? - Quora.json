            "answer_text": "He will retire to Maralago, write a book, and take on a lot of conservative speaking tours. Because no sane businessman or woman will believe that any American would vote for a man firmly settled into dementia, Biden\u2019s election will be unanticipated. So the moment it\u2019s clear that Biden won, businesses will make a sprint for cash, driving the market down record numbers. Many plants will close, others will relocate to other countries even before Christmas. With so many people facing layoff, or having already been laid off, the Christmas season will be bleak for retailers. Tax receipts in April will be the smallest seen in decades, even including the 2008 and 2009 period. Biden or his advisors will begin the day he is inaugurated to re-install all the regulations Trump canceled during his presidency. If the House is not dominated by Democrats, they will do them as Executive Orders. Rapprochement with China will begin immediately. The American economy will slip into a deep depression as early as April. Trump, ensconced in Maralago, will become a hero to his supporters, who remember him as the person who gave us the great economy we are watching deteriorate so quickly. Unemployment will shoot up, as companies lay off workers and close plants trying to get ahead of the rest of their industry. As new shackles are set on energy companies, they, too will be forced to reduce production, leaving the U.S. to return to coal for part of it\u2019s fuel needs. Pollution will grow just as it declined during Trump\u2019s administration and we will again begin buying oil from the Middle East. As Biden ruins his country, Trump\u2019s reputation as a genius will grow. The crowds, when he again begins holding rallies will approach the best numbers he ever saw as president. And Republican\u2019s will begin to come to Trump to get his support for the 2022 elections, and of course for the 2024 election. He will become a Power-Broker. ",

            "answer_text": "To a large degree he would move out of the public eye. Unlike other former presidents he is not likely to earn mega dollars for giving speeches, he does not have a clear ideology that he can keep on promoting, he does not have enough wealthy , well connected supporters to keep propelling him into the limelight, if he loses the election he will lose influence even within the Republican party. On the other hand he is not the type of person who goes quietly into the night. He would continue tweeting to his supporters, continue stirring up minor controversy (the press would love that) and being of minor interest in American life. His role in American politics would probably be similar to that of his friend Rudy Giuliani ",
