            "answer_text": "This is a very good question and one that Zombiologists have studied extensively.  Homo-mortuus-motum (human bodies in motion / hereafter referred to as Zombies) Zombies have various infection methods and pathologies depending on the exact strain of zombie we are dealing with. This answer will focus on the two most common zombie varieties so as to not be overly verbose. This answer deals with  the traditional viral zombie and the reanimated dead. For information on other types of zombie such as the voodoo zombie, vampiric zombie, eastern zombie, IPhone addicts or Rob Zombie please consult your local Zombiologist. Part 1: The traditional Viral Zombie  A viral zombie is a living host that is infected with a pathogen that destroys much of the higher thought processes but keeps the body functioning beyond its normal limits. This is done via the virus's ability to supplement the bodies normal oxygenation and waste removal properties of the cells while stimulating the cerebellum and nerve clusters. Zombies are often reduced to a animal state of intelligence. This process of keeping the body alive beyond the point of death does require a large amount of energy to maintain as well as neuropeptides. This creates the well known hunger and more specifically the hunger for brains. Method of transmission via a scratch.. Yes, zombies can infect with just a scratch but not always. There are numerous documented cases of a person taking several scrapes scratches and abrasions both from zombies and while fighting zombies without being infected. The more aggressive the virus is the more likely a simple scratch can infect someone. An extremely virulent strain may even be transmitted by a single drop of infected blood entering the eye. Less potent viruses may not cause infection even if a person is covered in zombie blood. There are two contributing factors to this detailed below.  Injury Because most zombies were infected by zombie attacks themselves they often have open wounds and are covered in their own blood and the blood of other zombies. Injuries to the face or hands adds even more likelihood of cross contamination during an attack.  Messy Eaters Zombies are very messy eaters. Their hunger is so voracious that it often causes them to just cluster together and tear into their victims en masse. This combined with the previous issue of injuries causes numerous points of cross contamination where blood or saliva may be on their fingers or anywhere else on their body. The zombie pathogen is very small just because you can't see a tiny drop of blood or saliva does not mean its not there.     Part 2: The Reanimated Zombie  The reanimation zombie is completely different from a viral zombie. In reanimation the vector of animation is either a virus that acts on recently dead tissues or is supernatural in nature. In these cases anyone that dies during such an outbreak will become a zombie no matter how they died. Whatever is causing the zombie state is already prevalent in the environment.  Festering Wounds The reanimated zombie is dead and has rotting flesh that has been given a semblance of life through some means. The normal factors of rot and breakdown are slowed but are still present. These \"Living Dead\" become giant petri dishes incubating hundreds and eventually thousands of different bacteria. The pathogens can be found in every tissue but are most easily spread via blood or saliva. Zombies also tend to cluster when eating so they tend to rub against each other spreading their various viruses, bacteria, yeast and fungi.  With all of the close contact eventually all of the zombies in a pack are infected and covered with various microbes. Getting even a small injury from one of these zombies is like rubbing rotting meat into a wound. Terrible and often untreatable infection starts in causing fever, sweating, discoordination, aggression and finally death. After the subject dies the animation vector then reanimates the body like any other recently dead.

            "answer_text": "I'm a Zombie lover, not a Zombie expert, but I'll give this a go; I have not seen the movie you mention, but I have seen 100's of Zombie movies and have an opinion. It seems more than likely the Zombie pathogen is something that everyone already carries; dead or alive. I say this because when the apocalypse begins, the dead turn into Zombies immediately and they had not previously been infected by a Zombie; they are the first of their kind, the originals.    An original Zombie from Night of the Living Dead I believe the pathogen is only activated once the human has died. This is the case in the TV series the Walking Dead. My thought is that if you are bitten or scratched by a Zombie, it accelerates the pathogen and kills rather quickly. Once bitten or scratched, there is almost no recovery though it has been done via amputation of affected area for example. You would need to cut the arm or leg off like this. An axe of a power saw would be best.  Zombie bitten arm removed at elbow I've seen many cases where someone dies without contamination by direct Zombie contact (like shooting, and other murderous and natural causes like heart attack etc.) and they still turn rather quickly. Remember, the original Zombie was not bitten or scratched prior to being a Zombie. Referring again to The Walking Dead, this scenario has been shown on a couple occasions. Your parents could have a heart attack and end up looking like this:  Mom's a Zombie now Summary: Dead or Alive, everyone carries the Zombie pathogen. Being bitten or scratched accelerates death and the Zombie process. Eventually, since everyone dies, everyone you know will end up looking like this:  Your friends want to party with you ",
