            "answer_text": "I have had two titles printed in China. One was a hardbacked full color coffee table book in landscape format. Including shipping, customs fees and printing the cost was a bit more than $8,000 for 2,000 copies. The second title was a road trip book about central Florida with color glossy cover and black and white interior. It was a 5.5 by 8.5 paperback. Printing 3,000 copies was half my US price but shipping and customs ended up costing me too much. Print quality was an issue with reprinting of the history book. First printing of the history book was excellent. It won a bronze medal in a national publishing contest. The second printing came out looking very different with a brighter cover that detracted from the beautiful paintings of a scene in the town. It sold just as well but after about 9 months I was taking returns because pages were falling out due to faulty glueing. A librarian taught me how to reglue the end pages etc. but I still had to lose about 300 copies. The third printing was done in this country \u2026.it took years to find a US book printer who could do glossy pages and hardback cover at a price similar to what I paid in China but the quality is better and consistent on successive editions. If you print in China be careful. Also be sure to have books shipped to the US port nearest to where you will warehouse the books. They shipped one book to Los Angeles, That left me with a huge shipping bill across the U.S. as I live in Florida. If the books are shipped to Miami my shipping costs are negligible while Customs and ocean shipping fees are about the same as to L.A. I had a different full color hard backed book printed in Korea \u2026good price and terrific quality\u2026but that was also before I found the US printer\u2026..Signature Books in Gaithersburg, Md. In every case I had received printed sample books but that still did not save me with the reprint in China. Hopefully, other US publishers will be forthcoming with their experiences \u2026.both good and bad. ",
