            "answer_text": "It seems simple enough that God (Yahweh) could just destroy Satan if he wished, and He can (and He will), but the story is more complicated than that. Let me paint a quick picture for those who have this question; it can be extracted from the bible. There is a great controversy that started in Heaven (no one knows where this is) that is still being resolved today.  Lucifer was the once covering cherub, and stood closest to the Holy presence of Yahweh. He was a highly intelligent being, capable of comprehending Yahweh better than the rest of the angels and creation (Ezekiel 28:14-15). According to the ancient Torah, Moses was commanded to make a Temple Sanctuary, and the Ark of the Covenant was to be placed in the most Holy apartment. The Ark of the Covenant was created with a mercy seat and two \"covering cherubs\" were placed between the mercy seat. Inside the ark was the Holy Law of God. The mercy seat represented Yahweh's throne, or government, which was built upon the foundation of the goodness of this Holy Law (Exodus:17-18, 20). Therefore, the foundation of God's throne is his Law. Like any government, Laws must be put in place. All creatures of the universe obeyed this Law. Lucifer stood closest to the presence of God and protected the Law of God. The law of Yahweh actually is just a description of the character of God (Loving, merciful, JUST, and Holy).  According to Ezekiel 28:15 something happen to this perfect, magnificent being that stood so close to Yahweh: \"You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, Till iniquity was found in you.\"  Isaiah 14:12-15 comments on Lucifer's character and how pride distorted him: How you are fallen from heaven,O Lucifer, son of the morning!How you are cut down to the ground,You who weakened the nations!For you have said in your heart:\u2018I will ascend into heaven,I will exalt my throne above the stars of God;I will also sit on the mount of the congregationOn the farthest sides of the north;I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,I will be like the Most High.\u2019 Lucifer argued that the holy congregation didn't need a Law to be like God. He wanted to change the government. His point was that if God really did allow his creatures to have freewill and freedom then it wasn't necessary to abide in God's Holy Law. Therefore his first transgression (sin) was coveting the throne of God. God, not excising manipulation or coercion over his creature, attempted to correct Lucifer who didn't realize that by rejecting the Law he was rejecting God Himself (who is the Life-giver sustainer and law personified). Unwittingly the rejection of God is rejection of the very thing that bestows life. God cannot be in the presence of that which he is not. In His essence, God is Holy, Just and loving. No thing that is in opposition to these characteristics can be be given His spirit to live if His spirit is the epitome of these transcendent personality traits (1 Corinthians 6:14). This is why \"the wages of sin is death\" (Romans 6:23). Lucifer introduced death into creation. He continued to rebel against Yahweh. He continued to  harshly criticize the character of God.      The driving force that made Lucifer dictate \"his truth\" was his pride. Lucifer was made perfect and beautiful but it got to his head (Ezekiel 28:17) He also deceived 1/3 of the holy congregation to question God's Law; Lucifer was cast from heaven with his fellow conspirators and his name and title were stripped from him (he became Satan). The Holy congregation was divided into rival factions.  The question arises: Why didn't God immediately put an end to the rebellion?  According to Deuteronomy 19:16-17 \"false witness\" Whenever controversy would arise there had to be a third party or witnessthe parties in the controversy in heaven were God and his angels and Lucifer and his angels. God, trying to show fairness and justice, could not immediately pass punishment; if he was the Judge Himselfstanding on one side of the argument then it would have proved Lucifer's argument correct. It would prove God unfair. So Yahweh is on trial, trying to prove that His character and will are good and that a Holy Law is required. Satan wishes to distort the character of God, and what better way to do it than attack humanity, a race made in His image. We know the Eden story and how SIN entered into the world; we also see how Lucifer is the author of sin and how humans have some of his character traits today. People also are attacking Yahweh's character today. Others have been lead to think that there isn't a God at all. The great controversy over Yahweh's character continues on Earth.   There is so much more depth to this, but I will not go into that (please feel free to ask me if you are interested in the rest of the story and how humanity has a part to play).  Some may ask: why did God create Lucifer then if he knew what would happen? Simple: God created a being that was capable of resisting Him, because God wants His creatures to love Him out of choice. He doesn't want to create beings that love and worship Him because he decided it should be so, that would be so contrived. That wouldn't be love, but manipulation and it would be cheap for Him. If he just decided to blink everyone who will ever oppose and hate Him out of existence God wouldn't be a God of love, but a manipulator. ",

            "answer_text": "This thread just demonstrates the disingenuous convolutions that Xtian apologists must perform to answer pretty straightforward questions. Thousands of words here to answer this simple question and yet none of them actually do, they just fudge around it. So let\u2019s look at this from a gullible believers pov. Assume: God is real. Satan is real. God is omnipotent. (that means he can do anything logically consistent. He can\u2019t, for example, make a 4 sided triangle or a married batchelor. But he can move mountains and defeat Iron Man AND Thor both together. With one hand tied behind his back.) So: Any omnipotent entity could kill any non omnipotent entity. As this particular god is the only god then we can safely say he is the only omnipotent entity around. So, if god is omnipotent then it is clearly logically consistent that he could kill Satan. So the simple answer to this question is \u2018He can\u2019. So why doesn\u2019t he? And there we are, this is just one more in a long line of Problem of Evil questions. So if he can but he doesn\u2019t it means he either doesn\u2019t know that Satan exists, or where to find him,, or he does and can but doesn\u2019t care. Cue thousands more words being written to counter the Problem of Evil. Most of those words will boil down to \u2018We can\u2019t know gods plan\u2019 and \u2018God moves in a mysterious way\u2019. And as god if our Father we must assume that that means Dad Dancing. And as Dad Dancing is the work of the Devil we can now see that God is actually the Devil. And as God is omnipotent, as well as eternal etc, it is clear that he can\u2019t be killed. So the reason God can\u2019t kill Satan is a. actually he can and b. actually he can\u2019t ",
