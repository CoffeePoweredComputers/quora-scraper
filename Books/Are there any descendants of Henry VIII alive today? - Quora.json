Henry certainly acknowledged some of his illegitimate children, Henry Fitzroy being the most famous example, however there is possibly more illegitimate children that we don\u2019t know about, and perhaps some that Henry himself didn\u2019t know about. So there is likely descendants form Henry alive today, but not from his wife\u2019s. ",

None of the acknowledged illegitimate children had children either, but it is possible that there may have been other illegitimate children that no one knew about. ",
