            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t have to make time or find time to read good books. Life is chaos. you never know what tommorow brings. You may even have a plan, religiously want to do certain things within few days, months or years, but somehow it creates a stress and puts a lot of pressure on you. There will appear some obstacles or setbacks. Then, you feel like giving up and don\u2019t read. I went through all this. So I devised a different strategy to read books. Here is what it is: I have a habit of picking books and finding out the good ones. Either I do this at a book store or at a library, or I will simply buy a good book at a second-hand book shop. So my diary is full of reviews of books. The following is an illustration of a review of books. The book title with its interesting features.  If I happen to go to a particular library, I will refer my diary and find out what are the good books in that particular library I have already noted to read. This way I don\u2019t waste time at the libray. I have a diary for six different libraries. I have 7-feet-tall book shelves and a three-door wardrobe full of books I collected for over a decade. When I\u2019m not occupied in any work, I will simply grab a book from my personal library and read. Even if I have as little as 5 minutes to spend, I read. When I don\u2019t feel like sleeping, I read. If I happen to wake up at the middle of a night or early morning, I read from my personal library. If I stay at home because I get sick or I\u2019m spending holidays, I read So instead of frustrating yourself by forcing yourself to read or find time to read, be busy finding out the best of the best books in the areas of your interest. This way you will be automatically drawn to read books (just like the roots of a plant are attracted towards deep waters) and you read more books. This way you stop the frustration and start enjoying your reading and grow well in life. Good luck in your reading!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if you are studying,then you are already reading. I assume you mean reading something other than your study material,however. Without knowing the specifics of what you want to read, I suggest, you find some fictional books that also speak to your studies. e.g.,if you are studying something computer related, lookup Tom Clancy. Very exciting,informative books. If that is not to your taste, set aside a period of time every day to leave your study and readfor pleasure. You will find when you come back to your studies your mind is refreshed and ready to get back into it.Doesnt have to be much time, max 30 mins, min 10 mins. Another idea is to make a list of everything you do during the day. List every little thing.Then go over your list to see what things you could do more efficiently or not do at all and use that time to read. Always keep a book handy and read when ever you have even a few minutes. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly u need to choose books that fantasize you and the books that you really want to read. Secondly you need to do some time management, of course giving first priority to your studies and eliminating the things which you think you can. For example in your free time if you play games or stuff like that and you feel you will enjoy reading more then you can eliminate gaming in your free time. Next is you need to sacrifice some time for other things, that won't be a problem if u really love reading. In fact its all about interest, in you love reading and the course you are doing then you will definitely find a way out. But still these were some methods I am doing to manage reading along with studies. ",

If you need to focus more on studies - Make it a habit of reading novels and book only at the bed. It will give you a sound sleep and will also help in keeping blue light electronics at bay from your your bed. ",
