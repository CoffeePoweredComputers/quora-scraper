            "answer_text": "No. That you be a ridiculous assumption, as how would it be enforced if everyone who bought the book claimed copyright ownership? Copyright is based on protecting the creators not the consumers. Consumers have their own rights, which doesn\u2019t cover owning any part of the material used in a book, but simply the \u201ccopy\u201d of the original book. Copyright is an inherent law that occurs when a creative creates something. This can only be transferred by written contractual agreement. ",

            "answer_text": "No\u2026copyright is the protection that the AUTHOR of the book gets for creating the work. The buyer of the book does not get any rights other than owning a copy of the book. If you write a story and decide to publish it then your would be the copyright owner and you might sell it for \u201cone time use\u201d or you might sell it for \u201climited use\u201d such as for a website to publish just one chapter. Copyright can get very complicated, so be careful. Good luck. ",
