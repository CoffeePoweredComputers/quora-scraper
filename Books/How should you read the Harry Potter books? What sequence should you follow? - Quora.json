            "answer_text": "Firstly, the films and the books are very different in some ways, in plot, in setting and in characters, so you have to view them the way you would view different versions of the Robin Hood or King Arthur stories - you know in some stories Robin is a peasant, in some he's a nobleman, in the Disney version he's a fox - they're all telling roughly the same story but they're not compatible, and likewise the Harry Potter films and the books tell roughly the same story but are not compatible. The Fantastic Beasts films will come first chronologically but they are in the film universe, and it's not clear what if anything like them will have happened in the book universe. We do at least know that Rolf Scamander does exist in the book universe, and that he wrote a textbook on magical beasts. As for the books, read The Philosopher's/Sorceror's Stone first, and then the Quidditch Through the Ages booklet which is referred to in the book. Then Chamber of Secrets and The Prisoner of Azkaban, followed by the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them booklet, which has notes referring to events in CoS and PoA. Then Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix, and then the little prequelette which Rowling wrote for charity. The prequel is set in summer 1977 so it takes place before the first book, which begins in 1981 - but it won't make sense to you unless you've read OotP first. Beedle the Bard fits in here because Dumbledore is meant to have compiled it and written the notes during the action of OotP and HBP. However, the first time you read it it will probably make more sense to you if you leave it till after DH. Then The Half-Blood Prince, and The Deathly Hallows. Then The Cursed Child if you really want it, but it's so wildly incompatible with the books that its status is really that of a fanfic. ",
