            "answer_text": "Assets: 1-assets are anything that belong to you, or can be put to use by you (in case of leased/rented assets) 2- possess the ability to generate cash inflows. (you can earn money from them, either by using them for production of goods or provision of services) 3- can be controlled by the entity possessing them. Now, think about premises. Does it satisfy all the three criteria mentioned above?Yes it does. Let me break it down for you. 1- the premise belongs to you, you could either by the owner, a tenant or a leasee. 2- it can help you generate income. You could either set up business there,i.e start production or provide services, or you could simply rent it out and earn rental income 3- It can be controlled by you. Thus, premises can be considered as an asset. If you\u2019re ever stuck while trying to determine whether or not anything is an asset, think of the 3 points mentioned in the beginning. You won\u2019t go wrong :) Hope this helped :) ",

            "answer_text": "Anything which appreciates in value over time is an asset. If a premise is appreciating in value then it can be called as an asset. But at the same time due to downturn or an other reason the asset value reduces over time then it shall be treated as a liability. Generally real estate appreciates over time if the investment is done considering a long term view and hence would be an appreciating asset. On the other hand, car is a depreciating asset as its value decreases over time and is considered as liability. More the assets you have easier to grown your net as the increase in their value with time is passive income you can earn. ",
