            "answer_text": "Making girls laugh is an excellent ice breaker. But it is not the only one. If you believe yourself a funny person and are simply out of practice then I would practice. Comedy both online and on YouTube and movie channels might help you hone your craft; you can even steal jokes if you want there's no copyright. Are you good at memorizing? If you feel humor isn't the right tool, you should consider others. The idea is to put your best foot forward whatever it is; history, art, drawing whatever you like best. Everyone won't like it back to you but you're being honest about yourself. But again if that is not your best subject or approach find the one that is and the right person; that art lover drawing lover bowler movie marathoner will be happy she met you. Good Luck. ",

            "answer_text": "It is possible, but I'd say it is far easier to put a woman at ease, make her trust you, and keep you out of the friend zone if you are able to make her laugh. Not having a sense of humor usually lands you in the friendzone. Most of the guys I see who are successful with women can joke around, tease the woman a bit, and be overall playful. Being serious, reliable, honest, or even sharing a mutual interest without a sense of humor usually gets you friendzoned. ",
