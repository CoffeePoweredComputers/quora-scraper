            "answer_text": "Didn't you read the article? It said that when he was 22 years old in 1984, he was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Alabama state law at the time mandated that since it was his fourth offense, the judge had no other option than to sentence him to life in prison. The judge had no other viable options. But more recently, the curiosity of another judge led to the re-sentencing of Kennard, who is now 58 years old. The judge in this case noticed how odd it seemed that someone was serving life without parole for a $50 robbery,\" said Kennard\u2019s attorney, Carla Crowder, who said it was Jefferson County Bessemer Cutoff Circuit Judge David Carpenter who saw Kennard\u2019s case when some documents came across his desk. After a hearing, the new judge ordered that the convicted man had served his time and should be released from prison. He had been sentenced to life without parole for the robbery of Highlands Bakery in 1983 was because he had been previously convicted of three other non-violent property crimes so his case fell under required sentencing guidelines. In 1979, he pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree burglary in connection with a break-in at a service station. Those three charges, which were all tied to that one incident, so he was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation. But the next time he was convicted, for the bakery robbery -- which was committed with a pocket knife, he had to be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Those sentencing guidelies have since changed. ",
