            "answer_text": "This is subjective but yes, after my first Kindle broke I replaced it with a Paper white and I could read it at night and in the day without any problems. The original Kindle was also easy but needed light to read at night but don\u2019t compare Kindles to tablets as Kindles are E-Book readers. Tablets are general purpose systems where speed of display may be a factor. The Kindles are not fast screen updaters; they are fast enough for reading but not for say games) > Kindles have a limited range of shades while a tablet may have to display 16 million colours. So Kindles are perfect for reading thanks to clever use of fonts, typography and most of all the screen display but tablets are not as good for reading but then they were never meant to do just that.

            "answer_text": "Yes! Kindle paper whites do not use traditional LED screens like you see on your phone or tablet. Instead it uses a technology that Kindle created themselves known as an \u201cE-Ink\u201d display. And though this device still uses LEDs to light the screen, the intensity is much lower than a traditional screen. These devices emit negligible amounts of blue light as well, which make them great for reading before bed when you compare it to a phone or tablet. ",

At this point, one should realize that in a dark room, the light should be very low and subtle, and brightness pumped up in a medium light environment. During normal use, ie daylight, you can keep reading your kindle until you finish your book. ",
