            "answer_text": "From an outsider\u2019s perspective it\u2019s what it might look like sometimes. But here\u2019s the thing : teenage years are years when you discover and explore yourself, in many different ways. Therefore you might think yourself to be something, and then realise you were wrong. To me, it seems to be what happens when someone says they are bisexual as a teen, and say otherwise after they\u2019ve grown up. I am bisexual myself, 20, and I\u2019ve known since I was 14. I have also met other people my age who thought they were bisexual before saying they were just gay or straight. But here\u2019s how, from my experience, it happens: A tongue is a tongue and lips are lips. They\u2019re not gendered. So if you can focus on the sensation rather than the person, it\u2019s possible that you might like kissing the same gender, despite the fact that you\u2019re actually straight, only have sexual desires and romantic attraction for the opposite gender. So, teens who are experiencing this might think that they\u2019re bi just because of that, while they realise later that they\u2019re not interested if it becomes \u201cserious\u201d. Oh, and I\u2019ve met some gay people who can have fun kissing the opposite gender but nothing more.Unto gay teens, it\u2019s important to remember that accepting that you\u2019re attracted to the same gender is hard, but it\u2019s equally had to accept that you\u2019re not into the opposite gender. Since those things aren\u2019t one and the same all the time, many teens struggle to figure that out or accept it, so they tell themselves they\u2019re bisexuals because they\u2019re not 100% sure yet they\u2019re exclusively attracted to the same gender. Sexuality can also be a spectrum, so some gay people do have a bit of attraction for the opposite gender, but it doesn\u2019t manifest often and it doesn\u2019t feel significant enough to bring it up.In both these cases, the teen never WAS really bisexual. So bisexuality itself, as in being attracted to men AND women, isn\u2019t the phase, but some teens use this term and this identity temporarily to try to understand what they really are or might be.And then you have actual bisexual teens, who feel attraction to both (not always at the same degrees by the way ! 70% and 30% towards one or the other can perfectly we\u2019ll be bisexuality), become bisexual adults (there are a lot more of us than people think) and might have a relationship with one or the other during their life. Naturally, no matter who they date, man or woman or anything else, it doesn\u2019t change their bisexuality :) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to try my best to be as honest as possible. When I was growing up, I suffered from many things. My parents were related, I got bullied in school..but I had this one experience. It happened when I was very young. As most children do, when I had friends over we would joke about sexual things we\u2019ve overheard on television or saw it in a magazine or though a father\u2019s porn collection. But this particular time, a male friend had pressured me to engage in sexual activity with him. I wasn\u2019t a bias boy. In fact, I was only about 8 or 9. We used to have a lot of sex like no one\u2019s business. That occurred for a few years. When I reached puberty at about 12\u201313, I started to identify as bisexual. It was true. At that time, I liked boys and girls. But I found that I couldn\u2019t develop an emotional attraction to boys, it was merely sexual. When I got older and the LGBTQ+ community got more recognized, I never felt connected to it. It was something about that community I couldn\u2019t relate to. I never participated in any parades(didn\u2019t care to), I had this contradicting mentality. But I still liked having sex with boys and was doing as often as I could. I even knew I would never date boys. I had no desire to. But everyone knew I was bisexual. I genuinely liked having sex with other boys. Time passed and for some reason, almost unconsciously, I separated boys from sexual objects and view them more as friends and i developed a more exclusive attraction. I had always loved women and thought about not only having sex, but loving them permanently and forever. Boys turned to men and I was just not interested in anymore. I battled with this realization that I could have been straight, but I liked having sex with boys. So, bisexual, right? How could something like that change? And as I got older, I became less and less attracted to boys and by age 21, I stopped being involved with men because I wasn\u2019t interested. The desire wasn\u2019t there and I didn\u2019t see them like that anymore. So, is bisexuality a phrase? For me, it was. And for many people, it is. But for many others, no. Even now, I don\u2019t know where the feelings went. Part of me felt like a fraud. But I\u2019m glad I was honest with myself and didn\u2019t feel guilty that my sexuality was fluid in that way. Now, I feel like I can relate to my children as they age and begin to experiment. But truthfully, sexuality and attraction includes emotion, not just your genitals. We can get pleasure from anything. But to say we love this person and want to be with someone is sexual orientation. Relying merely on the sexual connection because either way, with a boy or a girl, we will feel pleasure. That\u2019s natural. But there\u2019s so much more to bisexuality, homosexuality and heterosexuality than than that! Bisexuality was a phrase for me and I didn\u2019t even know it! There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. And no one should feel guilty or ashamed. Not all of us are trying to take from the LGBTQ+ community and/or be attention seekers. Feelings come and go. Mine did just that. ",
