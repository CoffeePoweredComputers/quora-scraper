            "answer_text": "Well, there aren't any OVERT transphobic references in the HP series. Trans people aren't mentioned at all\u2026 there are a couple of scenes where someone uses Polyjuice Potion to temporarily masquerade as a person of a different sex, like Crabbe and Goyle disguising themselves as girls in HBP or Fleur and Hermione becoming Harry in DH, but nobody really seems to think there is anything particularly off-putting about this. That said, there are a few scenes and descriptions that, when you read them knowing about JKR's transphobia, kind of read a little\u2026weird. Like others have mentioned, Rita Skeeter can come across as a mean-spirited parody of a trans woman, with the references to her masculine traits like large hands and a square jawline clashing against her super-feminine clothing and mannerisms, and fake-looking hair. Not to mention, she spends much of the book in a shape not her own, spying on school children. Now, I don't know if JKR actually intended for Rita to be trans, but I kinda doubt she did. I think it's just subconscious transphobia colouring her writing here; she wants to make sure Rita reads as thoroughly unsympathetic, and so she lets the narrative mock her appearance:look at this mannish woman pretend that she's feminine. It's a very common tactic for her to make fun of people's looks if she wants them to come across as unsympathetic; the sympathetic characters don't tend to be supermodels either, but they're generally described in more neutral terms or not at all. So that one of the unsympathetic female characters is mocked for having masculine traits\u2026 Kind of reads a little differently when you know JKR's attitude with trans people. So any transphobic content in HP is more inferred than actually stated. Such benefit of the doubt cannot, however, be given to her adult novel, The Silkworm, which does include a trans woman character, Pippa, and that portrayal IS transphobic. I might have forgiven that Pippa is portrayed as violent and emotionally unstable, because the book is full of nasty and unlikeable ciscender people too\u2026 but I notice that Pippa's appearance is also mocked with her large hands and protruding Adam's apple called attention to (the main female character has problems not laughing), and while the problems she faces as a trans person are alluded to they are mostly played for laughs, and Pippa's mostly just presented as pathetic. The main characters do display some sympathy, but they do so in a very condescending, patronising way while also mocking her, treating her with contempt, and (this is the big one) alluding to prison rape in order to get her to cooperate. Consciously or not, I think The Silkworm most clearly reveals JKR's actual opinion on trans people: she doesn't wish any particular harm on them, and is happy to allow them to exist\u2026 But obviously she doesn't think they have any right to be taken seriously, and they mostly deserve to be patrionized and mocked because OBVIOUSLY they're delusional reality-deniers.

            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s complicated. Certainly J.K. Rowling never expresses transphobia openly, but only by not acknowledging the existence of trans people. And in a story where human transfiguration is taught in the same way AP Chemistry is taught in high schools, that is remarkable. There are Metamorphs\u2014people born who can naturally change their appearance at will. It\u2019s notable that the Metamorph we have, Tonks, never once expresses interest in being a boy. We also have Polyjuice Potion, which is apparently only as difficult as an advanced chemistry project, and yet we don\u2019t hear of people changing their bodies using this, even though even cis people would probably be curious enough to try changing their sex for the afternoon. And despite the fact that witches are just as capable with their wands as wizards, just as dangerous, J.K. Rowling chose to have a world whose sexism and gender roles are if anything more regressive than our own, at least in the main series. How long do you think women would have waited for the right to vote if we could cast hexes? Would rape really be a problem if there were Stunning spells? Arguably the wizarding world should transform gender, but J.K. Rowling doesn\u2019t seem interested in exploring that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go so far as to say Harry Potter isn\u2019t transphobic, because that\u2019s like saying a work isn\u2019t racist because it doesn\u2019t have any black people. The absence of those people is in and of itself transphobic! And despite what other answers have said, you can\u2019t really disentangle your politics from your writing, it\u2019s too personal. As for them being children\u2019s books, there are trans children. There\u2019s nothing inappropriate about having trans characters in a children\u2019s book, just like there\u2019s nothing inappropriate about having a kid\u2019s picture book where the character has two dads.

            "answer_text": "No. There is literally no evidence of favouring transphobia in the Harry Potter series. Many people will try to connect some random phrase or description to transphobia but it's all false. One can always manipulate the narrative & present it as something entirely different. Eg. One answer here compares the description of Rita skeeter to transphobia. It's too far fetched!! The description of madame maxime is described in a masculine way but she is portrayed positively. Similarly, tonks who can change her appearance at will is shown baddass. Metamorphs and merpeople in goblet of fire are shown in a positive light. (No relation to transphobia at all). The only negative characters are the death eaters and people like umbridge because of obvious reasons. As for why there is a lack of lgbt representation in the books, it's because even though Dumbledore is not mentioned openly gay but he isn't mentioned straight as well. Many characters sexuality has not been mentioned. It's open to interpretation. Many horrible incidents like rapes which seems a possiblity by the Death eaters and snatchers as a form of muggle /muggleborn torture isn't mentioned. It's on you, how you choose to interpret. I do not agree with JK Rowling at all but please leave Harry Potter and fantastic beasts alone. The series taught me so much during my childhood and I still stand by the teachings today. I hope JK learns and apologises. This doesn't mean she is a bad human being, just an ignorant one. I was shocked and extremely sad with her ignorant views. Harry potter taught us the terrible consequences of prejudice. Maybe, one day she will learn. Many actors associated with the series have come forward and criticized JK. Eg Daniel Radcliffe, Emma watson , Rupert grint , Eddie Redmayne etc etc.  Image credits : google There is no point in dragging a classic series like harry potter and movies like fantastic beasts. You are hurting the fans whose entire childhood was shaped by Harry Potter and the actors who have worked hard in these movies. (Those actors who spoke against JK rowling and firmly put their point across). No need to punish them. Remember,     All Image credits: pinterest ",

What if all this darkness in me and my uncontrollable murderous rage is who I really am?\u201d Could have been interesting. Wasn\u2019t. Now, Lupin could always have just been for revenge on her math teacher or something, but Tonks also does not get a happy ending. Tonks popped out a baby and ran off to fight, of course she wasn\u2019t going to survive. You don\u2019t just leave a newborn, that\u2019s like the cardinal rule of fiction. If you so much as turn your back for a moment while the audience\u2019s attention is on you, all you get is a movie of long sad shots of sunlit green grass and violin music. And Lupin ran out on them twice, he didn\u2019t want to be there, you think she didn\u2019t notice that? Some marriage. But you\u2019re right, it\u2019s way too subtle to call Rowling on. All cis straight couples get to be happy together forever, though. Even Angelina Johnson, in her way. ",

Harry Potter is a series aimed at children, and the closest to any sort of LGBTQI-phobia we have is in chapter one of Order of the Phoenix, when Dudley taunts Harry about Cedric, asking if Cedric was Harry\u2019s boyfriend. But that doesn\u2019t even come remotely close to anything phobic. ",
