            "answer_text": "I will let you in on a little secret: a lot of people feel the same way you do. Life is not easy, except, maybe, for a very small number of people. In childhood you know nothing and are totally dependent and defenseless. The teenage years are misery. From 20 to 30/35 you want to enjoy life but have to work hard at building a future you usually know little about.  If you're lucky you find a profession, sort of settle down. Then you hit 40 and doors start to close. Time flies from 40 to 50. Family, a house, a career, a few accomplishments, and when you look in the mirror you see gray or white hair. Then you're old, and older, and older. It's not a smooth journey. People lie. They want to make it look like it was easy. It never is. There are countless sleepless nights, regrets that give you a pang every time you remember them, people you alienated until you lost them, jobs you shouldn't have walked away from and the ones you should have never taken. You desire people who ignore you. You waste time with relationships that are emotional blind alleys. Oh, and the advice you are given. Take a year off! Climb Everest! Start an orphanage in Crimea! Watch the TED talks! Move to Portland! So to answer your question: there is little you can do, except follow the course of your life to that unique place that the universe and its random events will have reserved for you. But I can suggest a little exercise. You need to do 3 things: 1. Pinch your arm. You are holding atoms of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen that have been in countless living beings before.  2. Hold a glass of water. This same water has been drunk before by millions of people. It rained over Rome once. Perhaps it washed the wounds of a medieval monk. It quenched the thirst of a soldier in the trenches of World War I. 3. Go out on the street and look around you. Everyone you see will be dead in 150 years. Most of these people will be completely forgotten, their lives erased from the history of mankind, like they never happened. To try and become stronger, realize and remember that our lives actually mean very little in the huge universal scheme of things. It really is no big deal. Now relax and live a little ",
