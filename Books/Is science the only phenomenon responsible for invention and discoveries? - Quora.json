            "answer_text": "No. Science has only been around for perhaps 400 years. Everything invented before that, from water-wheels to sailing ships to clocks, was invented by people who were creative, curious and determined, but completely ignorant of science.Scientists discover things, but the vast majority of inventions are made by engineers. There is a terribly wrong and dangerous tendency in our society to adulate science. Some people think science will solve all our social ills if only we will abandon all that non-scientific foolishness. Certainly science, guided by humanism can improve the human condition. But guided by nefarious forces, science produced Hiroshima, Auschwitz and Mengele. The key is humanism, not science. If you think science provides the answer to human suffering, I suggest you read: Brave New World by Aldous Huxley;Encyclopedia Brittannica\u2019s entry on the science of Eugenics; andScientism - Wikipedia.",
