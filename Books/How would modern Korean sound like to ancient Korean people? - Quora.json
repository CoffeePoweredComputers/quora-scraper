            "answer_text": "In my opinion, I guess that ancient Korean was milder but use more remarkable intonation than modern Korean. The characteristics of modern Korean language, especially in South Korea, use more hardened sound, less accent or intonation. And more, mordern Koreans use many foreign words from English and the native Korean words has been reduced and disappeared than before. Therefore, I think that the current Korean language will be unfamiliar to ancient Koreans. ",

To modern Koreans, it sound like some very romantic or mild or artistic people when a man talk it. So, reversely, modern sound of Korean would sounds as very rigid and aggressive.
