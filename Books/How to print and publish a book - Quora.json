            "answer_text": "I had that question when I started my first ebook, but after some digging around, I pieced together a combination of free products that got me through my first two ebooks. One product was the authoring tool, which made a very nice looking ebook and allowed me to save it in either PDF or EPUB format. Of course, as a PDF it is certainly paper-printable as well as downloadable. Plus I found a shopping cart solution that solved the problem of selling my ebook. These two made it pretty easy. Recently, though, I discovered a very price-friendly software package that pretty much covers everything in one integrated package and produces very professional ebooks. You can check out this guide I wrote to see both of these solutions and more about what I thought of them. I hope it helps you with printing and publishing your ebooks. Good luck! ",
