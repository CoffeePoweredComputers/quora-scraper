            "answer_text": "I feel like my first child learned to read like magic. One day she couldn't read, and the next day she could. At least that's what it felt like. In reality, we laid down the building blocks of reading for years before it finally clicked. We started teaching her letters and their sounds when she was 2 or 3, mostly by playing on starfall.com, which I highly recommend. We have also been reading to her as long as I can remember. She would memorize books and pretend to read them by herself. One day she started recognizing small words, so I started trying to get her to sound out the ones she didn't know and guess what they were. She got to a point where she could slowly read a page. Then one night she went to sleep, and I am telling you, her brain wired itself differently that night, and in the morning she could read smoothly and easily. She was interested in all of this, and thought of it as a game. Also, I'm not the only one who played reading games with her; daddy, grandma, granny, everyone helped her. I'm trying to go about it the same way with my second child, but she's not as interested in playing the letter games as big sis. It's still too early to tell if it will be a problem, and I'm still trying to keep it light and fun, so I don't stress over it. We play \u201cfind the letter\u201d around town with the little one, especially when standing in the checkout line next to the tabloids. I am trusting that she will read in her own time. I'm homeschooling, so I probably have more flexibility in this case. One thing that might seem counterproductive at first, that has been fun for my oldest, is playing video games. Not even educational ones, she has been playing Legend of Zelda games on weekends, and she has to read the dialogue to know what to do next. She also loves graphic novels. She's into the Sonic Boom comics right now. Maybe in addition to whatever you're doing, you could schedule time for something fun that requires reading, like a wordy video game or a comic book. My kid loves those corny joke books too; I can tell if she understands the joke by how hard she laughs. This is getting long, but I think I'm trying to say, make reading part of life instead of just saying \u201cnow it's time to learn to read.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "That is a great question, I hope that I can give a few quickly digestible practices to help you or anyone else that has the most important job of educating a young person! Don't Panic! A quick nod to Douglas Adams who\u2019s advice applies to all situations including education. Children learn at their own pace and that is fine. Keep it fun Keep reading time a fun time, not a chore. Sharing a book should be a relationship-building time and learning time. Book selection is the key Let the child select books, this may involve a trip to the library, a thrift store, yard sale, their own selection at home, or even e-books online. This gives the child ownership and allows the adult to learn what kind of books they like. They may like nonfiction with pictures and descriptions or they may prefer fiction with good characters and stories. Books should be at the child\u2019s independent reading level The child should be able to read just about 100% of the words without struggling to sound out the words and the child\u2019s reading should sound fairly fluent, like talking. The child should also be able to tell you about what the book is about, the name of a character, what they are doing, where they live, or if it is a nonfiction book then what the book is about. Have the child read the independent book to you. That\u2019s it. Listen to the child read, really listen, and don\u2019t tell them words they don\u2019t know. It is good for them to try to figure out words on their own. It also lets you see how they read when no one is around. If the child gets too frustrated you can tell them the word, or just tell them to skip the word and you can come back to it later. If the book is too hard and they struggle with multiple words then put the book aside for the moment and find a book they can read independently. Compliment the child on what they are doing well such as, \u201cYou read all those words by yourself, and when you saw a hard word you looked at the picture and it helped you figure it out! That\u2019s what good readers do!\u201d Teach one lesson After the child reads you may go back and give them only one strategy for them to practice independently such as covering parts of the word with your finger and make the sounds you see. Model the strategy for the child, help them try it with a word they had a hard time with, and when you think they understand what to do ask them to practice what you taught them when they read by themselves. When you have them read to you the next time remind them of the strategy you taught, ask if they have been practicing it. See if they use the strategy when you read again. It may take several times before the child starts using the strategy independently. Don\u2019t expect it to happen the first time. Let the Child Read Alone If the child has a good selection of books they helped chose and if the books are at the child\u2019s independent reading level they will be more likely to read by themselves. If the books are too hard the child will not be engaged. Learning to Read is Like Learning to Drive We all start driving in a safe place, empty parking lot, country road. We build our driving skills slowly and we are motivated to do so. If our first driving lesson is on a busy interstate and we immediately have a fender bender we are less likely to want to get in a car. Children who struggle with reading have had these fender benders every time they open a book. All too often they decide at an early age that reading is just something they can\u2019t do. We owe it to children to give them the opportunity practice with a safe book in a safe place with a caring adult. Thank you and good luck! ",
