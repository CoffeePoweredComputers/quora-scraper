            "answer_text": "There are a lot of great websites out there to learn basic mathematical concepts (like Khan Academy), HOWEVER none of them address GMAT-specific concepts and strategies (data sufficiency strategies for one). Also, users are often exposed to concepts that are not tested on the GMAT. For example, if you look at the Basic Geometry module on Khan Academy, you\u2019ll find that many of the concepts covered are not tested on the GMAT. Finally, many of Khan\u2019s modules assume that you have a calculator available, but you don\u2019t get to use a calculator for the quant section of the GMAT. If possible, I suggest that you stick with resources that were specifically created for the GMAT. Our free GMAT video course starts with the most basic concepts and works up to 800-level concepts. I'm sure there are other courses that do the same. NOTE: Throughout our videos, we often direct students to reinforce learning via very specific Khan Academy videos and quizzes, but the goal is to first present concepts in the context of preparing for the GMAT.
