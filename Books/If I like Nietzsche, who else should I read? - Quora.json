            "answer_text": "This is a good question. I guess Nietzsche was kind of a primal scene for me, and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking for acceptable substitutes. Nietzsche is a Romantic. He references Ralph Waldo Emerson as one of his favorite authors. So we know him. But if you haven\u2019t read Thoreau\u2019s Walden, check that out also. Reminds me of Nietzsche\u2019s The Gay Science\u2026Moby Dick. Very much shares Nietzsche\u2019s titanic ambitions and sheer exuberance!Nietzsche is a taste-maker. Two taste-makers in his league, who cover culture and history with that same exhilarating sweep: R.H. Blyth\u2019s Zen and Zen Classics\u2026 and Phillipe Sollers\u2019s Women.Philosophers in the mid-20th century started to refer to the \u201cmasters of suspicion\u201d. By which they meant: Nietzsche, Marx and Freud\u2026 Freud is fun to read; like Nietzsche he has personality\u2026 I can\u2019t really speak for Marx, but probably should know something about him. Because, along with Darwin, I think that they've shaped the modern thought process.What\u2019s a reasonably short work of Freud\u2019s? I don\u2019t know \u2014 how about Beyond the Pleasure Principle? It\u2019s got an intriguing title! Pairs well with Genealogy of Morals and a nice bubble bath\u2026 Again, haven\u2019t read Marx. If someone wants to mention something of his that is fun to read, I\u2019m interested! Meanwhile, I can vouch for something by Paul Mason, called Postcapitalism. It covers the development of Marxism, after Marx, and moves very quickly\u2026 as Nietzsche would say, it\u2019s tempo is presto. Speaking of the future, and historical sweep for that matter, you might read Yuval Noah Harari\u2026 both his Sapiens and his Homo Deus. Sapiens does historical sweep pretty well. And Homo Deus gives a foretaste of the trans-human\u2026 \u201cHuman being is something that must be overcome!\u201d \u2014 and Harari will leave you convinced that it just might be!Finally, if you like Nietzsche, you should listen to some Wagner. As you know, Nietzsche remained obsessed with Wagner and his music all his life.Personally I have yet to become so enthralled with Wagner that I want to listen to 6+ hours of opera sung in German. But if you want to try something that is very easy to get into, maybe check out Edo de Waart\u2019s set by Challenge Classics. He has orchestral adaptions of Tristan, Parsifal and Der Ring, that together run about 3 hours\u2026 Don\u2019t listen to more than 3 hours, though \u2014 or you will become a rotten nihilist! ",

            "answer_text": "Excellent answers so far. I'll add a few not mentioned: Ralph Waldo Emerson- an early romantic who definitely influenced Nietzsche. Martin Heidegger- a contemporary and fellow German philosopher who is as important to modern thought as Nietzsche is. He is also good to read after Nietzche because he goes through a very interesting aesthetic transformation that is in itself very Nietzschean. Carl Jung- a psychologist whom Nietzsche was a very strong influence. Though I would not start with this from Jung, definitely read The Red Book. It went unpublished for many years because it was a philosophical exploration, very much like Thus Spoke Zarathustra, that would have undermined his scientific credibility. I think it's better than Zarathustra. Jordan Peterson- a modern psychologist and philosopher who idolizes Jung and Nietzsche, and does a very good job to resurrect the importance of the individual and romanticism of creating an interesting and heroic story out of ones own life. Powerful stuff here. Also an interesting political figure. ",
