            "answer_text": "As a pure mystery I found it to be mediocre; I figured it out about a third of the way through. The solution is not terribly tricky. The dueling perspectives thing probably would have been more novel if \u201cGone Girl\u201d hadn\u2019t just done it and done it better (in my opinion). I think the premise itself is interesting but it has some serious logic problems, namely that it\u2019s extremely unlikely for these specific people to be constantly in the right place at the right time for the few seconds each day when the protagonist rides by them. (This neighborhood is also meant to be quite tony, but if it constantly has trains running through it at all hours in close enough proximity to be able to see what everyone in the houses is up to, I, ah, question this.) A lot of people I know hated the protagonist, and she\u2019s definitely not likeable and is extremely frustrating, but no one would accuse her of being too Mary Sue-ish or overly charmed. Frankly no one in the story is likeable, including the protagonist and the victim of the crime in question. The one person I sort of felt for in the proceedings was the victim\u2019s husband. The story is in many ways the story of the protagonist\u2019s recovery, warts and all, and I think it works on that level. The apparent ease of keeping tabs on people constantly via observation-from-trains is probably the most convoluted aspect of the story; there\u2019s no Amy Dunne-esque supervillain plots. In that sense it feels quite ordinary. It\u2019s definitely an entertaining way to kill a few hours as long as you\u2019re not expecting anything more of out it. Once you figure out the solution it\u2019s fun from that point to look for clues pointing to what you already know. It\u2019s not high literature by any means and it seems like it was almost written solely so it could adapted to the screen; it is fairly cinematic. But as a pure mystery it isn\u2019t challenging at all. ",
