            "answer_text": "\u201cThe Greek Myths\u201d by Robert Graves. A complete and enjoyable text which I\u2019ve read since I was 8 and never stopped: an enourmous source of information about the Greek world.\u201cTheogony\u201d by Hesiod. Often times, after studying on text books, it comes the time to read the classics. And most of the time, classics also happen to be more interesting and full of content than dry textbooks. Hesiod, possibly the earliest Greek poet along with Homer, wrote his major work in attempting to collect and systematically structure in a long poem the whole set of myths and oral traditions which existed so far about the origins of Gods (theogony) and of universe itself (cosmogony). The poem, although elevated style may be a hurdle (there are plenty of worthy commented editions available), provides a rich useful insight into Greek mythology passed on from the dawn of Greek civilizations to 8th century BCE.The \u201cBibliotheca\u201d of Pseudo-Apollodorus. Written about one millennium after Hesiod\u2019s Theogony by an unidentified author, the \u201cBibliotheca\u201d (Library) is the most complete compendium of Greek mythology ever written in Greek. Arranged in three books, it skillfully summarizes the set of myths and heroic epic, from cosmogony to the n\u00f2stoi (the homecoming of Greek kings after the destruction of Troy.)\u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cOdyssey\u201d by Homer. Whoever Homer was, despite his timeless fame, it\u2019s never been clear and probably will never be. Nonetheless, \u201chis\u201d Iliad and Odyssey, two 24-books each epic poems, have historically been held as the first actual - and major - works of Greek literature. Anyway Iliad, by telling the last days of the siege of Troy and especially the devastating outcome of Achilles\u2019 wrath, and its \u201csequel\u201d, Odyssey, through the narration of Odysseus\u2019 homecoming, incidentally come to give the most valuable knowledge about Gods\u2019 world and the relationship \u201cexisting\u201d between mortals and deities.The \u201cArgonautica\u201d by Apollonius Rhodius. Apollonius Rhodius was an Alexandrian poet who wrote in 3rd century BC. His \u201cArgonautica\u201d, as the name suggests, deals with the deeds of Jason and his Argonauts. As the author was a scholar and a librarian, his work naturally incorporates insight into geography, ethnography and mythology.These above are the 5\u20136 works which I deem to be the best when it comes to Greek mythology. In addition you can look up for Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoseon libri, written in Latin by the greatest Latin poet, but deeply influenced by Hellenistic literature and massively incorporating Greek mythology. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not familiar with TV series, movies or Internet resources in English which provide such a vaguely systematic knowledge, but I feel I can suggest that you take a look to Rick Riordan\u2019s Percy Jackson series, as long as you\u2019re looking for some less \u201cliterary\u201d sources: to tell the truth, Riordan, by using myths somehow \u201cretold\u201d and \u201cmade suitable\u201d to modern times, did an excellent job and possibly succeded to bring thousands of young men closer to the world of the Ancient Greeks. Hope this helped a bit. ",

            "answer_text": "The Iliad and the odyssey by homerIf you're looking for real historical literature. Another alternative would be Rick riordans book, mostly targeted to a teenage audience. Percy Jackson and the Olympians. It's got a story of its on but a newbie to Greek mythology would still learn a lot of facts and tidbits. Then there are authors like David gimmel and Mary Renault who've written a lot of novels accurate to the events of the original greek mythology. My personal favourite is the song of Achilles by Madeline Miller.It's so beautifully written. It's the story of Achilles growing up with Patroclus. Also see goddess of Troy by PC Cast for a more fun and light read about the events of the Trojan war, but it's more of a fanfiction of the Iliad more than anything. It's about a mortal woman of the 21st century who is thrown back in time and wakes up in the body of a Greek princess who is Achilles's war prize bride and she changes the end of the tragedy for the better... Yeah incredibly cheesy I know hahah Happy reading! ",
