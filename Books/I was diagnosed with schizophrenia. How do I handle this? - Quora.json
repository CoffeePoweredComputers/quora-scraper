            "answer_text": "Hello. Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that makes it difficult for our brain to perform the way it is supposed. This results in sufferers making wrong conclusions from various stimuli. It can also make the thinking process very disorganized. The sufferer is often oblivious to these problems because the part of the brain that would make the sufferer aware that there is a problem is one of the main parts affected by the illness. The good news is that treatments for thins condition are better than they were many years ago and even better than when I first got into psychiatry. To answer your question, you need to treat it. The sooner and the more effectively you treat it, the better the long term outcome. Like I said there are many treatments. Research suggests that Clozapine, a pill only medication that has been around for a while, is the most superior medication available. Clozapine requires dedication and blood tests. There will have to be changes to your diet and exercise habits with all the medications and particularly with Clozapine. If you choose not to take Clozapine, then my advice to you is to take a medication that comes in a Long Acting Injection (LAI) form. Research shows that outcomes with these medications are superior to pull form (apart from Clozapine). You may also benefit from increased knowledge about the condition and your family could as well. Support from family and friends also improves your outcomes. Depending on which country you live in, you may be able to access government programs that can help you with work, education and living in general. Lifestyle changes: avoid excessive alcohol consumption. Avoid illicit drugs that elevate brain dopamine: cocaine, Crystal meth, high THC Canabis, crack (cocaine), all do this, so I would avoid them all together. Try to eat healthy and exercise. Almost all the medications cause some degree of weight gain and if this becomes problematic, work with your doctors to deal with it early on. Lastly, the CTO; its not the enemy. Embrace it. It\u2019s for your protection and potentially the protection of others. The more you don\u2019t resist the CTO, comply with your medication and do all you can to stay healthy, the quicker your doctor will think the CTO is not necessary. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Having Schizophrenia doesn\u2019t make you a terrible or crazy person, it just makes you a person with a condition. Find out from your Psychiatrist what types of medication you can try to help to lessen your symptoms. Take them as prescribed and find the medication and dosage that work best for you. The goal is to get your brain to work at its very best so that you can enjoy life more with fewer interruptions. Continue therapy even if you get to a place where you\u2019re feeling better, as you might still need it to work through your feelings of having Schizophrenia, and keep in mind that almost everyone on the planet has one condition or another to deal with, so it\u2019s actually a normal part of the challenges of life. A therapy group might be helpful, or you could supplement your current therapy with your Psychiatrist by watching those on YouTube who also have Schizophrenia discuss how they\u2019ve learned to live so that this condition doesn\u2019t prevent them from living life in a way that works best for them and their loved ones. You are not alone. P.S. I would like to add that some vitamin deficiencies can mimic psychosis, so be sure to find out through a blood screen by a medical doctor if you are lacking in vitamins such as B-12 and D, for example. If you are taking medication it would be helpful to to see a licensed nutritionist as well to make sure you are getting other vitamins that help the absorption of the vitamins which can help prevent psychosis-like symptoms because many medications can interfere with that process in your body. If you can\u2019t see a nutritionist, do consider watching one online. I personally enjoy watching Dr. Berg on YouTube, who has a ton of extremely helpful information on vitamins, nutrition, and more. You can find him on YouTube by clicking his name below: Dr. Eric Berg DC Here is a video by Dr. Berg specifically discussing Vitamin B-12 deficiency (also known as Pernicious Anemia):  As always, be sure that any supplements you take will not conflict with any medications you\u2019re taking.
