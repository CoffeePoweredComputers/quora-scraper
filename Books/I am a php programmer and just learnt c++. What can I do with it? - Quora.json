            "answer_text": "Hi there, That is great news. But, if you\u2019re unsure why you\u2019ve learn it, how can I help you? Ask yourself, why have I learn C++, what are its uses and what is it that I want to do with it? If you\u2019re asking me to guide you, I can only share some options. Become a contributor for PHP core or make some extensions for it. If you\u2019re looking to change your role, from a web developer to maybe a game developer or even more a virtual reality creator, that is up to you. C++ can be use to communicate with robotics. So all in all, it is your decision. I hope I\u2019ve answered your question. ",

            "answer_text": "So the question is how to code web related software in C++. First, you can use some HTTP server libraries like Wt or libonion to code applications in C++ which are (specialized) web servers. And you can use libcurl & Qt to code C++ applications which are HTTP clients. Then, you can customize your PHP framework thru extensions (or plugins) coded in C++. Some database servers can accept plugins in C++. You could use FastCGI technology to connect your C++ application to a web server. BTW, all this is probably more likely to work on Linux. ",
