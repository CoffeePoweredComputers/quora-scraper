            "answer_text": "It was a dark and stormy night\u2026  No, seriously. Do you mean the opening? Or the process? An opening is always a bit of trying to put fifty pounds of potatoes in a five-pound bag. You want to grab the reader, get them used to your style and tone, tell them what kind of story it is, introduce them to the main characters, orient them to the world they will be in, and start the plot rolling. You can\u2019t do all of it. You have to focus on one thing and make it strong enough to drag the reader along until you can find the time to get the rest in. That\u2019s why some readers do prologues; a self-contained, simpler story \u2014 the hope being, by the time the reader figures out this isn\u2019t the main story and they got interested in these characters and their problems for nothing, they will be ten pages in and have subconsciously committed to reading the rest of the thing anyway. Every word in the opening is a trade off, and it is always loss-loss. Whatever choice you make will be a choice you can\u2019t make, a thing you can\u2019t show, a beat you couldn\u2019t do. And since it is at the top of the book, every little thing takes on significance it shouldn\u2019t. The heroine has red hair? \u201cIs this going to be important?\u201d the reader asks. \u201cDoes this mean she\u2019s a Witch? She\u2019s Irish? She has a temper? She dyes? Why is the author telling us this? I\u2019d better pay close attention to everyone\u2019s hair until I figure this out!\u201d It\u2019s the Chekov rule. Or, as I like to call it, room descriptions from the old table-top RPGs. \u201cYou are in a ten-foot wide hallway. There is a door to the left. It has a knob an the hinges are on this side.\u201d \u201cOooh, he mentioned the hinges! There must be something special about them! Quick, get the thief to the front of the party to Check for Traps!\u201d  Okay, here\u2019s my rule of thumb: we read for characters, and characters are characters when they are doing something. When they have a goal. A book which opens with; Susan was tall for Junior High and she wore her long hair in a ponytail despite not being a cheerleader\u2026 Or; It was another ordinary day at the office. Susan turned on her computer and started to check all the emails that had come in since\u2026 Don\u2019t give us anything but a person or a place. No, try this instead; Susan popped the magazine just long enough to glance at the witness holes. Three rounds left. She pushed the sweaty hair out of her face and\u2026 Now, it isn\u2019t that the third example is action. That\u2019s another new writer mistake. Action does stir the blood, and you can, especially in an opening, get a lot of mileage just by having characters move faster than a walking pace. What it is, though, is conflict. We don\u2019t yet know who Susan is or what she is doing but we understand she has an immediate problem. She really, really needs those bullets and she\u2019s down to three of them. And we\u2019re about to find out what happens because of this, and that makes us engaged as a reader. We could have fixed either of the above as easily; Susan was tall for Junior High. She was wearing her long hair in a ponytail because, today, today, she was finally going to pass that tryout and get on the squad\u2026 And; It had started as ordinary day at the office, but when Susan opened the first email of her work day she got a terrible shock\u2026 Now we have conflict. Or at least potential conflict. Given a choice, though, save the cheerleader, save the story. Tryout Susan has something even more important to getting a reader engaged with a character than a problem. She has a goal. You might not care about her goal. But she is actively doing something in pursuit of that and this makes her more intrinsically interesting than a character who is simply reacting to something that happened. Three-bullets-left Susan had the same thing; an implicit goal (win the fight, stay alive) and an immediate obstacle to her goal (a nearly empty magazine). So that Susan is in the middle of trying to accomplish her goal and she is reacting to the first interesting obstacle in her path. And how she reacts tells us oodles about the character. We could waste precious paragraphs of our opening trying to explain how she was calm under fire and determined to win anyhow but, and that she knows guns and this isn\u2019t her first time at this rodeo, but, hey, we just showed all of that with an action.  And what about the process of starting a book? Well, that\u2019s enough words for one morning. I\u2019ll let you ask that again in some other question. ",

            "answer_text": "Well pretend like you are telling the story to a friend. Where would it start, how should it be told and so on. You have to introduce the characters and the world you are writing about and if it is fantasy or sci-fi, then you have to explain the mechanics of the world to the reader.  You should make your protagonist likeable and believable (doesn't have to be likeable though. Plenty of books have been written with complete jerks as main characters. I'm looking at you Salinger.) Whatever you do your main character and the things that are happening interesting enough to make the reader want to turn the page.  Also start with a good first sentence.  Here are a few that I love.  It is a truth  universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession  of a good fortune,  must be in want of a wife. \u2014Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice Happy families are all  alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. \u2014Leo Tolstoy,  Anna Karenina (1877;  trans. Constance Garnett) If you really want to  hear about it, the first thing you'll probably  want to know is where I was  born, and what my lousy childhood was like,  and how my parents were occupied  and all before they had me, and all  that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I  don't feel like going into  it, if you want to know the truth.  All this happened, more  or less. \u2014Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five    In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice  that I've  been turning over in my mind ever since. \u2014F. Scott  Fitzgerald, The  Great Gatsby ",
