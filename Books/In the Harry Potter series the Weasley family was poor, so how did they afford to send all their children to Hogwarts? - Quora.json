            "answer_text": "The Weasleys weren\u2019t poor; in Ron\u2019s opinion his family is poor. It doesn\u2019t help his viewpoint that his best friend has a vault full of wizard gold left to him by his parents, and then ANOTHER vault full of gold and treasure plus a house when Harry\u2019s godfather died. Hermione is the only child of two (presumably prosperous) dentists, which means not only does she not have to share her clothes or possessions with anyone, she also takes actual vacations when she\u2019s not at Hogwarts and probably has Muggle clothes that aren\u2019t from a thrift shop. Others have already pointed out that Hogwarts is a state-funded school, not a private one (would Durmstrang and Beauxbatons be private schools then?) so the Weasleys didn\u2019t have to pay for the kids\u2019 tuition, room or board. But what about the expenses when the kids were all at home? Let\u2019s take a look. When Harry first meets Ron, Bill and Charlie Weasley have already left home and are working for Gringotts and as a dragon handler respectively. That means there are five kids still at home-Percy, Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny. Ginny doesn\u2019t start at Hogwarts until the following year. With two kids out of the house and working, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley have recovered enough financially to give Percy new robes AND an owl for making prefect. But we learn that Ron is headed to Hogwarts with secondhand robes, wand, and rat. Huh.Christmas rolls around, and we learn Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are spending the Christmas holidays in Romania visiting Charlie (presumably with Ginny in tow) leaving their 4 boys at Hogwarts. I\u2019m sure Mr. Weasley earns holiday time at the Ministry, but still, vacations cost money. Did they Apparate to Romania, with their 10 year daughter and their luggage?Mr. Weasley has a shed and office full of Muggle stuff, including the Ford Anglia. That stuff costs money. Or did he \u201cappropriate\u201d it on raids?Mrs. Weasley can be a stay at home mom with 7 kids.Ron moans about being poor but when he\u2019s telling Harry about the Chocolate Frog cards, he says he has hundreds of them.Mrs. Weasley has money to spend on Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s useless books and a subscription to Witch Weekly.All this to say that the Weasleys aren\u2019t poor. They just appear to be like many a middle class family in Europe or America. They live paycheck to paycheck, but they don\u2019t always focus on what they really shouldn\u2019t spend money on. This was my answer to a question, not an invitation to debate the Weasleys\u2019 true economic status in the comments, so further commenting has been disabled. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "There doesn't seem to be any tuition necessary to attend Hogwarts. If there was then you just know the Dursley's would refuse to pay it to keep Harry from going. Hogwarts is presumably funded by the Ministry of Magic, at least partially, but they have to send out acceptance letters so it seems not all wizard children get to attend. Hogwarts seems to be like what Americans would call a magnet school or a charter school. These are publicly funded schools but they are allowed to be selective with which students they will teach. Students often have to take an aptitude test to be allowed in. Hogwarts must have some sort of test they use to decide which kids to teach (midiclorians?). The only money wizard parents have to spend is on school supplies; robes, books, and potion materials. This is what really strains the Weasley family's budget, and why Ron and Ginny are forced to make do with hand-me-down stuff from their elder siblings. EDIT: And to those saying \u201cthe Weasleys aren't really poor\u201d you're wrong. They are poor. The books state several times that they are poor. We see the inside of their bank vault and how little money is in it. They may not be as poor as they could be, but that doesn't make them not poor. The poor in the US aren't nearly as poor as starving people in Africa, but if you tried to tell them that they'd want to slap you. The Weasleys are a poor family. ",
