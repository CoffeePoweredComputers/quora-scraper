            "answer_text": "I agree with Anett\u2019s assessment that the more you learn the harder it gets. Non-Japanese who say they can speak the language tend to mean they can order food in a restaurant, or hold a simple conversation. People who have got much further along the road than that tend to be more cautious, less likely to claim fluency, more aware that, despite all that they know, there is still more that they don\u2019t know. The problem is that Japanese is difficult even for the Japanese! For example, Japanese colleagues have told me that when they come into a university department it takes them a year or two before they fully understand what is being said at department meetings and so on. That makes me feel a lot better about the fact that, even after many years, I still often don\u2019t understand! Something similar applies in almost every area of Japanese life - in the workplace, in sporting activities, in specialized pursuits (like flower arranging, or Noh theatre, or anything like that), in local communities\u2026 For example, the amount of knowledge needed to be able to date and read Japanese ukiyo-e prints, or discuss Buddhist and Shinto Deities, would take a native speaker of Japanese months or even years to master properly. And someone who has put in that time and is quite at home with those areas of the language may have considerable difficulty keeping up with a conversation about crop-growing techniques among a group of farmers in a remote rural area, or the breeding habits of marine animals among a group of fishermen in an offshore boat, or even a group of company workers talking shop. So if Japanese is difficult for the Japanese, then I think it\u2019s fair to say it is virtually impossible for foreigners! That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t reach a high level, but the more you know the more you become aware of the limitations to your knowledge. One more thing. Japan seems to be very adept at closing the circle and defining very clearly who is in and who is out of the circle. Someone else on Quora described it a bit like this: If there are twenty people and twelve of them went to Waseda University and the other eight went to a different university, the ones from Waseda will engage in a kind of \u201cin-talk\u201d that leaves the others feeling left out. If there are twelve people and eight of them work in a bank and four of them have other jobs those four will end up feeling left out. If there are three people and two went to the same school the one who did not will feel left out, at least part of the time. OK, that\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration, perhaps, but it\u2019s not too far off the mark. The reasons for this are partly cultural - the majority group has a shared culture, a shared experience and shared assumptions - and partly linguistic; there are all kinds of in-group words and specialized terms that people use, almost without thinking about it, with others who share their background. Now think about what that means if you are a foreigner. Even two Japanese people who went to different universities or work in different fields will normally have vastly more shared cultural background, shared assumptions and so on than they have with a foreigner. It isn\u2019t always so, but it is often so. That doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t have friends - and good ones. Nor does it mean mean you can\u2019t make a lot of progress with the language and have some very interesting and stimulating conversations. But in my case, with English as my first language, I can say with confidence that I am considerably further from resembling a native speaker in Japan (where I have lived for twenty-five years) than in Spain (where I lived for six). EDIT: As one person says in the comments, the members of every culture are likely to have more in common with each other than with people from outside that culture. Of course this is true, but I think that in Japan the sense of being part of an in-group is more marked than in most other cultures. Just as an example, if you took two Scottish people who went to the same university but had very different politics and added a Frenchman who shared the political views of one of them to the mix, the two with similar politics might form a stronger social bond than the two who went to the same university. The shared political ideology might well outweigh whatever affinity the two Scottish people feel for each other. Of course, something similar could also happen in Japan, but my feeling is it\u2019s less likely. That\u2019s just a personal assessment, and YMMV, but that\u2019s my take on it! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. If you\u2019re Korean, it\u2019s pretty easy \u2014 similar grammar and a lot of shared words from Chinese. If you\u2019re a native English speaker though, it can be tough. Donald Keene pointed out many years ago that whereas the Columbia U students studying Chinese learned about 10k kanji (or was it 5k?) the students in Japanese learned only 2k, because there are so many different readings for each one. Kanji are hard. One person I know compared them to catching frogs and putting them in a pail. You catch one frog, but two others jump out. Similarly, you learn one kanji but forget two others. In my case, I just sat at my table for 8 hours a day and studied kanji. I learned 10 an hour for five hours, then spent 3 hours reviewing the ones I had learned over the previous week. Boring as hell, but in a month I had learned over 1,000 kanji (50 a day = some 300 a week X 4 weeks) and could read reasonably well. Note that this is not intellectually challenging at all. First graders can and do do it perfectly well. You just have to apply yourself to it. I knew a Japanese history student who went to some extreme school where they learned \u2014 wait for it \u2014 100 kanji a day for several months! At the end he knew some 5,000 of them and could read pre-modern Japanese. For what it\u2019s worth, I once met a Thai lady who spoke both English and Japanese fluently. Thai is not related to either language so she was a good unbiased observer. She said English was harder than Japanese, because the grammar is more difficult. (Maybe there are some Chinese loan words in Thai too, I don\u2019t know.) The fact is, Japanese is a pretty simple language as languages go: only 4 verb tenses (I go, I am going, I went, I was going), the verbs don\u2019t conjugate (I go, you go, he/she/it go, you go, we go, they go), only 4 irregular verbs in the whole language (go, going, goed). Compare that with French! No masculine & feminine. Not even any plurals. No relative pronouns (who, which, that). So what\u2019s the big deal? In that case\u2026why isn\u2019t my Japanese better after 18 years working at it? PS \u2014 here\u2019s the US State Department\u2019s experience with language learning. They rate Japanese a \u201csuper hard\u201d language, the hardest category. After seeing this, I felt a lot better. FSI's Experience with Language Learning The Foreign Service Institute's School of Language Studies (SLS) offers instruction in over 65 languages, with course length and curricula varying to accommodate a range of language proficiencies, from basic to advanced. The following language learning timelines reflect 70 years of experience in teaching languages to U.S. diplomats, and illustrate the time usually required for a student to reach \u201cProfessional Working Proficiency\u201d in the language, or a score of \u201cSpeaking-3/Reading-3\u201d on the Interagency Language Roundtable scale (full scale available here). These timelines are based on what FSI has observed as the average length of time for a student to achieve proficiency, though the actual time can vary based on a number of factors, including the language learner's natural ability, prior linguistic experience, and time spent in the classroom.
