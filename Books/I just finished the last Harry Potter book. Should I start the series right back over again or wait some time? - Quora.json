If you have, try out the companion books JK Rowling wrote: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Quidditch Through the Ages Tales of Beadle the Bard Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (This one is an epilogue to the main story but I\u2019m not very fond of this one) But I can\u2019t really say anything too forceful. It\u2019s your choice if you want to relive the story once again, but I\u2019m just giving out some tips. ",

I re-read the books because that magic was worth revisiting, and to be sure my memory of the richness of the books was not painted over by the mistakes, misinterpretations and missing stories of those movies.
