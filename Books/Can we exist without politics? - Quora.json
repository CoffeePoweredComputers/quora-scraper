            "answer_text": "In the modern world, religion has been replaced with politics. People can\u2019t exist without adherence to a higher power. In the modern world that higher power has become the state, and the state is represented by politicians. Politicians have replaced God as the, if not worshipable then venerable objects, for the public to absorb themselves in. It\u2019s a curious thing, when it comes to politics and science, people are willing to study it, in order to learn how it works, but when it comes to religion and the metaphysical, spiritual aspects of life, all of the sudden people forget the scientific approach, and just accept either their own preconceived notions or some passed on faith, as factual. Real religion is a science that can be tried and tested like any other science. In Atheism, for instance, the belief in abiogenesis and evolution is so strong that even though all empiric observations rule out these theories, atheists strongly cling on to these blind beliefs. It\u2019s a curious about being an atheists - even though atheists claim to be interested in facts only, they have to reject empiric facts i order to maintain their atheism. And instead of absorbing themselves in God and religion, like they are meant to do, they now absorb themselves in politics A new religion has evolved in the global culture. It\u2019s called Scientism. It\u2019s become the religion of atheists. Even though modern science has absolutely nothing sensible to say about the reality we live in, the general population is convinced that science has explained away the need for God and religion. Scientific theories like abiogenesis and evolution, even though they are pure and unalloyed myths, are being taught in all educational institutions of the world as scientific facts. The real fact is, the only use of science, is to invent and fabricate technology. But who has decided that technological expertise is the best way to measure our ability to understand the reality we live in? Those who are influential in defining peoples' realities - the producers, scientists, the media, politicians, etc. -- have made technological advancement the barometer of human progress. They claim that the advancement of technology is the most noble pursuit of the human race, that it has made the world a better place to live in. As proof, they list all the consumer gadgets we use and are dependent upon - computers, cell-phones, televisions, cars, and so on - and say that the intelligence to build these things shows that we have advanced our understanding of nature and how she works far beyond our ability in the middle ages. But is this assertion correct? To build a computer, one certainly requires advanced knowledge of physics and chemistry, but these disciplines describe only a tiny part of the reality we perceive. A far greater part of reality is our conscious experience of it -- something most people don\u2019t even think about. Few people ponder the fact that their understanding of the world is dictated by the culture they grew up in. They automatically take for granted that the way they perceive the world is the correct one, and that nature is best described in physical and chemical terms. Modern science is very useful for making technology, in fact, it\u2019s the only thing it is good for, and when we live in a world where the masses are kept in awe and reverence of technological wonders, science is, of course, a most important undertaking. But the jubilation of modern people over the newest technology is no different from the gaping wonder with which people in the middle ages looked upon sorcerers and magicians firing off sulphur and gun powder. The magicians did this to dupe their audiences and secure their comfortable hold on society. In the middle ages, in the West at least, the regents of society kept people in ignorance so they were easy to control and manipulate, and today the exact same means are used to enslave people in ignorance. In the global culture the slaves have just been upgraded to a middle-class with their own house and car. People still slave their lives away in boring jobs and are marred by the same endless worries and miseries, people have always suffered from. They are still being ground down by taxation, victims of greedy politicians, exactly like they\u2019ve always been. There is no basis for saying that advanced knowledge of mathematics and physics enables a person to better understand the world any more than the cave dweller of some 2000 years ago, who worshiped nature and various gods. If the modern culture is based on a better understanding of the world, why is it ruining nature and her inhabitants at an alarming rate? If modern man is more advanced in his understanding of nature, why is he sawing the branch he is sitting on? Despite the so-called advancement of modern society, people are till not able to transcend their mental conditioning. The proof is that modern society does not produce people with evolved consciousness. Rather, we see the exact opposite taking place - in direct proportion to the advancement of technology, people have become more and more base and idiotic in the way they treat and relate to each-other. Some years ago, WHO published a report saying that the biggest health crisis facing the world in the new millennium is that more and more people will be born with mental defects. Is that the symptom of an evolved society? Society, as it is, is not equipped to facilitate self-realized human beings. What need does a self realized person have for the plethora of useless products being produced by the few conglomerates that control world consumerism? Such enlightenment would indeed negate the necessity for the technological advancement upon which the world's finances now rely. That is why, in the current global culture, a deliberate campaign exists to transform people into atheists. In such a culture, religion is being ridiculed and has been replaced with politics. Instead of voting for a particular religion, the public now votes for politicians, who are mostly hired by those multinationals with the biggest checkbooks -- all in the name of serving the people, of course. The modern, global culture has already made the whole world into one big marketplace - a worldwide altar where technology is worshiped as the new opium of the masses. Being fed endless propaganda from Hollywood where technology saves the day, we quickly forget that technology, despite assurances to the contrary, cannot save us from the onslaughts of nature. Time and time again, technology comes up short in the fight against nature. The new high-priests of society, now clad in white frocks instead of black, fail to comprehend how the mechanisms of nature work. And how could they? They also suffer from the misunderstanding that everything is dead matter, and are restricted by the assumption that their knowledge of physical laws can explain the world. Yet more important than understanding how matter works is the understanding of how consciousness, false ego, intelligence and mind work. These make up the reality we perceive. As long as we fail to understand the difference between matter and consciousness, we cannot even be said to have evolved beyond animal consciousness. That's why atheism is dangerous - it keeps the consciousness trapped in a 3-dimensional world of matter. It keeps the self from its rare mission in the human life form - to understand consciousness. It cultivates a perception of life where the consciousness cannot see itself - a deception where the self, being absorbed in matter, forgets itself. Every individual is duty-bound to alter their consciousness and connect it with the whole - Sri Krishna. While Srila Prabhupada was a nitya-siddha, he was also a social revolutionary, as was the Lord he served - Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The political correctness that predominates in the world and passes as social etiquette should not stop us from assisting him in his mission - to silence the atheistic class of men, and to inundate the world with Krishna Consciousness. Krishna says: The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind. The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another, as the air carries aromas. Thus he takes one kind of body and again quits it to take another. The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of ear, eye, tongue, nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects. The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this. The endeavoring transcendentalists who are situated in self-realization can see all this clearly. But those whose minds are not developed and who are not situated in self-realization cannot see what is taking place, though they may try. \u2014 Bhagavad-gita 15.7\u201311  ",

Without rule of law, we would have chaos and most likely an authoritarian dictatorship type of society where one person will take power and abuse the power and gangs forming to take control of supply and demand. We need political leaders that not only create laws but organize the government and make decisions. So no, we can't really exist without politics unless you're okay with a dictator rising up and taking charge and a dystopian future like the Mad Max movie. Max Max is a perfect example of what happens when we don't have politics and rule or law. It might sound cool as a movie but if it were real, it wouldn't be cool at all.  ",

Wherever there is a city, there is also a governing body for that city. Those who know how to run the government will do so \u2014 and everybody else will contribute his or her opinion as they are able. To govern a city, one must know how to run a household (Economia). Then, one must know how to defend the city from invaders. Then, one must know how to protect the citizens and their property from criminals. One must know the city fully \u2014 its assets and liabilities \u2014 and one must know the population\u2019s culture well. For a large city, we can discern six major classes of the population \u2014 the agricultural owners, the agricultural workers, the industrial owners, the industrial workers, the government command, and the government workers. Each class has several subdivisions, its own interests and its own rights. It is up to the city government to negotiate the demands of each class and provide them with appropriate representation, to make the best decisions for the public good in specific circumstances. This is politics. As long as people live in cities \u2014 large or small \u2014 there will always be politics. ",
