            "answer_text": "When I taught high school math, I would sometimes find errors in the solution manual or in the back of the book. Textbook editors do their best but they are still human. I once spent a few hours on a problem always coming up with an answer that the book said was wrong. I sent the problem to my friend with a Ph.D. in math. He got the same answer as me. The book was wrong. So mistakes do occur. I once tutored a young man in a College Algebra course. He was doing and submitting his problems online. This may sound unbelievable but 5% to 10% of the answers on the software solutions were wrong. The professor was at fault for not warning the students about all the mistakes. I am not in any way a mathematician but I can do College Algebra problems. ",

            "answer_text": "My calculus text for 2 semesters of Calculus, had a few errors in the text, in the answers, and interestingly, in the accompanying answer book with worked out examples. So, it happens. Is it common, let\u2019s just say it happens from time to time, so not common, but not surprising when it does. ",
