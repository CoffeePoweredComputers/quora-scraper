            "answer_text": "Adult coloring books are a fun product, and can be lucrative if you\u2019re planning on selling them. I\u2019ve been helping customers print, share and sell adult coloring books for years, so here are my thoughts: The first thing you need is coloring designs for the pages of your book. If you are an artist, you can create them yourself. You can also download stock images, just be sure you have the correct rights depending on if you are using these for your own entertainment or plan on printing and selling them. You\u2019ll also need a front and back cover image. Your files for the coloring book, including the front and back cover, need to be print-ready pdfs that can be uploaded to your publishing company for printing. Next, you\u2019ll need to do is find a printer/publishing company that offers the quality and creativity needed for these unique products. Paper needs to be the right thickness, pages need to lay flat for easy coloring, printing needs to be clear and high-quality, etc. Look for a company that is experienced in printing these unique types of products, can help you get an ISBN for retail sales if you plan on selling them, and can offer you A to Z services beyond printing, like listing on Amazon, working with your shopping carts if you\u2019re selling from your own sites, providing on-demand or bulk printing options, and fulfillment services if you don\u2019t want to do it on your own. Beyond that, here\u2019s a quick list of other recommendations I share with our customers for creating high-quality adult coloring books, I hope this helps: Spiral binding or saddle stitching is best so that the book will lay flat.Coloring books can be printed single-sided or double-sided.If you choose to print double-sided, use a thicker-weight paper to avoid bleed-through.Perforate pages to make them easy to tear out.Ask if you can print your book vertical or horizontal. Most are vertical, so creating one that is horizontal with spiral binding so it lays flat will make yours unique!",

            "answer_text": "I recently published an adult coloring book using Amazon CreateSpace, and here's the advice I can offer you if you're interested in self-publishing, print-on-demand. Create the digital art files, using a program such Adobe Illustrator. Think about the dimensions of your printed book and page size ratios (length to width) before you create the art to avoid issues down the road.Choose a method of publishing - if you want to self-publish, you may want to look at Ingram Spark or Create Space. Depending on which you choose, you may have to get an ISBN too.Create a cover.Decide what \"front\" matter you want...like a table of contents, etc. Then create that front matter :)Layout the book using a program such as InDesign, according to the specs of the publisher you choose.Upload your files to the publisherOrder a proof when the publisher alerts you, and review it.Approve the proof if all is okay!",
