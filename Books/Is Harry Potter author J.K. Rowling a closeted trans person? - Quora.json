            "answer_text": "Doubtful. But she sure isn\u2019t who I thought she was, considering all of her recent buffoonish tweets and posts about trans people and their authenticity. Personally, I just don\u2019t get why so many incredibly wealthy and successful people who have worked so hard for their position in pop culture\u2014 and all the recognition they\u2019ve achieved\u2014just suddenly go off on a sensitive topic they know is likely going to do them damage. Unbelievable. So now, instead of being known as the incredibly talented and imaginative mother of the Harry Potter world, she\u2019s quickly earning the labels as a quack and a TERF. And that she\u2019s doubling down on all of her ignorant twaddle just makes her look even more pathetic\u2014and frankly, like she\u2019s going nuts. She\u2019s gonna be in BIG trouble with her fans in very short order (already is with some), if she can\u2019t stifle her urge to hurt some very fragile people who don\u2019t deserve to be her cultural victims. \u201cMiddle age rant.\u201d My ass\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing suggests that is the case so far, and I wish people would stop putting forth the idea that being phobic against homosexuals or transgender people means that said person is closeted themselves. Yes sure, this is the case for some people. But other people are just assholes, or ignorant, or any number of other things that does not corellate to being a closeted anything. Maybe JK Rowling is indeed a closeted transgender. But the bigger likelyhood is, she is not and she\u2019s just someone who holds asshole opinions. ",
