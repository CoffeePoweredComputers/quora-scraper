            "answer_text": "Both. That way you can compare the film to the book. I generally find the novel to be better by far than the film, for example, \u201cBonfire of the Vanities,\u201d as a film was a let-down, while the book was superb. The recently released \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d may have fared better as a miniseries, because there was so much material there to shove into a movie\u2014 even at 2 1/2 hours. Then again, David Lean managed quite well with Dr. Zhivago, a movie I will see time and again, while reading the novel once was sufficient enough for me. \u201cLolita\u201d as a movie, even by Stanley Kubrick missed the richness of Nabokov\u2019s phrasing, including the opening sentences of the novel, which to me are among the most memorable and superbly written. The classics generally are entertaining enough as movies, such as \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d and I enjoy comparing its many movie versions, as well as those of \u201cJane Eyre\u201d and \u201cWuthering Heights.\u201d Sometimes seeing the film version has prodded me to read the books, as was the case of the original BBC / Masterpiece series runs of \u201cPoldark,\u201d and \u201cI, Claudius\u201d (which is way overdue for a remake). I also read \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d while watching its first season. There was one case for me where the movie proved to be better than the book, and that was \u201cDevil wears Prada.\u201d The book was based on the author\u2019s personal experience, which was entertaining enough, but the screen adaptation (and Meryl Streep) made the movie version lively and memorable.

            "answer_text": "Totally depends. I know, people will say reading books over movies is the better thing to do. Well, when i first watch harry potter and the sorcerer\u2019s stone i didn\u2019t even know that it\u2019s a book adaption by J.K. Rowling. After so many years, i read sorcerer\u2019s stone and i was dumbstruck by the fact how a movie adapted from a book has missed so much but it\u2019s only legit as we can\u2019t really expect to portray each and every detail. Moving on, i have watched every part of harry potter series and i don\u2019t remember how many times. I have a hp pillow cover, elder wand keychain, harry potter t\u2019s. I even now remember the movie dialogues, each and every character\u2019s name and the spells and what not? But i haven\u2019t read any book apart from the philosopher\u2019s stone. Why? because i have already made such wizardry world in my mind and heart which i didn\u2019t want to change even a little bit. Now let\u2019s walk into the parallel universe. I have read this book last year The kite runner by the author khaled hosseini. I fell in love with the author\u2019s viewpoint. He presented the middle east in pages. I don\u2019t read very often because novels don\u2019t have any images in particular. lol. Judge me, I don\u2019t care but i read this one and his another famous novel i.e. A thousand splendid suns. Reason being his writing has enough potential that you don\u2019t need any pictures to keep the flow intact. The detailing in any tale is everything. Moving on, recently i have come to know there they made the movie The kite runner. I have watched the trailer even but i wasn\u2019t sure to watch, as hassan\u2019s image in my mind is different than how he was looking in the movie adaption. Both time it was the same reason for me that i have already liked something for some specific detailing and i didn\u2019t want to ruin that. So, if you\u2019re okay with such things then you should read the book first as books are far well detailed and has more interesting turns and event than movies. ",
