            "answer_text": "In modern times, uninformed people consider Latin America a geographical location and a proper name for all the nations south of Rio Grande/Rio Bravo del Norte; hence, Mexico is considered part of Latin America; albeit, Mexico is actually part of the North American Continent. It\u2019s not even part of Central America as some people declare. The term Latin America is a misleading term\u2026 I don\u2019t know of any country in the Americas whose national language is Latin. The majority speaks Spanish; some speak Portuguese, French, and even English. Truly, the expression LATIN AMERICA makes reference ONLY to countries that speak Spanish, NOT LATIN. I suppose the confusion, comes from the fact that Spanish, as considered by linguists to be a romantic language; that derived from Latin during the height of the Roman Empire, like French, Portuguese, Italian and Romanian. The term Latin America was first used\u2014in reference to the southern part of the Western Hemisphere\u2014by Napoleon III when he tried to outspread his empire to the Americas, in his futile attempt to suggest a cultural brotherhood between Spanish and Portuguese nations with France. Actually there is none, other than the origin of the languages. He placed Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian as Emperor of Mexico, (to his disgrace, as after Napoleon III abandoned him for lack of resources, the poor devil ended up being executed by President Juarez).

            "answer_text": "Yeah, pretty much universally. We were actually the first country that was refered to as Latin America. The term Latin America was imposed by the French during the Napoleonic Era. During that time, the French invaded Mexico and imposed a Austrian Emperor, called Maximilian von Habsburg (Maximiliano de Habsburgo in Spanish). The term was created to justify the French intervention to Mexico. After the French lost the Pastry War, the term prevailled and became accepted by most European and Latin American scholars. In Mexico it was pretty much fastly adopted (specially because many of the French soldiers that came stayed in Mexico), but other countries (like Brazil and Argentina) took a time to adopt that identity. Some countries like Haiti and Belize kinda still struggle with that term, since they identify more with the Caribbean and not that much with the Spanish and Portuguese speaking nations. The term Latin America isn\u2019t quite cultural, but rather a socio-linguistic term, specially because every country and region has its own culture. The culture from where i\u2019m from - Northern Mexico - is completely different to the culture from Patagonia - the southernmost tip of Chile and Argentina -. ",
