It contains a lot of filler material, so I skimmed the main points. This is how you read a lot of material in a short amount of time. For your convenience, I have boiled down that answer to its bare essence,* and added a few of my own insights. Scan the book to understand what it has to offer. To do so, read the description on the back cover or inside flap, and skim through to glance at any diagrams, and the names of sections.Set a reading goal. Determine what you want to, and can reasonably expect to get out of the book.Analyze the table of contents to make a prior guess about which chapters you will need to read. This may change as you learn more about the book\u2019s contents.Allocate time for each chapter based on how valuable or important it appears to be. This too may change as you read.Depending on how much time you give yourself to read a chapter, pursue it in the following order:The first and last paragraph of the introductionThe first and last paragraph of the conclusionSkim the titles of the sections, and decide which are worth readingRead the first and last paragraph of each section of interest.Read the rest of a section if it seems valuable.Stop every half hour or so to stand up, and either move around or stretch for about a minute. Get a drink of water.If you feel like your brain is full, grab a sheet of paper and summarize the high-level ideas you have read so far.I developed this skill over three years of reading academic articles in the field of computer science, which are characterized as one big idea, with enough context to understand it, and enough justification to merit publication. Typically, these papers are read by domain experts who know enough about the context and can get a sense that the justification is valid in a short amount of time, so you really just want to get the main idea, and may or may not find some of the context or justification useful to include in your own writing or investigations. This approach does not apply to fiction. If you\u2019re asking this question because you have to finish a book for your literature class tomorrow, consider dropping the course and trying again next semester. Then, pace your reading out over the entire amount of time between when you were assigned the reading and when you needed to have completed it. I can\u2019t say I ever did this myself, but I wish I would have. \u2014 * Don\u2019t worry, this is within the scope of Quora\u2019s policies. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHow can you finish a 200 page book in one day?\u201d Easy,Easy Here is the process of my marathon: I grab a book and start to reading.Since I\u2019m the kind of person who believes that the beginning of a book is determinant for the persistence of the reader,It can be easily involving or boring.Althought let\u2019s put the situation of a incredible good book.In this mean time, I will have my ass sit down on the chair,but this is not a rule.Over the reading my position and place can changed according to my comfort.We can not forget something to drink.I like to associate readings with rainy and cozy days,but unfortunately for me,I come from a very hot town.Yet, I almost always choose a coffee, just to create an atmosphere.Finally,but not least important,I happily forget about the world.Since I\u2019m always been an introvert,for me forget the world isn\u2019t though,is exactly the contrary, I create (or the author create for me?) a new world. In other words,books means refuge.What I\u2019m trying to say in a detailed way,is that read 200 pages is not difficult as you may think.We forget that a boring book of 20 pages can be harder than read one of 200.We're driven by stories,not numbers.Of course that a serie of factors will influence you,like if you already have the habit of reading or what kind of books are you up to( Read a young adult will not demand you the same effort as a Nietzsche,so obviously there's a difference of time that it will require). However,one thing is sure,when you\u2019re reading something obligated,even the best of the books can turn off the reader .So don\u2019t blame yourself if this is something for please others expectations. We're humans being,not machines!  ",
