            "answer_text": "I don't really understand what you mean by reversed, but this is a matter of perspective.  An antagonist would anyone who get's in the way or hinders the protagonist.  Therefore, anyone who hinders someone else is that person's antagonist.  A protagonist is the main character.  Assuming I understand your question correctly, your protagonist just needs to be the villian trying to do something evil and the antagonist would be the supposed hero trying to prevent that villany.
