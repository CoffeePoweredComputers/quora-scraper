            "answer_text": "I believe pretty much everyone is able to benefit from reading and listening to a book at the same time. I and the other millions of people dealing with ADHD have found this method both increases the ability to focus and helps recall details. That makes it great for any assigned reading task like boring college texts or classics with complicated vocabulary and old English. This combined method of reading and listening is also beneficial for students and individuals who are learning a language, as it builds fluency skills. This includes proper phrasing and expression. You are able to get a more complete understanding of a book, which makes it more entertaining and enjoyable. One interesting thing to note, however, is that audiobooks do not have much of an impact on children\u2019s language skills and word recognition when compared to being read to by a person in real life. It doesn\u2019t stimulate their brain in the same way. Overall, I definitely think it\u2019s worth it to read and listen to audiobooks at the same time. I would recommend to switch between reading/listening simultaneously, only listening, only reading, and reading aloud to yourself. Find which is the most challenging and the most rewarding and work on becoming better at both. Then you will reap the most benefits. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very common instructional strategy in K12 schools and is used to help beginning or struggling readers decode more quickly, more accurately and with more confidence. I strongly recommend it for these purposes. It\u2019s a trusted and true method. I also would recommend this to language learners (any level) for the same reasons. For language learners, this practice will also help build knowledge of sound-symbol correspondence and help those with superior speech fluency bring their reading skills up to the same level. For highly challenging works in the native language and for competent readers, this may help you get through the text with better comprehension and a greater appreciation of the stylistic features of the text, especially a work published pre-1900. Authors like Faulkner and Joyce and poetic works are probably ideal for this. Also, recorded books are broken into sections and being able to section off a work this way may help you get finished faster, with less frustration and stress. ",
