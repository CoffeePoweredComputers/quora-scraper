            "answer_text": "On a scale of 1\u201310 in demigod standards, he's a 10. On a scale of 1\u201310 in god standards, he's still a 10. Why? Well it's really no question when it comes to the MOST powerful demigod to have ever lived. If you don't think it's Percy, you're just kidding yourself. If you disagree, feel free to comment on this answer and we can debate ;) I believe I've already said this in a different post, but the reason Percy is so strong is probably not for the reason you might think. Sure Percy is the best swordfighter in 300 years, and he has a lot of cool and strong powers (including water manipulation, breathing underwater, creating hurricanes, etc), but what makes him so powerful is the fact that his emotional state dictates the intensity of his abilities. The biggest example is when Percy killed the minotaur the first time. The minotaur is actually a pretty high class monster in Greek mythology, and Percy Jackson was able to slay it barehanded, at age 12, and with no demigod training whatsoever. But the sole reason he was able to do it was because it had \u201ckilled\u201d his mother first. He was so angry that his powers kicked in involuntarily, and that's even true throughout the series. The first time he created his hurricane was when Hyperion threatened the safety of Annabeth and Grover. He entered and left the underworld (something very few heroes have ever done) just to save his mom. He slaughtered the arai to save Annabeth, regardless of the painful curses inflicted on him. And (my favorite) when he held Arachne (probably couple hundred pounds), Annabeth, and himself over Tartarus with one hand. ONE HAND. You see when Percy gets angry, he gets ANGRY. Even when he's chill he's a total savage, but if someone he loves is on the table, I wish you good luck. Alone, Percy could probably take out any one of the Olympians. If for some reason (I've said this before too) Olympus struck down Annabeth\u2026well they don't stand a chance. Elysium knows what Percy Jackson would do, but either way the gods would be no better off than the Lord of Time himself. ",

            "answer_text": " As a son of Poseidon, the god of the seas, earthquakes, and horses, Percy Jackson has tremendous potential. Many Percy Jackson fans fantasize about Percy being more powerful that Zeus or something like that. However, while Canon Percy is powerful, he does have his limits. Nevertheless, his power is taken seriously by both Gods and Demigods alike. Hephaestus \u201cNot that powerful, eh? Could have fooled me. You\u2019re the son of the Earthshaker, lad. You don\u2019t know your own strength.\u201d Grover Underwood \"It's just my luck. I'm the lamest satyr ever, and I find the two most powerful half-bloods of the century, Thalia and Percy.\" The Gods also view Percy as being too dangerous \u201c\u2026The next child of the Big Three who reaches sixteen will be a dangerous weapon.\u201d Dionysus \u201c\u2019This boy is still dangerous\u201d Athena \u201cAs we know from the Great Prophecy, children of the three elder gods\u2026 such as Thalia and Percy\u2026 are dangerous\u201d Kronos \u201cLuke feared you\u2026 Hazel \u201cBut she knew Nico was more dangerous than Reyna, or Octavian, or maybe even Jason. Then she\u2019d met Percy. At first, when she saw him stumbling up the highway with the old lady in his arms, Hazel had thought he might be a god in disguise. Even though he was beat up, dirty, and stooped with exhaustion, he\u2019d had an aura of power\u201d Reyna \u201cThe point is, Percy, you are the real power on this quest. You are a seasoned veteran. I\u2019ve seen what you can do. A son of Neptune wouldn\u2019t be my first choice, but if you return successfully from this mission, the legion might be saved. The praetorship will be yours for the taking. Together, you and I could expand the power of Rome. We could raise an army and find the Doors of Death, crush Gaea\u2019s forces once and for all. You would find me a very helpful\u2026friend.\u201d Hazel Percy had seemed so intimidating and powerful, like a real hero. Nico also had very high hopes of Percy surviving Tartarus. And this was after he mentioned how he and no other demigod stood a chance at surviving the Pit. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m the son of Hades, and even I barely survived. Gaea\u2019s forces overwhelmed me instantly. They\u2019re so powerful down there\u2026no demigod would stand a chance. I almost went insane.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to describe how powerful that place is. Once you get close, it sucks you in. I never stood a chance.\u201d But he says this about Percy. \u201cPercy is the most powerful demigod I\u2019ve ever met. No offense to you guys, but it\u2019s true. If anybody can survive, he will, especially if he\u2019s got Annabeth at his side. They\u2019re going to find a way through Tartarus.\u201d Leo Percy had been intimidating enough before \u2013 summoning hurricanes, duelling pirates, killing giants in the Colosseum \u2026 Now \u2026 well, after what happened in Tartarus, it seemed like Percy had graduated to a totally different level of butt-kickery. More than even the god Tartarus himself, Annabeth feared evil Percy. Since she\u2019d come back from Tartarus, Annabeth had told Piper a lot of scary things that had happened down there. At the top of her list: Percy controlling a tide of poison and suffocating the goddess Akhlys. This is very much in contrast to how Percy himself feels about his capabilities. They depended on him and relied on his powers. Even the Romans had raised him on a shield and made him praetor, and he\u2019d only known them for a couple of weeks. But Percy didn\u2019t feel powerful. The more heroic stuff he did, the more he realized how limited he was. He felt like a fraud. I\u2019m not as great as you think, he wanted to warn his friends. ",
