            "answer_text": "The answer is, of course yes. A Google search brought up dozens of offerings that were duplicates (an alarming number of them romance novels.) Publishers usually do a title check but I'm sure from time to time something slips through the cracks. The trick from an author's perspective is to have a title that is unique. Pretty unlikely to find another book named \"A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beginning\" however a book just titled \"The Bad Beginning\" is a lot more likely to be duplicated.    For an example do a search for the book \"Heart of Darkness,\" in addition to the Conrad classic there is another book from a series by Gena Showalter, and a graphic novel as well. ",
