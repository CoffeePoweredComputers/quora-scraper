            "answer_text": "It is a GREAT book. Offers social commentary relevant to today: alcohol, parties, sex, money, celebrity obsessed culture\u2026 sound familiar? It covers a fascinating time in history.Jam packed: Fitzgerald crams a well developed plot line and interesting characters combined with such a rich poetic writing style in a mere 47,094 words! That\u2019s nothing considering the first Harry Potter book contains 76,944. This gives the book a great pace and will keep you engaged until the last page is turn. Of course it also makes it a fast read and easy to re-read.Great characters: From the \u2018hulking\u2019 Tom Buchanan to the delicate Daisy, and of course the mysterious Gatsby, the book contains truly iconic characters.Plot twists: Clever and unpredictable changes in the plot although the book is highly enjoyable even without these.It\u2019s a classic: It has achieved such a timeless status that whether the book is \u2018good\u2019 or not it is still important to read due to it\u2019s huge impact and large readership.Potential drawbacks: \u2018Too short.\u2019Language is very dense.Characters are not likeable.May need to be read multiple times to grasp.Hope this helped. Cheers old sport!  Matthew ",
