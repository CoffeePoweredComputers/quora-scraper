            "answer_text": "I'm not really sure I believe that you can't learn from a book.  But let's set that aside for the moment. You can try videos.  Khan Academy, for example, has a ton of \"bite sized\" instructional videos.  (How do you know what videos to watch?  Maybe track the table of contents of a book.) You might also consider live, human interaction.  An obvious variation of this is to just take a class, assuming your college offers them at an appropriate level.  (Or even if you don't register for the class, consider just sitting in.)  A typical class at this level involves the professor introducing a concept and then working a bunch of examples.  So, presto... no need to read the book. If you don't feel like doing that, consider getting a tutor.  He or she will probably do the same thing, but perhaps in a more interactive/tailored environment. ",

            "answer_text": "you're not the only one in the world that really hate math. actually, we're same. i'm such 14 years old girl that loves learning by doing. people around me teached me about math, but i can't understand if i only sit down and wrote the math questions.so i think more than before and try to understand myself. why i can't be like others? and then, i start to grab the marker and write in the paper all of math formulas everywhere. yup, everywhere! my bedroom wall's full of that. so when i roll in my bed, i read that, when i go to sleep, when i'm boring i read that. and then i can memorize all of that. when i tried to asnwering math questions, at the first time i was confused. truly hard to understood. but i have a silly idea that everyone always underestimate again. i made a small book, i wrote everything on that! how come that answer be like that, why you should divided it, whatever that i can understand i write in that book. i bring that everywhere i go. i tried to do a same question with that, but woth different numbers. sounds not good, right? but i do all of that in my life. and i got a good mark with that hehehe. never stop trying and you should learn more about yourself. always learn, and you got the result beyound your imagination nor percentage \\U0001f60a keep trying! hope it helps!
