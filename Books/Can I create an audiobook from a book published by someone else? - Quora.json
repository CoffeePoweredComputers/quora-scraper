            "answer_text": "Yes, but only if you have obtained the audio rights to the work and negotiated a workable royalty compensation. Typically audio rights are included in the publishing agreement between an author and a publisher, so you\u2019ll need to talk to them about whether or not they are interested in having you develop the audio and see if you can negotiate an agreement on royalties (how much in advance, what the percentage and terms will be, etc.) There are potential other factors to negotiate as well such as approval of the recording talent, cover design, distribution, etc. If the author still retains the audio rights, you'll need to do the same thing with them instead of the publisher. The single exception, where you don\u2019t need to obtain rights, is if the work is already in the public domain. If that is the route you wish to go, you will need to learn more about what is or isn\u2019t in the public domain. Best of luck on your pursuit of audiobook material! ",

            "answer_text": "Only if a) the book is in the public domain or b) you have the audio publishing rights to the book. Audio publishing follows the same rules as print publishing or making movies from books. The author owns the rights unless the author enters into a contract with whoever prints the book, records the audiobook, or makes the movies. No matter who publishes the print version, if the book is still covered by copyright and you don't have a contract with the author, you're in violation of copyright law and the author is within his or her rights to sue you about it. If they already have audio rights contracted to a publishing house, the publishing house sues you instead. Either way, you're facing a lawsuit.  ",

This is because the original is copyrighted and (under that general head) it will have foreign-language rights, audio rights, movie rights, and similar other intellectual property rights. To produce an audiobook, this effectively means getting an IPR (intellectual-property right) licensing agreement with the copyright owner. If you produce an audiobook without permission, you will be in breach of copyright and liable under criminal and civil law. ",
