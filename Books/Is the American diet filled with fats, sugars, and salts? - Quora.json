            "answer_text": "Is the American diet filled with fats, sugars, and salts? Fats are a necessary nutrient, full of energy, and are carriers of many necessary fat-soluble vitamins. Sugars are not a necessary nutrient, but they are a common good source of energy. Sugars also handily come in the form of starches, which are even more common than sugars, and have historically made up the bulk of our necessary calorie intake. Salt is a necessary nutrient, and sodium ions are crucial for maintaining proper nerve and cell function. Since we excrete salt in our sweat and urine, it is important that we replenish it on a regular basis. Because of the importance of fats, sugars, and salt to our health, we have evolved to be able to taste fats, sugars and salts generally as good things, pleasing to eat (as opposed to many harmful compounds which tend to taste bitter, or acids which taste sour). If we find a plant or other food source that tastes fatty, or sweet, or salty, it will provide the necessary nutrients and energy we can get from those foods. Given how important fats, sugars, and salts are to life, it should be completely unsurprising that traditional diets world-wide are filled with fats, sugars, and salts. Take sushi, for instance. It\u2019s a sweetened, vinegared rice (sugar, starches) served with fatty seafood, with a side of soy sauce (very salty). You can find similar examples all over the world. The problem \u2014 and what leads to the source of questions like this \u2014 is that historically fats, sugars, and salts were expensive. They were vitally important, but hard to get. We needed to eat as much fat as we could, because it wasn\u2019t overall a large part of our food. We needed to eat as much sugar and starch as we could, because food was hard to get in large quantities. Starvation was a major concern, and fats and sugars (and starches) would help prevent that. Still, lots of people starved. Today, especially in America, starvation isn\u2019t a major concern. Instead, it\u2019s over-eating. Food is so abundant, food is so cheap, that it is easy to get too much of fats, sugars, and salts. So much so that it overloads our bodies which have evolved to be very efficient with the foods we eat, storing (as fat) energy during times of abundance to use in times of scarcity. But scarcity never comes, and the stored energy never gets used. The balance of body functions gets thrown off from this excess. ",
