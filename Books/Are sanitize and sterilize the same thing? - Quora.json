To sterilize (in your question\u2019s context) is to eliminate all life and render non-living biopathogens (virii, and prions if we\u2019re lucky) \u201cbiologically inert\u201d. Full stop. To sanitize is to ensure for the moment that unwanted living pathogens are subdued to the point that they\u2019re unlikely to be any problem at all until long after we need them out of the way. We sanitize when cleaning home beer-brewing equipment, and we *sterilize* when we safely can meat, shellfish, or mushrooms to be stored. Otherwise, we risk our lives just eating and drinking. ",
