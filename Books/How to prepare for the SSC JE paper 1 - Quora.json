            "answer_text": "Paper 1of SSCJE includes General Intelligence and Reasoning (50 Marks), General Awareness (50 Marks) and Technical Knowledge (100 Marks). General Intelligence and Reasoning can be prepared by developing a method of solving questions from relevant topics, like number series, alphabetical series, direction, age problem and many more. General Awareness it depends on student to student. As some students would like to prepare it by solving previous year question or some by solving SSC CGL previous year. Some study the entire history, geography, science, and others. But, the best way is to prepare a module by referring previous year papers which will guide you that what you need to study and omit. We recommend you to solve at least 25 questions a day since it wouldn\u2019t be taking more than 15 minutes. Once, you develop a habit of it then this section, where everyone loses marks you can get an opportunity to create a difference. Technical knowledge you need to have a strategy like to get hold of major subjects first then minor ones. Major subjects are those whose weight age is more than others. The best way is to prepare one major and one minor for 15 days so that you don\u2019t get stuck up with one subject. The amount of time devoted to a particular subject should be directly proportional to the marks you can obtain from that subject. Like, in civil engineering we have soil mechanics as a major, whereas transportation as minor, so I will not give the same time to both subjects. If I am giving one week or two weeks for soil mechanics then I will not spend more than two days in transportation. We, hope that you have understood what we meant. The most important thing is to train your mind to give more exams, especially more mock test. This will create a lot of difference between you and others. If you have any more queries feel free to ask. Thank You Ifeehub Team [1] #ifeehub Footnotes[1] ifeehub",

            "answer_text": "In this pandemic, online classes have become important and new normal. ACE has started online live classes for SSC - JE paper 1 ( General studies) from 1st August '2020, The classes are very lively, interesting and efficient. Without diluting their content and experience qualitatively and quantitatively they are providing classes for aspirants and it is definitely worth trying. It is easy to score in the General Reasoning section of SSC JE exam. For General Awareness, you need to be consistently learning things. In other words, you should dedicate a few hours for this section in your daily study plan. You cannot think of doing this section just a few days before the exam. The general awareness section syllabus contains so many sections with weightage as follows :  Recently I have watched some information of SSC JE (paper 1 ) general studies on ACE website about their newly launched SSC - JE Paper 1 online live classes. I found their demo classes good and as per my research their faculties are highly appreciated by aspirants (selected and currently preparing). I also watched some of their free classes on YouTube which they provided during covid- 19 lockdown period. Besides faculty, what attracts me was their approach and competitiveness. Their study materials and courses are good in both depth and coverage. Along with classes they are also providing free online test series. The course is very comprehensive and fees also affordable. So I would recommend ACE SSC - JE (Paper 1 ) online live classes for every serious aspirants who use their time and money judiciously. ",
