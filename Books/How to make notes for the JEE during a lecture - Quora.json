If not, then either join Unacademy or any other website or by YouTube and start to note down that point which was taught. And most importantly If u r studying chemistry, inorganic highlight the most important point.. (Dnt highlight the whole book) U can choose book of ur choice and if u have confusion then u can ask me either message me or comment down\u2026 btw ncert for inorganic is must\u2026.
