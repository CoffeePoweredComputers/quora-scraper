            "answer_text": "If you want the most economical option, it\u2019s to buy a flat. Buying land is easy, getting to put a house up and get plans approved PLUS building could/would take you at least 12 months (unless you are a building contractor). There are many obstacles to getting permits, getting architecture plans for the actual building approved. PLUS ordering the supplies necessary to build the house. PLUS there are always setbacks to deal with. I know all this because my husband and I bought a house and we had to gut it because it did not meet code standards and the house was so poorly built that it wasn\u2019t safe. We were able to get the entire project done in just under 12 months.  During part of that time, we sold our rental properties to pay for this house and the building project. We sold our house and moved into a rental so that we had someplace to live and stored our possessions and furniture. We had a contractor who had everything on a schedule and when he presented a problem or said we needed to buy certain things, we did it within 24 hours (the purchasing) and got the shipments as soon as they could be delivered\u2014 usually in less than a week if it wasn\u2019t custom material. If you aren\u2019t living close to where your building would be going up, realize that the travel back and forth will drive you crazy eventually. Whether you buy a flat or you build a house, I hope you find (or build) something you love. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the proper answer for this question would be a personal choice, but I can list some pro's and con's according to me which come right on top of my head, based on which you can decide, what is better for you :-  Buying a flat is quicker way to own a house and move-in while other one takes sufficient time.Lesser documentation verification needed for a flat compared to the other one.With a flat, in apartment, you get a community, security, other amenities etc which you don't get in other one.If you buy a land and build a house, you will be having a \"property\" made for your coming generations, son, grandson etc but with the apartment, it has got max lifetime of 25 to 30 years!You can construct & design your own house in whatever way you feel like while if you buy an apartment, you have to stick to the design what builders provide.And finally, last but not least, I feel, buying apartment flat is cheaper than buying land and building a house.So these are right on top of my head, but there are several other such pro's and con's with each approach. Finally it boils down to personal choice. If you ask my choice, i would prefer going with buying a piece of land and building my own house. ",
