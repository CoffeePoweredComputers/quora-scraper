            "answer_text": "You can download the Wattpad app on your phone or tablet and then read all books on it. They generally do not give you the option of downloading the books. This is done to avoid plagiarism or content from getting copied by others. However, if you wish to read e-books, you can download them from a the internet. There are many websites that offer you the option of downloading books for free onto your device and read them as per your convenience. That being said, I find reading online or on a device really stressful as well as inconvenient. It can cause severe eye damage and body pain. You are also prone to get headaches if you resort to too much screen time. Hence, I would suggest you to read more of physical books. If you want to get physical copies of books completely free of cost, you can visit a site called MyPustak. They offer books on a wide variety of genres including Fiction, Non-Fiction, Motivational, Academic, Self Help, etc. They deliver the books at your doorstep within a span of 4 to 7 days. All you are required to pay is a minimal shipping fee.  ",

            "answer_text": "No, you can\u2019t. What happens is that some authors publish on Kindle or other ebooks platforms. Some of them make available for free download, called perma-free ebooks. Sometimes, it's a way to offer the readers what they can expect from other stories written by the author. Some stories can be read offline on Wattpad, so downloading could be a problem for writers. You never know when someone is going to plagiarize your stories. ",
