The CISSP certifications standouts amongst the most looked for after and superb certifications in the field of the information security industry. Nearly everything that you caught wind of the CISSP exam is true. The CISSP Exam is hard, terrifying and resources concentrated. In any case, it is difficult, but not impossible to pass. Below given, are some tips that could tell you about how long to study for the CISSP exam so as to pass it on the very first attempt. 1. Learn to fluently speaking CISSP language Try not to be pompous about your knowledge into the field of Information security and the CISSP domains. You may think you understand a great deal about security; but however, you are most likely to be in a misconception, that you don't yet see every one of the kinds of questions that you are going to experience on the exam. In this way, I would strongly recommend that you begin your preparation procedure by experiencing every domain in the examination guides so as to ensure that you understand the language of the exam, the substance of the questions and the ideas CISSP would be aiming to teach. This approach will help you to stick the data in your brain. 2. Make the utilization of numerous sources of examination: You should have the experience of a few CISSP across the board study guides. It is best, to begin with, an authority of the CISSP study guide. These guides would be covering all the material in every domain. Also, you should practice the CISSP practice tests available online as there are a lot of test tests that you can do, so do training exams once in a while. 3. Wisely estimation and distribution of your time: Well for me it took around two months to prepare. I reviewed the CISSP books consistently a few hours per day. On weekdays, whenever I have time at night, I would use it to test exams available on the internet, repeatedly until the point that I could a minimum score of than a 70% . Concerning the part your time, a sensible approach would be to invest half of your energy checking on thinking about aides and a half taking practice tests. In case that you can work with group discussions, I would recommend you spend your time 40% on guides, 40% on tests and 20% on group discussions. 4. Relax and Have a Good Night Sleep before the exam This 6-hour examination, which consists of 250-question is atrocious. I cleared out the exam being exhausted and crushed and having no idea whether I have passed or not. So Relaxing and having a good night sleep would be my prime advice for each and every candidate, as you are going to require a lot of energy for the commencement of this exam. 5. Make and use some good and reliable strategies A good and reliable strategy is the key to achieve success in this Exam. I opted for a basic strategy that was to clear the question which I know firstly and then go for the one of which I was only partially sure and later on to take that one\u2019s which are totally out of my mind.

            "answer_text": "Mine was a long journey. Longer than it should have been\u2026 When the smoke cleared\u2026. I watched many video series\u2019. CBT Nuggets, Pearson Vue, and I even watched a bootcamp video that was 30 hours of the most boring thing I could imagine :) I read - the book I recommend the most is the Sybex 7th edition one. That\u2019s put out by ISC2, so, they have the material covered. I read a few Shon Harris things - truth be told, I thought she was great, but after she died, they changed the Domains - which I think she had designed. She did a few audio lectures - I listened to them when I drove. Cybrary. Kelley Handerhan does a great course Then, I took a BootCamp that my company paid for. I took it just to assure myself that I was prepared. I got that impression in the class - I was way above many of the others. After the class, I read the Sybex book AGAIN cover to cover. I literally finished it the morning of the test. Went in EXTREMELY confident after that\u2026.. ",
