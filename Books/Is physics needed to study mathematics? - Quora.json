            "answer_text": "Yes , modern mathematics does require ideas from physics. Its amazing to note the backward flow of information from physics to mathematics. It has been a tradition that math is required to understand natural sciences deeply. Recently some long standing mathematical problems have been solved using ideas from quantum field theory, gauge theory and string theory. Interactions between pure mathematicians and theoretical physicists have been intensified through string theory. String theory seem to have some deep connections with algebraic geometry. Mirror symmetry, roughly which is a bridge between rigid world of complex manifolds and flexible world of symplectic manifolds , was born (accidently) in the research of string theorists and this caught the attention of the mathematicians because geometers have been studying those geometries for many decades and thought they live in completely different mathematical \u201ccountries\u201d (so to speak). Problems in enumerative algebraic geometry have been solved using this symmetry. Ideas from quantum field theory turns out to be useful in math. For example, Chern simons gauge theory was used to study knot invariants in knot theory. Topological quantum field theories has been being studied as source of 3-manifold invariants. Ed Witten, the only physicist to win the fields medal, made significant progress in importing ideas from quantum field theory to pure mathematics. Witten used feynman\u2019s path integral approach to compute the intersection number of moduli spaces. Intersection theory of moduli space of riemann surfaces are now being studied by string theorists and their results turns out to be useful to mathematicians. Maxim Kontsevich solved the Witten conjecture(in algebraic geometry) that was conjectured in a study of two dimensional quantum gravity theories. It turned out that quantum field theory can be used as a tool for studying geometric structures and topology of manifolds. There are many more examples. In summary, to study modern pure mathematics, you need to know some pretty advanced stuffs from theoretical physics , knowing some classical mechanics is not enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Mathematics is the language that Physics uses to express its thoughts. It would be like someone who wants to be a Poet but does want to take English courses. As an illustration. Scientist had discover that most phenomena in the Universe follow a specific schedule, ( Law ) Scientists can tell when a Comet is coming back. But there were other phenomena that appeared at random. There were surprised because the Universe is very organized. Finally Scienties discovers that those \" disorganized phenomena \" were very well organize, but they did not have the vocabulary ( Math ) to describe them. With the development of Fractals the problem was solved. ",
