            "answer_text": "Firstly i would ask you to believe in yourself and think about scoring 97 or 98 because 12th abhi dilli dur hain. Your 12th marks will be based on your studies which you did in 12th. If you study in 11th and not in 12th you won't score your dream number. Here i would tell you that keep telling your brain about that number and your picture in the school\u2019s website saying your name and the topper 2022 title. Make your goal specific, even if you stop studying till the exams are near still you will stick to the same number you imagined about 2 years back(i.e. the present) for ex. 98% overall. So now in 11th what you'll do is make sittings of 3hrs daily, it doesn't matter that 11th and 12th syllabus don't coincide but you have to make a muscle memory of sitting more than 3\u20138 hours a day which you can use in class 12 last days. I'm not asking you to study 8hrs daily in class 11th or even 12th. Those 8 hours are for the Last 3 months before class 12 board exam. Currently you can daily study 3hrs and can easily top in the class11th, this will help your brain think that 98% goal for 12th is easy. The main basic secret formula is revision. Revise everything 10\u201320 times if you want to score that 98% if your satisfied with 90% then you don't need to revise that many times. 3\u20135 times revision is sufficient for scoring 90% Dont be that guy who thinks he can pull off 90% in the last month. Sadly i was that guy who spent whole 2 years studying business books, money related books stockmarket etc. (being from science stream). I started studying exactly 29 days before the boards started and was able to score 82% ;) And i blame myself because Even then i was not consistent. I skipped 2days-3days in between, also i struggled to sit for 8 hours a day bcoz ever in my life i haven't done that. That's the reason i want you to sometimes sit for 8hrs a day and study in class11 itself so that at the end your body don't have to struggle adjust. And it is damn easy brother, to score 98% even when you chill for these years but you don't have to take any chance. Every month you waste, the ratio of risk and probability will increase slowly. Chillax and at the end practice question papers. That's it. About me, i hadn't score 70% since last 3 years. In 11th and 12th i failed in many subs but at the end youtube helped me and i scored 82% smartly. I would have easily hit 90% but due to constanty masturbating everyday for 4\u20139 times made me slow in the end game. Never do this before your exams,you'll lose a lot of energy. Also use the whatsaap status feature, and write that you'll score (__) % in 12th, make it specific I'm telling again. And take its screen shot. Dont post it, use that screen shot as your wallpaper but change it before your go meet your friends everything and vice versa. Bcoz they'll make fun of it. Play with your subconscious. This was the psychological approach which is more important than the practical. For exactly what to study and when to Study, ask your teachers and ask yourself. Study hard topics/boring topics when fresh and easy topic when you're low on energy. Hope it made you clear about how to think. ",

            "answer_text": "You should start studying regularly and revise all the topics . For books i would say , follow the book which you yourself find good , mean to say that the book whose language is easily understood by you. I would say that exams are of easy to medium level , so no need to worry , just study whatever your teacher say. All the best. ",
