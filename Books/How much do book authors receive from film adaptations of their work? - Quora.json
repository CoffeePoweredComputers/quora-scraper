            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a snapshot of how books, magazine articles, short stories, and unpublished works are made into a motion picture or TV deal, along with payment ranges (From Book to Screen \u2013 How Dramatic Rights Are Sold). You can read the full article on our Sidebar Saturdays blog which publishes a post every Saturday to help writers with questions about publishing law. Typically there is an option fee, option renewal fee, and then a purchase price should the producer want to secure the story rights. An option starts around $500, with $50,000 being on the high-end. A good gauge is 10% of the purchase price. The fees for renewals tend to be higher than the first option. As for the purchase price: The purchase price will vary considerable depending on the project. Usually it will be based on a percentage of the film\u2019s budget with a cap.A good gauge is 2-4% of the production budget. If the budget grows, the producers have the insurance policy of the cap. So if the budget is $5 million, then the purchase price might be $150,000 for a 3% of budget price with a cap of $225,000 (or what ever number is negotiated for the cap) should the budget grow.The fee for films will be larger than television, which range between $25,000-$50,000. If the project becomes a series, payment is per episode (lucky you).The option fee is usually applied to the purchase price. The renewal fees, however, are usually not.",

            "answer_text": "It depends on different factors, from the book, to whom is the book about. A book about a famous figure or star is valuable not for the value of the writer, but by the value of the subject that is portrayed in the book. It doesn\u2019t matter how many books it has sold, because usually when the big publishing companies see the potential of the book usually they don\u2019t make an effort for the distribution and wait for the moment the movie is sold. As for Hispanic telenovelas. Delia Fiallo\u2019s less valued script for a telenovela was sold in 2018 for $1.5 million dollars. And \u201cEl Capo\u201d, by Gustavo Bolivar, represented to the writer close to $3 million dollars. ",
