            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cIs \"The interpretation of dreams\" by Freud still worth reading?\u201d Yes, and you will probably be surprised by its contents, unless you know what to expect. This is not a \u2018dream interpretation book\u2019 such as you find all over the place. It comes from a very different angle - that of a natural scientist - and includes the most personal of Freud\u2019s own dream material which he uses as observational data, since I think I am right in saying, that this volume was \u2018inspired\u2019 (if that is the right word) by his own attempts at self-analysis following the death of his father. This is a truly seminal work in the history of psychology and Psychoanalysis, if nothing else. It is where he begins to elaborate the nature and mechanisms of the System Unconscious, and its relation to conscious awareness, analysing how dreams may be constructed, and indicating how we might begin to think about interpreting their elements, rather than simply declaring what they do mean (unlikely without analysis as he shows). And it is very readable. Freud was a great writer, and this volume does not contain so much difficult stuff*, but is a much more immediate communication \u2018from the front\u2019, where he was working. [* This tends to belong to the more problematic task of conveying non verbal or pre verbal mental life]. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on why you want to read it. \"Freud for fun\" is not a thing, so I'm guessing you actually want to get something out of reading the Interpretation of Dreams. It isn't worth reading as a Psychological book any more, no -- unless you are a student of Psychoanalysis of the Lacanian School. Then it might be of some (limited) use to you. As a foundational text in the History of Psychology, however, it remains quite important. It also remains important for understanding much of the Literature, academic or not, of a certain time -- namely up to around the 1960s. The Intelligentsia of these days had generally read Freud and used references to his work liberally. To use an example of my own field of study: Talcott Parsons, an important Sociologist up to the 1970s lists Freud as one of the principal sources he draws from for his theories. As does Norbert Elias. Max Weber also was familiar with Freud. He really was an academic pop star. I have expounded things further in the comments. ",
