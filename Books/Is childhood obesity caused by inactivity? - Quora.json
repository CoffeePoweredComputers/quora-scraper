            "answer_text": "Obesity begins with overfeeding from infancy, it creates fat cells, those fat cells stay for life, according to Dr. Rand they don\u2019t multiply they expand. It also expands the infants stomach allowing for more food intake. Inactivity suggests a slow metabolism, the child would be unenergetic lazing around, eating, not getting outside exercise and expanding his fat cells. I know an obese young lady weighing in at the 400 lb. mark, I watched her grow-up from the age of 3 she was an obese 3 year old. I mentioned to her mother she overfed her kid from infancy, she didn\u2019t disagree. Young mothers mean well for their children, they just don\u2019t know over-bottle feeding will result in obesity. Thank you Joshua, good day to you. Donna Thompson ",
