            "answer_text": "I love reading, but it takes a lot for me to truly want to read a book. It's hard for me to pick up a book and just start reading. Sometimes I get lucky and when I pick up a book, I automatically feel connected to it. when I do start reading, it just fills me with a feeling that I can't explain, but I'll do my best to. When I'm reading a great book, it feels like I\u2019m actually there. Yes, this is something everyone else says, but it\u2019s true. When I'm reading an amazing book, I feel I am the protagonist. One book that made me feel this was Metro 2033. There were many times in the book where it felt I was making the choices. I had to choose what to do. Of course, I had no real power, but it felt like I did. When the main character was conflicted, I was conflicted. When he was scared, I was scared. It just makes me feel so immersed. The way the world is described also has something to do with how good the book is. Again, Metro 2033 does this so well. Often the book would take a detour from the main plot and focus on describing how dirty the walls were, how the pillars in the station were a different size, stuff that made every station and every location unique. The ending plays a huge role in how I feel after reading a book. If I love a book and it has a shit ending, I'm going to love that book less. Obvious, right? There are endings that just feel generic or uncreative, like waking up from a dream or having the main character die. I just don't like endings that make me feel \u201c\"oh yeah that just happened\u201d. My favourite endings are the endings that make me think \u201c\"what the fuck\u201d or \u201chow does it continue\u201d (not as in the \u201cwhat happens in the sequel?\u201d I mean how does the world continue in the universe of the book.) I love books that keep me awake at night after finishing it, wondering what actually just happened. I love books that leave the ending as something to think about, not just as something to wrap up a book. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: How does it feel, when you start reading books? In my mind, the most difficult part of reading any literature is when I am beginning to read it. Firstly, I have to actively decide on which piece of literature to read. This is very tricky for me because 1) I love to read virtually all forms of literature and 2) I have to decide on what time period or difficulty I want my literature to be. As such, I will end up sifting through whatever books I have yet to read and will end up having to choose one to read based on my particular interest at a certain time as well as whether I am seeking \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018light\u2019 literature. Typically, I aim for a blend of the two and end up reading a \u2018hard\u2019 book alongside a \u2018light\u2019 one. The \u2018light\u2019 one also tends to be fiction while the \u2018hard\u2019 one tends to be nonfiction, particularly philosophy. Regardless, even after choosing which books to read, getting used to the writing style can be a hassle. This is especially more difficult if I have yet to read the author. For example, I just finished Red Dragon by Thomas Harris yesterday, but I found beginning the book the be incredibly difficult. For starters, I found that the way the book began was very strange for me because it introduced two of the main protagonists out of nowhere with very little detail on who they were or their appearances. I had to read further to learn more about them. Also, it was full of technical police language as well as details of grizzly murders that had occurred at a prior time in the novel that I had little context for since I just began the book. Likewise, when I am reading a nonfiction book, particularly a piece of philosophical literature, I find that I need an incredible amount of background information on the author and his/her main philosophical avocations before I can begin to delve into the work. I find that taking notes in this area is incredibly helpful. In the case of \u2018hard\u2019 philosophical treatises and literature, I find it can take me some time before I get into a sort of \u2018focus\u2019 mentality and can actually focus my mind on reading through and understanding the material. Furthermore, some \u2018hard\u2019 writers have a particular way of writing unique to them that, like my issue with Harris, can be difficult to grasp. So, to end this off, how do I feel when I begin a book? I feel like I am taking upon a new burden. Adding another pound of stress to my already aching, tired mental shoulders. I feel as though I am beginning a mental workout that itself will be incredibly beneficial to my mental health and, like competing in sports, enjoyable for my mind. And, like ending a workout or a competition, I feel immensely complete upon finishing a piece of literature. For me, beginning a new book is incredibly difficult to do, but it is worth it for the juicy material inside that stimulates the mind. ",
