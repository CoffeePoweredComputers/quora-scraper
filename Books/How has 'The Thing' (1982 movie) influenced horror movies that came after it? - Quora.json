            "answer_text": "John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" is definitely in my top 5 favourite movies. It is a brilliant movie, that was a lot more faithful to the short story than the Howard Hawks 1951 movie (which I also love). It's hard to say how it influenced horror movies though. The two most important aspects of the movie in my opinion are the amazing practical special effects and the extreme paranoid situation, that is, a smallish group of people stuck-in-one-place with one or more enemies among them.  There are many other elements that really stand out too. Carpenter's simple brooding score is also a huge part of building the atmosphere and the ambiguous ending helps make it a classic. None of these aspects by themselves are particularly original, but they were all so well done and work so well together that the whole really does become more than the sum of its parts. I think that's its main legacy; a really solid, all round, well made horror classic. ",
