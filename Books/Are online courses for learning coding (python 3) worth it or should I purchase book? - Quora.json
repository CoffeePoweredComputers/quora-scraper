However, some of them are free and some are not. Here are some of my recommendations. Intro to python programming by SentDex Python 3 Basics Tutorial Series - YouTubePython Programming by Jose Portilia (this is a paid course on Udemy. The great part about it is that it has short exercises after every lesson in order to enhance your understanding of the topic. However, it can only do so much to make you understand the material better. A practical application of the knowledge you have (say a game or an app) would be way better than wasting time and money on fundamentals which will get cleared anyways down the road.)Making a game using python programming (make sure you do this after you've understood the fundamentals) PyGame with Python 3 Game Development - YouTubeIntermediate level python programming Intermediate Python Programming - YouTube again by SentDex.If you hate online courses and desperately want to read a book, then you should buy the one written by the creator of python. Its price is continually fluctuating so I don't want to give any link. ",
