            "answer_text": "If dragons from this franchise were/are real, they could most likely live in jungles, swamps, mountains, forests, and shorelines, depending on a species of dragons. For oceans, whales and other sea animals would probably have to reproduce faster to keep up with the competing sea-dwelling dragons. On land, wild dogs (including wolves), bears, cats, deer, antelopes, hippos, rhinos, elephants, and all other land animals would do the same as marine animals to keep up with dragons, but could also be slightly smarter so they could learn to avoid dragons of all kinds and to reduce the chance of these animals being killed by dragons. Humans, however, would have to build flame-resistant buildings and other structures as protection against fire (including ones from dragons). Despite this, humans could possibly tame and (unlikely but possibly) domesticate some of these dragon species. ",
