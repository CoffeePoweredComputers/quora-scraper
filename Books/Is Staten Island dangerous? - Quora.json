            "answer_text": "Crime in Staten Island is lower than any of the other 4 boros( I have not google for a guarantee answer, so this is just my opinion). Depending on the neighborhood, crime would be very low, like in wealthier areas what you find is there is home robberies and even home invasions but this thing does not happen every day nor every week. In places that I and many call the projects, you have less of educated people, poor people that have been abandoned, yes they were given an affordable apartment but their kids needed a dad and needed a mom to stay home and the kids to be educated. The government forgot the road in which children become criminals. Those moms should have gotten help to stay home, not to work and leave the kids alone. So the kids came home to roost and in those neighborhoods in which you have poor kids (black, white, hispanics, Italians, Irish). The white ones got involved in the business of drugs and the black ones got into gangs, robberies and with what the gangs do and the same for Hispanics. I am quoting this in general terms as per my own experience in living here for the time being. Im answering this question because it was asked of me. Actually my family moved to Staten Island from the Lower East Side because of crime. I was been beaten up by a gang of 8 or so teenager and adult men and kids. Many lived in my mom\u2019s building. She was asked to move by management because I was beaten when I was visiting her but I asked her not to fight it (she could since no body else got asked to leave, but the half father of some of the kids worked in\u2026The management office). I told mom if she did not move I will not visit again\u2026That did it. I felt awful about my mom loosing an apartment she waited for years to get and liked. I was afraid of what might happen since they kept getting threads from those guys, even though I had some arrested that meant nothing. But I helped mom moved out of there and in Staten Island she was able to get eventually a better apartment she had in Lower Manhattan. Eventually when the kids moved out I moved in with my mom. This worked so well being out and having my mom leaving as a roommate and meeting my friends and eventually my long term partner. She had a great time leaving with me and me having her. By the way we both worked in Manhattan. WE stayed there until my company moved me out of NYC and Where ever I went I took her with me. She always had a bedroom and I made sure my company moved her and me in 3 o4 moves I made. Meanwhile she spent a year with me and a year with the other family. She got to see a lot. I brought her back to Staten Island to be closer to the family when she got elderly and sickly. She died while living here at Bellevue Hospital. She was buried as the wife of a veteran(dad) in a National cemetery> I thought that was so becoming for her and appreciated the way the some parts of the vets law works well. Wish it will work that way when they are still alive. My dad died at the veterans Hospital in San Juan years before Mom. I think I got carried away\u2026\u2026\u2026..Thank You\u2026.Adam (Https://adamfoxie.blogspot.com) ",

            "answer_text": "Depends how you mean. It can be dangerous in terms of walking or bicycling (or driving) on certain roads, as many Staten Island motorists are super-aggressive, impatient drivers and would sooner run you over than yield the right-of-way. Staten Island might be a more dangerous place to live in terms of having an elevated risk of cancer as well: Cancer rates on Staten Island highest of any borough, data shows CANCER CLUSTERS: STATEN ISLAND - MetroFocus Some of it may be due to environmental reasons and some of it may be due to the behavior of those who get cancer (e.g., higher smoking rates, etc.). In terms of the likelihood of being a victim of violent crime, most of Staten Island is relatively safe, although some neighborhoods (e.g., Mariners Harbor, the Park Hill neighborhood of Clifton) have a reputation of being more dangerous than others. How bad is Mariners Harbor Staten Island? Exiled to a War Zone, for His Safety I\u2019ve lived most of my life on Staten Island and spent time in these places without incident, though. (I ride my bike through Park Hill all the time). ",
