            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a popular question, it\u2019s also one that I feel can have a number of answers. After all we\u2019re living different lives with different focuses and pressures. Imagine for a moment\u2026. How would you find the dream offer? Some may see the advertisement in the paper.Some may just happen to drive past the business and see the placard advertising it.Some may spend time searching all the shops before finding it.While a few tune in and hear the ad on the radio.And then of course there\u2019s that person who finds the package on their doorstep with a note saying, \u2018I thought you needed this.\u2019In a way, I think I got the last option. I had spent my life up to that point dealing with life in the best way I could. Life\u2019s purpose wasn\u2019t on my mind. Paying the mortgage, looking after my hardworking husband and teenage son, and caring for my semi disabled alcoholic mother were my main concerns. Without exaggeration, life was a struggle. But it was to get worse. Our son in intensive care with a head injury; our home being repossessed by the mortgage people. It shook my very ground. Suddenly I was living hour by hour, day by day. I had been taking my mother to a weekly spiritual healing clinic, and they offered me healing. It was a wonderful gift, that helped me to deal with the day. With the gift, came a feeling that I needed to give back, and I trained to be a healer. Without realising I had stepped on to my own pathway of purpose. Little by little our lives settled. Our son slowly recovered, and our mortgage lender rearranged our payments. I was guided that I must help in the world. That led to founding and running a charity for homeless and victims of domestic abuse in the UK, and twice a year taking aid to Croatia and Serbia after the Balkans War. It expanded my work to become both a healer and channeller. That increased to helping people with past life issues, organising life changing courses in the UK, Norway, Sweden, and the USA, publishing 3 sets of oracle cards worldwide, and setting up an international prayer group, which now has 54 members. My work continues to move on, and 24 years have passed since I was given the gift that began this journey. God had knocked on my door before, but I wasn\u2019t ready to recognise and commit myself to a journey of development. But I got there in the end, and for those who are afraid they may miss the opportunity, just relax and know that there\u2019s more than one way to achieve that dream offer. Basically,\u2026.. Allow yourself space in order to recognise what you \u2018need\u2019 to do. Find quiet moments. Recognise the disconnected thoughts that come and nag you while you\u2019re driving, or washing up, or showering. Let them inspire you.Don\u2019t expect your brain\u2019s logic to unfold your life purpose. Don\u2019t pressure yourself into discovering your purpose within the next half hour, or day, or week. The more you pressure, the more you block yourself.Instead, relax and get to recognise your senses. You used to sense far more until science and technology taught you to use your brain.You already know how to hear, taste, smell and see. Start to be aware of the instinctive guidance that your soul is sending you. Make a note of those feelings, or the random thoughts that fly into your head. Look for the inspiration to flow, and then act on these positive messages.Don\u2019t ask yourself \u2018why\u2019 you need to do this, instead ask yourself \u2018how\u2019 you\u2019re going to go about it.Somewhere you must find a passion to help in the world. Don\u2019t let it intimidate you. There\u2019s lots to do, and it\u2019s part of your development programme.For me it\u2019s been an adventure, and I\u2019m still on it. I know you can\u2019find the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Discover it by disguarding your identifications. Be an open space, allow the flow of life to go through you without disturbing it, without calling it this or that, by simply noticing it and allowing life to show you. Your purpose is to be. From being you are filled with life, from that life flow you realise what you are, simply a vessel. You are simply a vessel for life to flow through. It is conscious, blissfully alive, and has your greatest path. It will take you on a ride and you will see. Miracles become a moment to moment experience. And often it is unfathomable to what it will take you through, it liberates, it dissolves, it cleans, it flows. Its simple but takes some unlearning. You have to unlearn what you have been taught. You are not this or that. If you decide you are this, then you cut youself off from that. Dont be either. Dont be anything, as soon as you are something, you cut yourself off from all other things. Be open. Be free. Be open, be available, be kind, be the light and the life for those in your presence. Serve. Be of service to the life. And life flows through all. When life comes to you, wants you, needs you. Give. Simply give what you can. It may be a hand. It may be a lift. It may be a feather. You will know in the moment. Life always presnts you with an oppotunity to give. Life sees you being a giver, and as such gives you more. Gives you more so you can give more. Life knows who you are, it knows why you are here. It simply wishes you to see it for what it is, and be open to it, even become it. When you become it. Your purpose is complete. And your self become all. This is who you are. This is your purpose for being. ",
