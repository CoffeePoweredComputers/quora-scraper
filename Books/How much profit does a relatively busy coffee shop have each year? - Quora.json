            "answer_text": "It's incredibly difficult to say how this works out, because it depends heavily on a lot of different factors: Up-front costs:  Location (good locations can cost more money, but can also get more customers)Shopfitting (A good-looking shop is expensive, but can attract more customers)Fixed costs:  Barista staff (good staff costs more)Support staff (cleaners etc)Rent (see 'location')Water, electricity, and other billsInsuranceVariables:  Price of ingredients (Coffee beans, water, milk, any baked goods etc)Your pricing (More expensive coffee can make more money, but can reduce the number of customers)Etc. The sheer number of variables involved means that there's no easy way of giving a good answer.  For full answering of this question, put together a solid business plan (google How to make a business plan), and do some research into some basic economics to get your pricing right. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "It would probably be exceedingly difficult to get the financial statements for privately owned coffee shops to come up with an average. I would agree with Haje that there are many variables and whatever answer is provided to this question (even mine) is not indicative what may happen to you. However, for the sake of conversation, let's say that your traffic and cost structure is similar to one of an average Starbucks location.  If that were true, you could probably expect profits to be a little north of $100K per year.  Please see my answer here. Garrick Saito's answer to How profitable is an individual Starbucks cafe? ",
