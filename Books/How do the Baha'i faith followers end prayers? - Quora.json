Prayers end with praising God\u2019s attributes\u2026 such as: \u201cDeny me not, O my Lord, the fragrances of Thy raiment in Thy days, and deprive me not of the breathings of Thy Revelation at the appearance of the splendors of the light of Thy face. Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Naught can resist Thy will, nor frustrate what Thou hast purposed by Thy power. No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Wise.\u201d Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h Glory be to Thee, O King of eternity... Or \u201cO my God, my Lord and my Master! I have detached myself from my kindred and have sought through Thee to become independent of all that dwell on earth and ever ready to receive that which is praiseworthy in Thy sight. Bestow on me such good as will make me independent of aught else but Thee, and grant me an ampler share of Thy boundless favors. Verily, Thou art the Lord of grace abounding. \u201c O my God, my Lord and my Master!  ",

            "answer_text": "There is not a specific way to end the prayers. In the community where I was enrolled as a Baha\u2019i, the members used to close their eyes, fold their hands (some people) and say prayers in any language they would like to. Some Baha\u2019is sing (or chant) the prayers. There are very few Baha\u2019is who offer the Long Obligatory Prayer. It looks like the Islamic Salah.   ",
