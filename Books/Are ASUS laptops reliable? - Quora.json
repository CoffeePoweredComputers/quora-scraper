            "answer_text": "My wife wanted a lightweight, fast laptop. In my research I identified a number of machines, including the Asus UX301LA. A nice machine with a great screen, a nice keyboard and super fast startup. I got a 500GB machine, two 250GB SSD set up as Raid 0. It was such a nice machine I bought a second one for myself a month or two later. We then went overseas. A little over a year later, after the warranty expired, my wife\u2019s machine starts acting up, hanging on startup and other issues. Then it died - would not boot. One of the proprietary flashdrive SSDs failed, and because it was raid 0 there was nothing to recover from the other disk. I took the machine back to the US and sent it to an Asus approved repair center. They tried to order a replacement 250 GB SSD. It was not available before I had to leave, so I had them set it up using the 250 GB SSD. Shortly thereafter the other machine started having SSD errors. That failed, and both SSDs were unusable. I then went online and bought a \u201cnew\u201d 125 GB SSD, there were no 250 GB SSDs available. I set it up with Linux. I bought a used 125 GB SSD with the idea of expanding it to 250 GB but that was DOA and I returned it. Nothing else was available. So two identification Asus machines died within a couple of months of each other. The proprietary 250GB SSDs used in them or smaller 125 GB SSDs are not available. I have also asked at an Asus repair facility in Bangkok and they also do not have a replacement available. My Asus days are done. ",

            "answer_text": "i have 2 Asus laptop, one from 2011 and 2013. The first one busted when i am on field duty in 2013 (it is not a rugged laptop and i am a fool for using it when raining, in the jungle). After repair, that laptop served my sister for solid 4 years before suddenly died (and i haven\u2019t got the chance to repair it).The second one that i bought in 2013 is still good and i am still using it for my daily driver (with upgraded ram and ssd). So yeah it is pretty reliable for my case. ",

            "answer_text": "Asus laptops are in par with Dell in terms of build quality. In fact Asus over took the position of the second best brand next to apple pushing Dell to third. The high end laptops of Asus are great and are equally performance oriented as Dell. But the lower end laptops lack the same. This model of Asus is comparable with Dell vostro as both have the same configurations, while the former is bit cheaper by 2\u20133k. I suggest you if you can escalate the budget you can get the vostro 15 5568, which has some more features like optional SSD alongwith HDD, a fingerprint sensor, a backlight keyboard. If not required for you, then you can move on to this model. It's great ",

In the budget of laptop Asus R558UQ, you could find some other DELL laptops with the less graphic capacity. Dell Insprion i5559 is one of them (6th Generation Intel Core i5-6200U, 8 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD). Another recommended laptop model in that budget is Lenovo Ideapad Miix 700 12\u2033 (2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (Intel m5, 12 8GB SDRAM, 256GB SSD, Windows 10). Miix 700 is the worth one to have. ",
