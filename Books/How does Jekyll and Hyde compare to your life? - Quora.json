            "answer_text": "How does Jekyll and Hyde compare to your life? Well, my friend Sarah McLean and I have been buddy reading several books over the past months, and the latest one we discussed was The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. It's a classic, so it took me awhile to understand it. (I'm more into modern fiction.) But Sarah and I have been talking about polarities and the science of dichotomy for awhile, and it turns out that I loved Jekyll and Hyde. It's not quite the polar opposite team like I was led to believe, but it is something better. See, I'm bipolar-minded. Manic depressive, actually. You can find me on both ends of the crazyface spectrum!! *giggle* So, there's that\u2026but then Sarah taught me about Shadow work. She has one, his name is Astor. And I figured out, with Sarah's help, that I have a Shadow too! My Shadow's name is Rebekah\u2026and she's a handful. *sigh* She's a party animal, and I'm probably the most boring person on the planet. Heh. I learned a lot from Jekyll and Hyde. I found out that Mr. Hyde was a lot stronger than I originally thought, he gave Dr. Jekyll a run for his money. And Dr. Jekyll had close friends to watch over him, too. They did their best to make sense of things, but the story ended in tragedy. I don't know what the future holds for Rebekah and I. I'm just grateful that we can thrive in the company we now keep. ^_^ ",

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. I\u2019d say when someone first meets me, I\u2019m Doctor Jekyll. I\u2019m sweet, kind, and caring. I also have that typical innocent look. Then, you talk to me for a while. You become my friend. I come out of my shell a bit, and so does the Mr. Hyde in me. I will act crazier in general. I also have an obsession with horror which will appear. I\u2019ll be able to hold long conversations talking about horror movies. You may see me talk to my thumb. I will probably talk about fictional deaths. If you see any of my crazy behavior; good news! I trust you very much! If you don\u2019t, I have spared you. I will show you my childlike innocence. If I spare you, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like you. It means I see you in a more professional sense. If you work hard at it though, I might show you my Hyde side. Listen to the music of the night, Marie ",
