            "answer_text": "Yessss! It definitely is worth buying. I have the Sophdoesnails' collabs, the Conceal&Define concealer and the Fast Base stick foundation. It is my fave drugstore brand and I am totally trying more, especially some new stuff that comes in the Revolution Pro line. There are, of course, some misses but they upped their game lately, and even if something doesn't match your expectations, the prices are really low for the big ranges of shades they have in pretty much everything and also for the quality.
