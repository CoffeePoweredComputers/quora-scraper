            "answer_text": "You can sign in with another person\u2014who has already downloaded Minecraft Pocket Edition\u2014's Apple ID. The person whose Apple ID you used will not have any money charged from him/her, as it was already charged when he/she first downloaded the app. You can take advantage of this fact. Just ask a friend who has Minecraft Pocket Edition and tell them what you are planning to do. Pass them your iPad or Apple software and give them some privacy to type in their AppStore account's password, then search up Minecraft (or view it in their Purchases) and download the app. Once it's been installed, sign out of your friend's account and back into yours. The servers/worlds your friend built may still be there, so the first step is to delete them\u2014what you do on your device won't affect theirs. As in, by deleting a world/server on your iPad, it will still remain on theirs. Remember to change your skin and name yourself something cool as well; Steve is boring and useless if you want fame. Now the next step is to create your own world or join a server. Slaughter zombies and participate in Hunger Games and join build battles. Build your own city. Have fun!  I do hope no one reports this as illegal. But it's a method that can be used wrongly\u2014which is why you should NEVER tell anyone your Apple ID should you be asked to do the same favour for someone else. ",

By downloading an illegal copy of MC:PE, you go against Minecraft\u2019s End User License Agreement (EULA). It states in the EULA: The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we've made unless we specifically agree to it. By \"distribute anything we've made\" what we mean is: give copies of our Game to anyone else;make commercial use of anything we've made;try to make money from anything we've made; orlet other people get access to anything we've made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;unless we specifically agree to it. In addition to that, when you buy MC: PE, you get the app forever with no additional pay2wins (Yes, Microsoft does try to sell you their texture packs and skins, but those are purely cosmetic. Plus, you can probably find them online for free.). It only costs $6.99, and I would gladly pay double that amount for what you get in MC:PE. TL;DR: You can\u2019t.

Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong An extra bonus here, if you want to get Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta for free, there are lots of exe files you can get for it ad boom! You have what\u2019s essentially Minecraft PE for Windows 10 for free! I don\u2019t think there are any ways to get Minecraft PE for free on devices that use the Amazon App Store (such as Kindles) and neither do WP or W10 Mobile devices. ",
