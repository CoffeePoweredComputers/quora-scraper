Although with the lecture the reader has much more to communicate with, including body gestures, vocal emphasis, and relevance through immediate parenthetical comments, the whole thing Won't Stay Still! It's true that this can lead to deeper learning if there is time to take a short note, abbreviating the learning point to make it stay in the brain, but there's never enough time with me for a note.
