            "answer_text": "Absolutely. It may well be my favourite book by my favourite author. There are other good books on economics, but this one is incredible in its thoroughness, explanations, examples and accessibility. Economics is such an important subject and yet it\u2019s so widely misunderstood - even in terms of what it\u2019s even about. Many assume it\u2019s all about money, but money is just a lubricant for exchange. Economics is about trade-offs - the allocation of scarce resources with alternative uses, as Sowell puts it. That applies to practically all choices we make - all facets of human behaviour, including crime, work, education, trade, war and so on. Policies don\u2019t always achieve their intentions, but we can try to analyse their effects by looking at evidence and by carefully considering how they change incentives and constraints. Whether consciously or not, we weigh up the available options before making decisions. Supply and demand is always in operation - not as some specific formula for predicting things, but as a force affecting prices (the amount people are willing to pay for things). Sowell explains, perhaps better than anyone else, how markets work and why socialism inevitably fails, in all its various forms and degrees. Nobody has opened my eyes more on such a fundamentally important part of life than Sowell and this may be his most important book, at least as a solid starting point. His others are also brilliant but in more specific areas. I\u2019d also recommend Milton Friedman\u2019s Free to Choose TV show for anyone wanting to learn economics. ",
