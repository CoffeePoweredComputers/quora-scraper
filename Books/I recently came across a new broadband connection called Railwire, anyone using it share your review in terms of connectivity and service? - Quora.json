            "answer_text": "Railwire Broadband is one of the excellent ISP service to the customer, which is very flexible and quicker. About Connection: Connection is good and mostly there is no drop-outs. (Even working at its best during chennai flood crisis). Speed is accurate and more. Downloading will be at its peak (double) if more seeds. About Customer care: Its okay, not so bad as they response, they\u2019ll try to solve it via remote if there is any fault. Depending on error we can check with local agent who providing this connection. They will do the work within Hrs. About Tariff: Tariff is not much attractive, but economical. I\u2019m using this broadband for past 4 yrs, so my tariff is 670/- (4Mbps for 30 gb). And can be recharged if data is over. About Payment: Very linent and flexible, as unlike other broadband, giving grace period of upto a week, without disconnecting i conclude Railwire is best of all these, with better services, more than average and no drawbacks. I save lot of money instead of investing in services like ACT which costs, more than 1.3k per month. I will patiently use it, no need of hurry for faster BB speed. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been using the Railwire 300GB 100mbps plan for the past 7 months. Use it mainly for casual browsing & smart TV . The performance is average. The average upload/download speed is around 25\u201328mbps,though they claim 100mbps. Buffering- free HD streaming is possible most of the time. Local faults are attended to by railwire local service provider. Promptness in fault repair is not consistent. Railwire's own customer care has a quite tardy approach to customer issues. Toll free number given in website very seldom responds and representatives are very lethargic. Server issues have taken 24\u201348 hours for restoration, though happens rarely. If you encounter a problem on a Sunday or holiday, rest assured, you need to wait till the next day to restore the net. Though Comparitively cheaper, I would recommend this only to anyone who has only bsnl broadband / has no access to better service providers. Personally, Would definitely migrate Jio fibre net/ to a better service provider whenever available. ",
