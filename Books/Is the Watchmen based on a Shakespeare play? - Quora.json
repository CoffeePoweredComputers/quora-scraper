            "answer_text": "I found this explanation \u2026 Alan Moore, who wanted to transcend the perceptions of the comic book medium as something juvenile, created Watchmen as an attempt to make \"a superhero Moby-Dick; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density.\" Moore also named William S. Burroughs as one of his \"main influences\" during the conception of Watchmen and admired Burroughs' use of \"repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning\" in Burroughs's one and only comic strip, The Unspeakable Mr. Hart, which appeared in the British underground magazine Cyclops. Moore and [illustrator David] Gibbons originally conceived of a story that would take \"familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm.\" Initially, Moore looked towards the defunct MLJ Comics line of superheroes for inspiration. \"I'd just started thinking about using the MLJ characters \u2014 the Archie super-heroes - just because they weren't being published at that time, and for all I knew, they might've been up for grabs. The initial concept would've had the 1960s-'70s rather lame version of the Shield being found dead in the harbor, and then you'd probably have various other characters, including Jack Kirby's Private Strong, being drafted back in, and a murder mystery unfolding. I suppose I was just thinking, 'That'd be a good way to start a comic book: have a famous super-hero found dead.' As the mystery unraveled, we would be led deeper and deeper into the real heart of this super-hero's world, and shown a reality that was very different to the general public image of the super-hero. So, that was the idea.\" ",

            "answer_text": "No. Writer Alan Moore has said that he was most influenced by William S. Burroughs, Beat Generation poet, author of The Naked Lunch, and creator of a single comic strip. There is a rather long and complicated tale between concept and character, which you need to read for yourself. After all, you aren\u2019t paying me for my research. The name, however, is a question posed by the Roman satirist Juvenal, \u201cWho watches the watchmen?\u201d. ",
