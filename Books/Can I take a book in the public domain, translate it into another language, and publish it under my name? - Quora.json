            "answer_text": "Well\u2026yes. Sort of. It\u2019s complicated. Let\u2019s say you took Jules Verne\u2019s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, copy-and-pasted it into a writing program, and then published it as a play with your name on it. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is now public domain. There is nothing stopping you from doing this. Only\u2026 Where did you get the text from? If you got it from the original manuscripts\u2014there are a couple of them\u2014then you are okay. If you got it from an original French printing, that would be safe as well. But if you took the text from a modern translation, you are in violation of the copyright held by that translator. The way they can tell if you ripped off someone else\u2019s translation is through the idiomatic expressions of one language and how the translator interpreted them in the new language. And\u2026 The moment readers have paid for \u201cyour\u201d book and open it, within two or three lines they are going to realize that you simply copied Verne\u2019s story and put your name on it. They could have downloaded Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea for free from Project Gutenberg. They\u2019ll feel like they\u2019ve been cheated, be angry, and demand a refund. If a lot of readers are demanding refunds, the retailers will freeze your business accounts and seize your sales earnings. You will forever have a reputation as a fraud and you can kiss your literary aspirations goodbye. So how do you get away with it? Simple: put credit where credit is due. After you are done translating from Verne\u2019s French to your language, you put him and yourself as the authors. \u201cby Jules Verne and [YOUR NAME HERE]\u201d \u2026or\u2026 \u201cby Jules Verne, translated by [YOUR NAME HERE]\u201d The latter would be the more acceptable. This way, readers will see you are not taking credit for Verne\u2019s work, and they will accept that your part of the work was making the translation so they could read it in their native language. This would even be appreciated. So, don\u2019t take credit for that author\u2019s work. Make it known what your role is in that work. It is highly critical to note that a classic like Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea has had a few translations. People tend to reference each by who did the translation, such as \u201cthe Mercier Translation\u201d or \u201cthe Butcher Translation\u201d because each is different and puts a different context to the story. So, your translation work will be compared to others. (Look those two up. They are real.) I strongly suggest that if you take on the task of translating, you should do your absolute best to interpret the story as closely to what the original author intended. The better you do at this, the better your work will be received. ",

You\u2019re still claiming\u2014by replacing the author\u2019s name with yours\u2014work created by another person. By any other name called theft, or plagiarism. Perhaps giving you greater credibility, credit yourself as an annotator of previously published work. Separate your changes from the original by commentary; surely you have something additional, and original, thoughts on the content! ",
