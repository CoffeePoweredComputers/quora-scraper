            "answer_text": "Maybe. \u201cFirst edition\u201d means the book has the same content as the first time the book ever saw print. If it gets revised, updated, corrected, or changed in any way, then it\u2019s a new edition. \u201cFirst printing\u201d means it\u2019s the first time that edition has been published. When a new book comes out for the first time, that\u2019s the first printing of the first edition. If it sells well, the publisher will tell the printer to print more copies; these are a second printing. The second printing may have a different cover, the copyright page may be altered to indicate that it\u2019s a new printing, the price may change, but as long as the content of the book isn\u2019t altered, it\u2019s still a first edition. Usually it\u2019s printed from the same printing plates/computer file as the first printing. And there can be third, fourth, fifth, and more printings, ad infinitum; some classics have gone to sixty or more printings. Sometimes you can tell printings apart, sometimes you can\u2019t; one of my novels had a slew of printings, and the third, fourth, and fifth all say \u201cthird printing\u201d because no one bothered to change it. (The first, second, and sixth are labeled correctly.) And those are all first editions. Now, if the text is changed in any way \u2014 an introduction is added, a few mistakes are fixed, a scene is updated to reflect changes in the world, a handful of editorial tweaks are made \u2014 then it\u2019s no longer a first edition; it\u2019s now a second (or third, fourth, or whatever) edition. And there\u2019s a first printing of that second edition, and maybe more. So if there\u2019s only one printing of the first edition (which is often the case, especially with books that don\u2019t catch on immediately), then a first printing and a first edition are the same thing. (And now we could bring up the question of \u201cfirst state.\u201d If a book is altered somehow in the middle of the print-run, then the earliest copies off the press are \u201cfirst state,\u201d and the ones after the change are \u201csecond state.\u201d Two hundred years ago this wasn\u2019t all that unusual, as a bit might break off a printing plate, or something could get caught in the machinery and damage something, but with modern printing technology it\u2019s very rare.)

            "answer_text": "What is the difference between a first edition and a first printing? To supplement the other good answers here: it\u2019s basically the difference between editing, and printing. Before digital typesetting became possible with the invention of word processing and desktop publishing, to print a book meant to set type by hand (or by linotype machine) using physical hunks of metal, each containing one letter or punctuation mark, clamped to a board (or a rotating drum) called the \u201cplate,\u201d which received ink from an ink source and then transferred that ink onto a sheet of paper when the printing plate was literally \u201cpressed\u201d against the paper \u2014 either by hand, or using a machine. This is the \u201cprinting\u201d process.  Once a book has been typeset, the publisher will decide how many copies it wants to print on its first \u201crun.\u201d Those are \u201cfirst edition,\u201d and ALSO \u201cfirst printing.\u201d The title page MAY OR MAY NOT indicate either of those terms on it; older books typically did not, and may not even have listed anything other than a publication date, while more recent books (since the ISBN system of book numbering went into effect) typically indicate, on the copyright page opposite the title page, both what edition, and what printing, a given volume is of a given book, as well as the original copyright date and any copyright renewal dates for new, edited, or added material. it is, of course, physically possible to run additional printings of a given typesetting after the first print run, so long as the little pieces of metal in the printing frame are still arranged together the way they were originally, and have not been taken apart and re-set. Each subsequent \u201crun\u201d using the SAME set of type will be a \u201csecond printing,\u201d \u201cthird printing,\u201d and so on. Each \u201cprinting\u201d means that the same set of type will once again be inked up and then pressed against blank pieces of paper to make another set of printed pages IDENTICAL (except for any evident wear-and-tear on the metal type, which DOES occur) to the first-run printing. But a second or third EDITION is a different ball of wax. That means that, at a minimum, after the original set of type has been discarded \u2014 either melted down or disassembled and each letter put back into its separate box in the typesetters\u2019 set:  For a subsequent EDITION, the book will be RE-set, all oven again, before being re-printed. Most often, though, it also means that either the author, or an editor at the publisher, has made some CHANGES in the actual wording or punctuation of the content of the book, before re-setting the type to print it again. That\u2019s what makes it a second \u201cedition\u201d \u2014 it has been EDITED since the original publication. Typically, editing will also occur between the original \u201cgalley proof\u201d printing of a book, and the first published edition \u2014 mostly to correct typographical errors, since by the time a book reaches the \u201cgalley proof\u201d stage, the author and the editor(s) have already been through multiple DRAFTS of the content of the book via edit after edit. But the galley proof is not a \u201cfirst published edition\u201d because it is not PUBLISHED \u2014 that is, not made available for public sale. Galley proofs are for private use only by the author and editors to review and proofread the printer\u2019s work and make sure it meets their expectations, as well as for advance copies to be furnished to book critics so they can publish reviews as soon as published editions come out. In some instances, later editions of a book will be issued by a completely different publisher, using completely different typeface, paper size, format, and so on. But later printings of a first edition, printed from the same plates, must be identical in all respects to the first published printing, save for changing the \u201cprinter\u2019s key,\u201d a line at the bottom of the title page will show a row of numbers: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and will REMOVE all numbers indicating previous printings, so the LOWEST number shown will be the number of the present printing.
