            "answer_text": "Meaning of word Guinness  Guinness is a popular Irish dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness (1725\u20131803) at St. James's Gate, Dublin. Guinness is one of the most successful beer brands worldwide. Inspiration   On 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the Guinness Breweries went on a shooting party in the North Slob, by the River Slaney in County Wexford, Ireland. After missing a shot at a golden plover, he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse (it is the plover).That evening at Castlebridge House, he realized that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird.Beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland and abroad, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realized then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful. Making of the book   Sir Hugh Beaver invites Norris and Ross McWhirter, sports journalists who provided facts and figures to the newspapers of Fleet Street in London, UK. The brothers were commissioned to compile what became The Guinness Book of Records in August 1954.  Books success   One thousand copies were printed and given away. After founding The Guinness Book of Records at 107 Fleet Street, London, the first 197-page edition was bound on 27 August 1955 and went to the top of the British bestseller lists by Christmas. \"It was a marketing giveaway\u2014it wasn't supposed to be a money maker,\" said Beaver. The following year it was launched in the U.S.; 70,000 copies were sold. Because the book became a surprise hit, many further editions were printed, eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year, published in September/October, in time for Christmas.
