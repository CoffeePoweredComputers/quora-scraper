            "answer_text": "No. A Mary Sue isn\u2019t someone who is incredibly overpowered, but rather someone who is too \u201cperfect\u201d to drive narrative conflict. Matilda\u2019s conflict has very little to do with her telekinesis. Indeed, losing this power is the finale of the book, and it\u2019s presented as a good thing because it\u2019s symbolic of her actual conflict being resolved. Her actual conflict, for the record, revolves around her lack of familial and intellectual fulfilment. While her powers were used to resolve the Miss Trunchbull plot, she had to train to be able to achieve it, in a classic if minor series of try-fail cycles. Then her carefully cultivated relationship with Miss Honey (which had relatively little to do with her powers) is what allowed her to escape her scam artist family, after an entire book of her pranking them failed to improve her living situation in any lasting manner. The plot is simple, as befits a book intended for young children, and there\u2019s a degree of deus ex machina in a couple of places, but Matilda herself has some solid conflict and a perfectly servicable character arc of personal growth.

            "answer_text": "No. A Mary Sue is quite a specific definition and does not apply to any female character who has powers\u2026 it refers to a character who is created exclusively in fan fic and who is absolutely unstoppable in all they do. Apart from not being a fan fic character, Maltilda is far from showing the traits of a Mary Sue. First of all, she is always an underdog in pretty much every interaction she has. She is abused by her parents and by her headmistress and is in a very vulnerable situation for most of the book. Her powers come about as a result of that conflict - equalising the playing field. Secondly, she is not 100% perfect in everything she does. She has flaws and weaknesses. A Mary Sue in that situation would be a character who had all the same powers as Matilda but was also well liked by all the characters and had no problems. And was Matilda\u2019s best friend who made everything easier for her. ",
