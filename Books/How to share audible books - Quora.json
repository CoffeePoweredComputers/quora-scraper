On my research\u2014I\u2019ve found 3 prominent ways to share audible books with friends\u2014and family. Using an Audible converter (premium tool)Using the family digital content sharing of \u2018Amazon Household\u2019 (free with limitation\u2014possible to with only one adult)Using the \u2018Send It\u2019 functionality of the audible App\u2014and Audible on the Web.You can learn read a step-by-step guide on how how to do the 3 methods All the 3 options are easy to execute. And the premium audible converter\u2014has its 30-days free trial\u2014thus you could share unlimited-ly till you decide to purchase it or not. It removed the DRM and converts to MP3\u2014for easy sharing I hope this answer helps in a tangible way.Cheers. \u201c ",
