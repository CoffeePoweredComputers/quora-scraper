            "answer_text": " This is such an individual question. It depends on the person really. I do believe there is some generalization of needed sleep hours accordingly with the age, but I do not let that restrict me. For an instance, I have practiced less sleeping and found out it works perfectly fine for me. 6 hours of sleep are enough for me. I know for some people it is a way too little or even too much, but it is because of their already developed habit. Our bodies are machines. The way you are programming your body to function- the way it will act appropriately. Therefore if you practice sleeping for 5-6 a day, your body will get used to it. However, do not do it by any means. There are jobs and industries you can work at, that requires a fair amount of sleep so your body can rest and recover. Physical jobs often require sleeping longer in order for the body to gain energy again. However, for me, I figured that I may give it a try and see what happens if I sleep fewer hours a day. And I came to find out that this actually works better for me than sleeping 8-9 hours. The bottom line is - try and analyze the results. If you want to build a habit of sleeping for 6 hours, you most certainly can, but make sure it is good for you. All of us already have bad habits, and you definitely do not need another one - especially not one that includes departing your sleep schedule. You can also try polyphasic sleeping, where you can try sleeping several times a day for 1-2 hours. Here also, analyze and see if that is maybe something that works for you. You never know. You also will never know if you do not try. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually everyone is different in relation to sleep and sleep patterns. It is accepted that most people (adults) need between 7\u20138 hours; however depending how strenuous the work you do, particularly if it is outside your usual regime, or you are not well, you may need more sleep than normal. Equally if you are worried about something you may need the sleep but your body will keep you awake by making you think about it. Ultimately you will fall asleep out of exhaustion (sleep deprivation). That is a \u201cfinal resort\u201d action for the brain, which will just \u201cshut down\u201d and make you got to sleep. However even taking out over-work or illness, some people need more sleep than others irrespective. As for children, particularly small one still in babyhood, but not quite children (7 years old) the accepted norm is: At six years old - 12 hours At ten years old- 10 hours At fourteen years old 9 1/2 ( I have never under stood the 30 minuet bit). Again everyone is different even in those years and more so if they are unwell, under whatever guise, or indeed if they have been working or playing hard (say football, rugby, hockey, athletics). Even mental work, absorbing, or trying to absorb information quickly e.g. studying or learning a new procedure. During growth spurts, and particularly 7\u201310 and again 12\u201315 years old, (and particularly girls starting menstrual cycle) that is very tiring and therefore teens do tend to sleep more, and small children in particular very soundly. Hence why parents get very frustrated about teens who won\u2019t wake up, or sleep funny /odd (to the parent) hours. So if you are waking up feeling \u201crefreshed\u201d, speak perfectly coherently and at the same speed you usually do and not sleepy, then you may be one of the people who indeed need less sleep than others; of course the reverse is true. Generally it is those who growing faster at their particular growth spurt (again varies from person to person) who tend to sleep heavier. Most very small children can be picked up fast asleep and not wake up if they are going through a growth spurt. Also waking a teen can be hard. As a caution though if this is happening on a very erratic basis, then it may need to be looked in to, particularly if these events are spread across the day, since this could indicate a form of epilepsy called \u201cnarcolepsy\u201d (which can be both convulsive or non-convulsive). Children, indeed adults who sleep-walk are usually hard to wake up if they don\u2019t naturally. ",
