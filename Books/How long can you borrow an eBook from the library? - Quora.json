            "answer_text": "In the Albuquerque Public Library system, it\u2019s similar to the time you can keep a physical book and for the same reasons. The library has purchased N \u201ccopies\u201d of the e-book and can only have N copies checked out at a time. I put copies in quotes because it doesn\u2019t really mean the same thing as with a physical object, but in this case, it functions the same. I haven\u2019t looked to see if they do here, but libraries could, in theory, offer unlimited copies of e-books that are in the public domain. The rules on these works aren\u2019t a clear-cut as I\u2019d like. Project Gutenberg offers unlimited copies of this kind of work. As I recall, they place some (probably unenforceable) restrictions on what you can do with the text. It probably wouldn\u2019t be worth it for library system to get involved because things like Gutenberg already exist and why should they duplicate effort for no addition benefit? I suppose they could connect user up with these sorts of projects as a public service, which is after all, the business they are in. ",

Some check out for 21 days, and a few of the just-released titles will check out for only 7 days initially. After a certain amount of time they will roll over to the 2 week list. ",
