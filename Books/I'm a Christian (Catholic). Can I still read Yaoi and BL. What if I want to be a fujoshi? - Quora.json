He was even an LGBT magazine\u2019s Person of the Year once; \u201cThe Advocate\u201d magazine chose him. \u201cthe key is for the church to welcome, not exclude, and show mercy, not condemnation.\u201d\"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\"The problem, \u201c \u2026 \u201cis not having this orientation. We must be brothers.\u201d Well\u2026 if the Pope says that homosexuality isn\u2019t a sin, and he\u2019s supposed to be God\u2019s prime representative, there you go. Of course, a lot of people disagree with this because the Bible states homosexuality is an abomination, but at the end of the day, the Bible also teaches forgiveness and acceptance. So, you should be fine. And Yuri would be fine as well. ",
