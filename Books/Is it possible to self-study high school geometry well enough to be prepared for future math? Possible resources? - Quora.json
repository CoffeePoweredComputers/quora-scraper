            "answer_text": "It\u2019s absolutely possible. If you are self-disciplined and motivated, you can \u201cteach yourself\u201d just about anything. I would recommend that you include a method to test yourself (lots of free online resources), and have an established procedure to address questions (tutor, online forums, etc.). One caution: Think through your reasons for wanting to skip to Algebra 2. If you want to keep the interest/challenge, if you want to take high-level maths senior year, if you want to have flexibility of your schedule\u2026 I taught at a school where the standard was for students to take both Geometry and Algebra 2 at the same time. Most of the students took Algebra 1 in 8th grade, and then Geo/Alg2 as freshmen. Literally, like 75% of the freshmen class did that. It was a horrible idea. Double-math is fine for highly gifted students, but it is ridiculous for most \u201caverage\u201d students. And, trust me, 75% of that school\u2019s freshmen were not gifted. Their purpose was for students to have completed Trig and most of Calculus by the time they took the SAT/ACT as Juniors. ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah I think so. I never got past algebra in high school never taken a geometry class. Pass HS with a 1.8 GPA average I did 5 years of special education in middle school so called slow students. Then went to college but dropped out after 2 semesters. And now I'm 25 years of age and currently I am studying algebra 2 and geometry with lots of self tests as of now because I taught myself prealgebra and algebra 1 6months ago. I keep going because I want get a C.S degree. And become an engineer. ",
