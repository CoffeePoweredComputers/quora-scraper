            "answer_text": "Affiliate marketing is not a scam. It is a business. Then there are guys like Keala Kanae that try to make money by teaching you how to make money. People new to affiliate marketing are desperate for information on how to make the 6, 7, and 8 figure income that EVERYONE is always talking about. There are systems that work. They basically all teach the same thing. The mechanics of websites and social media are the first thing you need to learn. Then you need to learn how to market. The gurus are gurus because they have gone through all of this process, so they know what works. The main thing to realize is that you will not make 6 figures your first month. Probably not your first year. You will make mistakes. You will learn from your mistakes. Then you will get better. DO NOT make the mistake of paying a fortune to some guy with all the answers. They will not do the work for you. Get as much free information as you can. Eventually you will find someone that gives you good solid information over and over. You will find yourself applying information that you remember from Youtube or some bootcamp or webinar. When information starts to make sense, then you can consider spending some cash with the guy that says things that make sense. Not some flashy guy with a flashy car and a fancy house that they bought with money people gave them to learn how to make money. That being said, Dan Brock has a whole lot of great content on Youtube. Brian Dean is the guru\u2019s guru on seo and backlinks. Two guys on Income School on Youtube blow away most of the webinars I have been to. So check out the free stuff and decide how you want to spend your money. Also do not start spending money on advertising until you know exactly how to do it and what you want to accomplish with it. Advertising that sucks is a total waste of money. ",

            "answer_text": "Affiliate marketing is not a scam. But yes, there are some scam-related websites if you go search in the market. The three most commonly-encountered affiliate marketing scams. 1. **Get-Rich-Quick Schemes** - Many companies take advantage of the fact that many people are looking to make money, and oversell the services they offer. Unrealistic deals can be easily spotted, as they will claim that you can make a lot of money with minimal work. In reality, you\u2019ll need to put in plenty of effort to make affiliate marketing a successful venture. So be wary of schemes that promise otherwise. Get-rich-quick schemes will also push the idea that you can make thousands of dollars in a short period of time. Again, this simply isn\u2019t possible. Instead, look for programs that have clearly defined payment plans. The monetary value these programs promise will be lower, but far more realistic. Of course, your potential earnings will vary from program to program. However, in a general sense, affiliate marketers can expect to make between 5% to 30% per sale. 2. **Pay -to-Join Programs- **Another common affiliate marketing scam is asking people to pay for their memberships. Again, this is an easy trap to fall into. At first glance, it might make sense that you have to pay to join a company\u2019s program. However, most credible affiliate schemes are entirely free to join. This is because you are effectively going to be working for the company that has set the program up. You wouldn\u2019t pay to work a real-world job, so you shouldn\u2019t do so when getting started with affiliate marketing. Plus, when you buy into a scam like this, likely, you won\u2019t see your money again \u2013 or make any additional income. Before signing up for any program, make sure that the company behind it is legitimate. Is there a list of clients on its website, and can you find positive feedback about the program? If not, it may be a sign that you need to look elsewhere. 3. **Fake Products or Services **- Sometimes, scammers will create fake products or services, and promote them under the name of a well-established business. Scammers will often craft full product catalogs, and write \u2018customer\u2019 reviews for each offering. They\u2019ve even been known to promote their businesses by using paid phony spokespeople. A clear sign that a product is fake is an abundance of overly-positive reviews. Even the best services will have a few negative comments, so be wary of any that don\u2019t. False products are also likely to have blurry or unrealistic images \u2013 such as stock photos. Real brands take the time to photograph their offerings carefully. Fake ones simply steal pictures from other websites. If you aren\u2019t sure whether a program or product is real, your first port of call should be to check the brand\u2019s official website. You should be able to find the products or services in question, and likely a page for the affiliate program as well. If you can\u2019t, then it\u2019s probably a trap. It may also be worth contacting the business owners directly. They\u2019ll be best equipped to provide a solid answer, and may even escalate the issue further to prevent other affiliate marketers from being scammed.
