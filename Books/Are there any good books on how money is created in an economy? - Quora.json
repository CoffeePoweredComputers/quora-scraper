            "answer_text": "Much depends on what you mean. For example, are you seeking ideas, opinions, and possible answers on: Finding books precisely about what you question seems to ask: how money is created in an economy. If yes, one useful starting point could be: https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=good+books+on+how+money+is+created+in+an+economy&oq=good+books+on+how+money+is+created+in+an+economy&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i71k1l4.3776.3776.0.4098.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.0.0.7L0EYkEpAEkFinding good books on how to make money in an economy, then a useful start-off point could be found using a Google search at: https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=good+books+on+how+to+make+money+in+an+economy&oq=good+books+on+how+to+make+money+in+an+economy&gs_l=psy-ab.3...163163.169797.0.170504.10.10.0.0.0.0.116.1022.5j5.10.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0.5M41RLiPlEIThen, of course, there is the seemingly endless questions about how to make money online. All three questions lead to entirely different answers. Unfortunately, because of the limitations of words and meaning, I\u2019m not sure which of those three possible options interest you. There may even be more alternatives. If assuming you\u2019re keen on exploring how to earn money directly \u2026 My best guess is that you\u2019ll hear different answers depending on where the person invited to comment comes from. So for example, responders from the USA may typically reflect \u201cthe American dream\u201d. However, forgive me for making a quick guess (which I realise may be wrong). If you\u2019re keen on exploring how to make money, I urge you, rather than follow what any particular author may promote, I suggest, look at what they do rather than what they say. That difference is so important. Why: yes, the perspectives of others can help, but what they do, may have worked for them, at a particular time in history. There is no guarantee that replicating that method will work for you today or tomorrow (if we exclude boiler room scams). Time changes how things work out. What worked yesterday, may not work so well today. Strive to understand your economic environments. The solution to making money does not lie with any particular author, but you, and the choices you make, at any particular point in time. My best guess is that many authors write books about how to make money. Yet I wonder how many have really made their first large inflow of money simply by writing a book about how to make money. Key point: making more money once you have a stash of it, whether earned or gifted, is a lot easier than starting off from little or even zero. Getting to the first $100,000 is surely a lot harder than going from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 in profit. So earning $1,000,000 if you already have $100,000 to invest, is arguably much easier than starting from having nothing spare. Yes, you could still lose it all, but with careful planning and spread risk, you won\u2019t. I suggest, be wary of the fake-it-until-you-make-it method - which has perhaps worked for many in the past. Today, however, thankfully, is the age of transparency: I recommend, be more open, honest, more analytical, etc., in your dealings with others, and many benefits can come back to you. So take note of what they are doing, not necessarily what they say. If you agree with their approach, by all means consider replicating if that is your choice. But do so with you in complete control. Perhaps few will suggest that to you, but I\u2019m not in the business of selling affiliate programs, so am quite happy to share with you my true opinion. In return, you are free to make of that what you will :-) Moreover remember, throughout history, what we may consider as \u201cmoney\u201d is changing. In the past, money has been wheat, barley, coffee, silver, gold, oil, and so on. In a desert, if you are thirsty, even water is a form of money. Whatever we need to live, or to enhance our lives, has value. When we exchange value, we have trade. Moreover today, money can also be found in electronic forms like the Blockchain in the shape of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Dash, Monero, and so on. Some people think that Bitcoin is a fad, yet after (to-date) 142 declarations from \u201cindustry experts\u201d of death, it is still here, and will probably stay around for the foreseeable future. Who really knows what money is, other than a group of people agreeing on something that has value? That\u2019s why the dominant money of tomorrow may indeed be digital money created out of computer code, bits and bytes, rather than any physical item. For validation, all we need is mutual agreement that something has value. And times are changing. One reason why people ultimately want money, is that it can give them freedom, choices, options. Nevertheless, no amount of money is of little use if you spend too much or your expenses are too high. One key point is not what matters is not what you earn, or what your net worth is, but what you have left after you have paid your taxes and day to day living expenses. So if making money is for you: My first recommendation is: caution. Why: the world is a funny place. People can do weird things. They can tell you nonsense and still look in the mirror and tell themselves what a wonderful person they are, while knowing in their heart of hearts that what they have said is fiction.My second suggestion is: develop your critical thinking. The world is full of nonsense. Don\u2019t trust or accept what you read just because you are seeing words on paper or screen (millions do), no matter who may recommend the book.Do not be overly impressed by anyone who has a lot of money, status, or influence. Why: your judgement may become impaired by factors that don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, and which only makes them richer, if you buy into bad ideas. You may be overly influenced by someone who sees life very differently to how you interact with the world.Start small. Find a need that you can fill. Then fill that need in a unique, attractive way. Minimise your costs. Strive to be kind to your customers or buyers. If you have repeat customers, you have found one way to make money. Aim to build your wealth slowly. Follow the laws in your country. Pay your taxes. Forget \u201cGet rich quickly\u201d: the jails are full of such people. Instead, by knowing when to take your time like a snail, and speeding up fast like a hare when needed, you can maximise your options, live an enjoyable life and relax more. How: you may just find that\u2019s, you can have lots of\u201d slow\u201d periods, interspersed with short bursts of wealth generation that vastly exceed your expectations. The end result can be a happier life. ",
