            "answer_text": "It is a paid app. It has an yearly and monthly subscription plan which you can purchase according to your needs, but other than that, it has reading catalogue and also some reading lists published by some of the eminent personalities. But the best feature is it provides a \u2018 free daily \u2018 book summary which you can read or listen on the go. It is a sample of the thousands of titles they keep summarizing, mainly non fiction. I have been using blinkist for over an year now and have read more then 200 book summaries over it and I must say I simply love it! It's got really crisp and consize book summaries and even the books they summarize are really trending and worth a shot! So go on, enjoy reading them! Cheers! ",
