            "answer_text": "I apologize up front; I don\u2019t have the answer to your question. However, I wanted to thank you for bringing to my attention the existence of two entire subjects I had no idea even existed. -And which, frankly, sounded like total make-believe or some kind of satire until I dug around trying to figure out what you were asking about. Holy cow. They\u2019re real. I mean, Web Novels, (or \u201cLight Novels\u201d) make sense. I get that. A step up from fan-fic, (because a professional story-teller is doing the work), but a step below pulp fiction, because there\u2019s no actual pulp. But Cultivation Novels? Like, cultivation, -no puns or wordplay or deeper meaning intended. Stories about Farming. Adventure Farming, even! -And enough of them to deserve a whole category? Wow. It\u2019s going to take a while to add that one to my list of, \u201cThings I Know\u201d. But sure. Why not? Any challenge taken seriously enough can make for a good story. Anyway, I wish you the best of luck in getting an answer to your question! My general advice, however; if it fuels your passion for writing, if the words flow and you love the process and the result, if it helps and doesn\u2019t harm the world.., then it might be a good idea to obey your muse and start typing. Shoot, I might even read the thing out of curiosity! ",
