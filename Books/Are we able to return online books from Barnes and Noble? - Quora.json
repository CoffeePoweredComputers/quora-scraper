            "answer_text": "Books purchased from the Barnes & Noble website are usually returnable in-store with some exceptions. New, unused textbooks are returnable for store credit; for a refund, they must be returned to the website. Used books, or books purchased through a third-party seller, are not returnable in-store. POD (print-on-demand: Create Space, Xlibris, etc.) titles are not returnable in-store. Regular books, gift, and toy merchandise is subject to the same qualifications as in-store purchases: you must have a receipt; the item, including packaging, must be in saleable condition; the return must be made within 14 days of receiving it (within 20 days of shipping. There is a date on the bottom of the packing list that gives the shipping date). CDs, DVDs, LPs must be new and their packaging unopened. Media that is purchased used, through a third-party seller, or received in a damaged condition must be returned to the website. ",

            "answer_text": "Once you buy an E book, it\u2019s yours. No returns on those. But hard copy books purchased online are returnable within 2 weeks (that may have changed) as long as you can produce the receipt. You can either return them by sending them back or you can bring them into a brick and mortar store as long as they are in their original, salable condition. ",
