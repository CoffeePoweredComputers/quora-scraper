            "answer_text": "The best place to see him would be when King is on a book tour and the last one was in 2017 when he was on tour promoting \u201cSleeping Beauties\u201d, but that does not guarantee that you will meet him unless there is also an autograph session after the presentation. Since most author tours have autograph sessions, at the end of the presentation someone will provide directions where you will go for King to sign copies of his work. Make sure you have your own copies of his work for him to sign. It\u2019s almost guaranteed that the line for Stephen King will be LONG so be patient and eventually you will reach his table, but he won\u2019t have time to chat because of that really long line of other fans wanting to meet him and get an autograph. Follow King\u2019s website and keep track of the NEWS to find out the next time he is giving a lecture or going on another book tour. StephenKing.com - Recent News ",
