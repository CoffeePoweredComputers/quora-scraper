            "answer_text": "I\u2019m very sure you can, because selling ebooks is about 99% of my income, and has been steadily rising since I started in 2010.  To be fair, I don\u2019t just sell ebooks though.  Instead, I package them with several bonuses, such as video courses and audio courses that are extremely relevant to the initial \u2018main\u2019 ebook for sale.  Most people will say you need to be an \"expert\" - or generating content for years in order to get results - but I don't believe that. The first piece of content I ever released online was an ebook, for sale, under a name I made up - and it still sells daily. Here's why: \"Ebooks are simply information, packaged, and information is (by far) the most valuable commodity in the world\" If you want to go down this road, then here\u2019s 7 tips:  1. Only sell \u201cHow To\u201d type ebooks. Fiction is much harder to sell.  2. Stick to the most profitable niche markets in the world. They all fall under the umbrella of the big 3: money, health, relationships.  3. Within those markets get specific. For example, instead of \u201close weight\u201d you could create something far more appealing to a certain demographic; like \u201chow to lose weight for men over 40\"  4. That last point is a double edged sword. Not only is it now more appealing to fat guys over 40, but you can also increase your sales conversion rate dramatically by only targeting traffic that is \u201cfat men over 40\"  5. I also go against the grain and do not use large online hubs, like Amazon etc. Sure, they can give you some easy sales, but they will also take a very large portion of the revenue. Amazon is good for lead generation, not for revenue. For the same reason, I would never use a publisher. These days, they often cannot market your product any better than you can.  6. Instead of a publisher or Amazon, just create your offer and then sell it yourself with an extremely basic website. The more simple it is, the better. I'm not sure why, I've just noticed that to be the case. 7. Promoting your ebooks is a bigger topic than creating your ebooks. But the most valuable lesson that most people agree with - is to build your list, segment your list, and keep in contact with your list.  I know this question is a year old but it came up in my feed, so hopefully it helps someone. Selling ebooks is about being specific and having the right message targeted to the correct audience. If you do it well, you can go on holiday and still get paid. You could be lost at sea and still earn an income, and you can wake up every day with new sales made automatically. It isn't easy, but it is certainly worth it. Thanks for reading. Good luck! ",

Here is a method I use to sell e-books to make some pretty amazing cash on the side. Be sure to take a look at the bottom of the site where this crazy method is. It changed my life. Some reasons people prefer eBooks: Storage \u2013 People can store hundreds, even thousands, of books within one device.Ease of purchase \u2013 Buying an eBook is just a click away.Portability \u2013 The worst thing is finishing a book on vacation and not having the next book to start.Price \u2013 The price of an eBook is usually less than a print book.Purchasing Options \u2013 A person can find an eBook at almost 80 different online outlets. Here is what he does\u2026 \u201cI simply upload my digital products to one of the free digital delivery platforms such as payhip.com... Once uploaded you can get your link to the product by hitting the share button... Then I just head over to youtubes video editor and hit the CC button. Then search for video's related to puppies and dog training. (CC means Creative Commons licence! This licence allows you to re-upload these video's) That's right you don't even have to touch a video camera and this takes just minutes... I also make a simple call to action slide using a program like MS paint to place at the end of the video, directing people to \"click the link in the description to download your product\" I make two of these videos a day over a month and I have 60 videos on youtube for that product... Lets just say I get 6 view per day on each video (usually much more)... That's 360 views each day... In my experience this product converts at well over 7% because of the low price and it's perceived value, but lets just say it converts at 3% and you are selling this product for a very low price of $7 as a whole sale unit... This gives me a conversion rate of 10.8 units sold per day... $75 + per day! Now just think if a videos goes viral and gets over a million views each year... Jack pot! You can do the math... See how possible this is by searching youtube.com for puppy compilations and you will see how very possible this is... Check out this video it has over 900,000 views in just 4 months... So there you have it! The gold nugget you may have been searching for!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "If someone goes on to write a book that sells a million copies, why not pursue writing as a career?  But the question really is, how many of the hundreds, if not thousands, of authors whose books are published each year have seen such success. People only see the tip of the iceberg and they like what they see. What they fail to see is the large number of authors who might not even sell a hundred copies a year. Just like in any other field, a new author is unknown in an already crowded field - more like a needle in a haystack. Most books remain undiscovered and authors do not earn enough to make a living off writing. By no means am I trying to discourage anyone from choosing writing as a career. Just take care that you have a sustainable source of income to keep you going while your book and you yourself are discovered and find a following. Don't give up a day job yet to pursue writing.  You may find the following questions interesting. How many copies does the average book sell?If you publish one eBook on KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) that is fiction, how many copies should you expect to sell in one year?How do I sell my $2.99 e-book to 335,000 people?I have self-published a book and it is based on my road trip to Ladakh with two of my friends. Once I returned from the trip, I decided to write a memoir of the trip and published it as an eBook on Amazon - Himalayas: Through Heaven and Hell in the Hills Success has many definitions depending on who defines it. To me, being able to write a book that was good enough to be published was the beginning of success. Seeing that at least some people enjoyed reading the book, based on the reviews, was better. If success is measured in monetary terms, I would not call it a success. I still need a day job to pay my bills. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there, Disclaimer First: I am one of the founders @ Notion Press Publishing Self-publishing your novel as an eBook with Kindle is a great idea since it gives you the opportunity of reaching readers and getting feedback about your book. However with over 2 million titles on Amazon alone, the book industry is an extremely competitive space for new authors. Your book needs to be well written, edited, positioned, designed, distributed and marketed properly to stand any chance of success and start earning profits. It is a good idea to publish on Kindle if you have experts working on the aspects I've mentioned above or if you are convinced that you can manage all of it on your own. Your other option would be to approach a guided self-publishing platform similar to Notion Press and work with a team of book experts who will take care of the entire publishing process and bring both the print and digital version of your book out to the market. In this guided publishing model, you will own 100% of the rights to the book and take home 100% of the profits from book sales. You could also increase your chance of success by publishing in both digital and print formats. Print books still dominate the market and you would be missing out on a huge chunk of readers if it was published just as an eBook. You can approach any guided self-publishing platform similar to Notion Press to get both versions of your book published, distributed and marketed. ",

I\u2019ve published 3 eBooks over the past 2 years, including one exclusively on Amazon, and I make between $500 - $3,000 each month with my digital products (depending on if I run sales or promotions). As long as there\u2019s a need in your niche, eBooks are great ways to teach or instruct your audience. And not just in the blogging field. According to Helium 10 (an Amazon research tool), here is how much money different authors have made, on average, in the last 30 days: The top finance & budgeting book on Amazon makes approx $44,000 in monthly salesThe top dog training boos on Amazon make nearly $11,000 a month eachThe top vegan recipes cookbook makes $over $19,000 a monthThe top pregnancy eBook makes $36,500 a monthSo there are two ways to do it: Either publish eBooks on your own platform, keep a bigger chunk of the profit, but work harder on building an audienceOr self-publish on Amazon, make lower margins, but have a bigger reach without having to do any marketing yourself (except PPC).I outline the PROs and CONs of both methods, along with some tips on how to get started, in my tutorial on Best Practices For Creating And Selling An Ebook (On Your Website + On Amazon).

However, I\u2019m glad my first published ebook is become successful that helps me earn money. Of course, it won\u2019t succeed without the help of a fulltime english native writer like http://www.ozki.org/57/ for as low as $57 per 3000 words of book. It helps me build a solid author brand on original content for my book as well. Therefore, I conclude that ebook publishing really helps to earn a passive amount of amount and helps to support for a living. Thanks! ",

If you are not a leading member of an online community directly interested in the content you will create for them, then I'd say it is probably not worth your time. The best content sellers have been generating content for years (posts, comments, blogs) before they try to sell anything. They have an instant customer base built in from those earlier efforts which makes selling (and being profitable) easy. ",

The best strategy is to give as much information to what you write the book about, but not to overlook putting reference links to the product of what the book is about. Unless the book is a best seller and intriguing you are not going to make a lot of money out of it unless it is so intriguing for them to download and share it with their friends. Past experience suggests an Ebook has to have so much attraction to present them that they cannot keep their eyes off the information in it. Because there are so many out there, you have to spark their interest from the common place market to a point of making it jump out at them. Once you know how to do that then you will make money. ",
