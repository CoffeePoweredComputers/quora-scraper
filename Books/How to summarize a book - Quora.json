            "answer_text": "Summarize according to your major course's focus: Example-- If you major in Linguistics or Languages, you would do well to sum up your English class books with a slant to  how the said books you're asked to read  are developing your know-how of English. The same applies to the books you have for your German class. IF the said books are not too technical (example, they are Cultural or Historical), then , you may summarize them more loosely, according to how you've become more aware/appreciative of a certain period or country/region/culture. IF those books you have are storybooks, then you will have to sum up the main plot or action, the memorable characters/important ones, the setting (time, place, cultural set up,author's bit of a life), and the theme/main topic/lesson or moral lesson of the story/ies.
