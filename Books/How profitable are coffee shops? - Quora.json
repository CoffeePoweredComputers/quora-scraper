            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of 'profitable', which can range from a business that is profitable enough to pay the working-owner a wage, right up to a business that can generate a minimum of a 40% return on the owner's investment without the owner needing to work in the business. There are countless coffee shops that fulfil the lower expectation of profitability as described above but very few that operate at the higher end of the profitability expectation. Those that do will generally adopt the following key strategies in their business model as described here: What's the secret to a successful coffee shop? The major reason that few coffee shops make it to the higher expectations of profitability has a lot to do with the fundamentals of the industry as analysed by the profit squeeze in Porter's 5 Forces where 3 of the 5 profit-squeeze factors are working against the coffee shop\u2019s profitability. These include: The ease at which new coffee shops can enter the market: I believe that new entry businesses exert the greatest amount of profit squeeze on coffee shops. 'Every man and his dog' thinks they can successfully open a coffee shop ... and they do. 'Nothing to it' they say. These operators come and go but meanwhile they force prices down in the market and take enough business from good operators to make it hard for them to ever be profitable.The ease at which customers can turn to substitutes: With the prevalence of quality make-it-at-home/office coffee machines, substituting your coffee shop offer has never been easier. Add to this the fact that just about every food item you make can be made by your customers at home for a 1/3rd of the price.The significant amount of competitor rivalry: There are big national and international chains in this market with big advertising budgets and who use their market power to secure the best sites, best buying prices and the best staff. Even other independently owned coffee shops will make it difficult for you in the market because they all offer pretty much the same products and compete for exactly the same customers.In summary, coffee shops would generally be seen as difficult businesses to make money from because they face profit squeezes from three different threats: the significant amount of rivalry between competitors, the ease at which your products can be substituted (customers doing it for themselves) and the ease at which new entrants can and do enter the market. In answering this question it may also be prudent to read my answer to the following, which looks at the more micro profit challenges facing a coffee shop Why do most caf\u00e9 startups fail? As an objective analysis, here are some financial benchmarks produced by the Australian Taxation Office from thousands of coffee shops operating in Australia that identify the profitability of coffee shops at different levels of turnover. The result indicates that even in the highest percentile turnover range of $600,000 turnover per year, the average net profit return = 600,000 x (100% - 90% average total expenses) = $60,000, and that\u2019s before taking out a tax of 30% and without knowing if this includes a % owing to the owner in under-paid wages for the hours spent in their business.

            "answer_text": "How profitable a coffee shop is depends on how well the owner runs the business. Every shop, from a massive chain to a single location must be run by the P&L statement. Provide a great product and even better service; combine that with extreme diligence to minimizing operating costs, reducing waste, and running as lean as possible and your shop can maintain very healthy margins of 40\u201350%. Much of it will depend on the products you sell, but keep things simple, offer high quality, and make it accessible to your customers. Education for your baristas, as well as your clients is important. Find a roaster you trust and form a good relationship. Do constant cost comparisons for paper goods and other commonly used items like syrups, milk, etc. Be a negotiator for low prices but get creative with your vendors because you can negotiate a lot more than just price. Learn how to fix your equipment yourself, or make sure you get maintenance included from your coffee vendors. Depending on your location, tailor your offerings and service to your customers. Talk to every single person that comes in to understand what they need. For example, if you\u2019re in a metropolitan area, speed and convenience will be most important. Get out in the community, donate, but make sure you get something out of the donation. Don\u2019t discount your product. Coupons are terrible, be more creative with your promotions. Make it fun for your customers. Keep an eye on your competition and be better than them in terms of quality and technology. Don\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel. Pay attention to places like Starbucks. They are constantly innovating, remodeling, and listening to their customers and they\u2019re on top for a reason. Your coffee shop will be very profitable if you love coffee, love people, love marketing, and love numbers. You have to simultaneously be detailed and have an eye on the big picture. ",
