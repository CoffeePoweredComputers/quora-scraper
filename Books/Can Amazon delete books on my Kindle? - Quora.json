            "answer_text": "The answer to the question whether Amazon can remotely delete books from users\u2019 private Kindles without notice could be answered if a class-action lawsuit over Amazon\u2019s deletion of e-books goes to trial. In July 2009, Amazon learned two of George Orwell\u2019s e-books had been uploaded to its Kindle bookstore by a company that did not own rights to these books. Without notice, Amazon remotely deleted these books from users\u2019 accounts and refunded the purchase price. Kindle users, however, likened Amazon\u2019s actions to Amazon entering users\u2019 homes, removing books from their bookshelves, and leaving a few dollars for compensation. The class-action suit, filed by 17-year-old Justin Gawronski of Seattle says Amazon violated its own terms of service when it \u201chacked\u201d into users Kindles to remove the book. Gawronski had notes on the deleted copy of the book that he used for a class assignment. This case involves copyright, property rights, and digital rights management (DRM) law, though resolution of the case might not involve DRM law. Amazon\u2019s terms of service says users have the \u201cright to keep a keep a permanent copy of the applicable Digital Content and to view, use, and display such Digital Content an unlimited number of times...\" In this situation, Kindle users' \"permanent copy\" of Orwell's books was far from permanent because Amazon did not have ownership of the books at issue. Jay Edelson, an attorney who specializes in internet law, says just because a technology company can access someone\u2019s personal property digitally, that company does not have a right to do so. Even Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, says what Amazon did with the Kindle books was \"stupid, thoughtless and painfully out of line with our principles.\" Information in this answer is from \u201cCan Amazon Legally Delete Books from Your Kindle?\u201d by LegalZoom.

            "answer_text": "Yes they can. At least, they can delete books from their own store that are on the Kindle. The most notorious instance of this was of the book 1984. Amazon's '1984' Deletion From Kindle Examined They do this for a few reasons. They may need to delete a book in order to update a recently edited version of the text. They may need to remove a book from your Kindle because your method of payment didn\u2019t go through. And of course since you don\u2019t actually own the books on your Kindle, and neither does Amazon, they may need to delete it because they lost the license that allowed them to \u201csell\u201d the books, in which case the license you \u201cbought\u201d it under is invalid as well.
