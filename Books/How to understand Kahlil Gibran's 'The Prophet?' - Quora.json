            "answer_text": "I have listened to and read this book for 38 years. I\u2019d strongly suggest reading this: Speak to Us of Love: Reflections on Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet - Kindle edition by Osho TRULY amazing. ON LOVE Then said Almitra, \"Speak to us of Love.\" And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said: When love beckons to you follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden. For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast. All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart. But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor, Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; For love is sufficient unto love. When you love you should not say, \"God is in my heart,\" but rather, I am in the heart of God.\" And think not you can direct the course of love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. To know the pain of too much tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love; And to bleed willingly and joyfully. To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving; To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy; To return home at eventide with gratitude; And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips. I don\u2019t see any contradiction there. Keep in my mind that spiritual teachings are the result of the consideration of paradoxes. Paradoxes are NOT contradictions. Also, to look for logic inside poetry is to miss the logic of poetry. ",

            "answer_text": "Slowly read the whole book. It's poetry but it's also a story. Try to take it in as it is instead of trying to \u2018understand\u2019 it. Many who have read it over a lifetime will tell you that the understanding of its meaning became clearer as they gained life experience. Some of the phrases can be taken literally, like \u2018[your children] come through you but not from you\u2019, which means your children are not really yours, they are their own persons, and they live their own lives. You have a responsibility to look after them, and you can love them, but you do not own them. But, as I mentioned about life experience, if you do not have children you might not yet be able to fully understand the deeper meaning. Feel free to post in the comments any of the phrases that you might want to discuss. ",
