            "answer_text": "YES! A few years ago, one of my friends convinced me to read it, but I was really not looking forward to it. You know the feeling; you look at the book waiting expectantly on the table and think \u2018ugh, it can wait.\u2019 Eventually I picked it up and vwoop, I was done with it. Something about the pacing of the story, or maybe the translation (I forget which specific version I read) made it extremely gripping. I very quickly became attached to Dantes, and his exploits and adventures kept me interested right to the end. If you like storied of redemption, revenge, and repaying old friends, you will probably like \u2018Monte Cristo\u2019, because boy, does it have lots of that. As soon as I finished it, I went out and bought a copy for my collection, something I only do for the absolute top books I read. I only actually buy books if I read and loved them.  Check out this beautiful cover! ",

One of the greatest books I've ever read about a man who thinks his quest for vengeance was his calling to be the hand of God, only to find out he is human. Impossible to do justice in a description. Read the whole unabridged version though, I've never read an abridged version that was any good. ",
