            "answer_text": "They\u2019re quite popular. In fact the most sold type of car in 2019 in the Netherlands was the Tesla model 3, a fully electrical car. Also other types of cars are available as electrical cars, and sell very well. There are plenty of charging stations, so charging the car is never a problem. Also charging at home is becoming more popular. Most Dutch people only use their car for relatively short distances for which electrical cars are perfect. On top of that, a lot of cities got environment zones where polluting old diesel vehicles aren\u2019t welcome. However an electrical car is never a problem. ",

            "answer_text": "On the first of January 2019 there were 45000 fully electric cars in the Netherlands, which is twice as much as one year before that. For comparison, in 2014 there were just 4600. The most popular one is the Tesla model S with 12000. Together with the hybrid cars, there are 139000 cars that are either fully or partially driven by electricity. This translates to 1.6% of the total number of cars. So to answer your question, they are gaining popularity, but the fraction of electric cars is still quite low.
