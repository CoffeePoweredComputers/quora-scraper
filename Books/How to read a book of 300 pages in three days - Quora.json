            "answer_text": "Absolutely! To read 300 pages in 3 days, you would have to read about 100 pages a day. This could take you several hours to read, depending on how fast you read and how easy the book is to get through. For example, I can read an Agatha Christie book (which is about 250 pages) in about 2 hours or so because I\u2019m a fast reader and it\u2019s an easy read. Reading a classic book like Charles Dickens or Oscar Wilde, however, could take me significantly longer to read because it\u2019s a harder book to get through. I could still finish 300 pages in 3 days, but it would take me several more hours of reading to do it. So, just keep that in mind when you\u2019re considering how you can get 300 pages done in 3 days. Also remember, audiobooks count as reading too. So if you have an hour commute to and from work every day, listen to an audiobook of whatever you\u2019re reading. You could get more than 100 pages done that way too! ",

            "answer_text": "100 pages per day is a good place to start. You can split it up as 50 pages first thing in the morning and 50 pages last thing before sleep. If you are reading non-fiction I wouldn't recommend the before sleep session. At least in my case reading non-fiction before going to bed makes me lose my sleep. If you are someone who commutes regularly you can also use your commute time for reading. If you are driving obviously don't read (please) but you can switch to an audio book. Personally I do most of my reading in my morning and afternoon commute and right before I go to bed. Doing this regularly helps me go through a decent quantity of reading. I also always recommend chosing books you actually enjoy reading. There is a time and place to read tougher books but if you are after quantity of pages picking a tough book is just not going to help. It's a smart strategy to pick a book you enjoy, go through 300 pages in 3 days and prove to yourself that this can be done. I write about books and recommend them, if you find what you read useful, there is more at Therapy With Books. ",
