            "answer_text": "Ideally move to a place more conducive. I know, you would have already thought about it but still stating the obvious. You can play the game of Focus or Concentration. We all hear growing up from our parents and teachers to concentrate. We ourselves others in our families to focus or concentrate at times. We ourselves are aware that focus and concentration are critical. But the best part is No one was taught how to concentrate. I picked this up from one of the YouTube videos as I completely agree with that statement. So the way to learn this art is fix a defined amount of time and stick to doing a task for that duration without getting distracted. Time could be as small as 1 min and can be increased later. Important point is, be considerate and forgive yourself if you loose concentration or get distracted until you get good at it. This is a game which will transform your life in many different ways, and btw might be able to even get you to read in a chaotic backdrop. Happy reading! ",

Reading a good book is to be in a different world to explore that explains what's that which is beyond all of these what you consider as chaotic and dooming. You laugh, you fantasize, you become scared, you ponder and sometimes you cry with each turn of the pages. Books give you fascination. A good book is the best thing to escape from the world we live. Now, coming to the focus aspect, focussing do need some efforts. It just doesn't come to you on your will. You put some works to focus, once, you get habituated, it becomes easy to focus. Your focus is carried away because you are giving too much of importance to the events happening around you. Just stop giving damn to unnecessary things around you. You first have to give priority to reading, you have to realise its importance in your life, then only you can focus in better way. Start from something mild reading, then go for higher standard books. So, jump into reading now. Go for it :) ",
