            "answer_text": "Great question! In short, Globalization is the free movement of goods, services and people across the world in a seamless and integrated manner. In other words, when countries that were hitherto closed to trade and foreign investment open up their economies and go global, the result is an increasing interconnectedness and integration of the economies of the world. The importance of this economic phenomenon can\u2019t be stressed enough; arguably the most significant contributor to increasing a country\u2019s GDP (standard of living) is foreign direct investment - that is, foreign companies who invest in your country. A modern example of this is American company\u2019s outsourcing labour to Mexico and China because labour costs are cheaper in these areas. This not only benefits the foreign companies (in this case, American companies like Apple) but also helps the countries being invested in by increasing their exports, creating jobs, closing the technology gap, and overall, improving quality of life. When assessing the importance of Globalization, it\u2019s good to look back to where it originated; Extent of the Silk Road and Spice trade routes blocked by the Ottoman Empire in 1453 spurred exploration and saw rise to international trade.  Diagram of the 15th century silk road Trade on the Silk Road played a significant role in the development of South-Asian countries. Though silk was certainly the major trade item exported from China, many other goods were traded, and religions, syncretic philosophies, and various technologies. Diseases, most notably plague, also spread along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road was a route for cultural trade among the civilizations along its network. Today, we as a global society, benefit from Globalization not only in economic means, but in social, cultural, political, and environmental circumstances. Without globalization, it would be very difficult for refugees to flee war-torn countries like modern day Syria and Yemen. Furthermore, we wouldn\u2019t see as much cultural diversification as we do today without international trade. A large reason why people from all around the world are able to gather in large cities in developed nations is due to Globalization. Without international trade, we would lack the physical and capital requirements to grow large cities that are abundant with skyscrapers that employ thousands of people who deal with international relations etc etc. I could go on about this forever! Basically, when we talk about Globalization, we aren\u2019t just talking about the trade of goods and exchange of capital, we must realize the various social and cultural opportunities that have been realized with international trade.

            "answer_text": "The true globalization, which enables peaceful coexistence between diverse cultures, has removed all trade barriers and enabled free movement of labor is great, and worrying at same time. Let me explain the reason why. Pros of True Globalization More competitive market motivate businesses to be more competitive, so therefore they decrease the prices, and/or improve the quality of products.Free movement of labor enables one, united global economy, enabling workers from country A to work in country B without lincenses (not applied to jobs like civil servant, lawyers) Yay! Now we can work in [insert country here]! As the world becomes more connected, rogue nations are much more unlikely to happen (e.g. North Korea) due to powerful economic ties with adversaries. No nuclear armadeggon! Wars are much more senseless now, so therefore less wars. When the world is connected, invading makes zero sense when you can still profit from reduced prices on imports. No need to blow them up. In fact, don't do it. It's a net loss. Powerful, united economy can reduce unnecessary nationalism and make our species work together for common goals, such as climate change, space exploration, and counter terrorism. We need to do something about this\u2026. More tourism (due to reduction of travel restrictions)More charity (instead of dumping money on modernizing our nuclear arsenal and buying new stealth jets, we can donate to poorer countries suffering from AIDS, famine, and polluted water. Help them. More demand on international organization employees.Need to work on global currency, like much larger version of the Euro Zone, employ financial experts.More funding for social welfare, disease research, and the space program due to less funding on defense budget.Cons of True Globalization Destruction (or weakening) of national values.Destruction of minority language and cultures (the top 50 survives, but rest dies off).Less demand for soldiers and weapons will reduce arms manufacturing sector. No more cool bombers? Awwwhh\u2026 :( Too much competition can wreck moderate to small sized business and install entrepreneurs to invest on already existing business, rather then new ones.Some countries could be totally or at least, severely be depopulated due to less travel restrictions, cheaper airplane tickets, and easier asylum seeking.Need to learn at least two languages if you don't primarily speak English. Not the greatest future if you are not an English speaker, or not a bilingual. You can choose your own side on this, but I am in favor of globalization. ",
