            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a LOT harder (but in some ways easier) than I ever thought it would be. Just writing a book takes hundreds of hours. Editing takes as much time. Then there are all the other things you (or your publisher) must do: ISBN numbers, bar codes, cover design, marketing, distribution, author events\u2026and more. My suggestion is to write a book because you always wanted to write a book or to enhance your career (kind of a large business card). In a two way tie for a new job, if you\u2019re the one who has written a book about an area of expertise you have that applies to the job, you will likely be chosen. The other perk of writing a book is that everyone suddenly thinks you\u2019re smarter than they did before. If you want to purchase my most recent book, go to Amazon and look up A Plan for Life, The 21st Century Guide to Success in Wealth, Health, Career, Education, Place, Love\u2026and You! ",

            "answer_text": "Writing a book, like any large, ambitious endeavor, is really hard. It is in fact daunting, so much so that many people dream of writing a book and never get around to it. But, what if you break down \u201cwrite a book\u201d (or any other large, ambitious endeavor) into much smaller steps? Such as, write one page a day for one year. Or, write for an hour a day for one year. Or even, write for 30 minutes a day. Then what seemed impossible becomes quite manageable. In case you didn\u2019t catch all the hints I scattered in this answer, this \u201cbreak it down in small steps\u201d applies to anything you find daunting. Big steps are how people become overwhelmed and end up doing nothing. Small steps are how things get done. ",
