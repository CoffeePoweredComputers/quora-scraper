            "answer_text": "The cash book is divided in two sides. The left side of the cash book is Debit side and right side of cash book is Credit side. In double column cash book, two columns are made viz, Cash column and Bank column. If the transaction is related with cash, the amount is entered in cash column and if it is related with bank, the amount is entered in bank column. Coming to your question, record a transaction in double coloumn cash book if cheque issued is dishonoured. Cheque issued means the payment is made by the business and later on it is dishonoured means the payment couldn't be made and hence creditor is still our liability. The journal entry for Cheque issued : Creditor's a/c\u2026\u2026\u2026dr To bank a/c Creditor is our liability (having credit balance) but now when payment is made, creditor's a/c is debited because it is no more our liability. And moreover, creditor is personal a/c and receiver so Debited Bank is personal a/c and giver so Credited In case of dishonoured cheque, we will just reverse the above journal entry. Bank a/c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026dr To Creditor's a/c We Credited Bank a/c in first journal entry as payment was being made but now it dishonoured so bank a/c is Debited as no payment is made. Creditor is still our liability as cheque dishonoured so Credited  Thanks for A2A Hope this clears your query. ",
