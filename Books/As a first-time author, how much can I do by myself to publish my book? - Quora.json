            "answer_text": "You can and should do it all. You can do everything by yourself, or at least without having to pay for help. Help in this business is expensive. It will cost you more than 99% of new authors will make in their entire writing career. I\u2019m sure others will tell you different in their answers. There are editors for hire and they will ask if you don\u2019t want to be in that top 1%. They will tell you they can put you there. There are graphic artists for hire who will tell you it\u2019s the cover that sells books and they can put you in that top 1%. There are marketers for hire who will tell you they can guarantee you enough sales to put you in the top 1% using all the marketing tricks they know. Your book will need editing for content: plot development, character development and more. It will need proofing for style and mistakes in spelling and grammar. It will need cover art that grabs attention. It will need an aggressive marketing campaign consuming as many person-hours as it did to write the book. It will need a self-publishing platform \u2014 hopefully a company that will help you over all the technical and content vetting hurdles that you will encounter on the way to getting your book published for sale. Ideally this company will also work hard to help you sell your books and they should not charge you a penny for all this. They will take a small cut out of the sales price of each book, something like 30%. You get the rest. To accomplish these things by yourself, I suggest you visit Smashwords first. Google them. They publish Ebooks and sell them on the Web. No you don\u2019t have to publish with them. You might decide to go Amazon exclusively. I\u2019m a Smashwords author but also publish my books separately on Amazon. There are certain incentives for an author to publish on Amazon exclusively so do your research before deciding. The reason I\u2019m sending you to Smashwords first is the sooner you read Mark Coker\u2019s book, Smashwords Style Guidelines the less time you will waste trying to get your Ebook formatted properly for conversion from MS Word format to something your readers can download to their Ebook reader, tablet, or computer. It\u2019s free and you can download it from Smashwords in any Ebook format, including Kindle. It will tell you most of the things those expensive editor people want you to pay them to tell you. Free. I read two other fine and helpful books by Mark Coker - The Secrets to Ebook Publishing Success and Book Marketing Guide these two books will tell you most of the things those expensive book marketing people will want you to pay them to tell you. Free. Mostly the same things. Really. As for Cover Art, Mark Coker offers you a list of graphic artists who do good cover art cheap. Or you can do what I mostly do. Surf the Web looking for public domain art which has the feel of the content of your book. I don\u2019t believe in paying for cover art because I disagree with the notion that covers are what attract people to books in the first place. No, most readers browse for books in Amazon by putting the names of authors they like into the search box. If you want to do your own cover, using public domain art if your not an artist, Smashwords and Amazon provide you with tools to upload your cover image. There\u2019s just one more thing and it\u2019s big. You do need someone else to look at your book and tell you as much as possible about what\u2019s wrong with it. It doesn\u2019t need to be a professional editor though. I know a friend who paid a good editor (they can be very good) $3,000 to edit his book. At the rate his book sales are dribbling in, he will have to live to be 150 years old before he makes back his $3,000 and I thought his rough draft was very good. I recommend you make friends online with other authors. Find someone whose writing you think is brilliant and who feels the same about yours. Forge an alliance to edit each other\u2019s books. This is what I\u2019ve been doing and I think my editor/author friend is as good as any in the business. And she\u2019s free, not counting my sweat equity which is really a pleasure \u2014 editing her work. ",

            "answer_text": "If your goal is to get professionally published, you could do everything yourself without a publisher. But keep in mind that a good quality book will require an editor and and good cover artist. This could get quite costly. Even veteran authors cannot do everything themselves because we as humans always miss things when we do everything ourselves. Regardless if you are traditionally publishing or not, do not submit your first draft to a publisher or writing professional. Revise your story the best way you could before submitting. I suggest you learn a little about how publishing works before trying to publish. I like to read about publishing and found the following sites useful: Jane Friedman | Writing and Publishing in the Digital Age Welcome To The Creative Penn Write Better, Get Published, Be Creative | WritersDigest.com things you may be able to do yourself(Self publishing): Formattingcover design(only recommended if you have graphic design experience and are willing to learn what\u2019s appropriate to put on a book cover)Finding a literary agent(not mandatory)building an author\u2019s platform(your future audience)creating your author websitePre-editingFinal proofread(this should take place after all your editors look through your book.)book marketingcopyrightThings you need to hire a professional to do(self publishing): Editing(there are three main stages: developmental, copyediting, proofreading)book cover designThings you could do yourself(traditional publishing): building an author\u2019s platformpre-editing(revise your book the best you can)book marketingfinding a literary agent(this is not mandatory)making a websiteIn traditional publishing, publishers cover all costs of publication. This includes editors, cover designers, formattors, etc. Therefore, you do not have to pay for editing if you are traditionally publishing. I still recommend revising your manuscript to the best you can yourself before sending it to a professional worker or a publishers. These people prefer to work on better quality writing since bad writing is more expensive to edit. ",

No matter how good a writer you are, you need an editor.) The process of producing the eBook is relatively straightforward if you have the right tools. I pour the book into Indesign for eBook export, then use the free program Calibre to make a Kindle and an ePub file, but there are other ways to do it as well. Amazon's KDP web site has a tool that will make a Kindle file directly from a Word file, and you can use Calibre to make an ePub from that. The important bit is marketing. You can't just throw a file up on Amazon or Smashwords and expect it to sell. You need a platform from which to promote it. If you have a blog, link to it there. Got a good social media presence? Talk about the book from that. Do you do podcasts? That's a great vehicle for promoting the book. ",

You can completely format your book with LibreOffice so that you've got both a physical book and an ebook.  You can create your front, spine, and back cover in any one of a number of graphics packages.  You can upload your finished work to Holy Trinity of Indie Publishing: Kindle Direct Publishing, Smashwords, and Createspace. It's really simple.  If you've got any questions, please feel free to ask me; I help get authors published every day! To correct some misconceptions:  It is not \u2018impossible\u2019 to edit your own writing.  Many authors - including notables like Mark Twain - have done just fine without editors.DO NOT use Calibre to create an Amazon-format eBook.  Amazon rejects eBooks created with Calibre.  Use Kindlegen to create an Amazon-format eBook from an existing ePub file.DO NOT create ANY eBook file from Word.  Word files are notorious for containing all kinds of extraneous and unnecessary formatting that even Word can misinterpret.  It's known as \"Word bloat.\"NEVER EVER create an eBook from Word if you plan on selling it.  Amazon and other eRetailers charge YOU based on the file size of your eBook.  I have personally seen a Word document that created a 23MB eBook.  After striping away all the extra formatting (font definitions, spans, bolds, italics, etc) the entire file size was reduced to 965KB.NEVER EVER create an ePub from an Amazon format eBook if you plan on selling it.  The proper workflow is to create the ePub FIRST and generate the Amazon format from it.  There are many tools for editing and proofing an ePub.  There aren\u2019t any for editing or proofing an Amazon format eBook.Amazon DOES NOT have any \u2018software\u2019 that will clean up your manuscript file.Barnes & Noble DOES NOT have any \u2018software\u2019 that will clean up your manuscript file.Google DOES NOT have any \u2018software\u2019 that will clean up your manuscript file.You absolutely, positively CAN amend or change a print edition book exactly as easily as you can change an eBook; you make your changes, recompile, and upload the file.Please, Quoranians: if you do not know an answer, do not post a guess!

Unless you a big budget, I would do everything I could by myself or with the aid of non paid help. Since I don\u2019t know what your format is or your situation, I\u2019ll give you a brief glimpse of the Amazon/Kindle method, I am familiar with some of their workings. Do you have a complete manuscript? if so go ahead and begin to edit, a little everyday, this is where the non paid but good help comes in handy. Take a break from the edit process, maybe a couple of days, I\u2019m always amazed at what I find when I disengage myself from the writing for a moment edit wise. While you\u2019re on edit break start thinking about marketing and also think about a good plug for your book. Alright hopefully the edit is done, and you\u2019re happy with it, are you to format it to fit an e-book? That requires skills beyond me, I go to Nick Caya at Word 2 Kindle, $49.00 and a few days later  my documents are formatted to MOBI and EPUB, Kindle uses MOBI. Go to Kindle Direct Publishing do the register thing and follow the prompts, do you remember the plug for your book? This is where it comes in handy, it\u2019s like your back cover, did you bring a cover? if not Kindle has some, they aren\u2019t great but they\u2019ll do. When you come out of cover, go ahead and preview your book, this is how it will look through a device. Pick your price if you're following the prompts then you should be pretty clear, now you\u2019ve reached the end, your e-book should be on the market tomorrow at some time. Pretty easy huh? now here\u2019s the reason I brought you on this route, do you see where it says paperback, well that\u2019s you, Don\u2019t you think you should get a paperback  print on demand out of this? same thing, follow the prompts, when this is said and over you will have an e-book and a corresponding paperback for the cost of formatting. I don\u2019t know of another place where you can do that. It really is that simple, there\u2019s some details in there, but if my dumbass can do it you can too. I can assure you I know less about digital technology than most. The fun part is trying to get people to become aware of an unknown author floating in the Kindle Sea with so many others. Anyway Good Luck! Robert ",

You have not clarified if you intend to self publish your book or submit your book to a traditional press in hopes they accept you for publication. The distinction is significant. How much you can do will depend on your chosen direction, your current skill set, and as mentioned by others, how much time you have to learn enough to see your book through to publication and distribution. During the 25 years I published books I never assumed what the author\u2019s intentions might be when they walked into my office. Sometimes they only wanted a cover design, sometimes just the interior of the book, sometimes only editing, and most times a little of each. I suggest you determine if you are self-publishing or submitting to a conventional press. Decide also if you want a printed book or if a digital publication will satisfy your needs. Until you make these decisions, most answers will only provide vague inferences which may not apply to your circumstances. I hope this was helpful. ",

Then comes printing and print finishing and believe it or not, you can even do this yourself, with a good quality printer and desktop perfect binder. The one thing you should never do is hand it over to any company that advertises that they will publish or self-publish your book. Instead, if the above sounds too much, get out the phone book and go talk to your local printer. Believe it or not, most even small printers are quite capable of producing a book. ",
