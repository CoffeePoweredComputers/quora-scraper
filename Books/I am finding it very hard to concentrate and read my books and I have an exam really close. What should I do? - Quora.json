            "answer_text": "Same thing happens to me also, especially when exams are closer. I don't feel like studying. Usually, people starts experiencing insomnia during exams, but it's exactly opposite with me, I start experiencing something called nacrolepsy during exams. As if I've completed everything for exams.  Main reason could be anxiety just before exams. Now, the question is, \u201chow to overcome this\"? Humans are greedy. Start applying this for your studies also. Before you sit down to study, make targets, as, what topics you're going to cover today. Now, start studying and promise yourself that when you cover that targeted topic, then you are going to give yourself something as a reward. Don't stop before completing you targeted topic. Here, this reward becomes your greed. When you think of this reward then you'll become more committed towards your target.  I keep my reward as reading answer on Quora. If I complete my given target, then, I can go online and can read answers on Quora. Just for 15 minutes and not more than that. And also, the best time to concentrate on studies is the early morning. So, just overcome your dysania and start studying.  Try this and tell me if it works or not. Thank you. ~KY. ",
