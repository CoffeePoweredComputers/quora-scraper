            "answer_text": "Not normally because the caliber of the bullet may be the same but the brass case will be totally different not allowing it to chamber into their weapon. For example 7.62x39 is a Soviet Era cartridge with a length of 39mm The US and Nato use a 7.62x51 which is 51mm long. They are in no way interchangeable. There are a few calibers that can be substituted for others but not many and not military. Some have claimed that during the cold war the Soviets used a machine gun caliber that was slightly larger than the Nato equivalent so that the NATO rounds could be used in a pinch. Despite the similar bullet diameters, the dimensional differences between the two cartridges would prevent either being correctly chambered in a firearm designed for the other. ",
