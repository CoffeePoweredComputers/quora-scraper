            "answer_text": "There is a common confusion inherent in this question. You automatically, by law, have the copyright and the Amazon terms and conditions do not say you are giving that to them. And, to be honest, they are likely not interested in those. Most cases where actual copyright is signed over it is because the publisher wants to carry on using the things you created after you stop (especially after you die) and Amazon has no interest in commissioning books by other authors that include stuff you might have created. It used to be (not sure if it still is) a common feature of comic publisher contracts. This is how we can have stories about Batman and Superman even after their original creators died - the original creators signed over that copyright. Most publishers don\u2019t bother because they would generally need to pay a lot more for the privilege (you should never sell copyright cheap) and they are likely to never use it, especially if they can keep you writing about it if it becomes popular and maybe negotiate with your heirs for the copyright if they need to later\u2026 but this would be a rare thing. However, what you do give to Amazon (by the contract you sign) are what are known as \u2018publication rights\u2019 which are, as the name says, the right to act as the publisher of that work. Depending on how the contract is written, you sell a publisher the rights to different regions and types of publication. For example: - US, EU, English speaking, worldwide etc. Publishers who have international distribution are more likely to want bigger chunks of the world but some would prefer it if another, more local, publisher managed it. Amazon (I recall) asks for worldwide because online sales and POD models of printing are easier to distribute globally than the whole \u2018print a big run of books, pack \u2019em in a crate and put on a plane\u2019 model of distribution. - Ebook/Audio book/Graphic novel - different formats of publishing the same work. - Film/TV and merchandising rights. One of my publisher contracts specifically told me I retained the right to make cuddly toys of my characters. This amused me. Amazon does not bother with these so they are yours to do with as you wish. With trad publishers, the difference here is whether, when a film/TV production company or a toy manufacturer wants to make something based on your work, they have to negotiate with and pay you or your publisher for the option to do so. Rights should have an expiration clause in them (used to be a \u2018time after last printing date\u2019 but more recently it has become a straight time limit). Essentially a time at which the author can request the publisher for the rights to be returned to them. The time after printing thing was because it was generally considered if a publisher had stopped ordering print runs it meant they had lost interest in using the rights (because sales had dropped, for example) and so no longer wished to use them. Ebooks never go out of print so cannot use this. So, to summarise, you don\u2019t sell the copyright to Amazon, you sell the publication rights. ",

            "answer_text": "You own the copyright on anything you create, unless you did it as an employee of a company under a work made for hire agreement. When you upload to Amazon (Nook, iBooks, Kobo, Ingram Spark, Lulu) for the purpose of self-publishing you set up an account in which you give them permission to display your book, show a percentage of it for free and then offer it for sale in return for giving you a royalty off each sale. You can terminate that offering at any time. You have not assigned or parted with copyrights, you have granted Amazon a license or permission to offer it to the public. With Kindle Unlimited that license or permission is locked into a 90 day exclusive agreement. Without Kindle Unlimited or with Print books it is non-exclusive and you are free to publish it elsewhere like Draft2Digital, smashwords or Nook Books. ",
