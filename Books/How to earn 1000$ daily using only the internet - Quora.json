            "answer_text": "Going for 1000 Dollars a day is quite a high-class goal if you\u2019re completely new to the internet and making money on it but still possible to achieve. You have different possibilities to start earning on the internet here are some: Join a system where you can become an affiliate.As an affiliate you would mainly resell and promote a company\u2019s products or services. In exchange you would then get a commission for each and every sale you made. In my eyes one of the best models to start.Join a system where you can become an investor.As an investor on such a system you would then invest a certain amount of money into the system and get daily,weekly or monthly interests back to your account.In my eyes one of the more risky options to choose because of the knowhow of a starter on the internet but still an option.Join a system where you can become a distributor.As a distributor, you would then collaborate with the platform and working out strategies to sell their product or service in a better way. In my eyes really close to the affiliate system because it would also be based on commissions per sale.Join a system or platform where you can offer your own products or services.As a seller you would only use a storefront of a platform to offer your products or services online.These are mainly the chances you have to start earning online. Now it\u2019s on you to decide in which niche you want to go in and start. I\u2019ve knowhow in the first two possibilities, so if I can help you any further let me know. Just have a look at my profile and you will find the way to my page. Best, Mirco ps: Hit me with an up-vote if you like my answer on this, thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you are #1 result in Google for the majority of search queries you will receive about 33% of the traffic for those queries. Assuming each query has 1,000 searches per month, you will receive 330 visitors per month per search query. Let\u2019s assume you have 10 search queries for which you are #1 in Google search, that means 3300 visitors per month. I will use 1% CTR for your Google Adsense ads that you put on the pages people are landing through Google search using the 10 search queries, that means you will get 33 clicks per month. Assuming each click has $1 value, you will make $33 dollars per month with this setup. You need 909 times more of that to make you 1,000 dollars a day. Could be 909 x more search queries for which you rank #1 in Google, 909 x more searches for the queries per month, 909 x more dollars per click OR a combination of these to get you there. Adsense could be one of the revenue streams. Multiple revenue streams + more queries for #1 in Google = more money. ",

In my opinion, instead of focusing on the money, we should focus on builing something that will be rewarding and fulfilling for us in the long-term. With regards to using the internet to build that something, you can consider blogging and using social media to establish your brand. After that, you can start building your business around your personal brand. You can also consider selling phsical products online. Hope this helps. :) ",
