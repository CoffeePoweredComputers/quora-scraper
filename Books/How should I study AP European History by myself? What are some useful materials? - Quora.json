Do you mean that you are studying after calls by yourself, or that you want to study AP European History on your own, without a teacher, outside of a school curriculum? If you mean study coursework by yourself, that\u2019s basically what most history entails. Studying means reading the material, then reviewing the important points until you understand the material enough to write effectively on exams. It also involves researching historical texts in order to write papers assigned to you by your teacher. That work by necessity is a solo endeavor. Historians overwhelming work alone, because everyone is doing their own research. If you mean how do you learn AP European History outside of a classroom, that\u2019s relatively easy. Get the curriculum and simply do the required reading . ",

            "answer_text": "Theoretically, you could self-study any AP course. The question is if it's personally worth it. Are you trying to get a gen-ed history course out of the way, perhaps? Maybe you just really like European history. Or perhaps you're just trying to rack up AP tests. Regardless, with a little diligence and a little purpose, you are more than able to self-study AP Euro. It's definitely an engaging course. ",
