            "answer_text": "I believe I have read every book, though not every short story, written by Robert A. Heinlein. Doing so impacted my life by showing me that my father was right in most of the wisdom he imparted to me as I grew up. Many times, I\u2019ve noted that Heinlein and my father shared similar attitudes, nearly identical philosophies, and clearly were of the same generation when it came to mores. I am grateful to both of these wise men for the things they have taught me, the truths they brought to my attention, and the basic simplicity of their belief. Through their teachings I learned that if a society is to succeed, it must eschew the foolishness and sophistry of organized religion because the damage it can and does cause is one of the main detriments to progress and progression of society.

            "answer_text": "I've not read every book written by John Steinbeck ( but well on my way). I believe I've read maybe thirteen of his books. His character development was near perfection and he told complex stories in a very accessible way. From his most famous works to his most obscure, the writing was brilliant. While I don't try to emulate his writing - no one could, I do try to create characters that are as full, interesting and likeable as his. To paraphrase Jack Nickolson in As Good as it Gets, Steinbeck makes me want to be a better writer. ",
