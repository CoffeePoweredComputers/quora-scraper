            "answer_text": "As the other answers posted here indicate, there\u2019s no simple answer to the question. Shelves and books both vary a lot in width, so if you\u2019re shelving children\u2019s picture books on a long wall you\u2019ll get a really high number while if you\u2019re shelving literature anthologies on a shelf that\u2019s constrained you\u2019ll have a small number. Libraries do have to estimate these things, however, and as a very broad estimate for your average collection a book is generally figured to be just over an inch, so you could fit 11 of these hypothetical books in 1 foot of shelf space. If a library is replacing shelving or expanding and wants to have an estimate of how many items will fit on the new shelving, they would get a count of the books in that collection, figure a reasonable multiplier for width, and get a reasonably good estimate of books per linear feet of shelving. Typical shelving segments in libraries are about 3 feet, so you could fit 33 of these hypothetical books onto one of these shelving segments. That\u2019s probably the simplest answer to the question, although your mileage may vary a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "This question cannot, actually, be answered. How big is the shelf. Is it a narrow bookcase or is it wide and roomy. How large are the books you want to put on the shelf? A group of very slim books will be a larger number than if you were placing very thick/large books on the shelf. Larger books take up more shelf space than slim/narrow books. ",
