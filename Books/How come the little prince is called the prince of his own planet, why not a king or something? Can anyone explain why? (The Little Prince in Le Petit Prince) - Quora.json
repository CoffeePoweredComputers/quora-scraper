            "answer_text": "The novel is full of symbolism. In fairy tales for kids king often represents reason or fully mature man. Therefore titled little prince in his modesty doesn't call himself a king. He knows he has to gain a lot reason to wisely rule over his planet and that he failed once when he let baobabs grow on his planet. And his planet is so small that he fears roots of baobabs can erode planet (baobabs are symbol of sin). Above all he wants to get enough emotional intelligence to improve relation with his beloved friend rose (symbol of feminity in many tales roses symbolize or are associated with women who need to be awaken from spiritual sleep). He doesn't have knowledge to understand his rose nor how to get rid of baobabs so goes into journey to meet the ones who are supposed to enlighten him. ",

            "answer_text": "Because Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote his children's illustrated fantasy for the delight of adult readers, so that they could identify him with their own secret inner child, \u2018The Little Prince' inhabiting alone his own unique little planet world, not the giant crowded spheres of Kings and Queens and other regal adults. The story was published in 1943, (the year I was born), and I have my own hard back copy, which I've treasured for years. ",
