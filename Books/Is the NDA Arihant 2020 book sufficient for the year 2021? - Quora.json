            "answer_text": "By Arihant Book you mean Pathfinder. If you are a PCM student then for GAT section it is enough. Coming to maths I would suggest you should go for ncert and RS Aggarwal as Pathfinder has only summary of chapters and does not give in-depth knowledge. And if you are complying ncert than it will help you in boards also. Practice paper of Arihant are good and also get a book for previous year questions. ",
