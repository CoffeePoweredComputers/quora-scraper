If you want to test how complete or accurate your textbook is in order to judge its quality, you could try comparing it to other sources on the same subject to see if other sources give the same information or provide more detail. Pick a section of the book that particularly interests you and compare that section to part of another book that covers the same topic. See if they agree with each other. If there are points where they are different, look at a third book to see what it says. ",
