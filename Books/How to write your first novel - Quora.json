            "answer_text": "If you are considering your first novel, you probably have a character in mind: a man, a woman, a group of people. You can\u2019t just start writing. You will get a story, but it won\u2019t make sense and you won\u2019t know where you are headed. Perhaps you have profession or situation in mind: he\u2019s a spy, he\u2019s rich, he\u2019s poor, she\u2019s famous, she is lonely, etc. You have to have a dramatic premise. This is NOT the plot; it\u2019s the basic idea. Such as: A man finds a suitcase full of money and he isn\u2019t sure whether he should keep it or turn it in. Once you start writing, if you are paying attention, the little skills you need will make themselves known: how do I introduce a character. How much explaining does a character need? How do I mix action and dialog? As these questions arise, you can look up books on the subject. The process of writing the novel will lead you to what you need to know. ",

            "answer_text": "Know your craft and the tools that are available to you: Spelling, Grammar, Style. Learn the difference between word definition and word usage. Understand that whatever you write, even if it is fiction, that to make it as realistic as possible, which means that you will have to learn how to research. Part and parcel of learning the craft, is to learn how to construct and format any manner of book. Many novice writers are lead to believe that you turn on a word processor and just typing out some idea. Not true, in any way. Writing a book freestyle or cold, rarely gives you a superior book, and there is great difficulty in writing literature when approached in that manner. Be passionate regarding your writing and what you write, and NEVER write out of the desire for money. If you write because you want to be rich and famous you will reach a point where you will not be able to write anything. To be a writer you have to have something to say, and the idea is to have more things to say than one lifetime would accommodate. ",
