            "answer_text": "For the most part, I would say yes. As part of NYC, anything can happen, but as far as the 5 borough\u2019s? I think Staten Island is probably the safest. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some seedy places here, and I\u2019m sure (like anywhere else), that if you\u2019re walking through one of those places at 3 am something bad could happen. I think what saved SI from a lot of what problems the other boroughs have is the fact we don\u2019t have the subway coming thru here. And unlike the other boros, there\u2019s more of a suburban feel here than the rest. It\u2019s still NYC though, so a little street smarts and common sense is still a benefit if you catch my drift.

            "answer_text": "There are MANY places to live on Staten Island safely! The added bonus is there are still numerous green spaces, parks, woods to explore, hike, etc\u2026 over the years I've lived here (47 years in the house my Grandfather built!) there has been more development,more cars & more stores; but still a safe environment on the whole. I was born in Manhattan & LOVED living there! My parents decided to move to Staten Island. It's not sophisticated like Manhattan, but you can always hop in your car, or take an express bus & be there in a flash. There are very few neighborboods I wouldn't live in on S.I. . ",
