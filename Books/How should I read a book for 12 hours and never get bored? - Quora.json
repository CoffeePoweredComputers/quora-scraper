            "answer_text": "Before the how \u2026 Why? I\u2019ve often read for more than 12 hours at a stretch \u2026 because I\u2019m so engrossed in what I\u2019m reading. It just happens. I don\u2019t plan it, I don\u2019t decide it is something that needs doing. So \u2026 why do you feel the need? If you get bored \u2026 stop. do something else. Why persevere at something that is no longer fun? Take a walk, visit a friend, watch TV, whatever \u2026 When you WANT to carry on reading, sure \u2026 come on back. Note, you never said anything about studying \u2026 but even here \u2026 studying for 12 hours at a stretch is NOT conducive to understanding or memory \u2026 you need breaks. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a voracious reader and have been since I first learned how to read. As an adult (for over half a century now), I can generally read for two hours at a time without becoming bored unless I actively dislike the material I\u2019m reading from the onset. However, to read for prolonged periods of time (such as 8 or more hours), I have to meet three criteria: The book has to seize my interest to the extent that I almost go into a trance as I read it, I must avoid external distractions (such as my telephone, loud music, and bright light as much as possible, and I need to have easy access to water, food, and a restroom close by so that I don\u2019t break my near trance while meeting my body\u2019s needs. Other people I know who can read for long stretches of time in one session have similar reading habits, but I have no way of knowing how representative of marathon readers we are. ",
