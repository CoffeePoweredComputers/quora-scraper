            "answer_text": "First it should be clear that one has everything needed to take care of their immediate needs; housing, transportation, food, clothing, bills, ect. Second, they should payoff their debts, build up an emergency fund of 3\u20136 months worth of expenses. Once this process is taken care of one can start the process of investing and do it comfortably. There are many ways to start investing, one that I would adhere to is to invest slowly. I would start by saving a thousand dollars to invest and find a company that is of interest to me. I would start by buying a few shares in that company and try to by a few shares throughout the year. One could buy shares monthly, quarterly or annually; whichever suits the needs of the investor. Once a sizable position is made, then one can begin the process of prospecting another company to invest in and follow the same strategy. Do this over the course of a few years and the portfolio will begin to grow, both in terms of value and in terms of the number of shares that are owned. Invest in 10 to 20 stocks and manage it well; then you\u2019re on your way to having a sizable portfolio over time. Buy and hold is a great strategy to use, over the long term stocks go up in value and there is no reason to sell stocks in great companies; as they will continue to perform, kind of like a fine wine that gets better with age. Feel free to read Dave Ramsey\u2019s total money make over to get you in a financial position to be able to invest. Also, look into The Motley Fool, they have a plethora of resources to point you into the right direction when it comes to investing. They even have a subscription model for $99 a year that you can subscribe to to get investment ideas. That $99 dollars is cheap compared to what you can gain and if it\u2019s not for you then you can cancel. Investing is all about discipline, if you have money, time and discipline; you can fair really well. Thanks for the question, hope this helps. ",
