            "answer_text": "Is the Bible just a good book? The Bible is God\u2019s story to us about how He loves us and has a plan for us, each and everyone of us. If you read the Bible knowing that God loves you and accepting that He loves you, then you begin to touch God and He will touch you. Yes, there are sad, bad and glad stories in the Bible. The Bible starts out speaking on how God wanted a family and He created man to walk in the garden with Him in the cool of the day. He made Eve so Adam would not be alone. He kept them from the Tree of Life after their sin so that they would not be in eternal damnation. He sent Jesus to die on the cross for our sins. Yes, we are all sinners. Read the book of Romans. God made a way through His son, Jesus Christ, to save us from our sins and to spend eternity with Him. There is so much to try to understand and we cannot understand it all at once. It takes a lifetime. I met Him when I was six. I realized I was a sinner. I needed God. I sought Him, not religion. I asked His forgiveness. He forgave me instantly just as He promised. This is basically what I heard when I was six and these are the verses that led me to salvation in Christ Jesus and eternal life. John 3:16 16 For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. Romans 3:9-13, and verse 23 9 That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;10 For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation.11 For the Scripture says, \"Everyone who believes on Him shall not be put to shame.''12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and 1crich to all who call upon Him;13 For \"whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.''23 For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God\u2019s glorious standard. Romans 5:8 8 But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 10:9-11 and verse 13 9 If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. 11 As the Scriptures tell us, Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced. 13 For Everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved. \u009d This is true for anyone. I have known many people to come to faith in Christ by hearing and reading these verses and believing God for what they say. When one does this, they have a relationship with Jesus Christ, the creator of the universe. In Genesis 1, it says that, well, here, I copied it also. In Genesis 1:26 it says, 26 Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. God said, Let Us. This is key. God is one, with three personalities. The Father, in heaven, the Son, who came to earth, and then returned, and sent the Life-giving Spirit on the day of Pentecost. The three are one. This too is accepted by faith. Not unlike accepting that when one works an algebraic or some other type of math problem that certain things are. They are not always understandable, especially at first. Praying and hoping that those who read this response begin a walk with God, through the power of the Father, through the victorious power of the Lord Jesus Christ, overcoming death, hell, sin, and giving us life in Him, through the power of the Holy Spirit who resides in us and we in Him for eternity. Read the Bible. It is life to the spirit and the soul. God loves each and everyone of us as though we were the only one who was a sinner and needed a Savior. Yes, the Bible is a good book, even a great book because we have a great good who wrote a good book so we could have a relationship with Him. He used sinners in these stories so we could see that He loved us just as much as He loved them. One can see that especially in the stories of David and in the things that Jesus said and did in the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and many other places of the Bible, the Good Book.

            "answer_text": "The Bible is a great book, on a number of levels. Since it was likely written by many authors it merges a number of perspectives and themes. It provides insight into beliefs and rituals that span thousands of years. Yet, even with the apparent discontinuity in the stories, there are ideas that stand out as binding forces throughout. The \u201cold testament\u201d and the \u201cnew testament\u201d are radically different, yet both are fascinating literary works. My focus has been on the \u201cold testament\u2019 - the Hebrew Bible - but the \u201cnew testament\u201d is interesting as well (particularly John). Every aspect of literary analysis can be applied to find new levels of meaning in each book. Whether one is looking at plot construction or Hebrew or Greek grammar, there is no end to the intricate patterns and their implications. Of course, the Bible is not only a literary work, but a work which holds meaning for life. You may agree or disagree with the lessons, but they are there to contemplate. The ethical teachings in the Hebrew Bible alone provide the source material for human interaction around the world. The Hebrew Bible teaches lessons through the real actions of people, uncensored. It doesn\u2019t always hit you in the face with the statements \u201cdo this\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t do that.\u201d It leaves it up to the reader to determine the implications for their lives. The book of Samuel (I and II) tells the story of David, the good and the bad. It reveals how he might have been a great warrior, but it also reveals how terrible he was with his family - and the implications of that. Even the Creation storie(s) in Bereishit (Genesis) are complex. As simple an idea as \u201cman\u2019s dominion over the earth\u201d has many layers and interpretations. While the Bible might give us insights into God, or a supernatural creator, it can be interpreted in many ways. God, as the authors might have envisioned him, or God as an idea impacting the actions of the people thousands of years ago. In my mind, there is no richer piece of art, or greater manual for life, than the Bible. Whether it came from, or was inspired by God is completely irrelevant for me. ",
