            "answer_text": "In the past, most Stephen King film adaptations have disappointed me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved The Mist and The Green Mile but film as a medium can never hope to do justice to the brand of storytelling that Mr. King brings to the table. The Shining works well as a Stanley Kubric vehicle but it deviates greatly from the finer parts of the book; the character of Jack Torrance is completely dehumanized and his uphill battle with alcoholism is significantly downplayed. This is my own analysis and I am sure a lot of King\u2019s constant readers will disagree with me. The previous paragraph was a lame attempt at justifying why I did not watch IT. The novel happens to be one of my favourite King books. It delves into childhood fears and its repercussions, has brilliant Lovecroftian undertones and like most King books, is based in Maine which happens to be familiar ground for ardent King readers. I heard the movie got good reviews and Pennywise finally got his place in pop culture as one of the scariest antagonists ever. I presume that the second part of the film would follow The Loser\u2019s Club\u2019s foray into adulthood and the subsequent return to Derry to end the menace of Pennywise once and for all. Since they could not possibly adapt that thick slab of a book into one movie, the second part ought to follow the novel\u2019s plot, allowing for artistic license, of course. ",
