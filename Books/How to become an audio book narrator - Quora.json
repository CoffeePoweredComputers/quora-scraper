            "answer_text": "Tell me first that you have some acting, voiceover, or narration experience. If you don't, the path to audiobook narration for pay is very long. If you have a modicum of speaking/acting experience, and if you are willing to invest your own money upfront (between a few hundred to a few thousand dollars) to build a modest, but properly sound-treated booth or closet or small room at home and equip it with digital recording equipment--computer, software, a good microphone ($$), etc.\u2014then you will be ready to begin to learn the audiobook narration trade. There are many audiobook producers\u2026from BeeAudio to Dreamscape to Dayan, to Spoken Realms, to ACX (a division of Amazon) and others. In some instances, these companies have their own studios and prefer voice artists to record on site. Quite a few companies, however, rely on home-based voice talent. It is in these home studios where audiobook narrators voice, edit, and engineer their books, or where, at least, they record books and assign the editing and engineering to specialists. The next step is significant, and involves much time and patience, and an appreciation that very little regular income will begin to flow for a few years. You will have to sit in your darkened, small, isolated studio for several hours per day in order to record what is referred to as a \u201cfinished\u201d hour of usable audio. Don't begin to imagine that you will get a book's chapter right the first time. You will expel nose and throat sounds, your stomach may rumble, a helicopter may fly over your house, a neighbor may mow his or her lawn. Sounds not of your liking will interrupt, and you will have to repeat words, sentences, even many paragraphs ruined by some small background irritation. Oh, and I forgot to mention the preparation process. Whether you are assigned a book by contract\u2014a publisher or producer hires you\u2014or you have auditioned for, and won, a book contract, or you have chosen to produce a book on your own from the long list of public domain (PD) books (books published before 1924), you will have to read those books, make a Word or PDF version, mark it up for pronunciations and other mechanical reasons (typos, unclear accents, etc.), and be able to display that book in front of you as you read and monitor your recording software. Once you have mastered the art of preparing an audiobook, narrating an audiobook, editing and engineering an audiobook (which, really, is an important skill to have), you will have to produce several audition samples and put them up on a website proclaiming your skill and availability as an audiobook narrator. That\u2019s only the tip of the marketing needed to get your name known well-enough to attract a client who hears your audition and selects you from a dozen (or a hundred) other narrators. On top of that, you will have to learn the proper pricing of your work. Many audiobook narrators are paid by the \u201cper-finished-hour\u201d (PFH) rates, which means that no matter how much time it takes you to complete an audiobook narration\u2014let\u2019s say 40 hours for a ten-hour audiobook\u2014you will only be paid for the 10 hour finished length of the book. Do the math: if you offer a client $50 per finished hour for a 10-hour book, and you value your own time at $50 per hour, but it takes you 40 hours to actually prep, narrate, edit, and engineer the final product, you may get $500 for the finished book, but your actual cost to produce the book was four times that! Or $2,000. So you lose money if you don\u2019t find a better pricing scheme, and if you aren\u2019t able to speed your work up. Union rates for PFH audiobooks average $200 PFH, so a 10-hour book will give you $2,000 in gross income\u2014but if you can\u2019t get your production time down from 40 hours to something around 30 hours\u2014and even if you double the value of your own time to $100 per working hour\u2014 you\u2019re still not going to make a profit. So learning the pricing game is crucial. And I\u2019m not even go into what you can make if you do a royalty deal\u2026suffice to say, it is not the best overall moneymaker. Ah, but you\u2019re not there yet. The next step is to reach out to audiobook producers and book authors to let them know you are open for business and ready to narrate their next book. The competition is very deep\u2026there are many fine, experienced audiobook narrators out there (I have only 30+ audiobooks on the Audible and other markets, while many of my colleagues have well over 300, and they are quite good at marketing themselves and at producing audiobooks at profitable speed. Just because you have a fine voice, great equipment, and the skills needed to produce an audiobook from start to finish only places you on the first rung of the ladder of audiobook success. I suggest you look on Facebook and find some of the audiobook narration groups and read through their FAQs and posts; take a look at Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX) and see what kind of books are being offered to narrators and look at ACX\u2019s FAQs and tip sheets. Very valuable. Get a subscription to Audiofile magazine to learn the latest trends, classes, seminars and meetups going on in the industry. It is a very rewarding field, but it requires a lot of hard work, persistence, hardness-to-failure, optimism, a desire to learn new technologies, some modest investment of time and money, and a willingness to market yourself in an ocean of very stiff competition.

            "answer_text": "Anyone can narrate an audio book for Amazon Audible. You just need two things: 1) A book to read that is available on Amazon and to which you have the right to record. 2) The ability to create an audio recording that meets Audible\u2019s very high quality standards for your recording. You can learn about what Amazon requires here: ACX ACX | Audiobook Creation Exchange You don\u2019t need a million dollar studio, many, many successful audio books have been recorded in closets. Here are the technical requirements: ACX Audio Submission Requirements Create top-quality audiobooks, and maximize your sales potential by providing the best overall listening experience. Audiobooks uploaded to ACX must adhere to the following requirements. The ACX Quality Assurance team may reject titles that do not meet these standards, and their retail release may be delayed. The following requirements help ensure customers get a great listen. Your submitted audiobook must: be consistent in overall sound and formattinginclude opening and closing creditsbe comprised of all mono or all stereo filesinclude a retail audio sample that is between one and five minutes longEach uploaded audio file must: contain only one chapter/section per file, with the section header read aloudhave a running time no longer than 120 minuteshave room tone at the beginning and end and be free of extraneous soundsmeasure between -23dB and -18dB RMS and have -3dB peak values and a maximum -60dB noise floorbe a 192kbps or higher MP3, Constant Bit Rate (CBR) at 44.1 kHz [1]That -60db noise floor is challenging for us home gamers, but it is doable. It means in practice that there can be no audible hiss or clicks in your recording when the narrator is not speaking. For example, unless you are in a professional studio you\u2019re going to have to turn your air conditioner off, and use a computer with no fans running. For all practical purposes, you can\u2019t have other people around you while recordings if you are doing this at home. The -23db/-18db requirements means you have to have decent recording software that can verify your recording meets these parameters, such as Twisted Wave. People also use Audacity, which is free. What ever recording software you use the Audacity forum is very helpful to anyone recording spoken word narration. Note: I\u2019m in the process of recording my first audio book right now. I had access to a very quite room where I was able to record about half the book. Sadly I lost access to that space, and am working on finding a new space for my recording. Footnotes[1] ACX",
