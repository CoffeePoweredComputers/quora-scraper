            "answer_text": "Satish: the answer is, you translate a copyrighted book with great care. It is a special skill to translate\u2014but my question to you is that if you translate a copyrighted book without the author or publisher\u2019s permission you could be sued\u2014where ever you are. I would ask why do you want to translate the book? If it is for your personal use, then no problem. But that\u2019s a heck of a lot of work. Strangely enough a book I wrote in l970 suddenly popped up in a Danish version. I had no knowledge of this, and more importantly it was done without my permission. So proceed with caution. ",

            "answer_text": "First, you need to obtain the legal right to translate the book, and you would contact the author about that. Second, if you question is about the general translation process \u2026 you\u2019re trying to capture the flavor of what the author is writing, not just a word-for-word translation (which may not be readable). So you have to in a sense restate thoughts into your native language in the best way possible. Authors have to place a great deal of trust in translators, and prefer to use translators who already work with established publishers for that reason. ",
