            "answer_text": "Ooh, good question! So, to answer this I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019re already committed to actually reading them, as opposed to seeing a production. Other answers to this question have already done a good job of suggesting filmed versions to introduce a newbie to the Bard. As others have stated, the order in which you read Shakespeare is more about introducing yourself to his tropes and techniques than it is about following any sort of narrative continuity, as the plays are generally standalone stories. My first suggestion is that you tackle each of the three \u201cgenres\u201d separately. Broadly speaking, Shakespeare wrote tragedies, comedies, and histories\u2014each with a different style and set of literary conventions in play. Understanding Shakespeare\u2019s comedies is not the same as understanding his histories, and vice-versa. Once you\u2019ve settled on a genre to start with, you can choose your first play. You\u2019ll get your best results from selecting a piece that has the following traits: Simplicity - Obviously, a straightforward plot and smaller cast of characters will be easier to read.Familiarity - Culturally, you\u2019re more likely to already be acquainted with the plot of some Shakespeare plays (like Romeo and Juliet, or Hamlet) than others; this will help anchor your comprehension of the text.Quality - Frankly, some of Shakespeare\u2019s plays are much, much better than others. Choosing a text that is coherent, focused, and strongly-themed will make you more likely to finish reading the play.With all this in mind, here are my suggestions: COMEDY Start with any of the following plays: Much Ado About Nothing - Strong comic characters, lively dialogue, and a clear plotline earn this play its standing as one of Shakespeare\u2019s most popular comedies.A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream - This is a good all-around dose of Shakespeare\u2019s storytelling style, and there\u2019s almost too much effort made to explain the plot to the audience. This is about as close to an easy read as you\u2019ll get from Shakespeare.The Tempest - A relatively small cast of strongly-motivated characters makes for a plot that is accessible and easy to follow.Save these for last: Two Gentlemen of Verona - Almost every character in this play behaves inconsistently to the point where it\u2019s difficult to understand\u2014or care about\u2014any of the choices they make.Taming of the Shrew - The inherent misogyny baked into this piece renders it somewhat less than accessible to most modern readers.Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost - This play\u2019s meandering plot and gratuitous monologizing make it difficult to follow.TRAGEDY Start with any of the following plays: Romeo and Juliet - If you grew up in the Western world, it is virtually guaranteed that you have some measure of familiarity with the storyline of this piece, and the particularly beautiful poetry of the text doesn\u2019t hurt, either.Macbeth - With a briskly-paced plot and some of the most recognizable Shakespeare lines outside of Hamlet, this is a good starting point.Hamlet - This play sports familiar imagery and compelling themes, as well as a tight cast of characters.Save these for last: King Lear - Numerous scholars have commented on the maddening incoherence of this piece, with its direct contradictions and loose plot ends.Troilus and Cressida - This play can be painfully tedious even for seasoned fans of the Bard. Don\u2019t start here.Othello - Though the central conflict is simple, this play is deceptively complex in its plot and political context.HISTORY This is a little trickier, because the lion\u2019s share of these plays do fall into a narrative chronology based on the events they depict. You can either read them chronologically or take a similar tack to my recommendations for the other two genres. If you opt to read these chronologically, I recommend skipping King John, as it\u2019s a bit of a loose end in English history as told by Shakespeare. Begin instead with Richard II. Otherwise, you might consider starting with Richard III and doubling back. Enjoy your journey! ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to have the most fun and get the most out of the plays, there are a few factors that can help you choose an order. If you\u2019re new or newish to reading Shakespeare, it\u2019s going to be pretty hard at first. The more you read, the easier it gets. This means that you probably want to start with plays that are easy to read. That\u2019s going to mean plots and language on the simpler side, a plot that makes sense to modern readers, and a shorter play. You could do Much Ado, Macbeth, Midsummer, Twelfth Night, Henry V, Comedy of Errors, and Romeo and Juliet. After this, you\u2019ll be able to read the rest in any order.If you feel able to read Shakespeare pretty well, you probably want to start with the best plays. These will be the most enjoyable and will make it easiest to really love what you\u2019re reading. While there\u2019s no consensus on the best plays, these tend to fall pretty high on most people\u2019s lists: Hamlet, Macbeth, Lear, Othello, Tempest, Coriolanus, Much Ado, Richard II, Richard III, Julius Caesar, and Antony and Cleopatra.You can choose the genre that most appeal to you\u2014 doing the tragedies first, or just the comedies, or whatever. If you want to get a little more niche, try reading just the romances or the problem plays.There are a few that I really don\u2019t recommend, unless you\u2019re dead set on reading everything. Two Noble Kinsmen, All\u2019s Well That Ends Well, Two Gentlemen of Verona, Merry Wives of Windsor, Two Gentlemen of Verona, Henry VIII, and King John are generally considered to be the worst. I think you don't really need to read Titus or Comedy of Errors. I personally really hate Midsummer, but that\u2019s not a popular opinion.If you want to get a better idea of the concepts that develop throughout multiple plays, it can be really cool to read the plays in chronological order. This means that you\u2019ll be starting with some of the worse plays, but you\u2019ll end on some high notes.",
