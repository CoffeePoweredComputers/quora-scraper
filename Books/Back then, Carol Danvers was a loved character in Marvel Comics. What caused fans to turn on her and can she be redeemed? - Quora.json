            "answer_text": "She was never beloved as you\u2019re thinking, what with her original version being an awful, near intolerable SJW writer for Ms Magazine before SJW was even a term, but writing changed her for the better and she was at least likable to the point of having fans. However, like everyone that Marvel likes to use as an excuse for social justice without thinking through what they\u2019re doing, bad writing killed the momentum and good will she had amassed. Bad writing turned fans against her. Civil War 2 was one of\u2014if not the worst offense, where she refused to even admit to the POSSIBILITY she could be wrong, much less that when it\u2019s discovered that she\u2019s been wrong the whole time she goes completely out of line and claiming that she\u2019ll find proof that she was right to imprison everyone she\u2019s currently holding (without a trial). She arrests Tony Stark for publicly calling her method she into question and saying she\u2019s wrong, using Tony\u2019s actions as an excuse because \u201che said I was wrong\u201d isn\u2019t a legal reason for arrest. On multiple occasions, Captain Marvel has acted as if she\u2019s right so no one else can be right if they disagree. The fact that she can physically break the opposition means that her temper tantrums don\u2019t endear her either. I preferred her when she was Miss Marvel because because while she could be arrogant, she at least could know when to apologize and when to back down. Captain Marvel apparently does not. ",

            "answer_text": "She was never a loved character, but she was fairly liked and was a decent character. Then Brian Michael bendis started the civil war II run and like usual he just took one side of the conflict and started writing them as out of character, pig headed assholes. He did it to Iron man in civil war 1 and this time it was Carol Danvers turn. But where Tony at least started out as having a point in civil war 1, Carol just became a stubborn, pig headed fascist that went around arresting people literally for what basically amounted to thought crimes. Ever seen the film minority report? Tom cruise plays an agent that goes around arresting people for shit they haven't even thought of doing yet, because the government has access to tech that apparently let's them see crime before it even happens. Cruises character is fine with this setup right up until agents try to arrest him because the tech showed him killing his mentor or something. Long story short, the tech is flawed and can be manipulated in order to make it look like people are going to do shit they weren't actually going to do, because of course it bloody is! And the same shit is going on in civil war II. Carol is arresting people based on an inhumans power to apparently see the future, but again his power is flawed and can be manipulated. Hell Kamala Khan actually shows Carol that it can be manipulated and tries to get her to stop, but Carol just says that kamala betrayed her and keeps acting like a fascist. She's been written as an arrogant, pig headed asshole for years now and is actually getting a new run where she fully turns into a villain and tries to kill the other avengers. It says something about her character arc that her turning evil doesn't come off as a surprise or shock twist, but as a natural next step for her. ",
