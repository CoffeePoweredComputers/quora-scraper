            "answer_text": "There are three basic routes to acquiring awards for your novel: 1: Aim for tiny awards. Many, many academic and regional literary organizations give out awards each year that you\u2019ve likely never heard of, which makes them much easier to win than, say, the Pulitzer Prize. Also, many specific trade organizations give out awards for books related to their industry, again with barely anyone realizing it; for example, one year a book from my small press won an award for \u201cbest memoir about the Peace Corps experience,\u201d which I didn\u2019t even know was a thing until I was contacted by the group to tell me the book had won it. Unfortunately, or at least based on personal experience, such tiny awards make almost no dent at all in increasing your book\u2019s sales, but they\u2019re a wonderful way to add prestige to both the book itself and your overall CV as an author. 2: Be prepared to spend a lot of money. There are tons of literary award organizations that basically exist to be profit-making endeavors for the people who run them. The most prestigious/notorious, for example, might be the Independent Publisher Book Awards (or IPPYs), which between itself and its subsidiaries literally gave out 807 gold, silver and bronze medals last year, but then charged people $85 per book per category to enter, generating somewhere around a million dollars of revenue for the group itself. Spend enough money, and you\u2019re virtually guaranteed to win an IPPY one way or another, which is also the case with many smaller award programs that work the same way. These kinds of organizations have a bit of an eye-rolling reputation from those actually in the industry \u2014 it literally means nothing to a publisher if you query them and proudly say, \u201cI\u2019m a past winner of an Independent Publisher Book Award!\u201d \u2014 but they\u2019re legitimate awards nonetheless, chosen through legitimate means, and impressive to those who don\u2019t realize that you spent hundreds of dollars in the quest to secure one. 3: Become friends with the people who give out awards. When it comes to the four most impressive American literary awards \u2014 the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the PEN/Faulkner Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award \u2014 it\u2019s actually a teeny-tiny little group of intellectual elites who choose them all. All these people know each other; all of them are associated either with a major press or the academic world; and all of them live in New York City. If you\u2019re very serious about wanting to win of these awards, move to Brooklyn, get an internship at Simon & Schuster, and start attending every industry networking event, bar night, and McNally Jackson reading you possibly can. That\u2019s what will get you an NYC lit agent, which is what will get your book published at Random House, which is what will get you a review in the New York Times, which is what will get you a Pulitzer nomination. There is literally no other route to these major awards besides this. Incidentally, this advice is also true to a smaller degree for the prestigious awards within specific genres, whether that\u2019s the Hugo for science-fiction, the Edgar for mystery, the Lambda for LGBTQ literature, etc. In all these cases, the awards are almost always given out to those who are firmly entrenched within their genre\u2019s community, who attend the conventions regularly, and who have made fans out of the people who organize and run these conventions. Although there are always occasional outliers within these fields, certainly your best chance of winning one involves ingratiating yourself with the people who actually give them out. P.S. If all else fails, submit your work to the Pushcart Prize, which nicely allows everyone who enters to legally say in public that they\u2019ve been \u201cnominated for the Pushcart Prize.\u201d Because of this, they get literally thousands of entries each year, which makes it a legitimately huge honor to actually win; but it\u2019s certainly nice to be able to call yourself a \u201cPushcart Prize nominee\u201d merely from the act of putting your work in an envelope and mailing it off!
