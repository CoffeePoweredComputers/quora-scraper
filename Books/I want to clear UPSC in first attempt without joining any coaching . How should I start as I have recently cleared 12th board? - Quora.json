            "answer_text": "It is an absolute delight to see when students are so serious about there careers and actually know what they want to do. This is actually the best time to properly strategize what and how to study and practically for the in-depth study of the same. You practically have ample time to decide what optional you are the most comfortable with and also switching according to your needs can be a very easy task. The first thing which you should do here is to literally CRAM the SYLLABUS and imprint it in your mind. There is a fair probability of any aspirant to underestimate the power of knowing the syllabus but honestly, it goes a long way. To know more about the syllabus, you can either follow the UPSC website or the link shared below. https://www.jatinverma.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-upsc-syllabus Once you are thorough with the syllabus you should start reading the NCERTs. Read it as many times as you can. They are an integral part of the preparation. Agreed making NOTES is very important, but don\u2019t start with it right away. Read these books at least twice before switching on to the notes making mode. Not all NCERTs are important but there are a few which are indispensable. Follow the link below to have clarity on what and which to read in the same. https://www.jatinverma.org/important-ncerts-for-upsc-cse-preparation The next thing is developing a knack for the Newspaper. You have a liberal time for the same. A newspaper plays a very crucial role in the preparation of this exam. You can follow any newspaper be it the Hindu, the Indian Express according to your preference. Initially, it would take time for how and what to read in the same. It can make a person tad a bit anxious too but slowly gradually you will get a hold over it. The important thing to be kept in mind while reading a newspaper is that you know the syllabus thoroughly. This will aid in eliminating all unnecessary, irrelevant topics out. Once done with the NCERTs, switch to the standardized books. Follow the link below to know the important books for the CSE preparation. https://www.jatinverma.org/important-books-for-upsc-cse-preparation While reading the NCERTs and the books, link it with the current portion you get in touch with while reading the newspaper. UPSC never tests you on the bookish knowledge but on your power to implement your read. Thus, linking the static with the current here holds quite a significance here. There are some important sources of the current affairs which one should follow for an all-round preparation. You can know about the important sources of current affairs preparation by clicking on the link below: https://www.jatinverma.org/top-sources-for-current-affairs All the Best!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Wow ! That\u2019s lovely coming from someone who has not even been to college. Well great that you have thought so far. But remember, the UPSC examination is a test of your personality. Your personality builds over years. So now concentrate on improving your own communication skills, reading habit. Try to read the morning newspaper. Read fiction and non-fiction, anything you can lay your hands on. Try to understand the issues happening around you. And more than anything else, please enjoy your college life. Because. trust me that\u2019s something which will never come back. To clear the exam, you need to know the syllabus, be thorough with the basic books and write good answers. Those things need a wholehearted practice of one year. But the years before that will determine how much you are able to give to the process. So try to be a more well-rounded personality from now. ALL THE BEST ! ",
