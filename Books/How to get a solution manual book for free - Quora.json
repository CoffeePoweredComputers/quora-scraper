            "answer_text": "You can get solution manuals for free only if you are an instructor AND you go to the publishers site and get registered as an instructor. Every publisher has that option. After that, you can request for the solution manual. It\u2019s a long process, but if you are able to convince them (you will need a university email address), then you can get testbanks and solution manuals for free. Otherwise you can go to sites like DuranBooks(dot)net and they can provide you with very cheap solution manuals and testbanks, but not for free. ",
