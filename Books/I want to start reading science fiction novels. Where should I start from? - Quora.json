            "answer_text": "There are so many good choices, and many styles of science fiction, some of them fading into fantasy, but still sciency enough to satisfy. You could start with some classic authors, Like Phillip K. Dick, Gene Wolfe, Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison, Ursula K. Le Guin, Joanna Russ, Octavia Butler and Larry Niven. Almost anything you pick up by one of these authors will be a good entry point. There are some wonderful space opera series, like Lee and Miller\u2019s Liaden Universe series, beginning with Agent of Change, or Lois MacMaster Bujold\u2019s Vorkosigan series. And there are authors that transition between sci-fi and fantasy, with some great world building and characters, like C. J. Cherryh. Try Downbelow Station or Cyteen, both award winning science fiction books by this excellent author. Or try a foray into cyberpunk, with William Gibson, Bruce Sterling and the like.

            "answer_text": "I would recommend both the Ender's Game series by Orson Scott Card--DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS MOVIE ADAPTATION--and The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury.  Don't be fooled by the youth of the main character. This is a book series with depth, brilliant (literally) characters, immersive scientific world-building, fascinating sociopolitical systems, and enormous heart. This series is also one case in which I think the sequels are even better than the first book, since the rich world is fully explored in the sequels. I couldn't recommend something more highly. Please give this a try if you're ready for a great series.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a quick dip into some interesting science fiction, The Martian Chronicles is made of short stories that explore the possibilities of interplanetary travel, extraterrestrial societies, and humanity's future. The stories range from light-hearted to existentialist, and from realistic to fantastic. They'll keep your attention and whet your imagination (whet: to sharpen, or stimulate). Enjoy! ",
