            "answer_text": "I couldn't fathom the thought of how someone I let into my life, let into my heart, let into my family. Turn out to be so Evil. Especially after the Love Bombing. He was Mr. Wonderful. But, was very skilled in making me think I was crazy. What hurt the most was him using my faith to get close to me. We lived together, but maintained a celibate relationship. Spoke of marriage, but he maintained open communication with his ex-girlfriend. He tried very hard to have my family turn against me. He discarded me, in a very hurtful way. But, it was a Blessings in disguise. I prayed so much, because I was confused. I didn't know I was dealing with a Narcissistic person. But now, looking back. He showed all the signs. He moved out, without me knowing. And even though it hurt, I thank God, for sparing me deep emotional and physical pain. He continually tried to hurt me, by communicating with my family. He blocked me on social media, but tried calling me from different numbers to tell me how much he missed me. I had to educate myself on the schemes, and tactics they use to keep you in a vicious, evil, and manipulating cycle. The best advice I received for healing is\u2026NO CONTACT\u2026..NO CONTACT\u2026\u2026NO CONTACT\u2026.You literally have to erase them from your life. My faith got me through it. I know you Will get through it too. ",

When we feel emotionally crushed, that is when we learn. It seems as though Mother Nature wants to teach us real significant lessons. And I learnt so much. I learnt that: Love will always beat evil any time and every timeHow crucial it is to self reflect as often as you canGo out to the countryside and you will feel more in sync with life.Be very patient with yourself. Your soul has been hit. Keep at it and you will emerge a winnerLife is short. Don\u2019t spend time hating others. It is not worth it.Sweet revenge is awesome. The better person you become after this experience will hurt the abuser more. The narcissist will feel like a loser once he/she sees how you have become such a happy person.Now you know what it means hitting rock bottom. Open your eyes real wide and if you can make a difference in someone\u2019s life, do it.The best healer of narcissism is the art of self love. Discover how awesome you are.Listen to self healing music. The divine love frequency is 528 hz and it is scientifically proven that it heals down to your DNA.Aim to be positive always, no matter what challenges you face.Follow all these and keep God in your life and one day you will be in awe of YOU! Namaste. ",

Instead, I'll mention some resources: A professional therapist trained in Trauma Abuse is ideal; but they are harder to find than common all purpose therapists. Also, therapists arent accessible 24 hours a day. The internet has resources available at all hours. One such group I belong to is The Narcissist Victim and Survivors Support Group, pictured.  Another resource is YouTube NPD coaches. Heres a brief list of the ones I view Narcology Unscripted with Dave Angie Atkinson Jess Stanley Dr. Ramani Dr. Carmen Bryan Dr. Todd Grande Lisa A.
