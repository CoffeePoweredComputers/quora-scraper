            "answer_text": "KMG and C Rajagopalachari are available online. SO is BORI Sanskrit text. But the translations are not fully available free for BORI. But logically and factually all the version of Mahabharatha we can never say which is authentic as the oldest text available is less than 2000 years old and they all have some logical and linguistic anomalies and many other factors which make them suspected as not by one hand and from one period even. So BORI critical edition if you read with its accompanied notes gives a logic which makes it seem authentic but factually none of the 1200 + versions can claim authenticity for Veda Vyasa Krishna Dwaipayana or Vaisampayana or Ugrashrava Sauti ownership or authorship. So read the BORI critical by Bibek Debroy or KMG version and appreciate the great effort and mass of work behind it and enjoy it. ",
