            "answer_text": "I know this wasn\u2019t the man thrust of your question (and I think you\u2019re correct about no car being flipped), but \u2026 One thing that disappointed me: the neighborhood didn\u2019t resemble the real one at all. The movie shows flat terrain and a rectangular grid of streets, neither of which is right. The houses are too far apart and there aren\u2019t enough trees, either. As a result of the changes, they removed the reason that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev abandoned the stolen SUV and fled on foot\u2014which would have been a nice, dramatic scene. (You can follow this on Google Maps street view. Go to 33 Laurel St. If you rotate clockwise, so that the three parked cars are on your right, you can see the intersection with Dexter Ave. where the shootout happened. The Tsarnaevs were just across the intersection, roughly abreast of where the red car and yellow pickup are. But DT fled in the opposite direction, so you want to rotate counter-clock wise and head down Laurel.) After the shootout, DT went west on Laurel, and had to cross a major intersection to continue on Spruce St. Spruce goes up a hill and bends right about 80 degrees. When you reach the crest of the hill, you\u2019re at the intersection with Lincoln St., and you can see out to Mt. Auburn St., Rte. 16, the main road they had driven down earlier (which doesn\u2019t resemble the one shown in the movie, either). At that point, DT could see that his escape route was blocked by at least four police cars \u2014 I know because I was watching from my townhouse on the north side of Mt. Auburn, between Spruce and Lincoln. (I had driven the route up Spruce hundreds of times coming home.) And in fact, one or more patrol cars may have headed down the street towards him (according to the Boston Globe, although I think that may just be a guess.) So he pulled over and fled west on foot, down a steep hill and across Walnut St., another fairly main road. We were a bit more than a half-mile from the first shootout, and a quarter-mile from the capture. We were alerted to both by the sounds of gunfire. After it was over, I told my roommates \u201cWe were never in any real danger. The terrorists were on the other side of the street the whole time.\u201d With as many as eight police cars between us and them. ",
