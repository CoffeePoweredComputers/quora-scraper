            "answer_text": "Don't.  Publication is not the next step you should be taking. You should be looking for feedback and focusing on revision and improving your own skills.  That's what real writing is, not an endless procession of first drafts. Releasing a work to the public really will not get you the kind of qualitative criticism you need to judge your own work.  That needs to come from people who know what they're talking about and are willing to explain their responses in detail. Look at joining a writer's group.  Go to the Kindle Pioneer program. Just don't make the mistake so many people do of just going online and publishing a day after the draft clears a spell check. I understand the impatience. I finished my first book when I was younger than you, and started winning awards by the time I was 14.  To say I was eager to get a novel published was an understatement.  But I waited, and I'm glad for that, because what I had at 14 was not comparable to what I had at 20 when I did publish.  The quality of your work and what that contributes to your reputation in everything in this business.  It's not worth rushing it if you have any desire to be taken seriously as a writer. ",

            "answer_text": "Writer and Professional Editor. I have known many writers who rushed to publish without making sure they had the best book possible . . . years later, after they built a reputation as BAD WRITERS, they are trying to dig themselves out. If you put out something BAD, readers will NOT forget. I even have a best-selling author whose work I refuse to read after I read a book he published which had more than 100 errors. YECH! And he even THANKED his editor. You certainly don't want THAT following you for the rest of your writing career. One thing some writers find indispensable is a critique group.  Also, read as many books as you can on craft. Any edition of Strunk and White's Elements of Style, Janet Burroway's Writing Fiction: A Guide to Narrative Craft (an excellent resource for technical guidance), Stephen King's On Writing, and Noah Lukeman's The First Five Pages: A Writer's Guide To Staying Out of the Rejection Pile belong in every writer's library. Reading them will get you on the fast track for producing a top notch book. ",
