            "answer_text": "Yes , I think it's enough . U should learn 100% given in NCERT , including daigrams floral formula everything . Checking into past few years paper u will notice that it is mostly based on NCERT . U can study from modules when u feel that u are done with that of NCERT and u are confident about it . But I would recommend not to learn too many examples from other sources . This will give unnecessary stress to you . And u may forget what is of primary importance ( ie: NCERT ) ",
