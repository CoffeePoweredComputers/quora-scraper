            "answer_text": "Expert Secrets by Russell Brunson. It\u2019s about positioning yourself as an expert and providing your audience a new opportunity. And getting people to pay you for your advice. Of course you shouldn\u2019t pretend to be an expert if you know nothing about the topic but don\u2019t be shy if you really do know your stuff. Lots of the successful affiliate marketers are seen as experts in the area of affiliate marketing. That\u2019s why they can sell courses, sell coaching, sell affiliate products that they recommend to their audience. In these courses and coaching they sometimes recommend affiliate products to their audience if its needed or helpful, so they get a commission as well. Promoting affiliate products through YouTube, blogs, ads etc are probably how you would start out as an affiliate marketer but that\u2019s not where the big and fast money is. Use your success from promoting affiliate products to position yourself as someone who knows enough to help others achieve the same result. Build a following (providing free and valuable content on Facebook, Youtube, etc) that trusts you who will buy what you recommend. You can offer coaching - if you\u2019re earning $100 per month, someone who\u2019s earning $1 per month might pay you to learn how to get to $100 per month (but don\u2019t lie or pretend). Eventually you can build a course that can help scale up your earnings because your course can sell even when you\u2019re sleeping. And in your courses and coaching you\u2019re recommending affiliate products so you\u2019re still building up your affiliate commissions from promoting products. Ultimately, positioning yourself as an expert and creating a new opportunity for your audience is going to get you to the $10,000 per month. The book Expert Secrets tells you the most effective process of doing that so I highly recommend it. You can get it here. ",
