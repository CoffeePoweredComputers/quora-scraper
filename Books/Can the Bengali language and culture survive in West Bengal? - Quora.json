            "answer_text": "I'll tell you a story. There's this sandwich shop, called Sip n Sandwich, in the oldest AC market of Kolkata(yes, the one in Shakespeare Sarani). It's a vegetarian food outlet, the people serving the food are what we Bengalis so fondly call 'non-Bengalis' and they are those lads in their twenties who pretend to take the upper hand if you speak anything other than Hindi and English. Now that's a huge hypocrisy because if these guys are doing business in this city, they ought to learn the language of the majority of the customers. Any how, I went shopping with my mother the other day and when we were done, we went to pick up some sandwiches for the road. My mother inquired and placed the order in Bengali. The swag at the counter immediately took advantage and said on her face that she has to repeat the order in Hindi. My mother got a bit flustered, she isn't very strong with Hindi, and the guy was like, \"Dekhiye, aap jo keh rahi hai na, mujhe kuch bhi samajh mein nahi aa raha. Please, aap Hindi mein boliye ya kisi aur ko boliye, woh samjha dega.\" This made me really angry. Before my mother could even talk to me, I went over and was like, \"Dada, dekhun, ekta Sweet corn sandwich ar ekta Mexican sandwich kagojer bakshe moore din, baari niye jabo.\" The guy said, \"Sorry Ma'am, Hindi mein boliye na, English bhi chalega.\" \"Ami ki bollam? \" I returned an unflinching look.The guy somehow sensed that I was doing this deliberately, so he called over another guy who understood Bengali. \"Haan Didi balun ki byapar, ami Bengali bujhi. \" the new participant said. I looked at him and said, \"Mein keh rahi ki ek Sweet corn sandwich aur ek Mexican sandwich pack hoga, bhaiya.\" \"Yeh baat toh Ma'am aap pehele bata deti toh... \" \"Since when are you in this business?\" \"Do saal se. \" he said after exchanging looks with the guy at the counter. \" Aur abhi tak Bangla bhi nahi seekhi? \" My mother tucked at my elbow, but I wasn't listening to her. \" Sorry, Ma'am. \" and the guys went back to their own business. And, to my mother's biggest surprise, the sandwiches are exceptionally good that day. This is my point. It is us Bangalis who are striking the axe at our own feet. We are the ones who are giving the rest of the world too much indulgence to help us disappear. If language dies in West Bengal or anywhere in India for the matter, it's going to be because of us. One of the many reasons why I respect Bangladesh so much is because they have the courage to hold on to their mother tongue. So ardent is their love that youths died fighting for the language. Mothers and sisters all over Bangladesh sing this song on the 21st of February each year :\"Amar bhaiyer rokte raangano Ekushe February, Ami ki bhulite paari?\"(The blood of my brother has stained the date of 21st February red, can I ever forget that?) The question is not whether it will survive, the question is whether we will be able to make it survive. Listening to Rabindra sangeet all day, taking part in discussions that detest the current political scenario, eating Rosogollas all day doesn't make you a Bengali. I don't do any of the above (no offence to the great man, but all day? That's too much) but I am a true-blooded Bangali and I speak BANGLA (not Bengali, you wretched morons). The culture is way more extended beyond Rabindranath or Nazrul for the matter. How many of us have read Jibonananda? I doubt if half of the 'Bengali' s even know his name. Art is way beyond Potochitra of Kalighat and Bankura'r ghora. Food is way more beyond machher jhol and sorshe ilish and Rosogollas and Misti doi. Seriously? Yes, because that's the way we have been portraying ourselves for the past decade - a vulnerable community who will succumb to anyone's wishes to impress them and bring out (and regurgitate) only that side of theirs that make them acceptable, if the tradition or the food is a little out of the way, boy, better keep that under cover for the next century.

            "answer_text": "Once upon a time, France, Spain, Portugal, Romania etc had a lot of native languages of their own. Celtic languages were quite dominant in a large part of Europe. Romance languages were not heard or spoken outside of Italy. Fast forward to 500 years later, All of these regions were using the spoken form of Latin (called Vulgar Latin). Most of the native Celtic languages are extinct. Before Arabic become the dominant language of Middle East and North Africa, those regions had their own native languages. Now they mostly don\u2019t. There is one thing common about these two languages becoming dominant in regions where they were not native. They were the languages that were used as lingua franca and they were actively supported by the government. When a large country decides to use one specific language above all the others, most of its people will try to learn that language for economic and social benefits. It\u2019s natural. A language doesn\u2019t die out within one year or a hundred. The process is gradual. With every successive generation more and more people will find their own language less appealing and will try to learn the language that will help them communicate with most of their countrymen. Bengali has a lot of speaker. An incredibly rich collection of literature. A great many people who take pride in this beautiful language. But Hindi has an even larger number of speaker. More and more non-native speakers are using it. It is gradually becoming the lingua franca of India. Who knows? Maybe five hundred years from now, most of the non-Hindi languages will go extinct. Hindi will become the Vulgar Latin equivalent of India. Or maybe not. Despite being surrounded by Romance languages, the isolated Basque is still spoken proudly. Despite being almost wiped out by Arabic, Farsi held on and went on to become a prestigious and thriving language. It all depends on the people that speak it. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course they will survive! They have survived throughout centuries, it\u2019s in their genes. Not even the British could wipe off their authenticity and identity. Some of us are too fond of English. There\u2019s nothing wrong in being fond of a language other than your mother tongue, but that should not come from making your mother tongue inferior. I did my graduation in English literature, learnt Hindi in school, studied Sanskrit in college, and taking Spanish classes now. My friends call me a Grammar Nazi. But, I love my mother tongue equally well, if not more. Sadly, today\u2019s generation (not just Bengalis) have developed a peculiar diction (and accent) consisting native and foreign words. They don\u2019t realize what they think as COOL and SWAG is a sign of illiteracy and considered stupidity in other parts of the world. Have you ever come across a French person mixing other languages with French? Spanish? Russian? Most of them don\u2019t. Many of them were colonies once, so don\u2019t start on the foreign influence part. So we learn nothing of our own country and remain blind about other cultures too. Coming back to the survival of Bengali language and culture. We are going to survive because of our tenacity and capacity to stand against strong winds. We don\u2019t give up, we just don\u2019t know how to. Take it from the famous personalities in Bengal. Be it the revolutionaries, writers, poets, painters, sportsmen to the most hated Mamata Banerjee. I\u2019m not taking side to any political party here but she is a good example of how we always bounce back stronger. You remove us from the national cricket team again and again and we love making come backs like Sourav Ganguly. You drag us to the road, beat us up by your cadres and corrupt officers, we wipe off your 34 years government and make it to the throne of Bengal as Mamata Banerjee. There are plenty of such examples and currently I\u2019m not in a mood to write (maybe later). In short, it\u2019s true that we are going through a crisis period just like many other tribes in India, but we\u2019ll be there along with others. We\u2019ll definitely survive. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "A pertinent question. The survival of Bengali language and culture in West Bengal will very much depend on the level of interest that Bengalis have for it. This is, unfortunately, not obvious anymore today, specially among the younger generation. As far as language is concerned, their apathy towards their mother tongue is evident. Only a small percentage of people read Bengali literature regularly, even fewer write it. As to speaking, the \u201csmart\u201d people (those educated in English medium schools) can usually express themselves better in English than Bengali. The less privileged one's readily switch to Hindi in order to appear \u201cmodern\u201d. Many times over the last two years, when visiting modern & smart shops in Kolkata, I have been spoken to in Hindi by shop assistants. But upon insisting that they spoke to me in \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be (Bengali) or English I have found that strangely enough in most cases those personnel were actually Bengalis. (I wouldn't be surprised if it's their company policy that encourages them to speak Hindi as a default language.) Anyway it just shows the encroachment of Hindi in Kolkata. However, things are different in smaller towns and rural areas. There the normal language is still Bengali and most likely will continue to be so in future. However, in vocabulary and accent there are variations among those areas. Furthermore, there is usually a qualitative difference in the parlance of people at a higher socio-economic level and those lower down in the scale. So, considering all factors, it is difficult to believe that today's \u201cstandard\u201d Bengali will survive another fifty years. ",

They encapsulate the experience and knowledge of diverse peoples collected in widely different environments, and are a precious part of the human heritage. With the explosive expansion of a few dominant languages in recent decades, at least half of the world\u2019s languages are critically endangered in that they will soon have no speakers and become extinct (Krauss, 1992; Crystal, 2000). Pagel (1995) estimates that roughly 140,000 languages have ever existed (median estimate), so it is the fate of the majority of languages to become extinct. Fishman (1991) argues that death of a language generally leads to death of the underlying culture to which it is linked. It is therefore an important challenge to understand such situations as precisely as possible, and to recognize whether there are measures that can help us preserve some of this heritage. Much work has been carried out on both theoretical and empirical issues of achieving language maintenance as evidenced by the numerous recent volumes on the subject (e.g. Fishman, 1991; Grenoble & Whaley, 1998; Crystal, 2000; Nettle & Romaine, 2000; Fishman,2001; Bradley & Bradley, 2002; Grenoble & Whaley, 2006). Fishman (2001:1) begins his treatise by stating: What the smaller and weaker languages (and peoples and cultures) of the world need are not generalized predictions of dire and even terminal illnesses but, rather,the development of therapeutic understandings and approaches that can be adjusted so as to tackle essentially the same illness in patient after patient. Toward this end, Abrams and Strogatz (2003) have proposed a mathematical model for studying language competition. The model predicts that whenever two languages compete for speakers,one language will eventually become extinct, the language that dies depending on the initial proportions of speakers of each language and their relative status. The model obtains a good fit to a number of empirical data sets, tracing the relative abundance of speakers of several endangered languages that have been undergoing competition with other, more prestigious languages. However, it does not account for either bilingual individuals or the social structure of the population within which the languages compete. The model also does not distinguish the vertical and horizontal transmission of language, and ignores the impact of the behavior of individual speakers in the population, focusing instead on the expected aggregate behaviour of the population as a whole. Despite these limitations, the model has stimulated a burst of research into the dynamics of language competition and diversity (e.g., Patriarca & Lepp\u00e4nen,2004; Mira & Paredes, 2005; Wang & Minett, 2005; Schulze & Stauffer, 2006; Stauffer,Castell\u00f3, Egu\u00edluz & San Miguel, 2006), much of it performed by non-linguists. In this paper, we extend the Abrams and Strogatz work to model bilingualism explicitly,accounting for the fact that some individuals may speak both of the competing languages. Our first step is to formulate a mathematical model that, like the Abrams and Strogatz model, deals with the expected aggregate behaviour of the whole population\u2014this model also predicts that death of one of the two competing languages is inevitable (although the trajectories that lead tothis state differ from those of the previous model). However, in order to investigate the range of possible trajectories that a system of two competing languages can potentially follow from the same initial state, and to devise a method by which the probabilities associated with them can be predicted, we also implement an agent-based model. In particular, we investigate the impact of simple strategies for language maintenance,allowing us to estimate for different scenarios the relative likelihood that a pair of competing languages can be maintained in a population comprising both monolingual speakers of each language and bilingual speakers. We then examine the role of social structure on the probabilities of maintenance, representing the social structure by a local-world network (Li & Chen, 2003) to encapsulate the patterns of sociolinguistic interactions among the individuals comprising the population. The paper is laid out as follows: In Section 2, we discuss deterministic models of language competition, first briefly describing the Abrams and Strogatz model for a population in which two languages compete for speakers, then introducing an extension of the model that incorporates modelling of bilingualism. In Section 3, we apply the extended model to investigate the efficacy of simple strategies for language maintenance. The deterministic models that we discuss in Sections 2 and 3 allow us to determine the expected final state of a system in which two languages compete for speakers. However, they do not reveal the variety of competing outcomes that are possible, the likelihood that the system converges to each of them, or the impact of population size on the likelihood of maintenance. Therefore, in Section 4 we go on to derive an agent-based model for language competition that allows such effects to be assessed. Our simulations suggest some general principles for achieving maintenance. We then consider the impact of social structure on the probability of successful maintenance in Section 5. The paper concludes in Section 6. 2. Deterministic Models of Language Competition 2.1 The Monolingual Model of Abrams and Strogatz (2003) Abrams and Strogatz (2003) (henceforth A&S) have developed a simple mathematical model of language competition for a population in which two languages compete for speakers. The model aims to trace the variation over time of the proportion of speakers of each language, potentially allowing a language that is endangered to be identified at an early stage so that appropriate action to maintain it can be planned. In deriving their deterministic model, A&S make a number of simplifying assumptions, in particular: i) Each individual is monolingual in one of the two languages, but no individual speaks both languages. ii) Speakers of one language switch to speak the second language according to the \u2018attractiveness\u2019 of that second language. iii) The attractiveness of a language increases with both the proportion of speakers of that language and its \u2018status\u2019, a global parameter that measures its inherent utility within the community\u2014we shall discuss status in Section 3. iv) The population has a uniform social structure: individuals interact with each other at the same rate, and influence the languages that they each use equally\u2014we discuss social structure in Section 5. v) The population size remains constant. Let us consider how these assumptions translate into a mathematical model. We write the proportions of monolingual speakers of X and Y as x and y, respectively. Since each individual is assumed to be monolingual in one of these two language, the values of x and y must sum to 1 (i.e., x + y = 1). The rate at which speakers of one language switch to become speakers of the second language depends on the attractiveness of that second language. In their most general conception of attractiveness, A&S assume that a language has greater attractiveness the more monolingual speakers it has and the greater its status. All such functional forms of attractiveness, they state, give rise to the same qualitative dynamics as that of the following constrained model in which the attractiveness of language X to speakers of Y is given by the power-law PYX = csX xa . (1) In the above formula, sX denotes the status of language X, and a is a parameter that models how the attractiveness of X scales with the proportion of speakers of X. The attractiveness of Y to speakers of X can be stated similarly. For a = 1, the attractiveness of X increases linearly with its proportion of speakers. For a greater 1, doubling the proportion of speakers more than doubles the attractiveness, and vice versa. The parameter c in (1) indicates the peak rate at which speakers of Y switch to speak X. This can reflect, variously, the rate of contact between pairs of individuals, the propensity for individuals to learn a new language based on their existing linguistic skills, or the provision of language resources to children. The formula (1)therefore provides a simple model for a variety of sociolinguistic factors that influence the attractiveness of a language, and whose dynamics reflect those of the entire class of models in which attractiveness increases monotonically with both the proportion of monolingual speakers and status. In this model, Y monolinguals switch language to become monolingual speakers of X at a rate proportional to PYX. Likewise, X monolinguals become Y monolinguals at a rate proportional to PXY (defined similarly to (1)). The rate at which the proportion of monolingual speakers of X changes over time can therefore be written symbolically as dx= yP - xP . (2)YX XY dt Substituting for PYX and PXY in (2), we obtain the formula dx = c [yxa sX - xya sy ]. (3)dt The rates of change of the system are summarized in Figure 1. We can make further simplifications to the formula by assuming, as do A&S, that sX + sY = 1, and by substituting (1 \u2013 x) for y, to obtain dx aa dt = c [(1 - x)x sX - x (1 - x)( 1 - sX )]. (4) Because the proportions of speakers of X and Y sum to 1, there is no need to consider separately the rate at which the proportion of Y monolinguals changes with time\u2014this is just minus the rate of change of the X monolinguals. The dynamics of the model can be analyzed by seeking the values of x at which no change in the proportion of X monolinguals is expected to take place. These points are termed \u2018equilibria\u2019,and are of two types: stable and unstable. 1 In order to locate the equilibria, we calculate the values of x for which the rate of change of x is zero. Stable equilibria occur at x = 0 and at x = 1. A third equilibrium does occur for an intermediate value of x, corresponding to a situation in which speakers of both languages remain, but this equilibrium is unstable. Therefore, no matter what is the initial state, the system will ultimately end up at one of the two stable equilibria. The significance for language competition is that the model implies that one language will always acquire all the speakers in the population, causing the language with which it competes to become extinct. However, A&S suggest that a third stable equilibrium, corresponding to a state in which the two competing languages are both maintained, can be achieved by appropriate control of the status of the endangered language. The idea of controlling the status, as well as other model parameters, in order to achieve maintenance forms the basis of the language maintenance strategies that we pursue in Section 3.A&S have tested the accuracy of their model by fitting it to diachronic data collected for three endangered languages: Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and Quechua. The former two data sets arebased on census data, while the latter data derive from records of the languages used in religious services in Peru. In each case, the set of values of the model parameters for which the corresponding trajectory most closely matches the diachronic data can be calculated. In this way, the status of Scottish Gaelic was estimated to be 0.33, half that of English with which it continues to compete. Welsh was estimated to have a slightly higher status with respect to English, 0.4, but the predicted trajectory for the proportion of speakers of Welsh throughout 1 Informally, an \u2018equilibrium\u2019, or \u2018fixed point\u2019, of a dynamical system is a state in which the system will remain, once attained. In other words, an equilibrium is a state for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., dx/dt = 0. An equilibrium is said to be \u2018stable\u2019 when the system, upon a small perturbation from the equilibrium, returns back to that state. We shall refer to all equilibria that are not stable as \u2018unstable\u2019. More formal definitions of these and other terms relating to dynamical systems can be found, for example,in Strogatz (1995). Wales nevertheless shows a strong downward trend that fits the empirical data well. A&S also estimated the value of parameter a for each data set, and found a to cluster about the mean value Do people have different behaviour in different languages? ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this question, I have to give a clear definition of \"Bengali Culture\", atleast what I think of it. What is Bengali culture? I think, a culture which is progressive and adaptive is the only culture that will survive the test of time.. Also, language is only one facet of culture. Language is meant for expression of one's thoughts and a person can be comfortable to express himself in English even if it's not his mother tongue.. Bengali culture was never rigid and always adaptive to various other culture. Let's take 3 of our idols- Swami Vivekananda, Satyajit Ray & Rabindranath Tagore. They are what I call truly globalized Bengalis. They have accepted western culture and blended it with our traditional culture. It reflects in their works. A huge number of Bengalis were inspired by them. The point I want to make is, Bengalis were never the frog in the well. They never felt this insane urge to protect their culture by forcing them to individuals. We always had a free choice and always will. Just because someone speaks fluent English and is more comfortable with it, doesn't make him less of a Bengali. It's his lifestyle, his celebrations, his choice of art, literature and films and overall his attachment to his roots that makes him a Bengali, not the language he speaks or the dress she wears. I have seen many people who speaks fluent Bengali and they are far from being a Bengali in terms of lifestyle.I agree that people tend to send their kids to English medium. But, that doesn't mean they don't want their kids to be exposed to Bengali Culture. It's for better education. Though I don't agree that English mediums are better, but that's the public perception, maybe because there are less number of good Bengali schools than English. I myself have studied in an English medium school, yet I feel more comfortable talking in Bengali than English. But,  English enables us to communicate with the world better. I strongly disagree with the fact that readership of Bengali books has decreased. Infact, Bengali is one of the few Indian languages with such modern Literature. Though, number of people who actually read books has decreased a lot in recent times. Maybe because there are other more accessible forms of entertainment available.In a nutshell, Bengalis always had a global outlook. Imposing culture forcibly will only create chaos. In fact, to me, the most important part of being a Bengali is to have a modern and global outlook and to acknowledge change as it comes. That's what I have learnt from my idols. So, to answer your question, Yes Bengali culture will survive even after 50 years but in different form than today. New cultural elements will be introduced, traditional elements will be questioned and reformed to fit the need of times. This change is inevitable.   ",

            "answer_text": "The question is a perfect one, but the explanation has an anomaly. There is a mention of more number of students flocking towards English medium schools and a depreciated number in Bengali medium schools. The reason behind this has to understood. The official language in the major part of the world is English. If the Bengali medium schools taught English up to a standard the English medium schools do, things would have been much better. I've seen students excellent in academics but are not able to study in premier institutions like JNU or Christ University because of language problems. They are not able to express themselves in English, which is the standard language for communication in interviews and are thus restricted to studying in West Bengal. So, the question is not about not sending children to Bengali medium schools, it is about maintaining the integrity of the Bengali Language. Having said that, I would like to say something about myself. I am a convent educated girl. And, I loved Bengali as a subject. This was one class that I never missed and I always paid attention to. I love reading Bengali books and on traditional occasion days, I wear traditional clothes by choice. And, I believe, if the Bengali culture was on the verge of extinction, the crowd at the Ananda Publishers stall in the Kolkata book fair would not have increased every year. Till today, the youth loves reading books by Satyajit Ray, Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Ashapoorna Devi, Suchitra Bhattacharya and many more, if I could mention. The main difference lies in the perception of the people. We can be globalized and yet maintain our culture and our language. And for people who are ashamed of calling themselves 'bangali', I feel, they are a disgrace to their mother tongue, irrespective of what their mother-tongue is. The problem lies in the minds of some people my friend and not in English schools or making children more fluent in English. Give it a thought. P.S.: This Quora answer was required to be written in English and not in Bengali because 'Quora only supports English for now. ' ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt it will survive in Kolkata. It is very sad to think about it, but Bangla is neither the language of business nor is it the language of cool/hip in Kolkata. Bengali is the language of the \"Bangali babu\" in dhuti and spectacles. I am an NRI, have lived many years abroad, and have a tall/muscular build. I remember last time being in Kolkata, girls would give me attention until I spoke in khati Bangla instead of opening in English (classy) or Hindi (sleazy but sexy). Bangla is \"old fashioned\". Bengalis with economic power have a strong disdain for the Bengali culture that comes from the rural/lower-classes of Bengal but lap up the low-class culture of Hindi speakers (and nowadays Punjabis also). It wasn't until I went abroad that my Bengali horizons were opened to the stuff coming out of \"opar\". We Bongs have zero clue. We claim to be secular, but write off Bangladeshis as Muslim fundoos.  Speaking of Muslims, does Kolkata or the surrounding rural areas (Hooghly, Howrah, Barasat etc) actually have any native Bengali Muslims? I'm not talking of Bangladeshi infiltrators, I mean actual Ghoti Musholman. I regularly stop by the dargah near Tollygunje metro station in front of the Tipu Sultan mosque, the dargah has a common wall with a small Kali temple. They sing qawwali there on Thursday evenings but it is only in Urdu, not one song is in Bangla. ",

But recently I have seen the re-emergence of Bangla as the language of the intellectual. Certainly, I happen to share this belief. They are not ashamed to speak out in Bangla and be proud of it rather than speak in English to suggest they are more genteel than others. And another reason why Bangla will survive is because of the music. I don't think Rabindra Sangeet ever goes out of style. Youngsters nowadays gladly wear ethnic clothes at functions, watch Bengali movies and read Bengali books.The primary encouragement has to come from the parents. Lately, I have noticed some apparently upper middle class people only talking to their toddlers in English. Ultimately, learning begins at home. But having said that, I don't think at all that Bangla is going to dissapear anytime soon. It is so essential to the community because unlike most other Indian communities who are named according to their land, the Bangalis are named because of their language.Without Bangla, there is no Bangali.

People will get exhausted using english and their pretentious accents while keeping up with the same Bengali mindset their parents had before them. Its laughable, their hypocrisy. Hindi - pure Hindi - died a long time ago. I have not once seen a native Hindi speaker speak completely in fluent Hindi without using substitutes from english. Again, laughable. But I do know people who speak complete sentences in Bengali, without using english. I'm one of them. These people have a far greater prowess over english than these upper-class Bengali families do, and they treat english only as a language. It is the mark of an educated man that he can entertain an idea without accepting it.But, in all probability, this extinction is highly improbable because of the grandmothers and grandfathers most of us still have. Until that generation dies out, I dont see this happening. So... dont worry about it. Keep calm and keep being a Bangali. ",

            "answer_text": "It definitely will do. The inherent nature of bengalis to be confined in their own shell will make Bengali go a long way. I have meet many Bengalis for whom being in Bengal is the world to them. They despise the outside world to such an extent that their own Bengal becomes the most superior in each and every aspect. The destruction of a language starts when the society where it is used is open to influences from the outside. Bengal is a closed society. They are happy in whatever they have and they are proud of their traditions. Bengali language is a part of that tradition. English has become the need of the hour for the purpose of formal communication and hence bengalis have adopted this language but as far as the threat to Bengali is concerned, I don't think there is one and there would be none in times to come.

For them it is not possible for them to collect a paper. Surviving is the main important part for them. Just some how they leave home and take shelter under places selected by govt to protect people. How these people will show data? This is how crore core of bengalis will be eliminated through NRC. Just imagine, govt is throwing you out just because you are Hindu bengali!! If bengalis become less in number bengali culture will not survive. Now central government is trying to put tax over our durga pujo. Now again if BJP comes in power in Bengal, bengali culture will be totally destroyed because frankly speaking BJP is a uncultured bihar party. Alike tripura Bengal has more biharis and they are the main supporters of BJP. Basically they represent BJP in Bengal. This is how culture of Bengal will be destroyed. ",
