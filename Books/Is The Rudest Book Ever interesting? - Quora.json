            "answer_text": "Total crap to be honest.  One reason being he's talking about detaching yourself from the ego yet keeps on centering his teachings based on \"thinking\" and \"self\" which is counterproductive. Also, he believes meditation is \"thinking about nothing\" and that can't be any further from the truth. Add that to the fact he keeps on using the word \"fuck\" to sort of drive a point ( cause its a rude book ofcourse) but it just makes it even more cringe. If you are the type of person who genuinely stays on his mind more then he stays with people then there is 80% chance that you know alooooooot more than this book's author. This author is clearly suffering from a sense of superiority, i clearly felt that tone throughout the book, its annoying. I understand that the idea is to zap the reader with 'tough love'/'brutal' kind of advice but it's just patronizing. Many of his arguments are just 'because I said so' kind of viewpoints, no data or study or even a compelling story to back it up. He predicts every move a guy will make given the situation, now thats some high level intellectual stuff right there. This book is directed towards teens and young adults, and i have no idea how this gonna help to them as it is packed with some already known advices. It's not a particularly intelligent or thought-provoking book but understandably that is to pander to a larger audience. ",
