            "answer_text": "You only have to think about the complexity of the calculations involved in astronomy to realize that severe number-crunching is essential.  This is also true for particle physics.In the more everyday world computer science now allows us to create virtual models of ever more complex systems (such as the stresses and temperatures in the blades of a jet engine) in a way which would be impractical by pure mathematics.  Look up \"Computational Fluid Dynamics\" for examples. ",

            "answer_text": "You can't. I mean, not without first making a description of the problem and its requirements for yourself first. In Computer Science you'll find a set of tools that you can use to solve problems anywhere else, including physics. But which ones to use will depend on the problem at hand. ",
