            "answer_text": "Some of if depends on how you plan to finish or publish your book. If you are self-publishing it is up to you to chose, and connect with an illustrator and supply them with all the relevant details (& pay them, obviously). If you have the required drawing talent then of course drawing them yourself is also a fantastic option. If you are following through with a more traditional publishing route then you simply submit your manuscript and the publishers will provide/choose an illustrator for you. (If they accept your manuscript.) Most publishing company\u2019s websites will ask that illustrations are not included in the submission. Don\u2019t know where to find illustrators (you\u2019re talking to one - hi! nice to meet you) there are a number of sites that can help. Upwork is one of the better known sites but I would also say that simply asking established illustrators that you follow on social media or found through friends might work just as well. (However keep in mind that they can be busy or simply don\u2019t know you from Adam so being polite and understanding that 30+ illustrations is not a 40$ job that can be completed in a day is key.) Best of luck! ",
