            "answer_text": "The total entropy of the universe can never decrease. Entropy can decrease somewhere, provided it increases somewhere else by at least as much. For Example: Imagine, you are filling a giant balloon with hot air. Upon filling air into it, the balloon's entropy increases. At a point it will break. But to avoid that culminating point of increase in entropy, you have stopped filling the hot air and released that hot air into a very small room where you are. Now you will feel warmer. Suddenly it rains, so you will feel humid and you will begin to sweat. This sweating is a result of increase in entropy within your body. The disorderness caused by the balloon and the environment interacts with your body to create a disorderness within, and it expels through sweat which in turn evaporates to stay in equilibrium with the entropy of the universe. Hence the entropy of a system decreases only when it interacts with some other system whose entropy increases in the process. ",

            "answer_text": "Third law of thermodynamics says that Entropy is zero at absolute zero kelvin So in order to reduce entropy you need to reduce the temperature by cooling the system But by reducing the temperature the heat gets more disorgananized and the amount of heat which can be converted to work reduces as the Unavailable Energy increases Heat at higher temperature is of higher quality ie have more ability to perform work than heat at lower temperature with less entropy.
