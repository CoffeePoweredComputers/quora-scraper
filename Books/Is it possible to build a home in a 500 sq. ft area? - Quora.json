            "answer_text": "By 500sq.ft area, I\u2019m thinking that you have a lot 500 square feet. First off, I doubt that you zoning would allow it, but assuming that this lot is in an area that would permit it, you are not looking at a very large lot to begin with. 500 sq.ft is only something like 20\u2032X25\u2032 and could be 10\u2032X50\u2032 so your house would have to be less than that to allow for eavestrough and drainage unless your able to build right to the lot line like in commercial areas of cities. To have any decent size house, you would need a basement and probably three floors so you could get three or four bedrooms unless your planning on having to old hillbilly style house where you cook, eat and sleep pretty much in the same room. If you do have multiple floor, you have to remember that stairs will take away up to 100 square feet from each floor to allow for negotiating the different floors. Then you need at least one bathroom as you don\u2019t even have room for an outhouse on a plot of land that small. ",

Nowhere near 22\u2032 x 22\u2032. 500 sf would be a BIG apartment in Tokyo or New York city. The design will likely have to be multi-purpose with many built-ins, but it\u2019s a great design exercise! Here is a plan that\u2019s approx 500 SF.  ",
