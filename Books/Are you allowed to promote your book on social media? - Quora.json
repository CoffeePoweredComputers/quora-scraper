            "answer_text": "Of course\u2026in fact, today it is essential that writers develop what\u2019s called a platform to help them get a publishing deal. A platform is essentially a pre-built audience for your work, and you build it, primarily, with your own website and social media. I recommend that you consider starting an author website with a blog in which you discuss your writing practice, the writing community you are a part of, the topic or genre of your book or something similar. You can also post book reviews, and talk about other products related to writing, like music you might listen to, products you use, other artists, etc. Then you can share your posts on social media via Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram and other networks. Thanks for the A2A. ",

We\u2019ve found that they get A LOT more engagement by sharing a sample of their writing on social media instead of JUST showing the book cover.  I would suggest creating a large collection of visual excerpts to post and draw people in that way. Good luck in your promotions! ",
