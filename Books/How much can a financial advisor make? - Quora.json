            "answer_text": "Simply ask. As a matter of fact this is one of the critical pieces of information to know about your advisers - how are they compensated? They should be able to tell you this in clear, concise and understandable terms. If it seems fuzzy or takes a lot of explaining, then you might not be working with an adviser who is at the top of the Ethics ladder. People who sell products usually do so for a commission, which can lead to conflicts of interest where they are eager to \u2018sell\u2019 something (incentive) whether or not it is in your best interest to do so. Best way to find out is to ask them how much money they earn if they don\u2019t \u2018sell\u2019 this to you? Some are planners who work for a set amount per plan and then perhaps a retainer to monitor your plan over time. It is usually up to you to complete the components such as obtaining proper insurance, investment, estate and tax services outside of their plan. Many money managers work on a fee based system, such as a percentage of Assets Under Management (AUM). If you bring in $800,000 to invest and your adviser can grow that to $1,000,000 - you are usually happy and in turn, the adviser is usually happy as now they are earning a % on a larger sum of money. Conversely, if that $800,000 becomes $600,000, well you are usually not very happy and the adviser is now earning a % on a smaller amount of funds. It would tend to align the adviser\u2019s objectives with yours. Some advisers operate on a performance based formula whereby a strike is set and investment account performance above that strike will generate a fee or perhaps an increase in the fee above a certain rate. Bottom line: there are all sorts of people out there who call themselves financial advisers and who operate across the entire spectrum of the insurance and investment world. See experienced, capable and transparent advisers when choosing who to put on your team! ",

            "answer_text": "Amounts vary widely by type of practice, location and many other factors. Assuming you are talking about working with a major brokerage - Wells Fargo/Smith Barney etc. - you can expect 50\u201360,000 first year and assuming you survive, your earnings will grow. Year five should see you earning between 100,000 and 300,000. Starting out as a fee-only advisor/financial planner, your income will be negative for the first few years, unless you are lucky enough to get hired by a large firm. Once established, around year two, your income will likely be 75,000 - 100,000l. By year five you should see something in excess of 250,000. ",
