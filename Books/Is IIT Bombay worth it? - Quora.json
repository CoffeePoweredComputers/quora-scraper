            "answer_text": "Yes it is worth all the effort. I am really happy to be here and am having the best days of my life. For engineering or for anything, it is completely worth it. This place brings about a change in you that you never would have ever imagined. Edit: I would like to add a few more details to my answer to support my claim. As a chemical engineer, here in IIT Bombay, the professors are in the league of the best in the world. I have had great interaction with my professors and every single one of them has been of great motivation for me. So academically, this is the place you want to be. Competition: Being surrounded by the best brains of the country makes me think harder and work harder for everything around here. Healthy competition is required for growth and this is what I get as stimulus for my brain and body. Seeing people around me achieve great heights, makes me set my goals higher. Fun: At IIT Bombay, through my first year itself, I have been exposed to a lot more cultural activities than ever. Dance, Drama, Music, Movies, you name it. Everything is right here. You can have fun anytime of the year - yes, during exams too(a little different fun though). This keeps my mind healthy and has helped me explore a lot of different activities and get more out of life. It is an ecosystem by itself. It is the environment that one would want for their daily lives. We use public transport, no littering, have sports in our hostels, inter-hostels, PAF and literally everything here. If still you aren't sure why is IIT Bombay worth it, well pm me, I'll be glad to help. :) ",

            "answer_text": "When you are preparing to get into a college:Yes. Definitely. It will motivate you to work harder, time after time during those two years of IIT-JEE preparation, to get into that top 50-100 AIR, so that you can get CS in the college of your choice. You continue to study, even if, 2 days after you start your preparation you are faced with the sad reality that you most likely won't get to do CS @ IITB. However, that extra work you put in will definitely hold you in good stead. When you actually get into a college:Those who strove to improve their performance and knowledge, to get into IITB or another IIT, and failed will still have a choice of something to do. And they should accept that without regret, although they usually never do, drop a year, and try and even do worse. Then there are those, who join a college because they gave up and didn't do well enough for clearing IIT-JEE. Some of them, like me, let that event go by without regrets. Many others have regrets. So, yes, IITB is worth it while you prepare to get it. Consider it the carrot of the carrot and the stick approach (with the stick being possible poverty and joblessness). Once you get in, though, if you get into IITB, then it should be a good occasion (but you still have to slog), and if you don't, then you probably got into the best place you could get into realistically.
