            "answer_text": "It\u2019s mostly residential. Most tourists and residents of other boroughs in New York City will never set foot there. Nevertheless, it has historic Richmondtown, the Staten Island Yankees minor league baseball team (not to be confused with those other Yankees in the Bronx), and a decent sized zoo. Is it worth the trouble getting over there? Depends on what you like to do. If you\u2019re visiting New York long enough, you might consider spending a day out there, it\u2019s a change of pace from Manhattan, and even the other boroughs. You could always just take the ferry there and back, it is free and offers great views of Manhattan as well. ",
