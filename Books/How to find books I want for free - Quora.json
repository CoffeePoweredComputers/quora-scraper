            "answer_text": "Libraries are great places to read free books. If you live in most any civilized country, they\u2019ll have one, though I think America has many more. It\u2019s easy to get a library card. Bookbub and Goodreads are good places to seek out free books. They do have free books available, though most are merely reduced in price. On the other hand, .99 or $1.99 is not a bad price. I have never taken a free book because I\u2019ve never seen an offering with which I was familiar, either title or author; if I ever see one that I know of in advance\u2014snatch! Goodreads has book giveaways, though many people enter and few win. If you go on the Internet, just type in \u201cfree books,\u201d and you\u2019ll get a list of places to check out. Inexpensive books are available at used book stores, library book sales, and thrift stores. I enjoy \u201cthe hunt,\u201d and part of the fun is coming across a title I don\u2019t own and haven\u2019t seen in an eternity, then getting it at a bargain price. I once got a hardback copy of *Nicholas and Alexandra* by Robert K. Massie, a classic biography / history for $5, and when I took it home, I found it was *autographed!* Even if I return home with nothing (a rare event), I\u2019ve had fun looking. Ask a book-owner to borrow books he / she owns. I really enjoy it when someone asks to borrow one of my books, though I do have a price: when you return it, tell me if you liked it (or didn\u2019t) and why. I enjoy such discussions. Happy hunting!

You can usually request books there if they don\u2019t have them, too. You may also be able to join groups or fan clubs for the types of books you want, and take advantage of author giveaways and free book promotions. Often authors will give away the first book in a series for free, in order to inspire people to buy the rest. (After all, if people don\u2019t BUY books, authors have no reason to write them in the first place; we aren\u2019t doing this as charity work)! :) There are many reasons a person would be unable to afford to buy books; and that\u2019s why public libraries exist. Libraries buy the books that are in their collection, so authors don\u2019t lose out completely. Hope this helps. :) ",

The only time you have to pay is if you get fined for an overdue or damaged book.  I've had a library card since I was about 5. The past couple of years, I haven't used it much due to not having enough time on my hands to justify checking out at least four new books. I love it. The librarians are helpful, and lovely, and you get free books! ",
