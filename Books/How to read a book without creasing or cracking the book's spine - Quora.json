            "answer_text": "Quentin Stephens has given you the answer for hardbacks. Looking at the books strewn around me at the moment, I notice to my astonishment that there is one paperback which has a pristine spine. It is Sum by David Eagleman, a thin book of very short stories of which I have been reading one each day. The pages are not numbered, but Amazon says it has 130. Because each story is only two or three pages, I have not opened it up flat. Normally, I want a book to lie flat for ease of reading, but with this one I am only reading for a minute or two, so the minor irritation of the pages not wanting to stay open on their own is not bothering me. Maybe I am weird, in fact I have been called odd to my face more than once, but I don\u2019t care if my books get tatty. I am known to write notes in them, drop them in the bath, get chocolate smudges on the pages and tea rings on the covers. This is one of the privileges of owning books rather than borrowing them from a library, that I can do whatever I want with them. The ones most disgusting in appearance, one of which has lost its cover altogether, are the most read and loved. I enjoy reading books, and don\u2019t care at all about their monetary value (none of mine has much) or appearance. In fact, I have a friend who has bookcases which appear to me to be for display purposes only, and it always makes me feel sorry for her poor unread books which seem neglected simply because they are unnaturally perfect. But I am waffling, because it is late and I am tired. Pray, enjoy your books in whatever way pleases you. Don\u2019t open your paperbacks fully if you want to protect their spines, and reading only slim volumes could help. ",

It\u2019s just that pink unicorn cult trying to spread lies. I won\u2019t let them, so I\u2019m here to tell you the truth. Step 1: Put your head on a book like this:  This photo isn\u2019t entirely accurate. You need to have the book closed if you don\u2019t want to crease or crack the spine. Step 2: Fall asleep. Step 3: Perform osmosis. Step 4: Wake up and go through the rest of your day with the knowledge that you just gained from the book. Be sure to put the book in a safe place so you don\u2019t undo the hard work you went through to read it. ",

This is far more difficult with a paperback book than it is with a hardbound book. For the latter, never, EVER lie the book face down and open. When you see books standing on a library shelf with a lopsided spine, it\u2019s nearly always because careless or unaware readers flopped the volume down with the two hard covers up, thereby weakening the spine.

You are holding all the paper pages. Now let some pages of the front of the book drop. let a like amount drop from the back of the book. Repeat front and back until you are done. What you\u2019ve done is make the internal spine flexible. ",

If the books is 300+ pages, the spine will get creased when you open it fully. Unless, you manage to keep it on a desk while you read, and not open the book more than 90 degrees. However, that would make it a very uncomfortable reading experience. Easier solution - E-books and audio books (but then, you\u2019ve already thought of these). ",
