            "answer_text": "If you want something really close to Dan Brown, that will be a tough ask but two names spring to mind. Ian Caldwell - Just two books, start with The Rule of FourUmberto Eco - Thrillers, but with a complexity both in language and concepts that Dan Brown would not be able to match. Start with The Name of The Rose and work from there. There is also a Sean Connery movie on itI see that Raunaq\u2019s answer has covered quite a few books, so I\u2019ll just add a few of my own picks Eric Ambler\u2019s Mask of Dimitrios,Bleeding Heart Square, Andrew TaylorFrozen Death, Bernard MinierBed Of Nails, Antonin VarenneA Foreign Country, Charles CummingAn Officer and a Spy, Robert HarrisDead Lions, Mick HerronThe Bourne Trilogy, Robert LudlumWorld at Night, Alan FurstThe Secret Agent, Joseph ConradIf you want to do this author wise, I would give a list as follows, Robert LudlumLen DeightonKen FollettWilbur SmithCormac MccarthyJohn Le CarreFrederick ForsythTom ClancyElmore LeonardApologies for the redundancies. Happy reading. Cheers. ",
