            "answer_text": "My sister and wife who have both read Twilight agree that the books are bad enough, they are poorly written with bad plotting, 1-dimensional characters and terrible dialogue. But the movies are even worse with terrible acting - Kristen Stewat has one facial expression and been out acted by CGI trees, and crappy directing. Even Rifftrax had trouble making the movies watchable and they made Batman & Robin funny ",
