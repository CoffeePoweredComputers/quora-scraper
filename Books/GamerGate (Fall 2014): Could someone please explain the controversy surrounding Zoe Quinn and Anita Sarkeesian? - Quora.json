            "answer_text": "For much of human history, anything that constitutes a career has been largely male-dominated, even in stereotypically \u201cwomanly\u201d fields such as professional cooking. As video games became a major professional presence in the 90s, they were also affected (though you\u2019ll find a lot more successful women in Japanese industries, such as composer Yoko Shimomura, compared to in the West.) One aspect of male-dominated careers is the harassment of women in or related to the workplace, including falsely accusing them of using fraud or sexual favors to advance their careers. Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn actually did use fraud (and in Quinn\u2019s case, sexual favors) to advance their careers, as testified by many other women they\u2019ve worked with since long before GamerGate. They were able to get away with this partially by portraying all attempts to hold them accountable as misogynistic slander as detailed above. The other reason they got away with it is because the Internet decided that one of the ways to \u201chold them accountable\u201d was to physically threaten them, going so far as to SWAT Sarkeesian (i.e. make a fraudulent call to the police who then stormed her house and arrested her at gunpoint with a strong risk of shooting her.) This naturally destroyed any sympathy for anti-Sarkeesian sentiments, so effectively that I suspect the so-called feminists themselves may have arranged it. I have personally witnessed Sarkeesian bullying women who do not conform to her ideals. She is an excellent example of a \u201cfeminist\u201d who is really a chauvinist, just with a different ideal forced onto women. She still tells them what to think and feel about themselves, and she still tells them that someone else is doing their thinking for them when they don\u2019t agree with her, while pretending she knows what\u2019s best for women, just like the male chauvinists before her. Look how immensely profitable that\u2019s turned out for her. She even got a seat on the United Nations (itself a corrupt and hypocritical tyrant masquerading as a savior.) People like Sarkeesian and Quinn, and the idiots who empowered them by doxxing and swatting them, paved the way for the modern \u201cdon\u2019t even have to hide it\u201d villains who exploit controversial topics for their own egos, as we now best see thanks to Trump.

            "answer_text": "Edit: 20th October, 2014 - What I have written, I don't need to change too much.  Responding to this  2 months later, there is more coverage, more hype, more sensational views and opinions than before. And the idea of a Preface would be great to keep new people connected to the discussion.  The crazy hashtag brigading (a term I hadn't heard before August) is still impressive and impassive.Topsy and Google popularity of hashtags & search queries is still staying steady, and GamerGate is not becoming balkanized or manageable as expected by the press, but emboldened and semi organised, not on 4chan, but 8chan and reddit.  And in my opinion, GamerGate has changed to be more than an inciting incident, it has a better chance of being a viable consumer activism model for ethics, if treated as rational discussion rather than as fanatics or degenerate, entitled, or privileged fans acting as man-children. GamerGate has shown to be capable enough to remove aligned or  toxic from the discussion.  Second, the debate about harassment is also not viable now, because it is not part of the strategy or feedback from the GamerGate side, it is simply not being used by the people who are talking about GamerGate , or on the discussions.  If you want a TL;DR skip ahead until you see the bullet points.  Here be oceans of paragraphs.  A month has also been spent reading all of the references, checking facts and so on. Dan Golding's tumblr on the end of gamers sparked the topic first, and was repeated elsewhere later that day. Critical Distance has also stepped badly in critical thinking and analysis of the topic, but it is at the mercy of coverage and not able to maintain interpretation of materials and posts. The other issue I've ignored is feminists and feminism. I very often feel as if I learn less about feminism the longer I spend looking at modern feminism's values and academics, because of the disconnect in people calling themselves feminist to justify abuse and intolerance. I have to frequently remind myself that it's only a fraction of activists creating the veneer of justice to shroud criticism and responsibility for their actions and advice.  And some great sources of valuable conversation are crowded out by adopting the populist hatred and rhetoric. I just don't know that many women in tech, who are self described feminists, and are able to articulate, critique,  discuss or decry feminism. It's probably a lost voice in a large crowd, I assume it exists though, because it is a very large community, but I cannot tell fact from faction.  The outcome of the Intel boycott decision has had a huge impact on setting the tone for the debate about issues, and it's also set the level of discourse a bar higher as a result of appeasing both readers, corporate and the advertisers.  Some of this has been hijacked by the recent introduction of Brianna Wu, who was threatened for retweeting a bad taste meme, accused 8chan of doxxing her and showing harassing tweets with her address. And then appeared on TV to talk about it.  And while the notion of culture, community and hate groups comes up, a lot, there are a lot of issues that are not coming up in news coverage online at all. Interviews with developers were made, discussion of context and events are muddled, and voices are excluded still.  Recent coverage has decried GamerGate as female harassment without specifics, and sometimes, occasionally mentioning ethics. If anything, the moderate, popular and marginal 'academic' issues of ethics are overshadowed by a few people who have personal grievances. If GamerGate is a hate group, I'm still going to be a member, because of a simple dilemma; if Gamergate, even as flawed and unfortunate as it is, can change the way that games are used, made, seen and understood by others, then GamerGate has made a positive change to my life, my career and created a better future for millions of people. It doesn't need to be compared to ISIL or ISIS or the KKK, it just has to change the conversation from harassment to serious questions about ethics and standards for informed discussion. And outside of the press, it is doing this quite often with positive or mixed results. The same can easily be said for academics in gaming, with a higher degree of meddling and incongruent discussion. Academic discussion of ethics, culture and heritage, is welcome, but also isolated. Few discussions are made public, and conclusion is often created by a community based bubble reality, with its own hierarchy of peers and language.  Generally, if people can discuss GamerGate with tolerance, uncensored, open and balanced feedback, even if it is difficult or distasteful discussion. Places like KiA, GamerGhazi, and the Escapist, are keeping the discussion reasonable and ordered, and a few history sites exist that have catalogued the extremes on both sides, including a much richer backstory and discussion of previous culture issues at hand. I have also chosen to read through some of the most alienating, abusive, illogical, hateful tumblr, reddit, SomethingAwful, blog/forum  threads and twitter posts and alternative hashtags over the last 2 months, and I'm hard to offend.  A good portion were written by people who are not going to be affected by GamerGate, except by the arguments or sides taken. I've also been grief stricken by reading posts from celebrities, professionals and authors who are simply not going to take the time to learn about games or gamers, or understand that they've been misled into the discussion by emotional bait and switch. I chose to stop updating the list, because there are better places now that exist to discuss the issues raised, and I'm also considerably lazy.  The list acts as a counterpoint to the accusations of harassment being the main narrative of the events, and highlights certain actors as being responsible for events.  September has been a month to remember, the largest counterpoint has been the revelations of collusion and disturbing actions from the game journalist mailing list, GameJournoPros on breitbart. I have only seen 5 decent articles on the issues brought up, and a fair amount of hack journalism trying to avoid the need to discuss game journalists as news. It's also brought up a few interesting stories, Eron was sued for what I assume is Canada's version of defamation, not libel, which also brought up a series of personal biographies told by people who have met Zoe Quinn before she was Zoe Quinn.  I'd like to say I'm neutral on the topic, but the things I've said, the actions and comments of the professional people who should be conscious of their actions, and so on, prevent me from being entirely passive, neutral,  or an apologist on the issues. More recently, we've also heard about stories spiked, people fired and how the GameJournoPros list was involved in getting a writer fired for writing an article about indiegogo fraud, and it turning into an even bigger story about harassment and bigotry.  I will play devil's advocate, always, because it is the right choice to make. In another month, people will have written books about GamerGate. They will mostly be flawed gems in a sea of familiar opinions.  Also, as much as I haven't talked about Anita Sarkeesian, and this is a flaw noted by others, nothing that she has done, has changed discourse or opinions. Her work is lauded and summarily ignored as a result of the audience that she is catering for, ie. Non-Gamers.  It is difficult to decompile the subject of representatives of women in games, it has come up as far back as nude texture packs in the 90's, or Miss Packman, etc. Feminism has also been tied to violence and simulacra, or desensitisation to violence in games amongst other 'popular' issues in game studies.  For the non-tech audience, feminism, women, tropes and culture issues, should be an easy subject to talk about within a month if you have any interest in the subject and a room to record video. Many round table discussions exist on google talk, college students could write up the topic, given how similar it is to content from TVTropes on the same subject.  GamerGate as a community is based in a reality that is indifferent to anything else online, because it is comprised of a subset of millions of people, with vast views of what they see as problems with the industry.  Some of the actions and call to arms are being spearheaded by mens rights activists, as well as feminist activists, and pundits with extraordinary access to the popular opinions.  And so, I return.  I do have to acrimoniously agree with the points made in the article linked by Glyn Williams, from Owen Grieve.  The subtext of this controversy is deeply rooted in an anti-culture of misogyny, surrounded by a lot of observers and pundits revealing their opinions; However, having followed this since the first day, it has evolved into a veritable series of abuse, issues and latent discourse that hasn't taken place before in the wider community. Because of the Length, i've created a brief index: Preface.Drama, group narcissism and biasEthics in Journalism/BloggingTeam Misogyny vs Social Justice vs everyone elseContext \u2013 is this a story ? does it all matter ?Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotional ManipulationDepression Quest and SteamEron Gjoni, and Zoe Quinn5 names, and how it spun off from sexism to corruption.\u201cbrief\u201d timeline summary of events over 3+ weeksFor a TL;DR version, skip to tbe bullet points at the bottom of the article for a brief summary without the dialogue. Preface The important thing to keep in mind is, most of this is purely online harassment, and occasional public criticism or cronyism. Very few actions have progressed to arrests. individuals, or in-person harassment, with the exceptions being PAX Prime events, the online and phone / internet harassment of Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn, are noted and highlighted, and very few non-social-media communications have taken place,  And of those events where people have been harassed, threatened with rape, violence, murder, or sent photoshopped child pornography, there's also a lot of accusations of victimhood and attention seeking for publicity, among real publicity of the events, people being disgusted, or acting out in kind against others. it is generally appalling behavior, and standing in the middle can be abusive. Money is involved, several thousands of people have been libelled, vilified, criticized, and pilloried in the public through the media, dozens of people were hacked, busines and financial records, images, and their careers revealed in lurid details, public figures have been shamed in public for their words in private. Some avoided the spotlight and scandal, only to be discovered through their actions to reveal their aims and actions put into motion by others.  Even those in the media have been attacked on the basis of their actions, their connections and work history, and the use of their power, influence, and their choices made against the public, and arguably, the illusion of games news as kingmakers, independents and experts is shattered by the recent actions of several bad actors within a globally influential industry. We will still have bad actors using the events to spurn others and to isolate women into sectional communities or 'safe spaces' and cliques, but the public can also work to create an equal footing and audience. Women will be able to stand in the same public spotlight and now not have to face the same scrutiny as their peers; it also means that they will have to work harder to get there. Arguably, women and men will also have to know how to deal with the public and the pressures of having all that attention focused on them, and not to the toxic voices of an insulated community of peers. This is a harder journey to make, but it is a more worthwhile one in the long run for all gamers and all developers, and if they can change, also some very few journalists and games news sites along the way to broadcast and share in these events. We don't need to see another Phil Fish, or Zoe Quinn, being demonised for imagined sleights or shamed for personal actions, and treated like ordinary people instead of public figures to be pilloried. Group Narcissism, Bias and Drama Avoiding drama, avoiding bias, and discovering truth relies on a broader encapsulation of the people and actions involved. And it becomes even harder when we\u2019re not associated with the people involved, their lives become fantasy, delusion or nightmare in our disconnected  collective empathy.  Commentary, opinion, feedback, and criticism can also become magnified by the faceless aspect of anonymity and disinhibition, from dysrationalia to group think to other forms of cognitive bias, all online cultures often face outwards or inwards to police themselves from the community of others.  And during this controversy, the bias of a handful of online communities comes under speculation and attention, perhaps unfairly, because they are more open and effacing, they have had far more scrutiny. Arguably, this controversy is entirely isolated to a very small series of online communities of people, and as such, it lives and dies on hype, attention and drama.  And a fair amount of bile, hatred and unchecked irrational actions. Bias, and the online community Because the topic of ethics and opinions of ethics comes up, we do have to underline something important, Bias.  Especially in a Social Network medium, hatred is impersonal. But in this case, it is up front, extremely vicious and hateful and connected to people who are public figures, either on the small or larger stage of the public. And while this can be empowering, it is also revealing in the way that this story has affected and catalysed people to evaluate the internet\u2019s self-imposed moral guardians, and those that seek to champion the rights of people in the community, or those that willingly seek the truth, or seek an audience, and how those actions have spurred even more people to attack others. Bias, is why people recuse themselves from professional interaction, because that bias is human and rather exceptional and ordinary for society.  We might call it friendship, socialising or networking, but bias removes impartiality. It even strengthens when you perceive threats or find alternate opinions; bias is one of the strongest causal reasons for factions behaving the way they do. Bias creates polarity in discussion, people ignore basic agreements and revert to their emotional or limbic responses when threatened or questioned. Misogyny and Misandry might be cousins in hatred and disrespect, but it is nothing compared to silence. silence kills more people than hatred. especially among social animals.  Bias, is both normal and insidious, and it is the ordinary kind of corruption we face on an everyday basis, whether we realise it or not.  It is exceptionally strong in groups, and causes a lot of problems that are systemic and corruptive when we assume behaviors within groups that would not be tolerated by individuals or even police. This is the essential part of group think, the decisions made while under the perception of being part of a campaign or community, alter behavior, beliefs, language and actions. Ethics of Journalism Of particular importance later on, is the code of ethics in journalism,http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp In this story, there are so many events that it needs to be filtered through some kind of lens. I chose to look at this entire story, through the events as reported by bloggers, journalists, and the people who wrote about it in forums and online, and how the media reports issues, flavours the actions of crowds and can sway opinion, hate and respect. it is an impactful and powerful responsibility.  As such, it becomes critical we know what a journalist is, and isn\u2019t. This is the standard of a journalist, and what every editor would use to critique work before publication, and after publication.  Seek Truth and Report ItEthical journalism should be accurate and fair. Journalists should be honest and courageous in gathering, reporting and interpreting information. Minimize HarmEthical journalism treats sources, subjects, colleagues and members of the public as human beings deserving of respect. Act IndependentlyThe highest and primary obligation of ethical journalism is to serve the public. Be Accountable and TransparentEthical journalism means taking responsibility for one\u2019s work and explaining one\u2019s decisions to the public. Team Misogyny vs. Social Justice vs. Them/Other. Yes, real people are affected by misogyny and it is a real and present threat to people, I don't dismiss the impact it has on people on a daily level, nor would I do so. As someone who has been sexually assaulted and harassed, verbally and physically, in separate and numerous incidents, I can fundamentally appreciate the opinions, impact, and belief structures in play for misandry and misogyny combined.  In this case, it is a catalyst for a lot of other issues that has lasted longer than would be warranted, due to interference by 2 sets of collectives trying to defend 2 very alien ideals that are very poorly understood by the other side. If you choose to belong to either side, you will be subject to the entire list of social bias, group think, and all the neurotic and group behaviors that go along with associating with other people under a common banner or self-image. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biaseshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_narcissism And like all internet derived controversies, group association can come across as unorganised and dissembled once you take it apart, but, it becomes a lot meaner and nastier due to the nature of broadcasted opinions and personal connections involved, and then there's the magnifying force that the social network media of the internet brings to small and large issues. Context \u2013 Is this a real story? Does it all matter ? In context,   \u200bOn this page you can see the relative strength of these 5 search queries and the coverage of various people during the event over the previous month. The relative strength of these search terms also doesn't cover social media or posts that were deleted after the 18th to 20th. For a TL;DR version, skip to tbe bullet points. Context, comes from a variety of sources, and where possible, i have tried to find alternative or parallel sources of content.  we have the help of GeekFeminism Wiki,http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_incidents efforts by Wizardchan to show a collective timeline of incidents to show previous behaviour and trendshttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16m54TH3XTwAcYAFJdq-g9s3Y4reQNS9UgLG6DYXpa_4/edit#gid=0 A Narrative of #GamerGate and Examination of Claims of Collusion with 4chan Also linked is a list of 'problem' articles from journalists and sites that are not covering the issue entirely, or using click-bait titles, with dates, journalist names, etc. from Encyclopedia Dramatica (ED is a biased source, but reference material is not.) In order to sync events and remove unsubstantiated content, I have omitted and concatenated/revised articles. To cover the timeline wholly, it's important to go back a little because there's a lot of parallel things going on. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Emotional Manipulation. I don\u2019t know where or when or if I should mention Zoe\u2019s condition in connection to the events, because it should not excuse or relate, but it is something that comes up that adds credence to later actions and motives, even if it partially places emphasis on and discredits Zoe Quinn personally, or makes me look vindictive or that it is a thinly veiled attack of her personally.  Diagnosis, especially reductive diagnosis, is admittedly a form of victim blaming, victim shaming and offensively sexist. It is not something that should explain or encapsulate Ms. Quinn\u2019s motives or actions, even if it can do so, because I\u2019d extend the benefit of the doubt to anyone. There is also the question of overdiagnosed BPD in females as a feminist issue of shaming or controlling 'difficult' personalities or women in general  through diagnosis and treatment; due to the prevalent focus on emotional hypomania as an initial diagnostic method. And i'd somewhat agree, psychological diagnosis of BPD has to rely on more than a handful of criteria, i would only consider BPD to be influential if it affected cognition and equality or perception, and in my opinion, BPD is more than narcissism or bipolar tendencies or emotional dysfunction, it is also able to cognitively impair perception and empathy, as well as create a fictional or delusional correlation of events and of self. Over 3 weeks, it has been harder to disalign the person from the condition, due to the expanding influences and people in her social circle that are acting on her behalf in making grand or questionable accusations.  Her actions in dealing with the organisation TFYC highlight one of several connected issues in people with BPD dealing with others. An excellent summary of Borderline Personality Disorder, which aligns with observed behaviour is herehttp://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/11/29/1251025/-Borderline-Personality-Disorder-Heroic-Martyr-or-Emotional-Vampire For someone with BPD, they don't often admonish or relate their behavior to this condition, which can have detrimental effects, and create divisive or toxic relationships.  The personal information from eron's posts, Zoe's revelation of a mother with BPD, and her diagnosis, as well as later social interactions with her peers, and in contacts with other professionals and in speech and public interaction creates emphasis on noting the condition. and as such, it lends some evaluation to critiques of her public persona and public actions over the last 2 years.  Borderline Personality disorder is also marked by severe or manic depression, that can occur separately or in tandem with BPD symptoms. Depression Quest  and Steam After the Approval for release of Depression Quest (August 11th, 2014) on Steam's Greenlight program for independent or small games developers, Zoe Quinn was in a public relations dilemma after the death of Robin Williams to Bipolar Depression, coinciding with the approval of Depression Quest for release.  The timing could not have been worse in some ways for an already beleaguered developer, experiencing threats and harassment in the steam community and on Twitter, Tumblr, and in the public. When the game was first approved (in January 2013) and officially released (valentines day, 2013), to then promote the game she and her associates had developed in 2012 to the broad 7 million active gamers every day on the Steam Community & Store, This seemed like a good day. For the wider Steam audience who had not seen the game before, Depression Quest was not received well, feedback is filled with both spiteful and with generally poor reviews. Of the positive and mixed feedback from players, their comments also match the general feedback of players of the 2012 release, in that the game is less of a visual novel, and more of an Interactive Fiction tale in which responses are outlined, but limited, so that gameplay is more about experience than choices. People who had experience with depression noted that the experience seemed to be \"in the right place\" Other commenters were less positive.   1,855 Reviews of Depression Quest (sorted by steam user votes) Eron Gjoni Later in the same week as the release of Depression Quest, Eron Gjoni released a stinging and personal tirade on his ex girlfriend, (August 16th, 2014) accusing her of having a number of relationships with others while they were seeing each other, and accused her of being generally dishonest, manipulative, untrustworthy and controlling, among other invective. As noted by both Eron and Zoe in separate social domains, this was a private matter, and should not have been reflected on in the public domain, but it came to the attention of the wider gaming community through the efforts of others when others began to tie the tirade from Eron, into naming the alluded people in Zoe's Social graph/Network. 5 Names, and how it spun out from sexism to corruption  What created attention, was when MundaneMatt created a video describing Eron Gjoni\u2019s post, (which was sent to him from a forum post that no longer exists due to later censoring), was then taken down by a DMCA request from a \u2018zoe quinn\u2019, also the name of her youtube account, for including a still image of the game Depression Quest. At the same time that people were reacting to the post by Eron, on twitter, Tumblr and gaming forums, the invocation of the DMCA brought along a new crowd of speculation, and curiosity from critics and bloggers, and on gaming forums.  TotalBiscuit responded to the drama in a neutral fashion, addressing the developer's use of the DMCA to remove criticism should never be a good tactic. Due to the Streisand effect of highlighting the problem being covered up, creates intense speculation. Videos from InternetAristocrat became popular, because there was no initial coverage of the story, and while the content was viciously sexist and misogynistic, using the Five Guys restaurant as the motif for the \"quinnspiracy\" video, for many it was the only source of news on the topic.  It covered an enormous amount of material, and painted the picture for people, and galvanised people when forum posts were being deleted, users banned from forums and reddit posts discussing it were being deleted, users shadowbanned, and criticism leading to deletion on several forums. Eventual efforts in trying to sort the story from misinformation, deception, invective, shaming, blame and all sorts of emotive efforts by one side or the other, did not get to take place, because what happened brought it to the attention of thousands, if not millions.  Journalists had been contacted, but it was largely being ignored, due to the personal attacks and slander / misogyny and shaming of Ms Quinn in the video(s) and on the forums which were discussing it. And due to the deletion of threads, the trail of who and what was done in the early parts of these events is lost, only the archives and logs of uncensored forums like reddit and 4chan exist to recreate the narrative.  Various sides took part to fill in the subtext, and assign reductive blame to groups or individuals. From there, more people have spoken out, more voices have been heard, silenced, threatened, shamed, guiled, baited, trolled, defended and harassed. And what happened next was that Anita Sarkeesian, Adam Baldwin, Tim Schafer, and several games related critics and reviewers all decided to back various people and opinions, creating the entire  series of GamerGate events. What made this spin out from a simple spat into a controversy is the speculated names of the people who were revealed included a games journalist who had reviewed her game while in a relationship with her, Nathan Grayson. Stephen Totillo, Nathan's boss at Kotaku refuted this claim a week later, after other publications were soon talking about the abuse towards Zoe Quinn.  The issue came back into the spotlight after people replied that the relationship started 1 day after Nathan's article was posted, while other writers were being shamed into revealing that they were donating money to developers through patreon, a breach of ethics to some observers.  Arguably, the most prolific record of these events, comes from an IRC log of 4chan's public #burgersandfries room, which discusses all of the events, and proposes a lot of indirect and direct actions. Zoe Quinn and others had been recording the room, and Zoe Quinn posted selected excerpts under the hashtag #GameOverGate. Except, that it is still ongoing, even a week later, as people reconcile events and reactions.

            "answer_text": "It started with the boyfriend of a game developer releasing information about people she had allegedly cheated on him with. No one really cared until someone noticed that ene of those people was someone who had given her game a positive review, prompting people to start investigating personal relationships that were not disclosed by video game journalists when they should have been. While this specific event ultimately had little significance alone, it prompted a movement where there were investigations (by private citizens) uncovering an embarrassing number of instances like this and other ethical violations that would not fly in mainstream journalism. At this point, most people didn't know or care. But on one day, seven major gaming news sites or blogs of prominent video game news journalists all ran the same story. Every one had a similar message \u201cgamers are dead\u201d. This was referring to the identity of a gamers. Over the few days, sixteen of these articles would be published. In them, the media criticized gamers for not doing right by the media. According to them, all of the investigations were literally nothing but sexism. Even though most of them were about male journalists. (Note that while gamergate investigated undisclosed personal connections between video game developers and journalists, they only criticized the journalists. Gamer gate was about the media and NOT about developers, though it is true that when they revealed this information, a lot of people obviously were upset at the developers and they got a lore of hate over it). They claimed that gamers (their own audience) were categorically bad people. Obviously this was an even bigger scandal than the undisclosed relations, and this was when gamergate became big. Not only had the media declared their whole audience the enemy (even though most still hadn't even heard of gamergate), they revealed that they all worked together to create this agenda. That many major gaming news sites writing the same article on the same day was pretty damning proof. And for the first time, a large of people were seeing the media straight up lie about things that they knew were not true (in my opinion, the behavior of the gaming media here led to an even greater trust of mainstream media in general). Gamer Gate persisted for a while, revealing more undisclosed relationships, revealing a list that proved a disturbing connection between many of the major gaming sites, and revealing bullying behavior of people in media that caused sites like gawker to lose millions when sponsors pulled out. However, they continued to claim gamergate was just about misogyny. And they had the bigger voice. This made things difficult for gamergate. But what ultimately caused gamergate to lose steam was two factors: It was a grassroots movement that never became centralized. It was not an organized movement. It had rules (focus on journalists not developers, not public releasing of private information not related to ethics violations, etc,), but no true leaders or set goals.As I mentioned earlier, people started turning their sights on the mainstream media. Most of the prominent members stop caring that much about gaming journalism, because honestly, it's not that big in the grand scheme of things and it has always sort of sucked. So they went on to \u201cbigger\u201d things.",

            "answer_text": "(Skip to the bottom if you want the TL;DR version) \"GamerGate\" is an event really started to blow up about 37 days ago. It mainly is taking place on Twitter; however, many sites, such as Kotaku, Polygon, Rock Paper Shotgun, FunnyJunk, and Wikipedia are involved as well in the controversy. The controversy is mainly two sided. There is those for GamerGate, who propose that gaming journalism is corrupted, along with the sites that are against gamergate (proposed sites that have become \"corrupted\" are 4chan, Wikipedia, Reddit, Kotaku, and others). Then, on the other side, we have those that believe that GamerGate is a sexist/anti-feminist hate campaign, as they propose that there is corruption in game development itself - watch Anita Sarkeesian's videos if you want a feel for their arguments for that. On the more extreme side, there are those against GamerGate who believe that all those who identify as \"gamers\" are misogynistic/evil/corrupt/sexist/etc, and a few have gone so far as to make death and rape threats against them. Not that this is a one-sided thing of course - with something of this magnitude, both sides have nut-jobs, doxxing and making threats against the other side. One guy even supposedly got shipped a hypodermic needle to his front door that contained a suspicious substance! TL;DR Version: It's a hashtag campaign, with one side saying game journalism is corrupt, and the other side saying gamers and game developers are corrupt. Both sides have nutjobs. People have been fired from their jobs for their opinions. It's a really big mess. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh boy. There's no way to answer this without offending the piss out of someone. I'll answer what I know, and give an analysis of the elements that made it interesting to the rest of the media, along with certain timely events that this was linked to, but I'd be remiss if I didn't remark that the conversation is a bit of a mine field. The Events/The Mess What is Being Reported: In August of this year, the ex-boyfriend of indie game developer Zoe Quinn, Eron Gjoni, posted allegations on his blog that she had exchanged sex with Kotaku journalist Nathan Grayson to get favorable reviews of her game, Depression Quest. On September 1st, ShortFatOtaku posted, then removed, then reposted a vlog poking fun at Quinn's sexual history and claiming that the woman holding the camera on both videos had talked to Gjoni in a 4chan IRC (\"burgers and fries\") and that he had disclosed that Quinn's PR agent may have been sleeping with the IGF chairman. The video posted by ShortFatOtaku speculates on a feminist/social justice illuminati that are taking over gaming, and accused Quinn's parent company, Silverstring Media, of being a part of that conspiracy. The video notes that companies and games that tend to win at the IGF are composed of clients, friends and colleagues of Silverstring Media. Kotaku editor Stephen Totilo confirmed that Quinn and Grayson were in a relationship, but noted that Grayson had never reviewed Quinn or her work after the commencement of the relationship. He notes that both her game and a failed show she had appeared on were mentioned on Kotaku before the relationship started. 4chan members reacted to this by speculating on various conspiracies involving feminist, social justice and media critics, and noted that Silverstring also has ties to the Digital Games Research Association, an academic institution that studies gaming and gaming phenomena. DiGRA had recently held a retreat for Silverstring members on dismantling hegemonic masculinity. DiGRA itself had done work with DARPA on a project called IMMERSE, prompting 4chan members to believe they had stumbled on to some sort of massive, government conspiracy. The group of gamers, 4chan members and assorted others who believed they had discovered a plot began to try and investigate IGF, DiGRA, Quinn and Silverstring more deeply, launching several operations against IGF sponsors in the form of letter and emailing writing campaigns, joining an ongoing letter writing campaign about the state of gaming.  Several youtube vloggers, including Boogie2988 and Jayd3Fox released vlogs and videos around this period served to interest several broad subsections of gamers in this and the previous campaigns against a spate of \"gaming is dead\" articles. Jayd3Fox linked this to Sarkesian's critiques of gaming, then took her vlog down, claiming to have been threatened by an anonymous woman over her videos critiquing Sarkesian. During this period, Quinn received a variety of threats, was doxxed repeatedly, and suffered wave after wave of harassment and hostility. Her father was called at home and told she was a whore, her head was photoshopped onto porn images, she was threatened with rape, death and serious bodily injury, including breaking her kneecaps if she attended conferences. Her most vocal supporters received the same treatment, causing Phil Fish of Polytron to sell his company and leave gaming after he and his private company information were doxxed repeatedly online. In response to this, Andreas Zechler of Spaces of Play wrote an open letter on September 1st to the gaming community, asking gamers to take a public stand against hateful and harassing speech in gaming. This petition was signed by 2,495 people in the gaming industry. This letter was picked up by a variety of mainstream news outlets, which again linked Sarkesian to Quinn and harassment in gaming. Boogie2988 responded by mounting his own petition, which agreed with Zechler but demanded game developers stop referring to gamers as neckbeards. This petition garnered over 9,000 signatures. At this point, Breitbart noticed and began to publish on gaming and the feminist bullies \"tearing it apart.\"  Other critics chimed in, including Dr. Hoff-Sommers. Al Jazeera published a piece on it during this period, causing another round of strife, both within those who felt there to be a feminist conspiracy and in those who felt that it amounted to a conspiracy theory. Those who felt there was a conspiracy responded to the article by publishing a screen cap of what they characterized as financial ties between a Jenn Frank, who wrote an article in The Guardian about the on-going harassment of Quinn and Sarkesian. The screen cap, of the journalist's Patreon Account, lists Zoe Quinn as a friend on that account. The Guardian and Frank both responded that Frank had disclosed the relationship and it was not judged to be a conflict of interest. The virulence of the harassment of Frank caused her to declare that she would stop writing on gaming entirely, a move that did not stop the harassment. By this point, practically everyone has chimed in on the subject, and someone spammed Sarkesian's twitter account with child pornography in response to her comments on the situation. Quin responded on the 6th of September by publishing excerpts from the \"burgers and fries\" IRC on the date Gjoni had revealed the relationship between her PR person and the IGF, releasing them on twitter and in other places. The excerpts also revealed that various publicity campaigns targeting her were conceived on the IRC, and that the discussion of ethics in gaming journalism was originally conceptualized to provide a plausible smokescreen for harassment. The excerpts also demonstrated that her ex had helped orchestrate the harassment. Members of that IRC disagreed on The Escapist, and released a full dump of the chat logs, to show that the involved group was a minority in the IRC. They did admit that Operation #NotYourShield was conceived on 4chan, but said that it was created by minority gamers frustrated by the way they were portrayed in games. Other users used chat logs to demonstrate that on the /v/ board, attempts to abuse Quinn's character were dismissed. Gjoni released a statement asking everyone to step back and calm down. On the 7th of September, the ShortFatOtaku vlogger posted a video claiming to show proof of conspiracy, fraud and racketeering on the part of Phil Fish, Polytron, IndieFund, IGF and IndieCade--the video claimed that the winning streak enjoyed by the game Fez was a result of that conspiracy, and claimed that the voting software used to vote for favorites had been rigged. The IGF responded by publishing their judging process, and the coder who wrote the voting software spent time on \"burgers and fries\" answering questions about the software. Shortly after this, ShortFatOtaku made the videos private (the accusations amounted to admitting hacking, responsibility for damage, and what was likely to be false accusations of serious crimes.) However, despite this, the GamerGate tag has begun to gain momentum again on twitter and other social outlets. Ogeeku speculates that this is partially due to The Escapist's embrace of the poor gaming ethics explanation for the previous events. Around September 11th, GamerGate supporters (the feminist conspiracy side of the debate) stated that they had contacted the charity organizations Quinn had stated she donated the proceeds from Depression Quest to--iFred, and the National Suicide Hotline. Representatives from these organizations stated that they did not know her or have an affiliation with her. During the same time, a blogger claimed to have contacted the SF Police Department and have discovered that Sarkesian had never reported any threats. One of the Breitbart-affiliated journalists who originally wrote about the situation took this information and confronted both Quinn and Sarkesian on twitter about it. Ogeeku and several other outlets have noticed that this journalist has increasingly dedicated his career to trying to destroy Sarkesian, and as such may not be a reliable source of information about her. Quinn responded by posting the email receipts for her donations, and posted it on her blog.  The officer who was originally stated to have said Sarkesian never filed charges with the SF police department went on to state that it was because she was working with the FBI. The volume, seriousness, public nature, and frequency of the material published about Quinn, as well as the demands made on Kotaku and via other gaming review sites, attracted the attention of main stream media sources, causing stories about the incidents to be carried in The New York Times, Forbes, The Washington Post, Time, The New Yorker, Business Insider, Vice, The Guardian, Slate, BBC News, and a number of smaller venues, including gaming review sites and publications. Because the response to Quinn is very like the response to a series of other women in gaming over the last two calendar years (threats of rape, murder, serious bodily injury, doxxing, posting person schedules and home address, and the attempt to threaten employment or business opportunities), this particular case involving Quinn has been adopted into a discussion about misogyny and sexism in gaming that has been ongoing. Quinn's case, due to the style, type, and frequency of harassment, has been compared to the harassment of Sarkesian and other women in gaming across a variety of media venues. A Precis of the Arguments: There are actually three related arguments, aside from the tactics issues, which I'll address in a bit. The first argument is that gaming is, for the most part, not a medium intended to be terribly serious. While individual games may be serious (for instance, Silent Hill 2), the overall medium is and should remain a diversion, and its most serious responsibility is to entertain. There are several sub-arguments to this argument, including a certain amount of resentment about the increasing turn of gaming journalism to reviewing what amounts to high game art, rather than games that gamers would usually be attracted to. Another sub-argument is that the point of gaming is to be diverted from one's life, or local conditions, and to enjoy exploring a fantasy world, scenario, story or some other unreal environment. This argument notes that the ability to be diverted would be damaged by the introduction of serious critique into a light or relatively harmless art form. As far as I can tell, this represents a combination of nostalgia (the desire to simplify one's life or to be able to have a portion of one's life that is simple, and the belief that the past represents this), the desire to continue to use gaming as a vehicle for escape or entertainment, and a frustration with what is seen as an increasingly distant development process.  Early PC gaming (1980s, and I was around to see it, if young), often involved small gaming studios, child studios of large tech developers, hobby programmers, people creating free games, and imports--you could go to a store and pick up a floppy with games like Castle Adventure, Clue, PacMan 3D, BattleChess and other first gen PC games bundled together, or pick up multiple disk sets like King's Quest, or Space Quest. This is also the period in which the first Nintendo hit US shores, and it was possible to rent the machines from video stores and bring them home for 24 hours with titles like Rygar, Dr. Mario, Legend of Zelda, or Kid Icarus. You could subscribe and write to Nintendo Power, and they might publish your letters or gaming tips, and whether right or wrong, many gamers who view gaming as a non-serious venue view that period as one in which they and their interests were better received. The average demographic for gamers is a little bit younger than me (but not much), and grew up with the genesis of gaming technology in the US. It's likely they have strong associations between their childhood and a period that seemed simpler, easier, and potentially happier. Gaming, for people who have these associations, represents a potentially freer, happier and more innocent time, and gamers with these associations are likely to resent intrusion into the happiness they associate with it. The second argument is that gaming is a product of culture, and as a product of culture that disseminates cultural ideas, associations and ideals, can be studied or critiqued on that basis, with attention paid to the dissemination of messages that don't alienate, insult, demean, or mock others. This is not a new argument by any means--it's been applied to various art forms over the years, and is used to provide a basis for discussing any number of cultural events.  Gaming, however, has not always been the sort of popular phenomenon it currently is. (Siddown kids, grandma's gonna tell a story.) During the genesis of electronic gaming here in the US using consoles and computers, the audience for gaming was highly likely to be male, white, and/or of a middle class background. The audience for PC gaming was also likely to be in their twenties, since PC were much more rare and expensive during this period, and the OS with its pretty pictures didn't become a thing until the late 80s to 90s--if you had a computer, you needed to know how to operate it from a command line and how to boot an OS from a floppy. Chances are good you also needed to know how to build one, how to operate a soldering iron, and how to fix various maintenance issues. (Kids these days and their mice and their point and click and their quick time events and their repair places everywhere....) I can also distinctly remember going with my father to Radio Shack or various ma and pa electronics stores to pick up parts for something he was working on and begging him for a game. My brother and I were the only children I ever saw in the store, and my father went often (hazards of being an electrical engineer and hobbyist of sorts).  It also was not cool to be a nerd until relatively recently, making the older audience for gaming a group of people who felt stigmatized and picked on (and likely were. I took my share of it,* and no doubt many other nerds of the 80s and 90s did, as well.) The lens of cultural criticism aimed at gaming points out race, class and gender elements, and for many nerds accustomed to thinking of themselves as a minority of sorts, comes as a shock and an insult to that group.  Some people in this group appear to respond by trying to \"save\" gaming from what they perceive as being ruined by its own popularity--they reason that the only reason gaming is being subjected to this kind of attention is because it has crossed over into the popular imagination, wherein abides cultural criticism and other influences that will \"ruin\" the fun of gaming and the connection between gamers and development companies. Some people in this group also appear to be trying to save gaming from the influx of gamers who don't appreciate (aka won't allow things to be more or less the way they were) gaming as a venue. To the extent that new gamers are willing to allow gaming to remain the way it was, they are welcome--it's the people who want to change and complicate things that aren't welcome. I really just can't overstate the influence of nostalgia and escapism in this debate. The last argument is that gaming, like the internet in general, is a true meritocracy--in the sense that the people who thrive best there are those who can best watch their own backs. People who employ this argument are often employing it in service of both the history of gaming and the computer (the original nerds were those who did not need the kind of oversight and hand-holding OS and gaming now provides), and in the service of eliminating what they appear to believe is a set of arguments that make gaming and computers no longer the domain of those with an elite set of skills or certain mentality, but the general public (who will influence gaming and computers to make them less demanding, less intensive, require less intelligence to operate, and less useful, overall.) There is also an undercurrent here of preserving what amounts to a fairly elite clubhouse--again, keeping in mind that older nerds will have spent a considerable amount of time being a minority and have experienced a certain amount of persecution over this. This argument interacts with gaming in a variety of ways, including the general assertion that if someone is genuinely good at gaming (or programming, or what have you), they won't need what is presumed to be a series of arguments about requiring their inclusion. Their abilities will be acknowledged, and they won't need anyone else to help them get acceptance. For gaming, in particular, this argument is sometimes paired with a series of arguments about \"natural\" or \"inborn\" skills in certain gender or racial groups, including a few arguments about women and aggression (which I've been finding hilarious since 1984, the first time someone used one on me and I remember it.) The Tactics Issues: I'm classing the discussion about gaming ethics here, for several reasons--first, for those of us who've been around long enough to have subscribed to Nintendo Power, or have read the various computing magazines put out for Apple, Commodore, or Atari owners know that many of the gaming specific early magazines were essentially shills for gaming companies. PC gaming did have the advantage of some independent magazines, but the lines between gaming journalism and gaming companies were often fairly thin or non-existent. Ethics concerns are not new, but they have not been terribly popular as a discussion topic (as far as I can tell, in my years online and reading gaming articles--feel free, if you're reading and have a time line of that, to update me.) If there's an actual discussion to be had here about journalistic ethics and gaming, it's worth having. However, as Ogeeku states (and I agree), the well is so poisoned it's impossible to have the discussion in any reasonable or useful way.  To be blunt, if you're going to discuss how to do ethics right, it's probably best to try and take at least the middle road, if not the high road. Second, the pairing of ethics discussions to doxxing, various threats and accusations, the 0-6 record for those accusations and the highly personal nature of the threats undermines the authority of anyone who wants to talk about ethics--it's not ethical to threaten to rape, murder or maim people who disagree with you, and it's impossible to have a discussion about ethics when one or more parties is afraid they're going to be wounded, killed or raped if they attend conferences. Tactically speaking, while they are fighting vociferously, the old guard (the people who would like to keep gaming the way it was), are fighting a losing war--gaming has hit enough popularity to prevent attempts to regroup as an exclusive club. Unless the vast majority of general gaming audiences stop playing tomorrow, gaming is no longer an exclusive club. This has a variety of effects on gaming that are both a part of this debate (in the sense that gaming cannot avoid being exposed to people and groups that disagree with certain ideologies in gaming) and extend beyond this debate, because they create new and different markets for gaming. These markets, in turn, place different pressures on developers and create market subsections, and can attract developers into new markets. This does not mean that gaming cannot retain amusement as a central goal, but it does mean that amusement is going to have to take on a whole lot of definitions for those groups. Also tactically speaking, GamerGate makes it clear that there is a fairly broad swathe of users who tend to characterize groups with opposing ideologies as conspiracies. Social engineering in groups with those tendencies, even ham-handed social engineering, can be remarkably successful even in the face of proof of falsity. The continuance and resurgence of the GamerGate tag, in the face of the continuing string of false accusations, is something of a testament to the persistence of conspiracy narratives and social engineering in some populations. Of course, the GamerGate side of this is not alone in this tendency, but appears to be fueled differently than their opponents. This particular debate in gaming is part of a series of cultural clashes, and that cultural clashes over these issues are unlikely to die any time soon for a variety of reasons, including their continuing absorption into popular thought--simply watching cultural change in the US over the last * cough * thirty odd years (I'm older than that but that's about when I started really noticing) has been like watching a slow riot (you can see the bottle coming, but it takes a while to shatter). While gaming itself is a subsection, and a very small one, in a larger debate, it is not an island in that debate and, like anything happening to a group of people with diverse ideas, is going to be the site of conflict on those issues. Why the term conspiracy theory fits: With conspiracy theories, accuracy is much less important than confirming someone's suspicions and the comfort that comes from confirming those suspicions. In a very essential sense (and I say this, again, as someone who's spent waaaaay too much time in various IRC, conspiracy nut sites, and browsing almost anything I could get to on the internet, including 4chan (hi fellas)), a conspiracy theory is both a way of unifying a group of people and of comforting oneself about the progression of events that someone may feel powerless to prevent. I've flirted with my own, earlier in my internet life--I used to find all sorts of totalitarian state conspiracies sort of attractive in my late teens and early twenties, for a variety of reasons having to do with feeling powerless, encroached upon in my daily life, getting social approval, and being raised by the kinds of Christians who genuinely believed the apocalypse could happen any day now.  Just...you know.... replace Satan with gob'ment (I never was good at belief). People on those sites would often present parts of realistic looking documents, or hearsay, or report on troop movements, or other sorts of seemingly provocative minutae, and draw huge conclusions from them which seemed really realistic. I was old enough to really start examining the dynamics of power from more than just my own experiences, though they certainly played a part.** Thinking about myself as \"being in the know,\" and having preparations for when everything went to hell, and thinking of myself as having special knowledge was pretty attractive--it made me, for lack of a better word, part of a special group. The more people made fun of the conspiracy theory, the more attractive it was to me (the sheeeeeeeeple, man, they just don't get it). I got over it once I hit college and started to get a more sophisticated education in social analysis and exposure to history, politics, tactics, and technology. I couldn't verify any of the claims on the site, not even the ones which would have been in the historical record (and I hate being inaccurate, though it happens often enough that I ought to be used to it.) The continuing popularity of the GamerGate tag, despite the thorough debunking of the associated claims, is probably much more about the dynamics of being a part of a group and the kind of support that exists in a much more tangible form in the group than it is accuracy (or gaming ethics.) I think, in this case, it's probably also a function of seeing one's favorite diversion being made serious and no longer just a vehicle for having fun. Conspiracy theories are characterized by their lack of the need for proof, and this certainly qualifies. They're also characterized by in group dynamics that foster a sense of persecution by out group forces, in group enlightenment and a coming sense of disaster or sense of essential falsity on the part of overwhelming forces--in this case, the feminist illuminati.*** I'll even go one further and speculate that in this case, the nostalgia is part of an ongoing response to the increasing range and scope of social change as societies and cultures interact closely through the medium of the internet, but that's a bit tenuous for this discussion.  GamerGate appeals to people who feel alienated by the changing face of gaming, people who feel criticized when they've been the minority, people who want to keep gaming the way it was, people who are already prone to assuming conspiracies, and people who feel as if they're being disenfranchised by the changes in society being carried out in gaming. It has been timely, in the sense that it is happening during a particularly pessimistic period in game journalism (see all the \"gaming is dead\" articles) and during a period where there's an active series of cultural debates occurring on the role of gaming in culture. Where it can enlist the disaffected, it will continue. I think, however, that it's overdue for a fizzle out--while it does manage to capture certain disaffected elements of the gaming community (not just those my age, though I talked a lot about your average gamer by demographics), it's been wrong too many times to salvage its reputation unless someone manages to be very, very right with the tag. We'll see. * Much of it from other, male nerds for being female, thanks guys. ** At that point, I'd been homeless and had a graduate education in power discrepancies, police officers, random assholes, and being homeless and a teenage girl--the people on the site couldn't out cynic me in that regard. *** And if there is one, I'm hurt that no one has invited me to any meetings. I'd be a fantastic secret master. ________________________________ Source material: Ogeeku article, which has a ton of links: #GamerGate - All Quiet on the 4chan Front - Ogeeku Wikipedia has a nice list of articles on this from a variety of sources and I'm lazy tonight: Gamergate controversy ",

            "answer_text": "I just wrote this on my G+ blog, and I'll reblog it here: Thoughts on #gamergateThe American online Taliban is not new In 1983, I participated in a very small Usenet group, net.women.  There, about fifty of us in what was well, well over 95% a boy's club gathered to talk about glass ceilings, what it was like being a woman engineer in an age when newspapers still had MEN WANTED and WOMEN WANTED columns in the classifieds (and we had to write cover letters apologizing for cross dressing our job applications), and various. But I think it was early 1984, appropriately enough, when a few women decided they wanted to create a group called net.women.only.  I was among the handful who thought this was a very very bad idea, since there was no way to ban people from Usenet groups, nor create access lists for groups, as you might for an email list, so their desire to create a private oasis where they might quietly discuss brands of tampons or whatever away from prying eyes was entirely illogical. They got hate bombed.  It was horrific, trollish, and the first example I ever remember of 4chan style behavior on the early net.  It was shocking, and horrible, and there were women involved who never returned, I suspect, to any form on online community. And, to some extent, it was a formative experience that caused me to be on the path that brings me to all the work I've done since in community networks, digital divide/inclusion work, online facilitation of nonprofits and politics and civics, Tor, and so on. So, #gamergate  -- if you aren't familiar -- Gamergate controversy I think Gamergate is as old as net.women.only -- the idea that women shouldn't be on the net and certainly shouldn't be empowered.  But in particular, that women shouldn't be in gaming, I would trace gamergate particularly to the Dickwolves controversy, some  years earlier, when asshats in gaming were given comfort and encouragement in their asshattery by the industry thought leadership (God help us) at Penny Arcade. DickwolvesThe Pratfall of Penny Arcade - A Timeline Three years later:Why I\u2019m Never Going Back to Penny Arcade ExpoPAX Prime and the Dickwolves Problem So let me make this clear -- there is an inheritance of the gamer Taliban that makes them feel supported in wanting women to return to the kitchen, and leave them feeling safe in the gaming room, with just us chickens. And that, my friends, is really what gamergate and the dickwolves controversies, at the grassroots level, are all about. Men have always retreated to the game room to get away from women.  It's the den.  The man cave.  I don't care if now it's the League of Legends lobby, or waiting for a raid in WOW.  It's always been the card and dice parlor where the only reason a woman was there was to serve a man sex, food, or liquor. This has been true in basically every culture, east, west, Africa, globally.  Men gamble and play games in the absence of women.  I am happy to have folks bring me up exceptions -- I'm sure they are there.  But come on, you know what the struck-in-molten-brass mold is. And women have broken into the sanctum, more assuredly than the priesthood.  We are heretics, invaders.  Perhaps even more, we are women pretending to be peers where before only whores and serving wenches came. And the American gamer Taliban can not bear it.  They may not understand their outrage, but it leads them to violence, sociopathic and psychopathic retaliation, and all manner of what appears to be insane behavior to the rest of us. This is what happens when major taboos are breached, and people can not vocalize their sorrows.  I am not justifying the first bit of it.  I am only diagnosing it.  But I'm hoping it might make just a tad more sense. ",

            "answer_text": "I found two good discussions of this question online: I. Vox overview Here's a good excerpt from a Vox summary of GamerGate:  What is #GamerGate? Like all hashtags, #GamerGate has come to mean about 500 different things to thousands of different people. But at its heart, it's about two topics: The treatment of women in gaming: The start of the story (which is actually the latest permutation of a long-evolving firestorm) came in late August after indie game developer Zoe Quinn and critic Anita Sarkeesian were both horribly, horribly harassed online. The same harassment was later lobbed at award-winning games journalist Jenn Frank and fellow writer Mattie Brice. Both Frank and Brice say they will no longer write about games. The FBI is looking into harassment of game developers.Ethics in games journalism: Some argue that the focus on harassment distracts from the real issue, which is that indie game developers and the online gaming press have gotten too cozy. There's also a substantial, vocal movement that believes the generally left-leaning online gaming press focuses too much on feminism and the role of women in the industry, to the detriment of coverage of games. (One of the sites mentioned in this debate is Vox's sister site, Polygon.)Broadly speaking, the two sides in this debate are \"the #GamerGaters,\" the ones who are organizing under the hashtag to protest any number of issues, namely what they feel is a lack of journalist ethics in the gaming press, and a wide variety of other voices, who think the #GamerGate movement's connections to online harassment make it an unworthy vessel for change. The #GamerGaters have some actually interesting concerns, largely driven by the changing face of video game culture. But those concerns have often been warped and drowned out by an army of trolls spewing bile, often at women. \"The \u2018official' line is that it's about a demand for more transparency and better ethics in games journalism,\" Keith Stuart, games editor for The Guardian, told me in an email. \"This in itself is absolutely fine \u2014 as I wrote in my own piece, we should all be skeptical of the media. But whatever the higher motivations of some of those involved, the debate has had such a toxic undercurrent of abuse and anti-feminism that it has poisoned the whole concept. If this is about ethics, it cannot also be about systematic harassment. Those two contradict each other completely.\" Source: #GamerGate: Here's why everybody in the video game world is fighting II. Re/Code overview Here's an excerpt from a good post in Re/Code (a major tech blog) that appeared recently: (boldface added by me)  What Is Gamergate, and Why Is Intel So Afraid of It? Since it began in August, proponents of the online movement Gamergate have insisted that their chief interest is in exposing corruption in the press. Look closer, though, and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s just a front for a toxic smear campaign.  Gamergate is a sizable online community of videogame fans who are upset about growing criticisms of their favorite hobby, especially claims that today\u2019s games often depict women in demeaning ways. Complicating the matter further, Gamergate advocates say the debate about women in gaming is being enabled by a weak and corrupt gaming press. There are, in fact, problems with the media. Games companies wield great power over influential sites like IGN, Gamespot and Game Informer (along with many others), which even industry insiders refer to as the \u201centhusiast press\u201d for their often uncritical spin on the news. But that\u2019s not what Gamergate has shown it cares about in practice. The labels of \u201cethics\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d are, to date, a thin veil over an ongoing attempt to undermine women in the gaming industry and the games press. Anyone who advocates for gender equality, or better representation, or even just a more open discussion is considered an enemy to be bullied, boycotted or, in some cases, harassed.  Gamergate has even gone so far as to convince chipmaker Intel to pull its advertising from a gaming site seen as sympathetic to women gamers.And why? Because their voices are seen as a threat to the gaming community. In a twisted way, Gamergaters are battling a \u201ccorrupting\u201d influence in the gaming press and its adherents, but that influence isn\u2019t corporate scheming \u2014 it\u2019s social progress. Let\u2019s rewind and retrace how we got here. In August, Eron Gjoni, a robotics and AI programmer, publicly accused his ex-girlfriend Zoe Quinn, an independent game developer, of cheating on him with five men, including a writer for Gawker\u2019s gaming blog Kotaku, Nathan Grayson. This was the start of Gamergate, with Gjoni deciding Quinn\u2019s private sex life was a public controversy. His followers, in turn, accused Quinn of trading sex for a favorable review of her game,Depression Quest, from Kotaku. In truth, Grayson never actually wrote a review of Depression Quest for Kotaku, and only mentioned Quinn in an article about a failed reality show. In his previous gig as a writer for the PC gaming blog Rock Paper Shotgun, he wrote two articles that mentioned Depression Quest, neither of which were reviews. And after investigating Gamergaters\u2019 allegations, Kotaku concluded that the latest of these stories \u2014 the reality show piece \u2014 predated Grayson and Quinn\u2019s relationship. But never mind all that. This idea of sex for press coverage took root, and is still being repeated in Gamergate circles to this day. Gjoni continues to insist that Quinn is a \u201cpathological liar and hypocrite,\u201d and argues that she tricked journalists into siding with her. In an email to Re/code, he said Quinn could have \u201cnip[ped] harassment in the bud by issuing a public apology to the fans she\u2019d misled.\u201d Gjoni dubbed his invented controversy \u201cFive Guys Burgers and Fries,\u201d after the five alleged sexual partners, and wrote more than 10,000 words on the topic. Only at the end did he try to disclaim any interest in harassment, later telling a receptive Vice reporter that he \u201cvery much align[ed]\u201d with the social justice movement. \u201cMy own personal goal was just to warn people about Zoe, and let them make their own decisions about the information presented,\u201d Gjoni said in his email to Re/code. I\u2019ve reached out to Quinn for comment on this, and have not yet heard back. But the role Gjoni created for himself here \u2014 as a sort of whistleblower \u2014 doesn\u2019t really add up. Even if Quinn were the person Gjoni and his adherents claim she is, she\u2019s a person, not a government or multinational company; her only impact on the public was being a female game developer who made an atypical, critically acclaimed game. Her accuser comes off more as an angry, unbalanced ex than a responsible watchdog. Still, in very little time, Gjoni\u2019s blog post was a runaway train. The \u201cFive Guys\u201d meme proliferated in private chat rooms and public social forums, and geek-beloved actor Adam Baldwin (Jayne Cobb from Firefly) popularized both it and the hashtag #Gamergate to his nearly 200,000 Twitter followers.

            "answer_text": "I'm gonna lay my cards on the table before I get anywhere near answering this: I am Pro-GamerGate, and if you don't like it, tough. Now with that said, let me lay out an outline of events The indie game developer, Zoe Quinn, was found cheating on her boyfriend with multiple people, which should be nothing at all, concerning games. Turns out, though, those people she was cheating with are people who cover her beat, in one case covering the very game she made, Depression Quest.  It started life as the single person focused Quinnspiracy If that wasn't enough, her followers released documents on an effort to give women a chance to bring their game ideas to reality, eventually crippling the effort to the point to where it was life support. Why? The simple reason is that rivaled one she was developing, so she declared that effort oppressive, and unleashed her personal army on The Fine Young Capitalists.  Eventually, this lead to 4chan's video game focused board, /v/, to step in, and revive the effort, which was again attacked, but to no avail. With further research, it was eventually discovered that it wasn't just Zoe schmoozing her way to the top, but several people in the industry, including the relationship between Patricia Hernandez and the creator of Analogue: A Hate Story, and several writers donating to Crowdfunding efforts of the games they reviewed, including a 4 figure donation by a known Editor in Chief in the industry.  This lead to the second phase of this  As a result of #GamerGate, the Escapist, Polygon and Kotaku each took a look at their policies, and in the Escapist\u2019s case, actually revised it for both their site and the others apart of the company\u2019s site family. Likewise, some of the sites that attack their userbase, such as Kotaku and Polygon, saw a their net ranking take a huge hit that they\u2019re only now recovering from, while others, like RockPaperShotgun and Gamasutra, were sent into what has now become a death spiral. What happens next remains to be seen, as Zoe has shown no signs of backing down, and neither has those opposing her Those against GamerGate believe this as nothing more than an attack on women in gaming, their ranks including many media outfits, indie developers and many on the Left. Those in favor of GamerGate believe it a campaign to expose the corruption in game journalism, to show that Zoe and get crew are intimidating people to fall in line, lest they be blacklisted in the industry they love, with their ranks including /v/(formerly, as 4chan\u2019s owner ordered his mods to clamp down on threads discussing Gamergate, among other things), many on the Right, and many minority folks who believe the Left is using them a way to deflect criticism of the industry, those people uniting under the #NotYourShield banner.   Both sides continue to demonize the other, including opponents revealing sensitive documents on a young Asian female gamer, Jayd3fox, and making harassing phone calls towards her, and the other side sending hate and death threats towards Zoe and others involved. As someone who\u2019s observed the Occupy Wall St. movement, I know well what can happen when a movement loses its mojo and becomes a shadow of what it once was. What happens to #GamerGate from this point on depends on how on point those for it can stay with their aims as a consumer revolt and whether or not those against can successfully paint a group of many races, genders and sexual preferences as a bunch of white neckbeard misogynist turbo nerds in the eyes of those who vote with their dollar and their clicks.

In that vein, I think that reading the escapist's interviews with game developers on the issue is a great way to see what multiple people who are actually involved in the games industry have to say about it. Please try to read all of them to the end, because there's a fascinating variety of responses which shows that the issue is actually as complicated as it seems, and it would be a good idea to form an opinion on the issue on your own.

A few women in the gaming community called this out as shitty behaviour, and then the \u201cgamers\u201d harassed, threatened and overall acted awfully towards these women for weeks. Basically, it was backlash, because feminist gamers have started speaking out against sexism in the gaming community, disguised as a quest for \u201cethics in journalism\u201d. ",
