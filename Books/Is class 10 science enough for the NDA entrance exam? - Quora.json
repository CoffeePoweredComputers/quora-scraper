            "answer_text": "Yes if you have enough knowledge of Class 10 level science then you can easily clear NDA science section with good marks. You should focus more on basics rather than attaining deep knowledge of the subject. For eg- Reactivity series,periodic table,difference b|w physical and chemical reactions etc should be done properly rather than doing numericals based on complex topics and wasting your time. I hope this helped! Thank You and best of luck!! ",
