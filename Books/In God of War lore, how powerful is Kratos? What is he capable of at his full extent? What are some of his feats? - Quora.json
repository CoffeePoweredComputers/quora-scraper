            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my answer to a similar question- Anuj Patil's answer to How powerful is Kratos? I have mentioned a few feats in it already- But just to summarise it- Kratos is very powerful\u2026 Powerful enough to go one on one with EVERY god, and defeated them\u2026 Also, Gods in GoW world are the highest and the most powerful life forms\u2026 There is no one above those gods\u2026 The Gods and their ancestors(titans, primordials) basically created or represent an aspect of the world\u2026 Kratos cannot die, he has climbed out of the underworld more than once\u2026 Kratos has even managed to kill Baldur in the new game- Baldur is immune to magical and physical harm and is immortal for all intents and purposes\u2026 Every God that Kratos has killed has remained dead\u2026 Kratos has even overpowered the Titans on occasions\u2026 And one of them was Atlas- who bears the weight of the heavens (or earth) on his shoulders\u2026 Kratos\u2019 spartan rage is (simply put) something akin to Kaioken from Dragon Ball\u2026 All his parameters are boosted, and he literally tramples his enemies\u2026 Kratos can fully heal within seconds of battle, and fully recover in less than a minute\u2026 Being an Olympian with the power of Hope and the soul of Hades, he is pretty much an unkillable killing machine\u2026 Kratos has killed Gods that represent the following aspects of the universe- Underworld - Hades Sun- Helios Oceans - Poseidon War/Rage- Ares Death - Thanatos Fate - Sisters or Fate (they weave the thread of al life) Titan God of Destruction- Perses Speed/Messenger- Hermes Strength - Hercules Wisdom/Lightning/King of Gods- Zeus Father of the king of Gods and The God of Time - Titan Cronos God of Fires and Blacksmiths - Hepaestus Leader of Titans/ Earth God - Gaia Punishers for the Gods - The Furies And a few more\u2026 Basically of the Gods govern the powers they represent\u2026 And are pretty much omnipotent one their field of expertise\u2026 Hope you like the answer\u2026 Thank you ",
