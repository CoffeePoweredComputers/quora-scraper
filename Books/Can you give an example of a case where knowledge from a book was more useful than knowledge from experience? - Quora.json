            "answer_text": "The answer is that experience is nearly always more valuable with one exception. You don\u2019t need to touch a fire to discover you can get burned. There is a saying I am fond of. \u201cThere are 3 kinds of people. Stupid people, smart people and wise people. A stupid person makes the same mistakes over and over. A smart person learns from their mistakes. A wise person learns from the mistakes of others.\u201d Readers who learn from the people they read about, whether fictional or real, benefit from not having to experience the consequences represented in the book. This is one of the most valuable benefits of being well-read. Learning from history, learning from the misadventures of characters in a fiction book, these are extremely valuable and mean you don\u2019t have to go through those experiences in your own life. ",
