I also highly recommend writing a business plan. You\u2019ll find free templates on the web. As for approaching/contacting business, it will depend on the nature & size of the business and what you offer. You\u2019ll contact Microsoft much differently than you\u2019ll contact me. Personally, I loathe cold calls (phone or visits) & prefer email with a scheduled personal appointment, if necessary. ",
