            "answer_text": "Finding books is a journey.  No amount of internet browsing can match up to afternoon spent in a bookshop going through the shelves, a reading a few pages here and there before selecting your next book adventure.  I was a opposer of e-readers until i actually felt one of them. The ink and the looks make it a very nice experience compared to reading ebooks on a normal monitor.  E-readers might match up to a physical book's experience while reading but books mean so much more to me than just the content. A finished book goes to the collection where with one glance of an eye i can experience my reading history since childhood. Randomly pick up old books, re-read a few pages to enjoy that long forgotten moment once more, check out the markings in on the front pages to get a reminder of the when, where and in what conditions did I buy that book.. its just such a lovely experience to own cupboard full of books .. accomplishments and memories all neatly stacked up and arranged.. !!  As it is, the requirements from work and studies have made it impossible to stay away from the digital world... its just is nice change to hold an actual book once in a while.. and thats where i guess i might say that ebooks would be 'lifeless'.. its like futuristic usage of holograms and 3d projections for conference meetings.. logically and financially makes perfect sense but there is something that's missing .. the physical presence/touch of a human/book. For voracious readers i guess ebooks do make sense.. but for someone like me who reads different genres of books and not very frequently.. i would stick around the old way for some more time as of now...

            "answer_text": "As somebody who reads both e-books and regular ones, I do not think that e-books are somehow more 'lifeless' than books. By life, I assume you are referring to a book's capacity to offer immersion, to its power to make you relive the events told, to its force to create imagery ... I find no reason to believe that an e-book somehow doesn't quite offer the same reading experience as a regular one. Why, some of the stories (Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground, Rand's Anthem, Salinger's Catcher in the Rye . . . ) that have had a profound effect on me have been ones that I have read over a computer or an e-reader. The content, after all, is the same.However, I know people (my girlfriend being at the top of the list) who do not have the stomach for e-books, and who love the experience of reading from printed paper owing to some traditional, romantic notion of reading. They find that the immersion is just not as deep as it'd be if they were reading from a book. Other problems they have include the visual discomfort arising from reading on a computer for a long time and the several distractions that usually come with the device (the internet foremost). Most of these criticisms are rather valid when one's reading on a computer. The computer monitor is not suited for long reading hours and demands also that you sit on a chair for as long as you read, making the experience not as immersive. However, as far as e-readers are concerned, it's an entirely different matter altogether. I own a Nook and find that I have no difficulty in reading for hours at a stretch. The ink is created for your reading longevity. In fact, it makes it more convenient to read during the late nights, a time when you're alone with your thoughts with little distraction, by making an external light source irrelevant. Those who share their bedroom with another person will understand what a boon it is. In addition, it saves me a lot of money. Downloading/buying books over the internet is far cheaper than buying its traditional counterparts. Also, my e-reader comes with an in-built dictionary that allows me to check the meaning of a word by merely pressing my finger on it. If it were a book, I'd probably be more distracted each time I have to tear myself away from the book to look for the meaning of the word. Talk about immersion.In short, I do not see that the medium somehow makes the experience less meaningful. Anybody who propagates that there is no 'life' in a book when read over an electronic medium, is probably just a traditionalist who hasn't yet discovered the joy and the comfort of reading on e-readers. As somebody who loves both mediums, I find no reason to believe that there is somehow more life in reading on printed paper, as opposed to an electronic screen. ",

            "answer_text": "I feel that many of the above answers are focusing on the computer ebook. I own an Amazon Kindle e-ink display device. It looks just like a real book's page. I find that the material around the words will fade away from my awareness like a real book always did. The case I bought for it plugs into the side and has a pullout lamp that runs off the kindle's battery. When I use to read while lying in bed, my hand would cramp from trying to hold the book one handed. I would then have to frequently move my other hand from its relaxed position (usually behind my head) in order to change the page. With the Kindle I simply shift a finger from the hand holding the device and press a button... When I'm finishing a book and want the next in the series, I usually have it within 5 minutes (no driving to the store or planning the time for the trip). Basically, the ebook is best decided by your own experience with it... Either you'll love it or hate it. ",

From my own reading experiences, I get just as much enjoyment and meaning from an e-book as I do from my old paper books (of which I have many).  In my old age, the thing that matters most is the abilit to enlarge the print size due to poorer eyesight.  I've never had an actual Kindle with e-ink, but I have a Nook and an iPad, both of which I use for reading.  I like both equally, and back when I got my first Rocket e-reader, I liked it just as much! ",

            "answer_text": "I like reading on a Kindle because I can adjust the font size. I can hold it in one hand. Best of all, I am always looking up every word I don\u2019t know in the dictionary, and with the Kindle all I have to do is hold my finger down on it and it gives me a definition. If the word is not in the built-in dictionary, it can show me a definition off the internet. It can also show me where each time that word appears in the text, which is helpful if the word is a name of a character. Since starting to read with the Kindle, I now rarely read regular books. The main exceptions are books that have a lot of illustrations, or are workbooks that have questions to answer on the pages. Lastly, I loooooove audiobooks. There is a feature called whyspersync that allows you to switch between audio narration and reading. So I can listen to the book while I drive, then start reading again where I left off when I am going to bed. You can even read while listening to the audio. I often get the book and audiobook at the same time because of this. Those are all practical reasons. I am sure there are subjective, sentimental reasons for reading print books, and I respect those preferences. Never once thought one had more \u201clife\u201d in it than the other. It\u2019s just words on either a page or a device, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s what is going on in your mind reading them that matters. ",

I personally prefer reading hard copies of books since I like to read when lying down or carry them with me on trips where I can just toss it in a bag with the rest of my things. I resort to e-books when I can't get hold of a hard-copy or if it is expensive. But I have friends who prefer e-books as it is free and no maintenance. Also it allows you to read when doing other things(on a PC/Laptop). They claim that the book was no less impacting than reading from a hard copy, it only depends on how much concentration you gave it. ",
