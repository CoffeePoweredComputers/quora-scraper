Harry of course, didn't know the wands strange story. He didn't know much about anything of the wizarding world at that point. He must have been expecting Ollivander to be happy about finding a suitable wand. So it was natural that he wanted to know what was curious about a perfectly nice wand. ",

Very curious!\" Harry merely wants to know what Olivander thinks is so curious. ",
