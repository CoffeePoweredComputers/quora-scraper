            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. There are only two ways to achieve working 4 hours a week though. Build a team that you can manage remotely. Build systems that run themselves.Invest in income producing assets that will generate enough income for you to live comfortably.These options can also be considered semi-passive income and passive income. When reading the 4-Hour Work Week it was clear to me that Tim Ferris was believer in option 1. He did it that way and I did too. Build a Team & Build Systems Start Somewhere We read an online article on importing egg incubators. Rather than Xing out, we opened Alibaba, found a supplier of a kegerator part, bought 80 units and sold them on eBay. The key takeaway here was avoiding Xing out and taking action. There is no quick way to achieve the true 4 hour work week. You have to go through the process. It took us 4 years. It would've taken longer if we put off taking action. Prove the Model We made $10/unit on that first run. $800 profit. It worked. Next step was to multiply the product catalog. Prove its profitable and worthy of the investment of your time. Learn How to Do Everything - Then Outsource If you hire before you understand, then how can you really know if the freelancer is good at their job? How can you know how long a task should take? You will save a lot of money by taking time to learn how every piece of your puzzle works. You will also hire far better people. Better people equals better results. Create Standard Operating Procedures for Everything Your company is as strong as the framework its built on. Every task that is necessary in our company, has an outline on how to do it. When we figure out a better way, we update our SOPs. Since we hired great people, they make suggestions and can update the SOPs themselves. When KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) Change, Take Action You can only act when you have data. Know what data is important to your business, watch it like a hawk. Managing your business with no data is like driving with your eyes closed. When something goes wrong, find out why the data missed it. Update your SOPs & KPIs. Check these each day. Those will let you know if you can do nothing all day. Kick Back and Relax This morning I checked our KPIs and had no messages from the staff. That means I can go for a surf, nap and read Quora. I am now in Brazil doing the 330 Day Challenge while my business partner is backpacking through Australia with his girlfriend. Sales are up 10% this month! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it's real. The 4-Hour Work Week (4HWW) by Tim Ferriss discusses many real stories of successful entrepreneurs. You can look these people up; they're real. Leaving aside those stories, I have many friends, and myself, who benefitted from the principles of 4HWW. It has been a life-changer for me and many others. Let's discuss more.  Let's first start with my story in brief. I am not easily influenced by a person\u2019s recommendations. At first, a friend of mine recommended 4HWW, and I wasn't at all convinced (though I wasn\u2019t in much of an entrepreneur mindset at the time). Since I had an interest in reading alternative lifestyle books, I read 4HWW just like an ordinary book, not actually expecting to use what it taught. The book was so inspiring that I felt like implementing its principles and reviving old business projects that I had let fade into the background. Gradually, I proceeded with implementing the book\u2019s advice. I\u2019m glad I did because my businesses probably wouldn\u2019t have taken off without those insights. Since then it has been one of my first recommendations for everyone with an entrepreneurial mindset. From my experience and the feedback from my friends, I can confidently say that 4HWW is real. It\u2019s legit. It works even in 2020. Even after thirteen years of its publishing, the book is still valid and suitable for almost every kind of entrepreneur, be that amateur, intermediate or advanced. The book beautifully explains how to escape the nine-to-five work culture. That by itself isn\u2019t that amazing, since fleeing the rat race has been a concept in self-help books pretty much since the dawn of industrialization. But beyond that,it suggests how to work less for more money. It even suggests the way how one could live a better life with the same amount of money, a concept called entrepreneur lifestyle design. From a top-down level, it\u2019s basically everything someone would need to make it as an entrepreneur, except for product design and sales. You\u2019ll have to find good books on those concepts elsewhere if you don\u2019t know where to begin. For people who know what they want to do as an entrepreneur, but don\u2019t know how to get to that level of success, 4HWW is very helpful. The concept of virtual assistants is the biggest secret to actually working for four hours a week. Plus, hiring VA doesn't have to cost you extra, and in many cases will save you money compared to other options. I won't say that I have completely implemented all its principles since this stuff is all an ongoing process, but I am almost into implementing everything Tim covered. I won't shirk calling as one of the best books for entrepreneurs. Being an enthusiast entrepreneur these days, I read such books very often. What important to consider, though is that I have combined it with the ideas from other books as well. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that one specific book is all you need to succeed as an entrepreneur because that's a lie. Those who succeed in this sphere are passionate readers and learners, people who take the knowledge of multiple people and combine it together. So yeah, I didn't find any of the points in 4HWW unreal, misleading, etc. It\u2019s just about willingness to implement the ideas. You probably won\u2019t turn into a millionaire in a month, but that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t make more money and live a more relaxed life in the process. Come into it with reasonable expectations, ready to transform your life and do the work, and Ferriss will help you. It's worth mentioning here that the book gets a bit of technical in the middle. If you are a layman to the internet or not willing to learn about it, then 4HWW won't appeal much to you. You kind of need to already be interested in online business a little. Otherwise, I strongly recommend it. You can read a deeper review of the book on my site. The link is in my profile. In conclusion, 4HWW is real and its concepts really work, provided you implement them in the right manner and stick with it. Please feel free to reply to me if you have any questions. Good Luck! Thanks, Cleo ",
