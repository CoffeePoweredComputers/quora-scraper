            "answer_text": "The two following quotes are pulled from a PDF file available from the U.S. Copyright Office:http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf \"In general, copyright registration is a legal formality intended to make a public record of the basic facts of a particular copy\u00adright. However, registration is not a condition of copyright protection. Even though registration is not a requirement for protection, the copyright law provides several inducements or advantages to encourage copyright owners to make regis\u00adtration\" \"When\tthe\tCopyright\tOffice\tissues\ta\tregistration\tcertificate, it assigns as the effective date of registration the date it received all required elements\u2014an application, a nonrefund\u00adable filing fee, and a nonreturnable deposit\u2014in acceptable form, regardless of how long it took to process the applica\u00adtion and mail the certificate. You do not have to receive your certificate before you publish or produce your work, nor do you need permission from the Copyright Office to place a copyright notice on your work. However, the Copyright Office must have acted on your application before you can file a suit for copyright infringement, and certain remedies, such as statutory damages and attorney\u2019s fees, are available only for acts of infringement that occurred after the effective date of registration. If a published work was infringed before the effective date of registration, those remedies may also be available if the effective date of registration is no later than three months after the first publication of the work.\" Many details about U.S. copyright law for authors and other creators are in the linked above; the PDF is a 12 page document and is prepared by and available directly from the U.S. Copyright Office so I'd definitely consider the information there better than that found at a random website or Wikipedia (or in a Quora answer). While the brochure is an excellent introduction to U.S. copyright, it only covers the basics and should not be considered a substitute for advice from a copyright attorney -- especially if you feel your copyright has already been infringed and feel redress through the courts is necessary. You can apply to register your copyright electronically from the U.S. Copyright Office website ",

            "answer_text": "You have to fix it in some tangible form. Such as an eBook file or a printed book or a PDF file. On this manuscript for your book you include a copyright notice:Copyright \u00a9 2020 YOUR NAME, All Rights Reserved. In the United States: If you are trying to find an agent or publisher you can copyright it formally as an UNPUBLISHED WORK for $35 if you are the sole author and it is one title. This is online. You can also bulk copyright 10 titles for $55-$100 as an unpublished collection. If you are planning to publish it yourself through Kindle, Smashword, Draft2Digital, Lulu or Ingram Spark you wait until the day your press the PUBLISH button on their dashboard and then you can file for a PUBLISHED copyright for $35 online. If it is digital only (just an eBook) you upload a PDF file of the exact manuscript as submitted to the publishing service. If you also publish a PRINT EDITION you are required to send TWO complimentary copies of this to the Copyright Office in Washington. They will give you a label to print or your can have Amazon send them two copies. With Lulu you need to order proof copies and send them yourself. Copyright registration and sending print copies must be done within 90 days of pressing that PUBLISH BUTTON or you lose the right to get lawyers fees and statutory damages from the Federal Courts. If you don\u2019t send print copies you can be fined $250 to $2,500 if they catch up with you, plus the cost for them to buy two copies. Canada also requires a free copy of a Canadian citizen\u2019s book sent to their National Library. If you live in any other country CHECK YOUR NATIONAL LAWS over Copyrights and Intellectual Property and FOLLOW the rules. Foreign citizens have the OPTION to file an American Copyright, it might help protect you in court cases anywhere, as it gives you a government document showing your name, the title of the book and the date the office got the application. So it establishes paternity and there is also a copy on file at the Library of Congress to verify your claim. ",
