            "answer_text": "Hi, Your question is; As a Catholic, how should a damaged Protestant Bible be discarded properly? Jesus teaches that we are not to worship \u2018idols\u2019 and yet your question puts a special value on a book which in turn creates the very situation Jesus warned about. The book becomes an object of worship. Don\u2019t feel to bad about that. The church has turned Jesus into an \u2018Idol\u2019 to be \u2018prayed to\u2019 instead of \u2018learned from\u2019 and as a result, Jesus is idle in many people\u2019s lives today. Notice how the church ceremony around Jesus actually takes us farther away from the lessons Jesus taught for us to live our lives by. Maybe that is why they removed the bible from many churches and replaced it with \u2018worship literature\u2019. Jesus taught the first disciples to teach and heal others in only the first seven chapters of \u2018Matthew\u2019 (Ch 7\u201310) where Jesus speaks and then until chapter 28 they are out teaching and healing.Today, not even the pope can do that and he is supposed to be the leader. Jesus\u2019 message is not \u2018difficult to understand even by bible scholars\u2019 as the church states in the bible. It is a simple message that is easy to understand and just as Jesus promised, we have \u2018Holy Spirit\u2019 or \u2018gut instinct\u2019 as I call it, to guide us. If your goal is to do what Jesus did then take Jesus\u2019 advice and leave the (physically) dead for the (spiritually) dead and get on with learning from Jesus instead of praying to Jesus. That is how I started on my journey that led to writing \u2018The People Whisperer\u2019. I knew in my heart that the church was not teaching what Jesus taught. It took one and a half years of reading the bible and praying for answers and as a result, step by step I understood what Jesus taught so many years ago. Too many people rely on a church designed \u2018bible study\u2019 with church defined meanings to arrive a church conclusion of what Jesus taught. I put aside what the church teaches and read just exactly what Jesus taught. I learned that the church definitions are wrong and when the right definitions are used then all of what Jesus teaches makes sense for our lives today. For example; in the bible the church explains that \u2018daily\u2019 means \u2018in our life after death\u2019. Jesus teaches \u2018daily\u2019 as every day of our lives. Jesus taught us not to worry about tomorrow but the church teaches us to worry about life after death. The church disagrees with Jesus on too many points so I choose to follow Jesus and forget about church deception. Peace and |Joy, John ",

            "answer_text": "Protestant Bible and Catholic Bible is the same Bible. Protestand ommitted a few books, but apart from that the text and meaning is just the same, only translation different. Protestant Bible can by used privately by Catholics. The Bible can be discarded in the same way as Catholic Bible: by burning or burying (this is the same way we \u201cdiscard\u201d dead human bodies). Only Jehovah Witnesses\u2019 Bible (New World Translation) is different than any other, but Jehovah Witnesses are not Protestants: they are classified as a sect. They change the Bible text to suit their own teaching. Jehovah Witnesses\u2019 teaching also changes over time, and I know that they regularly order their members to burn their religious books that contain failed prophecies or don\u2019t match the current direction. Generally, in Christian culture burning is a respectful way of discarding damaged holy things (fire burns the sacrifice and brings it to the God in heaven with the smoke). Also, it is a recommanded way to discard evil things (in Bible, fire is cleansing!), so whichever way, if you burn something, you can\u2019t get it wrong. You can also give it to church. I heard they have a place where they burn damaged holy things, but I never tried this option myself. ",

            "answer_text": "As a Catholic I find this question to be quite interesting but simple, and to understand why so to give a sufficient answer we need to do a little history. Historically the Catholic Church is the original Christian church.  Barring the effects of wars (mostly due to Islamic and barbarian incursions), many of the churches mentioned in the New Testament (most notably and prominently Rome) have always been Catholic.  In the first centuries of the Early Church the Church Fathers  such as Justin Martyr (100\u2013165 A.D.), Irenaeus (130 - 202 A.D.), Clement of Rome (d. 101 A.D.) and others are seen to express uniquely Catholic ideas and dogmas.  These men lived within a generation of the events of the New Testament and where contemporaries with some of its characters.  In fact Clement is said to be possibly identifiable with the Clement in Philipians 4:3 according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica. This aside, for many years as the reader likely knows, the Bible was not actually a book but largely retained in diverse scripts or in oral form according to the traditions of the ancient world.  These recitations and scripts formed the tradition of early (and provably Catholic) Christianity.  Christian was not a religion of the book, but of a tradition written and unwritten handed down generation to generation just as the Catholic church hands down its traditions and rites today. Eventually to sufficiently maintain and conserve the sacred texts of the Chistian religion, the Bible was put entirely to writing and began to be assembled as we might begin to see it today.  There was a problem however, many heretical scripts were circulating alongside legitimate ones.  Fast forward to the 4th century, the Church fathers (whom were admittedly Catholic mind you) gathered to together to solve among other things this problem with the scriptures.  In 397 A.D. they met in Carthage and determined and reconfirmed the books of the Bible as we know it today.  Some of these heretical texts included those such as the Gospel of Judas, Gnostic texts, and others that clearly had serious flaws and did not represent the Catholic Christian religion in the least. Fast forward again to the Protestant Revolt of the 16th century.  Early Lutherans and other Protestants wished to establish which sacred texts they would accept from the Catholic Canon as suitable for their new Christian religion.  Rejecting the Carthage canon as a means to differentiate themselves from the Catholic Churches, they threw out the Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament.  These books had been similarly rejected by Jews at the Council of Jamnia 70\u201390 A.D.  These books were seen as \u2018too Catholic\u2019 containing concepts such as Purgatory, prayers for the dead, and intercession. TL;DR Hence we can see that the Protestant Bible really varies only in translation from the ancient languages, and the exclusion of a handful of traditionally Christian books.  Thus Protestant bibles are really Catholic bibles in different clothing, perhaps more Catholic by influence than most Protestants would be willing to admit. So how do we discard of a Protestant translation of the bible when it is badly damaged? (I fact own a few of Protestant translations myself)  Exactly as I would discard of a Catholic translation of the Bible. It is fairly easy in fact.  Just be respectful.  There is no canon law defining how a Bible ought to be discarded.  Some Catholics follow a custom of disposing of religious articles that have been blessed either by respectfully burying or burning them, but even that is not mandated.  If the Bible has been blessed you might choose to follow that custom.  A lot of Christians now long gone to their eternal reward spent a lot of effort to hand down and protect the Word of God for you. Sources: What is the appropriate means to dispose of an old Bible?

            "answer_text": "Any sacramental that is no longer usable should be returned to nature. Burying underground, sinking into a body of water, or respectfully burning are all options. I have a couple of things that I had set aside for proper disposal, and when the utility company had to dig on my property, I took that opportunity to bury them. Be advised that Bibles (books in general) can be very hard to burn in a regular fire unless printed on very cheap paper. You would have to pull out small thicknesses of pages and burn it bit by bit. I would never put a Bible in the trash, but I also wouldn\u2019t recycle it, because it could be profaned while in the bin awaiting processing. ",
