            "answer_text": "Great question! Was the intent to kill? When Professor Quirrell, a squirrelly fellow, is jinxing Harry's broom, did he intend to murder or maim? With all the adult wizards around, I am not sure he banked on a high success rate. Of course consideration must be paid to the fact Voldemort was, quite literally, in his head. Hardly a case for genius ideas, I suppose. Should Quirrell have been acting alone, I would speculate he sought to curry favor with the Dark Lord. The goal of Voldemort returning to full strength would have been steps closer; particularly with a large nemesis eradicated. ",

            "answer_text": "It might be, but he saw a chance to kill Harry and it would have been too tempting to him. Remember that he has spent a decade as a shadow of his former self and he would have a lot of anger for that. But then it failed, so Quirrell and Voldemort had to settle for trying to get the stone, and trying again would have been foolhardy, especially with Snape tailing them. Killing Harry is kind of an unspoken part of Voldemort\u2019s plans, anyway. ",
