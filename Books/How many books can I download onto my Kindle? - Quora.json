            "answer_text": "Depends on your Kindle model. Books are generally between 300\u2013500KB. So to find out how many of these you can put on the Kindle, we just have to do math.  Storage space by model (first number is total space, second is space available to user after accounting for Kindle OS and other software):  Kindle 1: 256/180 MBKindle 2: 2/1.4 GBKindle DX: 4/3 GBKindle 4: 2/1.25 GBKindle Touch: 4/3 GBKindle 5: 2/1.25 GBKindle Paperwhite: 2/1.25 GBKindle Paperwhite 3gen: 4/3 GBKindle 7: 4/3 GBKindle Voyage: 4/3 GBTo make the math easier, 1 MB = 1024 KB, and 1 GB = 1,048,576 KB Using 500KB for a book, we can see that even the very first Kindle released in 2007 could hold roughly 368 books.  When we get to the Voyage and most recent version of the Paperwhite, both 3 GB usable space, the number of books they can hold jumps to about 6000 books.  Everyone's habits are different, but to me even the very first Kindle still holds more than enough books to tide me over until I can get to a wi-fi spot and download more. ",
