            "answer_text": "No, not at all. This is a series that opens with dead children, a man driven to madness, a murdered woman staring blank-eyed at the ceiling, and another man intending on grinding the first into the horror of what happened. As time goes on, that opening prologue starts to feel tame. There\u2019s torture, multiple character deaths, multiple implied rapes, characters with PTSD, characters who lose limbs, characters who lose their minds, monstrous horrors in the night, and a whole lot of implied sex, some of it with implied S&M action. It\u2019s also not written in a way to appeal to children. It was never intended for children, unlike Harry Potter and Narnia, and Jordan didn\u2019t use short sentences or simple language. The first book opens: The palace still shook occasionally as the earth rumbled in memory, groaned as if it would deny what had happened. Bars of sunlight cast through rents in the walls made motes of dust glitter where they hung yet in the air. Compare that to CS Lewis\u2019s child-focused The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe: Once there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. This story is about something that happened to them when they were sent away from London during the war because of the air-raids. Unlike Lewis\u2019s Narnia, neither the style nor the content of Jordan\u2019s masterpiece is aimed at children. Jordan was using his experience as a veteran to inform his views of a world that had once been almost destroyed by war. He was not, and never intended, to write in a way that was accessible or appropriate for children. He wanted to explore the horror of what could happen, had happened, and would happen again, with magic thrown in to allow things to be both more amazing and awful than real life. I love these books to the point where I have a friend who jokes that much of our friendship is based on Wheel and that any conversation that goes on for long enough must, sooner or later, bring up Wheel of Time, calling this \u201dHolly\u2019s Rule\u201d. However, if they were my kids, I\u2019d be asking them to wait until they were at least late teenage years before starting them. Then I would see if they too thrilled to the repeated opening words: The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. (And if they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be running a DNA test.) ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019ve got a 6th grader who\u2019s detail-oriented and likes long, involved stories that move at a slow pace, then he/she might like them. Jordan goes into lengthy descriptions about everything, including articles of clothing. The heroes and villains are interesting and powerful. Women have very prominent places and roles in the stories and have great mystic powers. That appeals to me and I like the series. I don\u2019t remember at the moment how many books make up the series but they do make up a lengthy and grand story arc. I advise you get a copy of the first book and read as much of it as you have time for or all of it if possible and see what you think. I NEVER give a film or a book to someone, most especially a child, without viewing or reading it first! ",
