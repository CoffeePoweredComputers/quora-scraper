            "answer_text": "There is a cult that permeates most photographic domains. That cult claims, vociferously and often, that cropping is some sort of capital offence, some intolerable aberration that distinguishes amateurs from \u2018better photographers\u2019 or those \u2018not in the know.\u2019 Respectfully, the notion is complete garbage. Composition is a complex skill. Some have it, naturally. Others learn the principles with experience and experimentation. Whatever the attributes, innate or learned, the end result is the same. Here are a couple of shots I edited today\u2026 Man on a Mission.Kauno senamiestis: Kaunas Old Town.Lietuva-Lithuania.Fujifilm XF10  The final result us about thirty percent of the original RAW file. The shot was taken quickly - 1/350 - as I followed the group up the subway steps. I was attracted by the somewhat macho male with a bunch of red roses. When curating the originals, I \u2018saw\u2019 what I have in this version. Photography is all about \u2018seeing\u2019. The Sky\u2019s the Limit.Kaunas City.Lietuva-Lithuania.Ricoh GR  Here, I wanted the interplay between the reflection on the large glass building facade and the foreground space. I was attracted by the way the glass distorted the clouds and attempted to show that with filtration in Photoshop. Again, this is about thirty percent of the original file. There are many learned theses by photographers about composition principles. Ignore most of those, particularly the constipating \u2018Rule of Thirds\u2019 and look, instead, at the work these theoreticians and critical thinkers produce. That is the proof of the \u2018Composition Pudding\u2019, what photographers can do rather than what they say. ",

            "answer_text": "Use your entire format, try not to crop. Shot a lot and give enough time to edition. Learn from your mistakes. Focusing and reading exposures takes a lot of time, pre focus and calculate exposure in advance, just raise your camera to snap. There is a book on composition by Kandinsky, \u201c Punto y linea sobre el plano\u201d was the name in spanish, it teach you a lot on composition. ",
