            "answer_text": "Never underestimate your strength and never overestimate your weakness. So are you ready..??? Ok I'll ask you a simple question.. Are you really listening to your inner voice? Are you\u2026?? Well I think you are not . Because if you were listening to it, I think there was no need to ask this question at the first place because you inner voice is screaming ,\u201c Yes you can do it\u201d but somewhat it is getting overpowered by the fear of failure that you are having . You know what the problem is, its not that you are having only 100 left, the problem is that till now you are stuck with your failure of your last attempt. Unless an until you overcome that you can't move forward and the fact is you also know it. Its just a human nature that we want others to solve our problem but you know what we all have the solutions for our problems but somewhat we are just over thinking about it and at this point we starts to loose our self confidence and the amazing part comes when we get the solution and we say Ohh.. shit man it was quite simple. So stop over thinking and start utilising you time prepare your schedule and divide your work in small goals and complete them. I would like to share a story about it: There was a business executive who was deep in debt and could see no way out. Creditors were closing in on him. Suppliers were demanding payment. He sat on the park bench, head in hands, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy. Suddenly an old man appeared before him. \u201cI can see that something is troubling you,\u201d he said. After listening to the executive\u2019s woes, the old man said, \u201cI believe I can help you.\u201d He asked the man his name, wrote out a check, and pushed it into his hand saying, \u201cTake this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.\u201d Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come. The business executive saw in his hand a check for $500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world! \u201cI can erase my money worries in an instant!\u201d he realized. But instead, the executive decided to put the uncashed check in his safe. Just knowing it was there might give him the strength to work out a way to save his business, he thought. With renewed optimism, he negotiated better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big sales. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again. Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the executive was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I caught him!\u201d she cried. \u201cI hope he hasn\u2019t been bothering you. He\u2019s always escaping from the rest home and telling people he\u2019s John D. Rockefeller.\u201d And she led the old man away by the arm. The astonished executive just stood there, stunned. All year long he\u2019d been wheeling and dealing, buying and selling, convinced he had half a million dollars behind him. Suddenly, he realized that it wasn\u2019t the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his newfound self-confidence that gave him the power to achieve anything he went after.

            "answer_text": "Confidence is a valuable asset in life, never lose it. 1. You are unique in this world with your merits and demerits. Biologically, each one has a different and unique genetic configuration, that directs our qualities. Comparison between dissimilar objects is illogical. Hence, you are neither inferior nor superior to others. You are yours, second to none. 2. Everyone has merits as well as demerits. Hence, no one is complete. No one is perfect. No one is absolute. 3. There is a father to every father. That means, there is always available for more quality than everyone. For example, there is more intelligent than your proud out-spoken first boy and more handsome and smarter guy than your so-called local hero, and so on. 4. There is no valid reason for superiority or inferiority over others. Persons showing superiority are actually mentally ill. Ignore them and have pity on them. You are unique, second to none. You have all the possibilities to excel by way of education, grooming and hard labour. And flourishing inherent qualities. 5. You have enormous power and unlimited possibilities. You can achieve and attain anything in the world, only if you so desire. Nothing is impossible for you. The sky is the limit. No one can deter you. 6. Improve yourself with proper education, grooming, and hard work. Hard work has the unique power to surpass your deficiencies if any. Develop your inherent qualities. Have physical exercises, yoga, and meditations. There is no end to self-development. 7. You are a human being, the highest of the species. You are also offspring of your honourable parents. You are carrying their DNA. You should not embarrass them by giving in without a befitting reply. 8. The world is beautiful. But the life is short. Hence, every moment of life should be enjoyed to its fullest. This life is solely yours. Now it is your discretion to whether you can afford to waste your time in petty matters. ",
