            "answer_text": "My wife (also a writer) texted me today that she only wrote 600 words, feeling bummed about it. She usually writes a thousand, minimum, and also has a day job, and usually writes before work. Her text made me laugh. Some of the most productive days I\u2019ve had have been in the 500\u2013700 word range. Not the most productive in terms of word count (those would be in the 3,000\u20135,000 word range), but in terms of the five or six hundred words I wrote that day. Her process is to burn through a first draft at blistering speed, completing a novel in a few months. When she spent a month just writing two years ago, she started having wrist/forearm problems because of how fast that first draft flew out. Her first draft was very much that, too. We ended up rewriting entire sections of the book, changing major plot lines in the second draft, etc. She\u2019s doing it again right now (today notwithstanding) and I\u2019ve told her that\u2019s fine, but her first draft is also essentially an outline. That\u2019s anything but a criticism. It\u2019s just her process. She has this compelling need to get the first draft done and, while the story may be complete, it\u2019s still like looking at a house that\u2019s been framed but doesn\u2019t have walls yet. She basically flies by the seat of her pants through a skeleton first draft, knowing there\u2019s a lot she\u2019ll need to fill in when she\u2019s done. My process is wildly different. I\u2019ll write a sentence of dialogue and go empty the top half of the dishwasher parsing through the exact wording of the next sentence. I may type a sentence or ten before the next thing I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wording exactly as I want to shows up, and it may take me unloading the rest of the dishwasher and vacuuming half the house, and/or a five-mile run and taking the dogs on a walk, before I\u2019m ready to write another sentence. Her advice would be to shoot for 1,000 words a day. It\u2019s not bad advice, either, especially if you\u2019re just starting to try writing. In fact, I had a minimum of 2,000 words as my goal/expectation when she and I started working together (then collaborating, then falling in love\u2014it\u2019s a long story). Having that kind of goal works for her and (on my current project, anyway) doesn\u2019t work at all for me. What works best for me is defining how much time I\u2019m going to spend writing and keeping track of that time. If it takes me 10 hours to write 1,000 words, that\u2019s fine as long as my primary focus is on the next word or sentence for those 10 hours. If I write 1,000 words in an hour, I\u2019m still on the clock for the next five, so I should keep writing. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no set amount. Inspiration comes on different days and sometimes, not for days or weeks or month at a time. That being said, I am an employed writer (a content marketer) so I write every single day. I write between 1,000 and 2,500 words on average. Not because I necessarily want to, but because I have to and I get paid to and businesses count on me to. Outside my profession\u2014say on weekends or on holidays\u2014I force myself to write at least a journal entry per day. The journal entry can be as short as three things I am grateful for to pages of thoughts. I think what\u2019s more important than how many words per day is just getting into the habit of writing daily. Forget length. Don\u2019t stress about quality. Just create a writing habit and stick to it. ",
