            "answer_text": "Jehovah God had a special reason for sending Jesus into this impoverished world of mankind. Divine love was the motivation for this, for Jesus himself said: \u201cGod loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone EXERCISING FAITH in HIM might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. For God sent forth his Son into the world, not for him to judge the world, but for the world to be saved through him.\u201d\u2014John 3:16, 17. Jesus did not teach, as did the Buddha, that one can work out one\u2019s own salvation by the pathway of knowledge and enlightenment. Rather, he pointed to God as the source of salvation when he said text above. To be saved, one must have an active faith by exercising it like when you want to maintain your health and fitness, you have to eat balanced diet along with physical exercise to maintain it. Exercising Faith is in the progressive tense, meaning it is a continuing action until our death. \u201cHe that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.\u201d Matt. 24:13\u201cThe final assignment all of us have, no matter how much or how little we can do, is to endure to the end.\u201d Yes, as Christians all of us must endure to the end of this system of things or to the end of our lives. There is no other way to receive Jehovah\u2019s approval for salvation. We are in a race for life, and we must \u201crun with endurance\u201d until we cross the finish line. (Hebrews 12:1) The apostle Peter emphasized the importance of this quality when he urged fellow Christians: \u201cSupply to your faith . . . endurance.\u201d (2 Peter 1:5, 6) It was on a mission of salvation that Jehovah lovingly sent his only-begotten Son. God did not send his Son here in order to judge the world. If God\u2019s Son had been sent on such a judicial mission, the outlook for all mankind would have been hopeless. The sentence of adverse judgment that would have been pronounced by Jesus Christ upon the human family would have been condemnation to death. (Romans 5:12) Thus, by this unique expression of divine love, God counterbalanced the death sentence that sheer justice would have required. ",

            "answer_text": "This scripture is posted throughout Northern Ireland where I live: I have been a bible study student for over 50yrs, and I am a JW which these notes are taken from my own bible study notes having attended 3 Bible study schools at JW schools: They are notes that I have kept from all study classes for further references: I have not always been a JW but through my life have studied various religions for answers and JW\u2019s are the only ones after careful study and still studying to answer my questions: Please find it interesting, and I am in no way trying to defame anybody's faith in believing this very important scripture as it is life to all believers> Thank you for taking the time to read the contents: only-begotten Son: The Greek word mo\u2022no\u2022ge\u2022nes\u02b9, traditionally rendered \u201conly-begotten,\u201d has been defined as \u201cthe only one of its kind; one and only; unique.\u201d In the apostle John\u2019s writings, this term is exclusively used of Jesus. (Joh 1:14; 3:18; 1Jo 4:9; see study note on Joh 1:14.) Although the other spirit creatures produced by God were called sons, Jesus alone is called the \u201conly-begotten Son.\u201d (Ge 6:2, 4; Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:4-7) Jesus, the firstborn Son, was the sole direct creation of his Father, so he was unique, different from all other sons of God. They were created, or begotten, by Jehovah through that firstborn Son. The Greek word mo\u2022no\u2022ge\u2022nes\u02b9 is used in a similar way when Paul says that Isaac was Abraham\u2019s \u201conly-begotten son.\u201d (Heb 11:17) exercising faith in him: Lit., \u201cbelieving into him.\u201d The Greek verb pi\u2022steu\u02b9o (related to the noun pi\u02b9stis, generally rendered \u201cfaith\u201d) has the basic meaning \u201cto believe; to have faith,\u201d but it can express different shades of meaning, depending on context and grammatical constructions. The meaning of this term often goes beyond mere belief or recognition that someone exists. (Jas 2:19) It includes the idea of faith and trust that lead to obedient action. At Joh 3:16, the Greek verb pi\u2022steu\u02b9o is used together with the preposition eis, \u201cinto.\u201d Regarding this Greek phrase, one scholar noted: \u201cFaith is thought of as an activity, as something men do, i.e. putting faith into someone.\u201d (An Introductory Grammar of New Testament Greek, Paul L. Kaufman, 1982, p. 46) Jesus obviously refers to a life characterized by faith, not just a single act of faith. At Joh 3:36, the similar expression \u201cthe one who exercises faith in the Son\u201d is contrasted with \u201cthe one who disobeys the Son.\u201d Therefore, in that context, \u201cto exercise faith\u201d includes the idea of demonstrating one\u2019s strong beliefs or faith through obedience. Read John 3:16. Many whom we invite to the Memorial will know this verse by heart. But the question is, How does Jesus\u2019 sacrifice make everlasting life possible? The Memorial campaign, the Memorial itself, and the calls we later make on those who attended may provide us with the opportunity to help sincere truth-seekers to understand the answer to that important question. Such ones may be impressed when they begin to understand to a fuller degree how Jehovah\u2019s love and wisdom are expressed by the ransom provision. What points about the ransom could we highlight? Jehovah provided a perfect man who could become the ransomer. That perfect man would need to be loyal to Jehovah and be willing to give his life in exchange for doomed humanity. (Rom. 5:17-19) Jehovah transferred the life of his very first creation from heaven to earth. (John 1:14) Jesus thus became a perfect human, just as Adam had been. But unlike Adam, Jesus lived up to the standard Jehovah expected from a perfect man. Even under the most extreme tests, Jesus never sinned nor broke any of God\u2019s laws. As a perfect man, Jesus could save humankind from sin and death by dying in their behalf. He corresponded exactly to all that Adam should have been\u2014a perfect man, absolutely loyal and obedient to God. (1 Tim. 2:6) Jesus became the ransom sacrifice that opened the way to endless life \u201cfor many\u201d\u2014men, women, and children. (Matt. 20:28) Indeed, the ransom is the key that unlocks the door to the fulfillment of God\u2019s original purpose. (2 Cor. 1:19, 20) The ransom gives all faithful humans the prospect of everlasting life ",

The ransom gives all faithful humans the prospect of everlasting life. To benefit from that ransom however, humans need to exercise faith in God\u2019s Son to be saved from their dying condition and to gain everlasting life. This means that gaining the gift of everlasting life is conditional. If we are to \u201chave everlasting life,\u201d we need to believe in Jesus and obey him. ",
