Also, they seem to keep track of sales of books beyond their catalog because I've seen a book with the ranking number past 8 million; I can't remember the title but I never saw another ranking this low. [Update, May 31, 2015]I saw another book with an even lower ranking, almost 13 million!\"Harlan Ellison's Chocolate Alphabet (AKA From A to Z in theChocolate Alphabet)\" ",
