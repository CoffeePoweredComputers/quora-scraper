            "answer_text": "Before I became more involved in teaching students how to vet and discriminate between good and bad sources, I would have simply said, \u201cDon\u2019t cite Quora.\u201d After all, how credible can a Quora answer be? Anyone can write it, right? The truth is that any source can be the best source for some kind of research. As an example, if you were to write an essay about the credibility of Wikipedia, would you avoid citing Wikipedia? Clearly not. The reliability of Wikipedia itself has already been covered[1], but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m addressing. Wikipedia itself is valid enough when talking about Wikipedia. Twitter, likewise, can be the best source out there. As we know, the President of the United States jumps on Twitter all the time. If you\u2019re writing about Trump, what better source can there be? It is, quite literally, an original historical document. The same would be true (perhaps to a lesser degree) if you were writing about the events of the moderately recent revolutions in Egypt and Syria. What better source than someone who is right there in the thick of things? Clearly you would have to contextualize the source as at least moderately unverified in most such cases. I would say that Quora itself isn\u2019t a credible source. As an example, I completely believe Jasmine Adamson\u2019s answer: Jasmine Adamson's answer to Why are drone batteries so big? There is no doubt in my mind that she knows what she\u2019s talking about\u2026 but I just wouldn\u2019t cite it. She\u2019s intelligent, so I suspect that she would likewise tell you that you should find the answer elsewhere and cite it from a more reputable source than Quora. Tirumalai Kamala is perhaps the best medical sciences authority on Quora. It is literally what she does. She has the credentials and everything. Even better, she cites her sources and analyzes them. Absolutely amazing work. Check out her most recent answer: Tirumalai Kamala's answer to What is the evolutionary explanation for blood type antibodies? 30 well-chosen sources, each incorporated. It makes anything I write look like a child wrote it. I would absolutely cite a paper that she had written and published somewhere, but I think she would question having an answer that she had written on Quora used in an academic paper. It isn\u2019t what she wrote so much as where she wrote it. Quora just isn\u2019t the right place (yet) to go for academic research. I also don\u2019t think she wrote it for that purpose. This all being said, there are two kinds of credibility. Would I trust what Jasmine Adamson says about drones if I were purchasing one? Without question. Would I trust Tirumalai Kamala\u2019s take on medicine? Again, without question. In fact, I have read and followed their advice. The same is true of many contributors on Quora. The problem is that their answers are very worthy and correct (so I assume, since they are far more intelligent than I am when it comes to immunology and engineering specs), but they are published on a site where I\u2019ve seen incorrect answers not only as the top answer but upvoted a ridiculous number of times. Items I believe are factually and scientifically inaccurate\u2014faith medicine from fly-by-night company entities, as an example. At the same time, I have told my AP students to come to Quora, do research, ask questions, and NEVER use it in their academic papers. Quora is a great place to go in order to gain insights. It isn\u2019t a great place of you want to quote something for academic research\u2026 With one exception. Just as with Twitter and Wikipedia, I can spin a story where Quora is absolutely worthy of being cited. Hillary Clinton's answer to How would a Clinton administration help break down the gridlock in Washington? If you were going to write a paper about politics, a comment from a verified profile belonging to a politician is absolutely the right place to go.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m one of the most skeptical human beings you will ever find regarding reliability on-line. Unfortunately, nowadays people only receive information through social media, and such information can be highly manipulated. It is a known fact that many newspapers and broadcasting channels are highly biased. And specially in America where the media has a huge amount of control and infouence over the viewers. Now, if we already know that news reports and online articles are totally biased for many issues how can we trust other online sites which don\u2019t have the duty to portray the trusth, but they simply seek a main stream of clicks, likes and shares trough juicy headlines\u2026 If you start asking friends around you, especially those between the ages of 15\u201340 you\u2019ll realize that people no longer sit down in the morning to read the newspaper. Instead, they sit on their phones scrolling through tones of guided information that appears on their newsfeed. What many don\u2019t know is that big internet companies such as google, facebook or amazon sell the information of content we have previously searched and then they prioritize showing it again and again. Haven't you ever wondered why when you search for bycicles on amazon, even if it\u2019s just once out of pure curiosity, that when you go back to facebook, youtube or any other website with ads, that you will find your browser full of bycilce deals and pop-up adverstisement. Now why is this entire lecture significant for the question in discussion. Well, basically Quora can be a useful source of knowlege for two reasons. First, simply because it uses a human filter in which you can upvote or downvote content which allows the system to improve the content that will show you. Then here your criteria creates the filter of information not your searches. Second, as pointed out by other writers, most of the questions and debates in this source are focused on opinions. These articles are trying to provide you with hard knowledge, in contrast, you acquire soft knowledge through seeing other\u2019s opinions and points of view. In other words, these articles are not trying to tell you what to think, but rather helping you see what others think so you can form your own opinions. ",
