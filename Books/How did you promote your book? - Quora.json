            "answer_text": "As my book is not in a very popular topic, like teenage vampire novels, for example (it\u2019s about the disintegration of Yugoslavia and my participation in the resulting wars), I concentrated my promotion efforts on the small group of people who might be interested in those events. I think that it\u2019s most important that you target a specific audience. If your promotion efforts are too widespread, you won\u2019t sell many books. For each \u201ctarget\u201d, I had a slightly different approach: People in Kosovo Although my book was published in an Albanian language edition[1] more than six months ago, I still haven\u2019t done an official book launch. I\u2019m not convinced that it will generate a lot of attention. Thankfully, I know a lot of journalists and therefore, most of my promotion is via internet news sites. People abroad I did a book reading in Switzerland and I will have another one soon in Croatia. This is a very good way to promote your book. People buy your book in advance and take it to the book reading for you to sign it. Soldiers I gave away free copies for all the soldiers in my unit in Kosovo. My buddies in Germany[2] and Croatia, however, had to buy it online. I also gave some books in English[3] to a couple of US Army Special Forces that I met a short while ago.  During a book reading event Soldiers have their own information channels. When they like a book, they recommend it to their buddies and sometimes, this interest in a book spreads over from the military to other people. People are curious and ask:\u201d Why do soldiers like this book so much?\u201d and buy it. I also produced a number of promo videos for my book. People prefer watching a video to reading text. With promo videos, you reach a lot of people, but on the other hand, these folks aren\u2019t necessarily the most avid book lovers. For my book, the best and most successful promotion was done by targeting a rather small audience. Better to have fifty people that buy your book, like it, and then promote it to others than wasting your money on expensive ads.
