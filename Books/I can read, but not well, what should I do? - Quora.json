            "answer_text": "Reading do requires concentration and a sense of passion in delving into a certain medium. And of course, reading entails comprehension. To be considered as a good reader, it\u2019s not enough to literally and just plainly speak every words inscripted but it also concerns on how well you understand the gist of that story. As for those people who do not consider themselves as a good one, here are some basic tips that could possibly help you: If you don\u2019t like to read and you think it is just for compliance, then don\u2019t read. You will just end up wasting your time and energy for doing it without getting learnings. But if it\u2019s really a need and you\u2019re not in the mood, I suppose you should set your mind first. Do things that can help you concentrate and would motivate you to read. (You should know what those things are personally)Just what I\u2019ve said earlier, you need to have a sense of passion. Try to read books that best interests you. You will never be able to finish reading a book even if it contains only few leaves when it doesn\u2019t enthrall you. But, you will surely finish a thousand-page book if you really love the story.In the process of reading, read every details carefully. Don\u2019t mind the idea of being pressured at the thought of you being a slow reader. Bear in mind that reading is learning. And comprehension is a significant aspect in reading.Jot down unfamiliar words or terms you encounter while reading. You may check its meaning on a source. This may definitely help you in understanding what you read.If you have a hard time grasping the thought of the story, you may go back to the portion where you can hardly understand or made you confused. You can highlight this part and go back whenever you want. Based from experience, I can hardly continue and proceed reading if there are parts that made me baffled. That\u2019s why I always end up reading it again and again.Absorb every details. Think that all the words and thoughts being written are important. Do not agree to skip some parts that you consider as \u2018unimportant\u2019.It is helpful if you highlight parts that attract you or caught your attention. Well, maybe the reason of this is that it inspired you or either way, you were able to relate the statement from what you have experienced.After reading, try to ask some questions. Provide some realizations, reflections or any reaction from what you\u2019ve read. You can even critique (well it applies even if you\u2019re not a professional). Try to examine and test yourself if you\u2019ve gained knowledge from that book.I apply all these in my life as a reader. I still consider myself as a newbie in the bookworm world, however it is a process. You may be a slow reader for now, but time will come that you will devour books if you also practice yourself in becoming a good reader. Through books you are able to explore life and be amazed by every new learnings you get just by reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Which language are you lacking to read? Hindi or english or some other language? The best solution is read, the more you try to read the more comfortable you\u2019ll become. If it\u2019s english start with simple books like take english novels aimed for school kids, as you grow comfortable. Aim for a higher level. Same goes for any other language. Practice reading and if you get stuck ask someone to help you read, like your friend or some elder or teacher would be a good choice. Good Luck. ",
