            "answer_text": " This is not my specialty, but I followed it off and on when it was happening and I do know someone who wrote about it quite often -- Dr. Nerdlove, an online advice columnist who is also male, a feminist, and fond of all things nerdish. This is the overall link for his columns: Paging Dr. NerdLove - Helping Nerds Get The Girl.  In one article, \"The End of Gatekeeping,\" DNL (as I will now call him) traces the history of deliberately-imposed sexual stereotyping in gaming. (The End of Gatekeeping: The Extinction Burst of Gaming Culture - Paging Dr. NerdLove) He argues that while women played games enthusiastically, the games they played were different from the ones mostly played by men, and (according to male gamers) didn't \"count\" as games in the same way. (I should, as full disclosure here, mention that I've been playing games since my first roll of quarters in arcades, and would definitely count as a longtime gamer except that I'm female and my preferences were for mostly softcore games. **) Depending on how geeky you are, you might enjoy the article, \"No girls allowed,\" which completely unpacks how women were excluded from gaming over time. If not, suffice it to say that \"gamer\" culture was viewed as male-only culture, particularly by gamers themselves. When women started being visible in the business, they were viewed with suspicion. And as happens with any insular culture, when a male game designer and a female game designer broke up, gossip about it spread throughout; vicious gossip, that the woman had been having sex with other men in order to improve her professional opportunities. From there it exploded from some pointing out that gamers were jumping to conclusions to a full-on conspiracy theory which included death threats, stalking, and violent anti-woman statements from a lot of gamers. The really, really ugly underside of what male gamers as a group thought of women (dirt) and themselves (cool) became nationally exposed, which only made most of them angrier at being \"smeared.\" (That is, the ugliest comments being reprinted, and the FBI investigating the death threats.) Here's an example of how the male gamers represented those disagreeing with them:  I haven't read FeiFei Wang's recommended link, but I'm sure it's a useful one for the overall basics. I find it hard to even write a timeline of what happened because it's so horrific. It's pretty much an internet version of events in the Middle East where men are throwing acid on the faces of women not wearing head coverings.  If you can stand it, here's an archive of the best known Gamer site making unprovable claims: Politically Incorrect \" Thread #35074450. It's racist, sexist, nationalist, and various other ists, so trigger warnings there. Still this piece is one of the least offensive for its treatment of women. Finally, a year ago, DNL summarized some of the more egregious events of Gamergate here: What We Talk About When We Talk About GamerGate - Paging Dr. NerdLove. It's a bit clearer than the primary text of 4chan mentioned in the paragraph above. That's all I know. It reminded me far too much working with survivors of sexual and domestic violence, so I never wanted to explore too deeply. FOLLOW-UP  NOTE: David Spearman wrote an answer which defended the \"gamer gate\" side of this perspective, in my opinion fairly straightforwardly. Please read his answer (and if you like, my comment on it) for further perspective.   **Though in the 80s I had an atari and played Space Invaders till the screen went dark, something most people didn't know could even happen, especially me. I thought it had broken at first, not understanding the first thing about programming and games. ",

            "answer_text": "Both sides had people that sent death/rape threats. The same goes for every issue ever since the Internet has existed and likely before that as well. GamerGate wasn\u2019t about that and figureheads on both sides were vehemently opposed to death/rape threats. GamerGate started when game developer Zoe Quinn\u2019s ex boyfriend made a statement claiming she cheated on him and violated his consent by not disclosing that she cheated on him before having sex with him (AKA rape by deception). One of the men she allegedly cheated with was someone who had given positive coverage to one of her games without disclosing that he had a relationship with her. This caused people to realize various relationships between game reviewers/journalists and game developers that were being hidden from the public. Websites started having their writers disclose their relationships with subjects, so this stopped being a problem eventually. GamerGate was a hashtag that was used to talk about ethical/disclosure/journalistic integrity issues within the game community. Some people used the hashtag correctly, and some used it poorly. Sometimes false information was floating around on the tag, just like any other hashtag on Twitter. There was a lot of drama and a lot of hot takes. They discussed issues that mattered and plenty of issues that didn\u2019t matter. All GamerGate ever really was was people talking on Twitter, occasionally raising money for charity. GamerGate\u2019s been over and done with for at least 4 years now. Whether that\u2019s because games journalism became more ethical or because gamers just gave up on fact checking game journalism sites, I\u2019m not sure. It comes up once in a blue moon when there\u2019s a really obvious ethics issue and then it goes away again. I always thought it was very similar to BlackLivesMatter, where it was unfairly demonized by the people it was trying to keep checked and keep honest. Just like bad cops and bad politicians hate blacklivesmatter, bad journalists and bad developers didn\u2019t like when GamerGate exposed their secret relationships that might cause you to second guess their honesty, so they wrote countless articles full of name calling while avoiding the actual issues that were being brought up. Eerily similar to when people called peaceful protests \u201cmobs\u201d and \u201criots\u201d or kneeling \u201cdisrespecting the flag\u201d. Of course BLM and GG have both had bad people try to turn them into something they weren\u2019t supposed to be, but I don\u2019t think they were changed as a result. BLM has had a huge resurgence and has changed the minds of people who listened to the nay sayers, so it\u2019s possible the same could happen with GamerGate, but that might not even be necessary since a lot of GamerGate\u2019s issues were resolved.
