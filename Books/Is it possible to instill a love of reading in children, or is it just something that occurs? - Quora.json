            "answer_text": "Oh yes there is! Granted, some kids gravitate to it on their own. We forget that reading (at the beginning) is a challenging and tedious decoding of squiggles (sounding words out). Then memorization comes into play, and we\u2019re off! All of the words you just read were done at lightning speed, with memorization. Effortless. When kids learn to read, they need incentive to WANT to decode the squiggles - to overcome the tedium and get rewarded with the satisfaction of following a story. How do we set the stage for this proverbial carrot? We read them stories. Lots of stories. We engage them in the pleasure of reading vicariously through us. We set the example, provide the interest. Then when it comes time to learn to read, they already know the warm fuzzy feeling of following an engaging story. The curiosity of finding out what the text beside a picture describes (in picture books and graphic novels and comics). The pride in reading a \u201cchapter book\u201d all by themselves with your approval. That\u2019s how it starts. Some kids find the learning easier than others. But all kids can benefit from being read to. Read them a nice intricate story. An interesting story that you also find enjoyable. Read to your kids even when they already know how to read. Read stuff that\u2019s too difficult for them. Read to your kids! ",

            "answer_text": "I was never encouraged by my parents to be a reader. I never really had access to books. I became a reader when we moved and my new school had a classroom library. I was 9 years old and discovered the joy of reading. Since that time I have read thousands of books. I started encouraging my nieces to be readers almost from the time they were born. I bought them children\u2019s books and every time they went to bed at our house, Grandma had to read them a story from one of their books. Unfortunately I moved far away when they were 8 and 6 and lost close contact so I don\u2019t know if they became readers. I like to think they did because they were both extremely bright, curious with vivid imaginations. I believe that books would have appealed greatly to both of them. I know that the oldest earned her masters degree. A love of reading does not just occur unless there is access. If I had access to books from a younger age, I might have loved reading sooner. But you can instill a love of books in a child. Start as early as you can. Show them the worlds they can find in books, the friends that are available in books. If they have trouble reading, you can even give them a little tutoring. ",
