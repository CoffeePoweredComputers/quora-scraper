            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. The answer to this question depends on what your target Quant score is vs. where you're at right now in terms of prep and performance in tests. An hour or two per day should be sufficient practice to keep yourself sharp in solving problems. I'd say with a month to go, you still have plenty of time before you need to go into \"revision\" mode. You probably already know your weak areas and strong areas - spend a week or so in thoroughly reviewing the concepts in the areas that you regularly score low or get problems wrong - be it Geometry, Probability or P&C. Explore different places (GMATClub, Thursdays with Ron series etc) to find tutorials that really address particular topics you are not comfortable with, and  get comfortable with them.  You should also simulate test conditions when you practice in the last month. In case you do not have time for 4hr study sessions, set aside 2.5hrs for continuous study and practise questions in GMAT format (37 Quant questions in 75 mins, take a short 5 min break, and solve 41 Verbal questions in 75 mins). Then you can review all the questions you got wrong - immediately if time permits or come back later for review. For this entire exercise, I'd recommend the GMAT Official Question Pack that you can purchase from the official website. This is what I used for practice. I should stress that I strongly believe in the last month, you should only be solving questions from Official sources - OG 11/12/13, GMATPrep, Question Pack from GMAC or the specific OG for Quant/Verbal. You can find most of these questions listed and discussed on GMATClub/BeatTheGMAT forums. For last 3 days, you should be taking it easy and not do too many questions or try to learn new things. You don't want to burn yourself out. This is the time for revision. :) I found the  GMATClub Math Fundamentals book very useful for this purpose. Good luck with your GMAT. I hope this answer helps with your preparation! ",

            "answer_text": "I will be a bit bland and frank on this topic. Assumption: You have already completed your studies required for Quants for GMAT and have sufficient knowledge about the topics. You are familiar with all the question types and difficulty levels. You have solved the OG at least and have your own set of shortcuts and problem-solving methods. Answer:25 days to revise Quants for GMAT is TOO MUCH of time. In case you do satisfy the assumptions I stated above, you realize that to allocate 25 days for revision is simply a waste of time.1. Nevertheless, to brush up your concepts, you could try again with those questions which you got wrong while solving the OG.2. Since I used Gmatclub Free Resources only I can advise wrt them - Solve their Free Tests.3. After finishing the tests, explore the forums with 700+ level questions and solve the questions. I would suggest you to not spend more than 1 hour daily for Quants. It should be sufficient enough. ",
