Don\u2019t force yourself to read \u201cserious literature.\u201d That makes reading feel like taking medicine. Reading refines your sensibilities. It\u2019s a natural process. You start to appreciate good writing and gravitate toward better books. Who knows, you might find yourself reading the classics. By that time you\u2019ll be reading because you love it. ",
