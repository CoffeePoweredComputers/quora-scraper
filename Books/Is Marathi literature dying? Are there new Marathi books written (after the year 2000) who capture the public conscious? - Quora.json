            "answer_text": "We can't answer this question as of now. Only time will tell. The publication of Marathi novels has been reduced substantialy. But Marathi literature is not dying. The statement in the answer is not true because if you are reader of daily Loksatta you can see two to three marathi books are being published weekly. The Jnanpith award of 2014 was given Dr. Balchandra Nemade for his masterpiece Hindu. The publication of Marathi books have been reduced due to current generation is the product of English schools. The reading habit of the current generation fading day by day. This scenario is the worldwide not restricted to Marathi. Marathi people should accept new author by open heart as reader tend to compare current literature with the old one. The author gets encouragement to write through the sell of the book which reflects his/ her future contribution towards literature. In 70's and 80's reader used to wait for new books from their favourite author just like nowadays people wait for smart phone luanch. The current generation of authors are new to the literature world ( Eg. Asaram lomate). The quality of literature solely depends on the experience of author. I believe that there is void of experienced author in Marathi and that will be narrowed in future when current author will get older.
