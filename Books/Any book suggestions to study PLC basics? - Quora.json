            "answer_text": "\"INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC CONTROLLER\" By Garry Dunning.   Most of the things explained in this book with  the reference of Allen Bradley PLC. Though many places other make PLC like, Mitsubishi, GE,  Siemens etc. are explained. You get in-depth knowledge of hardware of PLC and good explanation is made about Bit, WORD, Bytes etc. In my view it is just a complete book for a beginner, even though I bought this book  8 years back, still I read this for knowledge of basic of PLC.
