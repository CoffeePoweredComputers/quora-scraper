And the course has lectures which inform you how to go about solving these problems? I suggest: Read the book.Go to the lectures.Take notes.Borrow notes from other students.Try to work out the solutions yourself.If you can\u2019t get the solutions yourself, ask for help.From other studentsFrom the teaching staff.You won\u2019t make satisfactory progress until you understand the topics. Getting others to assist you is fine but eventually you have to come to your own understanding. Otherwise you are very likely to fail your examinations - you wont have access to Quora, Wikipedia, friends etc in the exam. ",

            "answer_text": "If someone has gone to the trouble of scanning and uploading the book then you might find it on a torrent site. However, books such as this, with low popularity, tend not to be available that way. Please note, too, that infringement of copyright is illegal. I\u2019m not condoning it - I\u2019m simply answering the question. I think it highly unlikely that you\u2019ll find someone giving away a copy for free. However, you might strike lucky and get a cheap, used copy from a student who no longer needs it. Ask on social media and in forums where students studying electrical engineering might post. ",
