            "answer_text": "I'm going to disappoint you. You can't be sure. You can have a degree of confidence by using experience,  confirmation and comparison. Here are some tools to use to identify more reliable information. 1) Where is the book published? Is it a self published book? A popular press? A university press? What country and city? 2) Who is the author? Do their degrees make them an authority on their field? Who disagrees with them? 3) What is the depth and bredth of the books coverage? Is it arguing a very narrow or a very broad point? What proof is included? Is the methodology obvious or easily available? 4) When was the book published? When was the research conducted? Has it been superseded or discredited? 5) How does this book fit in with other knowledge in the field? Is it a point of view or a challenge to a core theory? Does it confirm the consensus view in the field? More reliable books will have substantial evidence included if they are challenging the consensus view, and will stand up to criticism over a long period of time. They will usually come from university presses or academic presses and argue narrow points, with clear methodology. In the humanities and social sciences, the point of view and school of thought informing the piece will be clearly identified. ",

            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s your first introduction to the subject, you can't know (as Brett Williams, a professional librarian wrote). To add on to his answer, sometimes even the traditional signs such as a legitimate publisher get tripped up. It comes down to \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read, see, hear, etc.\u201d Here\u2019s a personal example. I grew up in the 1960\u2019s and am a big follower of the US space program that put a man on the moon and have read many books on the subject, watched documentaries, visited Neil Armstrong\u2019s hometown, etc. I bought a book by Craig Nelson titled Rocket Men: The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon. It was published by Viking Press in 2009 - a legitimate and large international book publishing house. The author worked at several major book publishers, had written for known publications, and this was his fourth book. The dust jacket had the usual gushing blurbs from other legitimate bestselling authors. The book was chock full of errors. I won\u2019t list them all but here are some of the most egregious, almost to the point of humor: Page 79: in describing the Apollo 11 command module - \u201c \u2026. a copper, silver, and white cone made from iron reinforced with porcelain.\u201d No, it was made of aluminum. Page 225: describing the engine burn that put the Apollo 11 spacecraft into lunar orbit - \u201c\u2026slowed the craft to 2,917 feet per second, allowing it to fall into the pull of the Moon\u2019s gravity. The gravitational warp in space-time then threw it like a slingshot to the dark side \u2026.\u201d What? A space-time warp? While doing a lunar orbit insertion with a 1960\u2019s era rocket? No, they used a rocket engine to slow their velocity from 5,000 mph to 3,000 mph to get caught in the moon\u2019s gravity and secure an orbit. And, saving the best for last, Page 268: describing the helmets that Neil and Buzz wore on the moon - \u201cThe helmet had two visors, one like a pair of mild sunglasses to combat glare, the outer a one-way mirror of gold electro-plate which would reflect the worst of the sun\u2019s blinding rays. Also, in the unlikely event of a hostile encounter, its reflection would keep aliens from being able to peer into a human face.\u201d What? They were afraid that if they encountered aliens on the moon, they didn\u2019t want them to see what Neil and Buzz looked like? He was doing fine until he wrote that last sentence. ",
