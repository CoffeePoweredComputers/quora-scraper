            "answer_text": "I think the harder question is why rather than how. How: you sit down and write. If you don\u2019t have any ideas, brainstorm, or look at some of the techniques suggested all over Quora. How do I come up with ideas to write about? I am sitting here, staring at the wall. No ideas are coming. Don\u2019t forget to look at the suggested questions related to the above question. They\u2019re on the right side of your screen. There are loads of them that will help you. If you have trouble finding your \u2018voice\u2019 or you\u2019re not sure how to turn an idea into a story, there are loads of books about this. One that I like to suggest is: Amazon.com: Plot Versus Character: A Balanced Approach to Writing Great Fiction (0035313650352): Jeff Gerke: Books There\u2019s also: Amazon.com: Story: Style, Structure, Substance, and the Principles of Screenwriting eBook: Robert McKee: Kindle Store But some people find that one too complicated. I think a beginner can do fine with it if they\u2019re a careful reader and don\u2019t insist on \u2018getting\u2019 all the information into their heads the first time they read it. It\u2019s best to read some, write some, read some more \u2026 it\u2019s a great book to reread because you\u2019ll get something new out of it each time you make progress with your writing craft. But maybe you need this Quora thread for the how: I want to write a novel, but don't have an appealing story idea, skill as a writer, free time, tenacity, imagination, or observational skill needed to write a good novel. What should I do? None of this advice will make a bit of difference, though, unless you figure out why you want to write. Is it for fun? Do you want to develop a side income stream? Do you have things you want to say to the world? Are you a masochist? (The last comment is meant to be funny. I feel like a masochist sometimes because of my compulsion to write.) Until you have a purpose, whether it\u2019s self-entertainment, therapy, you want to work toward becoming a professionally published author, or some other reason, it\u2019s going to be hard to direct your efforts. It\u2019s also going to be hard to give you specific advice that will be useful for you. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean by \u201ccreative\u201d the same thing I mean by \u201ccreative,\u201d you\u2019ve already started, merely by creating that one sentence question? You could have asked it in dozens of different ways, or not ask it at all, but you created it. Some people think that fiction is synonymous with \u201ccreative,\u201d but they\u2019re only looking at the writer\u2019s skill with words. Yes, flowery, evocative words can make some fine writing, but that\u2019s not all there is to creativity in writing. Any time you write something that\u2019s never been written before, you\u2019re creating. In fact, the only writing I can think of that\u2019s not \u201ccreative\u201d is plagiarism. In fiction, for example, you are being creative when you choose which scenes to write and which to omit. But you do the same thing in writing non-fiction. If you\u2019re writing, say, about World War II, which battles do you choose to write about? What non-battle events do you describe? And how many details of each do you write, and which do you omit. Those are all \u201ccreative things.\u201d No two accounts of World War II will be the same. Each will be a \u201ccreative thing.\u201d Then, too, it\u2019s creative to decide on the order of things in you writing. Where does the story of a romance begin? Where does the story of World War II begin? Do you choose chronological order in your writing, or do you go back and forth in time? If two events take place concurrently, which do you place first in your writing? Or perhaps you switch back and forth with a little of one alternating with a bit of the other? In other words, any time you write anything that\u2019s not merely copying someone else\u2019s words, you writing a \u201ccreative thing.\u201d So, just stop worrying about creativity and start writing.
