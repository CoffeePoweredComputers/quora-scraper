            "answer_text": "This information may be a bit out of date so please check the facts but the principle won't have changed. In the UK, you sign up with an agency, preferably one that specialises in contractors. You will have a choice of how you want to be paid. Some agencies operate additional accounting and umbrella services where they will look after your financial situation for you and you just get paid a net income less their cut which will include a charge for their services. Alternatively you employ an accountant and set up your own limited company. The agency will still take a cut but you and/or accountant will have to do your books. Limited companies need to be audited so you will have to employ an accountant either way. You may also have to register for VAT and use prescribed accounting software packages stipulated by the Inland Revenue. Wait for a call from the agency, go for the interview selection process, and if you are successful, agree to the contract terms, start work and hope your contract gets renewed after the agreed term (3 months is normal). If not, try and relax at home, wait for the call while hoping you get a contract before your next mortgage payment is due, go through the selection process again. Repeat. After contracting for a while, you will have hopefully build up at least 3 months' financial buffer to tide you through in between jobs. Contracting is not for everyone even though the income sounds fantastic as you may be only working 6 months of the year. Even \u00a3500 a day isn't a lot after hotel and travelling bills, paying off your accountant, taxes and insurances. ",
