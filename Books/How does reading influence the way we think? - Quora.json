            "answer_text": "I suspect that it trains us to think about ideas as being organized in a couple of very specific ways: hierarchically (word, sentence, paragraph, section, chapter, volume, series\u2026) and linearly: from beginning to end. Compare this to something like a complex chart drawn on a whiteboard, or a mindmap, in which ideas connect to each other in a variety of directions simultaneously. When I was a kid, I was a huge fan of comic books. I found them much easier to read than pure-text books. But in my teens, I quit reading them and spent the next 40 years voraciously reading unillustrated prose\u2014thousands of books\u2014and this seems to have trained my brain (and untrained it) in a specific ways. I know this, because I\u2019m almost unable to read comics and graphic novels, now. Friends recommend them, and I try, but I find the process\u2014one I used to find easier than reading pure prose\u2014mentally taxing. And what\u2019s hard for me is the lack of linearity. Comics are linear in the sense that (most of them) are standard narratives that coast from beginning to end. But within each frame, you have to break the linear approach to reading and look around. And some comics are very sophisticated in terms of how they demand you move your eyes around the page. This is a skill I could probably get back, if I spent more time reading comics, but it\u2019s definitely a skill I lost, and I\u2019m sure that spending so many years reading ideas organized in the ways books organize them (linearly and hierarchically) has affected the way I think. Writing has become crucial for me. It\u2019s very hard for me to think through anything without words. And, of course, when I write, I am generating the same sort of organization I see when I read. Just the process of doing so much thinking in words has an effect on the brain. My need to write (or read) in order to think may be extreme, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a result of a life spent continually reading and writing. I\u2019ve also spent a life mostly reading long-form texts. I read fat non-fiction books much more often than I read news articles, and I read long novels much more often than I read short stories. This seems to correlate with my mental model of the world. I see it as a highly complex place of infinite depth that\u2019s impossible to sum up. (Friends say I make everything complicated.) But the causal direction is unclear. Has decades of immersion in long-form texts shaped my brain to be attracted to complexity? Or has my (genetic?) attraction to complexity drawn me to certain types of texts? ",

            "answer_text": "There is life and intelligence within every cell of your being that respond to your thoughts and words, (and the words spoken or written by others). So read words of life, speak words of life, and your whole body will be healthier! This is especially potent when you read just before going to sleep. Our subconscious minds are powerful and do not miss a trick, you might miss it but your subconscious did not. Whatever you read or hear as you are dosing off will marinate in your subconscious for hours as you sleep. One answer in here nailed it in the first sentence, \u201cit (reading) trains\u201d your thinking. Words are like seeds being planted in the mind. No matter your opinion of them, they stick like glue in your subconscious mind and influence your behavior and your health. This is so true and so powerful that it is used against us constantly through advertising, politics, healthcare, and news media. Propaganda manipulation = words. Too much to site examples for, just let your imagination go from here now that you have read my words. The Bible even teaches about the power of words. The tongue, one of the smallest organs of our being yet it has the power to either destroy or heal through its ability to form words. Before you go to sleep tonight, tell your cells \u201cI am well\u201d, there is unlimited power in \u201c I am\u201d. Use it wisely! ",
