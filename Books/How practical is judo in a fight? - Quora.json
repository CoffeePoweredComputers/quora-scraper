            "answer_text": "It depends. What kind of fights are you thinking of getting into? I can talk about my experiences as a kid, and once I\u2019ve used it as a grown-up. You decide whether it is practical for your purposes. I am a peaceful guy and haven\u2019t been in many fights. Beyond the practicality of learning how to fall without getting hurt (roll and slap), which can really save you from being seriously hurt, I have been in a few short scrapes. I don\u2019t like fighting and I make it clear. But I do resolve things quickly. That\u2019s why Judo appeals to me. I studied and got pretty decent at it, getting second place in a couple middle-scale competitions at my level. Because Judo is all about balance and getting the other person to the ground so they can be immobilized, this is not at all what your opponent will expect - maybe they\u2019ve seen too much TV, maybe they studied a martial art where people punch each other, it doesn\u2019t matter; Judo is very much an unexpected thing, which is what makes it useful. Note this will sound like I\u2019m some great fighter; I\u2019m decidedly not, particularly as a kid - I\u2019m nerdy and back then I was short and light and lanky. The only fistfight I ever got into I lost horribly and I ended up bloody. I am not good with fists. Then I found Judo, and it appealed to me because there\u2019s little blood, the fights gets resolved quickly, in what\u2019s called an \u201cippon\u201d(like a point/match/\u201dthe downed opponent would not be able to do anything past this\u201d), and I don\u2019t like hitting people or getting into scrapes. I can talk about three occasions where a bully was humiliated and Judo saved the day for me. The first time, the opponent (the typical middle school bully, larger than me at the time) was insulting me at recess at school. He pushed me once, I stood my ground while I evaluated his stance and cadence while he walked, then he got close to me to push me again. I stepped to the side, put my foot behind his and dumped him to the ground with a basic foot sweep with basically zero effort as he moved backwards after pushing me. Everyone was laughing at him. I just walked away.  Something like this, except I didn\u2019t have to turn (I just couldn\u2019t find the diagram), I just put my leg behind his and pushed him down, holding him by the shirt to break his fall so he wouldn\u2019t hit the back of his head and get hurt with the pavement. A few weeks later, same guy. He jumped on my back (again, in public) and I stepped back instinctively and threw him past me by thrusting my pelvis up while ducking. He flew past me, landed with a loud \u201cthud\u201d and I could hear the air leaving his lungs. I really should have held him like in the diagram so he didn\u2019t hit the cement so hard, but he surprised me and frankly pissed me off, given this was the second time he attacked me (he didn\u2019t like that I didn\u2019t respond to verbal taunts).  Don\u2019t attack a Judoka from the back. We\u2019ll throw you past us, bend and by the time you notice you\u2019re in the ground with a very sore back, we\u2019re in front of you and your torso is exposed to us. Again, I walked away while people laughed. That was the end of that bully, he stopped insulting or even interacting with me for a while. He tried to be my friend after, asking me to \u201cteach him\u201d. I was polite but ignored him. He can go to his own class, where the sensei will also teach him to be peaceful fo others. I don\u2019t want to be responsible for a trained overly-aggressive bully, thank you very much. Once it happened as an adult. The person attacked me trying to punch me. I grappled his arm, turned around to put my back against his chest and used his own thrust to throw him over. I didn\u2019t want to hurt the guy so I sort of \u201cguided him\u201d to the ground as opposed to letting him hit the pavement which would at that speed definitely broken something but instead I immobilized him pinning him to the ground. He tried to wiggle a few times, and I kept trying to verbally get him to calm down. After he agreed to calm I released him. He didn\u2019t try again.  Good luck freeing yourself from this. Your left hand and feet are free, but you can\u2019t hurt me with them. You try moving, we\u2019ll spin right along with you. I didn\u2019t choke him, that would be overkill. I just wanted him to acknowledge he was going to calm down. We are sort of facing each other so you can negotiate the release. So as you can see, it\u2019s worked for me, but only because I don\u2019t pick fights nor I search for them, and because it has a huge element of surprise to it, and the large size of someone else actually works to my advantage (today I\u2019m tall but not heavy, so it doesn\u2019t happen as often that this is needed). When things heat up, if someone is berating me, I\u2019m quietly observing their stance (and hoping they\u2019ll calm down - I really, again, don\u2019t want to fight). If I\u2019m attacked, I know exactly what to do. If they knew Judo, they\u2019d counter and this would last a lot longer. But they often don\u2019t, even if they\u2019re good fighters in a bunch of other styles, so they break their balance as they must (since they\u2019re the attacker) by thrusting at me when hands or feet to try to punch or kick. And 9 times out of 10, they\u2019re going to be in the ground in the next couple seconds after that, no matter how big or small they are in comparison (bigger people get hurt worse simply because they\u2019ll be flying in the air regardless and they\u2019re heavier). So it\u2019s great in that I know I am able to defend myself. I do have to care not to hurt the other person - a tatami (the mat) is not the same as a concrete floor. I use my training (and the muscle memory of my sensei guiding me in falls) to guide them as gently as I can towards the ground. I\u2019m not a jerk, I don\u2019t want them to break their skull or back against the concrete. ",

            "answer_text": "About 5 years ago, I was in a hotel room near an indian casino I that I was visiting for the weekend. The casino had not built a connected hotel yet so they would book rooms at a nice hotel a couple blocks away. Anyway, I had met up with some friends at the casino for dinner. but since I hadn\u2019t checked in yet, I headed to the hotel and got my room. I get to my room dump my stuff off and prepare to head back to the casino. I had just washed my face and was going to change shirts when someone knocked on the door. I figured it was one of my friends, so I went to the door, did a quick peek through thre peephole, and unlatched the door. The door unlatches and as the door opens someone with a stun gun zaps me. It got me in the stomach area and made me jump back. for a moment i thought it might be some kind of joke, but then two guys proceeded to push their way into my room. they were both wearing hoodies but once they were in my room, the main guy with the stun guntook off his hood so he could see better. His stun gun looked like a garage door remote with two prongs sticking out that allowed a menacing blue arc of electricity to crackle across. The first jolt hurt al ot, and I was scared shitless about getting zapped again. Dude says , \u201cok give me the fukin money! I said \u201cdude, I don\u2019t have any I haven even had a chance to gamble yet\u201d. So he motions to his buddy. While the guy stands there withe stun gun pointing at me, his bufy begins to search the room. I suddenly realize that I do in fact have about $1500 in my pocket. I\u2019m thinking crap what will i do if this guy ith the stun gun wants to search me. My mind is racing. I decided there was no way i was going to allow him to zap me again so if he decided to search me that was going to be when I\u2019d be forced to do something. I remember thinking \u201cwell shit, two on one really sucks, I knew that if I ended up scuffling with one, it would be so easy for the other person to attack me unhindered. I\u2019ll never forget. At that moment, for the first time ever, I concluded that if a physical struggle were to occur, to survive, i\u2019d have to kill or seriously maim one of them. Two on one was too risky and I was terrified about being repeatedly zapped if the two of them over powered me. meanwhile the second guy is searching under the bed and in between the matresses a s if I hid my money there. He worked his was around the bed and kept saying \u201ci\u2019m not finding shit dude\u201d. Mr stun gun grows visinly annoyed and looks around the room and spots my laptop on top of the mini fridge. and decides he\u2019s going to take it since they arent finding anything. so with one hand he starts yanking on cords to get it unplugged but he can\u2019t with one hand because he has the stun gun in his other hand. So,he must have felt there was enough distance between us because put the stun gun down on the fridge so he could rehave better reach to unplug the laptop. It was a pretty safe move because he\u2019d have plenty of time to quickly rearm himself. I considered it as well, but he had too much of an advantage. So I waited and watched him proceed to ounplug the lap top cable stuck the laptop under his arm and grab his stnu gun again. meanwhile his buddy was still reaching between the mattresses and was working hs way around the bed andended up between me and mr stun gun. I decided that wit this guy arms between the mattreses and his his was low. I decided this was my best chance to even the odds. So I decided to kick him in the face.something ive never done or even practiced. It made a horrible crunching/smacking sound as his head snapped back and his body flopped up and and i into mr stun gun who got tangled up trying not to drop the stun gun and laptop.The guy sprawled on the floor groaning in pain meanwhile the laptop hits the ground and the stun gun flies loose. There is a half second pause as me and mr stun gun both start looking for the stun gun. near the mini fridge. we both see it and we both grab for it. He manages to grab it and I end up grabbing out of desperation a squirt bottle flea and tick spray repellant. We both back away from each other as we come to grips with what we have. I hold up the squirt bottle and point it at his face. meanwhile his buddy is moaning obviously not as incompacitated as i had hoped. Mr. stun gun is contemplating if he wants to take a squrit of flea and tick spray. to the eyes. I shout at him \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you get the fuck out of here!\u201d the guy kicked in the face managed to sit upright and got a glimpse of himelf in the mirror. and say \u201cfucki! son of a bitch!\u201d as he starts feeling his bloody face. i later learned his nose was broken and had a split lip and lost a tooth. . He had enough and with stun gun guy guarding him, he managed to stand up, he and mr stun gun started to back towards the door. I cautiously followed.they reached the door and slowly backed out then suddenly slammed the door and ran like hell. For some reason chased after them. we ere in a long hallway eith an exit at the end. As I chased them I realized all I had on me was the squirt bottle. As a last ditch effort Iwas going to throw it at them and hopefully nail one of them bbefore they could get through the exit. SO I wind up, and get ready to throw it and as Ibegin to throw the strip of carpet mat starts to bunch up and tangle up with my flip flops. bottle goes flying off target and my flip flop strap breaks and they get away. the funny part is that there was a camera that monitors the exit and I got to see myself chases these guys and biff it. Even funnier, It made the local news as one of the end stories. it said something like two would be robbers were l targeting casino players in hopes of robbing them of their cash, but.. 32year old <name witheld> and 29 year old <name witheld> were in for quite a shock when it turned out theit target was a black belt judo master who managed to turn the tab on the would be robbers, severely beating one robber forcing both men to flee empty handed. \u201c eventually, both were caught and plead no contest to conspiracy, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon with great bodily injury and kidnapping. , mr stun gun had a prior and got 12 years . the other receive 7 years or something like that so is judo practical in a fight? Mores o if you wear shoes. ",
