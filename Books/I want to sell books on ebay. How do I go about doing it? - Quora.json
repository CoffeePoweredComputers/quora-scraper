            "answer_text": "In general, I think that the shipping costs for individual books from India to the US would likely eat up a good chunk of any possible profits you could make. In addition, you would not be able to take advantage of lower shipping rates offered for domestic shipment like USPS Media Mail. Plus, there's all the delays and costs associated with international shipping through Customs checkpoints. There are services on eBay India (like Global EasyBuy) to purchase products from the USA and have them delivered to India but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to ship in the opposite direction.  eBay India does offer information on shipping from India to international locations: Shipping Internationally. eBay India's partner for this service is CBT Shipment Service (web page: eBay.in: Powership) There's a calculator on this webpage to help you determine your costs. In a market space where you're competing with the likes of Amazon, the books you're offering would need to be special in some way to justify your higher shipping costs. Perhaps they're collectibles, long out of print, or in topic areas not covered by most book sellers. One other possible solution is to take advantage of the shipping volume that a drop shipper will have who moves a lot of items from India to the USA. I'd Google for the names of some Indian drop shipping firms and see what kind of pricing and terms you could negotiate. Best wishes! ",
