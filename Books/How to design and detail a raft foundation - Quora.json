            "answer_text": "Let's start with designing a raft foundation. There are two main checks to carry out and they are stability and structural. Let's start with stability. The three main modes of failure due to stability are, OverturningSliding BearingOverturning can occur when the overturning moments about the corner of the raft foundation are greater than the restoring moments acting due to the raft foundation and the structure. The overturning moments are usually due to lateral forces acting through the ground and restoring moments are usually due to the self weight of the raft and dead load acting on top of it. Sliding can occur when the lateral forces acting on the raft are greater than the forces resisting it. Sliding is usually due to lateral forces acting through the ground and are resisted by the friction between the raft and the ground below. A shear key can also be used, which mobilises passive earth pressures to resist sliding. Bearing can occur when the bearing pressure beneath the raft is too great for the ground to resist. You would need to calculate the maximum downwards pressure due to the vertical forces acting down on the raft and any moments as well and compare this against the maximum allowable bearing pressure of the ground beneath the raft. There are two main structural checks to consider are, BendingShearYou would have to calculate the maximum bending, usually sagging at mid span and hogging at supports and the maximum shear, which is likely to be adjacent to the supports. These values will be decided by the use of the structure, its size the design standards that you are working to, amongst other things. Another consideration is which way is the raft spanning, what are the relative dimensions in plan. It is possible that the raft will have to be designed in both lateral and longitudinal directions. It should be noted that structures are rarely ever the same and much care and attention should be given to each of their individual characteristics and situation. Once you have these load effects you will have to determine the thickness of the raft and the size and spacing of steel reinforcement, along the concrete strength and overall specification of the reinforced concrete. This leads us nicely on to the detailing. You would have to carry out a number of other checks, such as determining lap lengths, anchorage lengths, crack widths for flexure and early thermal cracking. These checks will be to a degree governed by the which country's design standards you are working to, but this answer should provide a really good stand point.   ",

            "answer_text": "Design of a raft or mat foundation is based on the site specific soil conditions and must; ensuring sufficient load capacity (aka bearing capacity), andensuring long term performance (aka settlement).These design criteria can be found in foundation design text books.  With a mat foundation, the controlling design variable is differential settlement, that is settlement across the mat, usually measured from the center to the corner. Detailing of a raft or mat foundation follows standard steel reinforced concrete guidelines.  A good reference for that is the CRSE design handbook  Technical Publications. ",
