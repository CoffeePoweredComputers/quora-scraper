            "answer_text": "You ask, \u201cHow similar or opposite are you to your siblings?\u201d I have three brothers. Being that I\u2019m a woman, naturally I have many things about me which are different than my brothers. I still believe that men and women are different in many ways. However, I share many similarities with my youngest brother\u2014my parents\u2019 bonus baby\u2014who is 18 years younger than I am. He is 55, and I\u2019m 73. He and I are both basically introverts and can be quiet and reserved in groups where we are not well acquainted with the people or the people are talking about things which don\u2019t resonate with us. He isn\u2019t comfortable with typical man talk, and I\u2019m not comfortable with typical woman talk. He has no interest in spectator sports\u2014very unusual for the male gender. He has mentioned how boring and uncomfortable it is when guys start talking about sports. He has no interest in talking about cars, either\u2014another popular topic with men. I\u2019ve become bored when women talk about clothes, jewelry, and shoes. He and I can both be almost like extroverts when we\u2019re comfortable with people, and each of us can be the life of the party at wakes/funerals. My mom\u2019s wake lasted for nine hours, and the time sped by for us both. We enjoy connecting with relatives we haven\u2019t seen in a while. We call my brother the family ambassador because he has worked on our family tree and connected with distant relatives from all over the world. We have both had success speaking before groups even though I went through much of my life with terrible stage fright due to a tremor which developed when I was 14. But when I was 62 I spoke at my husband\u2019s memorial service, and ever since then I\u2019ve enjoyed doing readings and eulogies. My brother has a special talent for speaking, and he is very humorous. He used to do impressions for the class when he was in elementary school. He had Archie and Edith Bunker down perfectly. He has had his coworkers exploding in laughter. We love it when we find out that we have something else in common. In general, we can be a bit reclusive in public\u2014we prefer not to have overly friendly waiters or waitresses or sales clerks. My mother used to say that he and I both inherited my father\u2019s bad temper. Mine has settled down now that I\u2019m a widow with an empty nest, and my hormones have said goodbye for the most part. He can still lose it, no doubt about it. Neither of us are very much like our other two brothers. I told the brother who is two years younger than me that I felt that bonus baby brother and I were the most alike of all the siblings. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true.\u201d We didn\u2019t get into a debate about it, but knowing this brother, he was probably thinking about it in a very literal sense, since both he and bonus baby brother were/are accountants. But occupation is only one aspect of a person. This brother reminds me a little of my father who was a businessman for many years, and his conversation could be very dry. The brother who is 4 l/2 years younger than I is more fun to be with for the most part. He can keep things rolling at a get-together. He used to love his alcohol. He isn\u2019t as lively when he\u2019s sober, but I\u2019m glad that he has slowed down in his old age for his health\u2019s sake. He inherited my mom\u2019s tendencies to be outspoken, critical, and frugal. So he and I have butted heads at times. He and the accountant with the dry conversational topics live about 15 minutes away from one another but don\u2019t visit. They ran into one another at the gas station a couple of years ago, and my younger brother had to introduce himself! Bonus baby brother and I are the siblings who have been able to stay on the phone for two or three hours with no problem at all. Our close bond was helpful after the death of my youngest brother\u2019s wife. I stayed with him for a few days. He cried. I prayed. We talked. Believe it or not, we both laughed. A memorable experience. ",

            "answer_text": "I only have one sibling. I have a brother who is 21 months younger than me. When we were young, he was a pest - he knew how to get under my skin and he enjoyed doing it frequently! I was not like that. He was more athletic than I was and while we both had a lot of friends, he was more outgoing and I was more shy. My brother would get into trouble when we were kids, but I didn\u2019t. At times, he gave my parents a run for their money but I was well behaved. My brother was never disrespectful towards my parents and neither was I. We didn\u2019t have an obviously close relationship growing up, but when push came to shove, my brother protected me and came to my rescue when we were teenagers. Now that we are adults, I know that if I need my brother for anything, I can go to him and he knows that I would be there for him as well. As for our similarities, we both have a good sense of humour and we come by it honestly. My father was always trying to make people laugh with his outrageous sense of humour, while my mother displayed more serious, deadpan humor. She actually became even funnier in the last few years of her life when my father was no longer alive. My brother and I are both responsible adults who value family. We are both strong-willed and we have many opinions about a lot of things! We have our differences, as well as similarities. We are our own people. ",
