            "answer_text": "A Fast Company (provided below) article gives the answer to this question at length, and also covers other best seller types (Amazon.com, for example). The most important bit regarding the NYT best seller list: \u201cNo one knows exactly how this is compiled, but large publishers know certain things about getting onto the list, and that\u2019s why you find many of the large publishers\u2019 books on there. It is a well-known fact among publishers that the New York Times gets its book sales data from a scattered few bookstores [\u2026] and it doesn\u2019t take into account the actual sales of the books (which Amazon does in order to rank), but how many books were shipped to these particular sampling of stores in anticipation of sales.\u201d \u201c[In 2011] the New York Times began counting online sales along with books that are in brick-and-mortar. According to certain publishers and industry insiders, it takes about 20,000 books ordered during a week at these select bookstores to have a chance at the New York Times bestseller list. Savvy publishers, usually the top ones, know which bookstores. The rest of us have to guess.\u201d Read further here: What Being A \"Bestselling Author\" Really Means ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it takes a boatload of books to be sold. As far as print sales, it also takes publisher support. It really helps to have a strict on sale date to make the list. That is something that only comes with a publisher backing you. (And it means your books cannot be shelved early.) Publishers have a pretty good idea which outlets you should be sold in as well. e.g. the stores that are counted in the NYT tally. You need their help with that, too. So, yes, high sales (10,000 is fairly accurate for the top of the list, half that for the bottom) AND it is critical for the publisher to give you a push. A good friend of mine just made the list for the first time and she has been toiling at this as long as I have. Gives me hope. :) ",
