            "answer_text": "Easy answer- Several. Robert Lynn Asprin is one I have read everything I could find of his, ALL 4 of his series. The MYTH series, the Bug Wars, Thieves World, and the PHULE series. I have also read as many of the Lee Child books as I can get. (There are 26 that I know of with his latest just being released prior to Christmas 2019. I\u2019ve read all but the last one. Three have been made into movies with his main character Jack Reacher) Hard answer- I have read so many wonderful authors like D.C. Fontana, Arthur C. Clarke, William Shakespeare, William Shatner, Ben Bova, Keith DeCandido (I know him personally), Dayton Ward (Also a personal friend), Isaac Asimov, Peter David (The ENTIRE New Generations series. All 10 books), David Mack, and so many others that I can barely remember them all. I try when I find an author I like to acquire as many of their works as possible to immerse myself in their worlds. To that end, I have probably read an entire wing of a library by most standards. I do recall a few years back when I had an entire summer off, I read 80 books in 120 days Mostly Trek-related stuff, but some weird and wonderful ones as well. Now there are some authors that no matter how hard I try, I couldn\u2019t get ALL of their works as some have written several hundred books. Stephen King(83), James Patterson(147), Harlan Coban(31). I was just in the local used bookstore today, and Patterson has over 147 or more books that have him listed as the author, although I have my doubts that anyone is that prolific but he has a total of 10 or more main characters with numerous series of books on each one, so who am I to judge that? The store went from having a rolling cart with his works on it to an entire wall section of just HIS works and they get more in every day. The manager told me that they have dozens of people come in every week and look at them trying to find a particular character\u2019s series book they lack to complete their own collections. So as to the question, have I read an author\u2019s entire works. Like I said above SOME yes I have. As for others, there\u2019s NO way can I get that many copies of their works and find the time to read all of them either. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Douglas Adams. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and more, including his last book that he wrote while dying of cancer called \u201cThe Long Dark Teatime of the Soul. Good Stuff\u2026 Also I have read almost all of John Grishams works. Alot of these are lawyer stories that have been turned into movies, but as with all stories, the books are so much better. Also Kurt Vonnegut, I have read almost all of his books too. He is my favorite author of all of the beatnik writers, because he is a straight, American, Christian man. Some of his ideas are a bit anti American, but he just calls on some of the things Uncle Sam has done that we never learned about in history class. Just one example would be the bombing of Dresden, Germany. The firestorm attack by American and British forces, claimed the lives of at least 25,000 innocent German civilians. This is but one of the many facts that he asserts that should bring shame on America. He also talks of the 2nd atom bomb dropped on Japan as being an example of how the USA overdose things. But in fairness to our Great Country, Japan did not surrender after the Hiroshima bombing and we were going to have to make a land invasion, that would have possibly cost us thousands of American soldiers lives, so we had to drop another one on Japan, to facilitate an inevitable surrender to the US forces. Patricia Corwell is another author that I have read most, if not all of her work. Through the character of Kay Scarpetti, she used her knowledge of the Forensic Coroner, that she used to be, to tell a varied sort of interesting stories that bring about alot of pages being turned. And last but not least, Pat Conroy. His books have also been made into many movies, such as the Great Santini, The Prince of Tides, Lord's of Discipline and a few others. His perspective of a deep thinking Southern Man has been appreciated and shared by me, throughout the Time I read most of his books. And there is one last one, and that is the Bible. I believe it to be the Complete, Holy, Collection of the most well known Author of all Time. And that is God Almighty. Some say that History is His-Story and I agree. It is the story of Our all loving Father God, who is in Heaven. Thank you for your time and consideration in reading this answer. ",

I\u2019m one novel and one novella away from reading everything the late Henning Mankell wrote - something I only realised thinking about the answer for this question. I\u2019ve read everything Agatha Christie wrote under her own name. Never touched the Westmacott novels, since they aren\u2019t mysteries, so I suppose it depends whether you count those. ",

Will still read anything coming from Pynchon and McCarthy but Stephenson has been a little disappointing lately so will peruse reviews before sending sheckles his way. Kryptonomicon is one of the best works of fiction I have ever lived through and know it's hard to follow greatness (see Stephen King) but even with this in mind Stephenson's last couple of works have been very uneven.
