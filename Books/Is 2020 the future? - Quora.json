If you\u2019re reading it now as I\u2019m writing it, it\u2019s November 27, 2019, so it\u2019s the future. In 40 days it\u2019ll be sometime in January 2020 (I\u2019m too lazy to count) so 2020 will be a current reality. Assuming we get there, that is - maybe time will stop and start to rewind on December 31, 2019. Or maybe that\u2019s already happening and we\u2019re all living with the reversal of time\u2019s arrow. It\u2019s hard to tell\u2026 ",
