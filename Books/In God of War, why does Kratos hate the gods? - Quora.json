            "answer_text": "He doesn't \u201chate\" the gods per se, he hated Ares and Zeus:   The rest he simply disliked it. Remember, after killing his family, Kratos desired to redeem himself and served the Gods for ten years, completing labor after labor. The last one was Ares, and the Gods promised that he'd be freed from the burden of his sins if he killed Ares, and that he did, becoming the first mortal who ever defeated a God in combat:  However, the Gods didn't really removed his nightmares as he thought it would happen, they just forgave him and the nightmares still kept going, pushing Kratos into the edge, and creating on him a certain level of distrust for the Gods. After the death of Callisto and Deimos:   He lost his faith in the Gods for good and said to Athena that he'd seek retribution, he'd seek revenge. However, that revenge wasn't by attacking the Gods, but by defying them, by attacking their ego. So he broke the rules of Zeus and got personally involved in mortal affairs, affairs that only happened because of him, since the Spartans attacked Rhodes on his orders:  That was Kratos's first attack on the Gods, he wanted to attack their personal image, he declared war against their ego. Zeus however, tricked him, took a portion of his powers and gave to the Colossus of Rhodes, making Kratos smaller and giving life to the statue:  Then he tricked Kratos again by making him put the rest of his powers onto the Blade of Olympus:  Then the Colossus fell on Kratos after he lost his powers since he got cocky and didn't bothered to be cautious:   (The God of arrogance\u2026.He\u2019s allowed to be arrogant though, he's a badass) Then Zeus revealed himself and killed Kratos while he was weakened:  Then Kratos got resurrected by Gaia:  And then he declared war against Zeus, not all Gods. Kratos's problem, his objective from GOW II to GOW III was Zeus, he hated ONLY Zeus:  But he knew that the other Gods wouldn't simply allow him to just kill their king, he knew that a war was necessary, that's more or less what he said after accidentally killing Athena, remember the scene?  He said and I quote: \u201cIf all of Olympus will deny me my vengeance, then all on Olympus will die, I've lived in the shadow of the Gods for long enough, the time of the Gods has come to an end\" Although the quote can give the impression that he hated all Gods, he didn't, he meant that if all of the Gods will deny him of Zeus's death, then all of the gods will die along with him, he wanted to kill Zeus and end his reign, he'd kill the other Gods only if they opposed him. And they did, all of the big guns decided to protect Zeus from Kratos:  If I had to guess, I'd say that Kratos would only kill the Big three: Hades, Poseidon and Zeus, the first two because it was necessary so he could reach the last one. He initially ignored Hermes:  But Hermes started to make bad jokes about Kratos's dead family, Kratos lost his patience. He heard Helios's pleas and probably even considered sparing him:  But when Helios started to badmouth Hephaestus and showing his true colors, Kratos realized it was better to just kill him:  He didn't wanted to fight Hercules:  But Hercules kept saying that Kratos was feared and respected by the other Gods, that Kratos received most of the glory while he just got the bad labours, that he deserved the title of God of War and not Kratos, so he attacked Kratos first and Kratos had no choice but fight back. Kratos initially ignored Hera:  But she started to badmouth Pandora, he lost his mind and broke her neck with his bare hands. Initially, he hated only Zeus and had a problem with the Olympians, but later this changed because he later developed a distrust for the Titans as well, all because of Gaia:  Because of Gaia, Kratos lost his trust over any deity, that's why in the new game, he didn't trusted Freya after he realized she was a Goddess:  He didn't hated Freya, but he didn't trusted her. He didn't hated the Gods, he actually spared many gods, he never chased Artemis:  Or Aphrodite:  Or even Morpheus, one of the main villains of Chains of Olympus. In fact, Kratos probably never saw Morpheus:  (Fanart. If Kratos never saw him, then we didn\u2019t either) He never went after any of those three, he didn't harbored any hatred for them. He disliked the other Gods since they never truly helped him, he was angry at them to some degree, but he didn't hated them like he hated Zeus, they were merely insects buzzing on his ear while he was trying to complete his objective, if he deemed necessary to kill them, he would without hesitation. It's classic warrior mentality, pick the fights you deem worthy, and never let anything or anyone stop you from reaching your main goal. He is a Spartan warrior after all: (God of War(2010)issue#1)   A Spartan soldier never quits, and never lets his back hit the ground, he does whatever is necessary to win. ",

            "answer_text": "isn't it obvious? Before the first game, Kratos was a servant to the God of war Ares. Ares, to make Kratos invulnerable, tricked him into killing his wife and daughter.  A while later, Ares declared war on Olympus by attacking his sister's city, Athens. So Kratos was tasked by the gods of Olympus to kill Ares, and in exchange they'll end the nightmares of his deeds.  After killing Ares, it was revealed that the gods were intending to \u201cForgive\u201d his past deeds, but no one will ever forget what he's done. Kratos committed suicide but was saved by Athena and then crowned as the new God of war. Kratos, because of his hatred to the gods for they have done, declares war on the gods. While destroying the city of Rhodes, Zeus tricks Kratos into draining his Godly powers into a sword \u201cBlade of Olympus\u201d and use it to strike down his enemies. Zeus intervenes in Kratos' moment of weakness and kills him with The Blade of Olympus  It's here when he earned his eternal hatred for the gods. Eventually he will bring down the whole greek pantheon and kill himself.  ",
