            "answer_text": "I may know some common knowledge about my country but not as well informed to be qualified as \u201cknow so much\u201d. However, I have some advantages in my heritage (debatable) and my mother tongue which help tremendously in reading Vietnamese history books and obviously listening to Vietnamese folklores from childhood. With this basic understanding, or guideline, I endeavour to read more history books from other sources while trying to keep as neutral a viewpoint as I can. Also, in personal opinion, it helps to divide the subject into many smaller periods then read about the ones I am most interested in. As history is a continuous process infused with intertwined events, which operate under the rules of causes and effects, naturally, there are certain points in these periods which demand my inquiry further into previous timelines or to their effects in the successive events. For foreigners who are interested in Vietnam\u2019s history, I believe there are incredible books in English or French which summarise the whole subject. They should be sufficient to prepare you with enough knowledge about my country. For further researches, I recommend a good command of either Vietnamese, French, or traditional Chinese (ancient official records were written in this form). P/s: Unfortunately, Vietnam\u2019s history research still relies much on Chinese sources (Chinese imperial records, memoirs, etc) as most of our ancient historical records were lost (pillaged, burnt\u2026) in the Ming\u2019s Occupation during the 14th century. Our historians are trying to piece together many events prior to this period so \u201cnew history\u201d is presented as they progress. ",

            "answer_text": "It all began in 1954. I was in the fourth grade of a parochial school being taught by nuns of the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth (SCN). Though it was the time of the \u201cGreat Division\u201d, Viet Nam was still called Indochina, of \u201cFrench Indochina\u201d. The nuns taught us about the Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres and we collected money for the \u201cCatholic Students Mission Crusade (CSMC). I later found out that much of what we learned about Indochina was propaganda with lots of holes. There was an unforgettable episode of \u201cPlayhouse 90\u201d concerning the fall of Dien Bien Phu. Fast forward to 1968. I was near the end of my required two-year active duty period in the Naval Reserve. LIke everyone else, the war was served for dinner. I thought I was \u201chome free\u201d because the standard tour of duty was 13 months. Then Nixon called up the Reserves as part of his \u201cVietnamization\u201d of the war. I spent five weeks in Field Medical Service School (FMSS) at the Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Depot. Among other things they serve up a heaping portion of why we were there in Viet Nam propaganda. There was no need to proselytize me. I had decided that I wanted to go as a Naval Hospitalman in spite of being warned that I would wind up with the Marines. Wrong Answer! I wound up with a reactivated Naval Mobile Construction Battalion \u2014 Sea Bees \u2014 for eight of the nine months I was obliged to remain in the Sea Service. I got a first-hand look at what the war was about when I volunteered for duty in the Medical Civic Action Program (MedCAP) based out of Da Nang. The French used to call it \u201cCap Tourane.\u201d I learned how to define Viet Nam: Abject poverty intensified by unbearable misery. Hit the fast forward again. I nearly deserted when Martin Luther King, Jr. was killed. The bitterness was worsened by the murder of Robert F. Kennedy in the same year. To make matters worse, we listened to \u201cHanoi Hanna\u201d berating us about how the war was not ours to fight. It wasn\u2019t, but I came to feel that I wasn\u2019t there fighting for my country though I was trained to do so. After seeing so many people walking to one of my roadside clinics operated by the Sisters, I began to feel that it was the Vietnamese people I was there for. They needed me and respected me for being there. Don\u2019t ask me how I know. I just knew. The Americans back home didn\u2019t give a fat rat\u2019s derriere. I came home to an empty airport and watched \u201cBorn On The Fourth of July\u201d. Something was missing. A hell of a lot was missing. I decided to find out the truth as best I could. Who was Ho Chi Minh? Is that his real name? What is the history I had not been told? It got really interesting when I read that the U.S.S. Constitution \u2014 \u201cOld Ironsides\u201d \u2014had been sent to Saigon to rescue a Catholic archbishop who was about to be skewered by the Buddhists he had angered. The French could not get to his aid fast enough so they sent us. That was way back before WWI. So my oldest Amerasian daughter \u2014 I have three \u2014 introduced me to her Vietnamese lady friend. We hit it off quickly though she, like my number two daughter, couldn\u2019t stop laughing at my broken Vietnamese speech. This lady was born in Da Nang. She had been part of the ARVN service and she was a veritable history lesson. It was she who took me back to the days of Emperor Minh Mang, the Nguyen -Tay Brothers Revolt, and the storied Trung Sisters, the \u201cHai Ba Trung\u201d. She told me how the French had invaded her country \u2014 twice, the second time with allied help! And she introduced me to my present wife. \u201cAnd now you know the rest of the story\u201d. Good day! ",
