            "answer_text": "Dale Carnegie started his book by telling us bits and pieces about the two most notorious criminals (Murderer)\u2014 Two gun Crowley and Al Capone. They did terribly wrong and yet Criticism nor condemnation didn\u2019t work against them. Instead, they\u2019re saying that it was them who were wronged. So basically, if criticism, condemnation, nor complain doesn\u2019t work on those who truly deserve condemnation, how much more will this affect us? I think the main point here is that every time you 3C other people, they\u2019ll end up hating a bit of you 99% of the time. Well, They MIGHT change their behavior but you\u2019re less likable to them. So I think it\u2019s okay if you 3C on wrong behaviors as long as you don\u2019t do it every time or else they\u2019ll actually end up hating you. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t read the book, but I\u2019d like to offer some insight. One of my primary rules that I try to live my life by is to always concentrate on the situation and not on the individual. Behaviors can be altered, and in doing so, we are helping people to have a better chance at success. It\u2019s not an easy concept to remember, and in applying it, we have to remember to always forgive but never forget. I have run across some folks over the years who just weren\u2019t a good fit for the teams that I was a part of. I\u2019ve tried to help folks develop their skills so that they fit in better, but there comes a time when a person realizes that it is for the good of the team as well as that individual to cut ties. It\u2019s not an easy decision to make, but it is the mentality that I use. If I can\u2019t help someone be successful as part of the team, then I\u2019m going to help that person be successful somewhere else. ",
