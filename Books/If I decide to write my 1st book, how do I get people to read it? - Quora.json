            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve done the impossible. You finished your book, and if you want people to read it, you need to do two things right away: put it in a drawer and write your second book. Let some time go by. Then take your book out a few weeks after you put it away and give it a thorough read-through. You\u2019ll see all kinds of flaws, because you\u2019ve been away from that work a long while and you\u2019ll go \u201cOMG! This is drek! \u201c You sit down and revise. You do it again. And again. You lopped off that improbable plot twist, toned down some elements, tightened up your wordage, perhaps made a secondary character go away, and straightened out your ending. Nobody ever said writing a book was easy. The first draft is the easy part. Once you have revised more than you can stand, you do some more writing: query letters. These are an art in themselves. There are books and articles on how to write them. Publications like Writer\u2019s Digest have lots of tips. Subscribe. Study the book publishing companies well, find out who might be the best fit for your book. Yes, I know there are self-publishing firms out there, and you might want to try one. But do it later rather than sooner. (They used to be called \u201cvanity\u201d presses.) You want to make money, not spend it. A very few writers (Hugh Howley) have actually been self-published then got their books published by a well-known company, but that happens rarely. You\u2019ll eventually need an agent. They are the bridge between publisher and you. On occasion a book gets bought \u201cover the transom,\u201d but usually not (unless you\u2019re watching The Ghost and Mrs. Muir). There are agent lists in Publisher\u2019s Weekly, and likely online. You might ask other writers (pros). If you attend conventions, writer guests of honor will show up, esp. if you write science fiction or fantasy. Do not ask them to read your MS. An agent is essential; they earn the ten percent (or going market rate) you\u2019ll give them. They promote your book, know best how and where to send the manuscript, and will develop a relationship with you. Listen to their advice. If they\u2019re more than usually greedy, run. Have your contract looked at by a good lawyer, though any reputable agent will simply offer the standard contract. I hope this is helpful This does not guarantee publication, but recognize that getting published is the business part of writing. Selling a manuscrip is not easy, but it can be done, if you are persistent. ",

            "answer_text": "The right cover attracts attention. The right blurb entices the reader into the sample. The first 10% of the book sucks the reader in, holds their attention, and makes them want to know what happens next when it ends in mid sentence. The right ad, placed at the right time, gets some visibility for the cover to do its job. Fail on any step, and the book will not be read. Covers must demonstrate the genre, be readable as a thumbnail, and convey a sense of what\u2019s to come. Blurbs should entice, without giving away plot or going into history. The book itself should be well edited, well proofread, and be crafted to be smoothly read. It should not have things in the first 10% which make a reader go \u2018wtf?\u2019, and bounce them out. ",
