            "answer_text": "One day in early 2016, I was searching for anything cool in an antique store. They had a back room that was really messy and probably dangerous from all of the dust. I headed in and saw a box of books towards the back. They looked like they hadn\u2019t been touched in 30 years. I only had 12 dollars on me, so I got 4 books. The oldest of them was from 1821, the newest from 1906. You can never know where you\u2019ll find some vintage books, so you have to just start looking. Good luck. ",
