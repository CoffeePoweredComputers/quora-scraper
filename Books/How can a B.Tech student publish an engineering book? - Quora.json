            "answer_text": "Hi there, Disclaimer First: I am one of the founders @ Notion Press Publishing. If you have already written your book, you have a few options. 1. You could approach a traditional publisher and submit your manuscript for a review. However, traditional publishers get bombarded with hundreds of manuscripts and take a long time to even go through them ( if at all they do ). More often than not, they also reject first time authors such as yourself due to a perceived risk of publishing an unknown name. 2. You could subsequently approach any self-publishing platform similar to Notion Press and work with a team of book experts who will take care of the entire publishing process and bring both the print and eBook version of your book out to the market. In this guided publishing model, you will own 100% of the rights to the book and take home 100% of the profits from book sales. To know more about how this works you can check out the website link given above. 3. Your third option would be to publish it by yourself by using platforms liike KDP or Createspace. These are essentially do-it-yourself platfoms which would essentially require you to take care of every aspect of publishing ie. cover design, interior formatting, editing etc by yourself. Once you havee all these things in place, you can just upload it onto the platform and they will compile it as a book and you can start selling it on online stores. Such platforms are mostly free to use and take a comission from each book sale and pay out a percentage of the profits in terms of royalty. ",
