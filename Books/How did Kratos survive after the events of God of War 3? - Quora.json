            "answer_text": "It is really interesting to see Kratos back in Norse mythology even though he impaled himself in GOW 3 at the end. But think of it in this way, he killed both Thanatos and Hades, the two gods who used to control underworld and death. So without them, there is actually no one to take the soul of Kratos to underworld. So basically he can not be killed. Now the question comes why other Gods are not alive then. Well there is no reference to a God\u2019s soul being taken back to underworld. So I assume they simply goes to the spirit world. Kind of like Norse mythology, where cowards, criminals and people who die of old age or disease go to Helheim, while warriors who died gloriously in battle go to Valhalla. And gods venture as spirits or are reborn as higher existence, like Athena. Plus underworld was created by the Greek gods, for the mortal spirits, duh!! A good thing to notice is that when the gods were killed in the game series, such as Hermes or Poseidon, some sort of plague or natural disaster appeared on the world. This signifies that the gods were embodiment of these chaos, released after their death. Now for Kratos, he is a banished god. We saw him all healed up by himself after getting beaten by Baldur during first encounter. I am guessing this can be either he holds some sort of self healing power back when Gaia healed him in GOW 2 or he learned this from his second wife Faye. Anyways, he butchered some really big names in Greek mythology and continues to do that in up north. So I won\u2019t be surprised if he got this self healing power somehow on his journey. Its a game made by people, so there will be loose ends. Also in order to tweak the mythology to turn it into an award winning game series, they had to keep some secrets. ",

            "answer_text": "Well to put it simply,in releasing hope to the world,Kratos reasorbed his God of War power, hence why Kratos does not have a second scar, also Kratos asorbed Hades soul,which allowed him to use the Hyperion gates, so Kratos is not a Demi God but a full God at this point in Killing Zeus (Think of Essence transfer). If you played the New God of War Kratos is able to vibrate the Injuries away which Baldur was doing who is Impervious to damage,a mortal cannot kill a God. Even Mimir and Freya stated they know he is a God not a Demi God half mortal/ God. Kratos is not really any older than he was in God of War 3 even though a millenia has passed. He is just wary and he is still haunted. He discarded all his weapons and picked up the blades of Chaos and fled Greece for a new land which must have taken forever. Where is Icarus wings or the Golden Fleece, the Nemean Cestus,Hades Claws,the Nemisis whip. They still exist and I would love for him to reacquire them. I was dissatisfied with this lastest installment with the axe. It did not feel like a God Of War game. Even Tyr had a ancient jug with Kratos who was abhorrent and horrified at his past. It reminded hik of who he is. Atreus has Jotun with God blood yet try to say he is mortal when Kratos is a full blown 100 diety aka God. There are tons of hints that Kratos is 100 percent God. ",
