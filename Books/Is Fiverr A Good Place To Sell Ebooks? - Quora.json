            "answer_text": "Fiverr is a good place to sell anything, but consider this: Fiverr is a great place to sell your ebooks if you have some plr books you want to sell, you can get an idea from what others are selling there.A betterplace to publish and sell books is the Amazon Kindle platform, although you cant sell plr books there, what you upload must be original works , else you will get your account suspended.It is very easy to publish a book with Kindle.There are millions of readers on file with Amazon Kindle eager to buy the latest books.Take a look on Google Trends and see what is starting to become popular, then write a short ebook about this niche.Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "While I haven\u2019t tried to sell an e-book on Fiverr (yet), I\u2019m inspired by others who have had success in doing so. Fiverr seems to think it\u2019s a great idea, considering how much effort they\u2019ve put into the new Book and eBook Writing category. From the perspective of a seller, it has to be one of the better fulfillment categories (Create-Once-Sell-Forever), since your hourly rate approaches infinity. It would reach infinity if Fiverr ever allowed us to automate the delivery! (Apparently, I\u2019m not allowed to link to Fiverr, anymore. Look under the Writing and Translation category. You\u2019ll find Book & eBook Writing about 3/4 the way down on the left.) ",
