            "answer_text": "ERP implementation has different phases and one of the implementation methodology used for implementing Microsoft dynamics suite is one or the other modified version of methodology caller Sure Step Methodology.  Name of the each phases is self explanatory and I can go into much more details about the each phases and books have been return about various methodology but I would suggest you to read about them, google them.. Each phase of not done correctly in planned manner with objectives, exit criteria, approval criteria, proper documentation etc can become the hardest phase. When a person is a consultant they think diagnostic and requirement gathering is the hardest phase, because business/customer needs to make sure they know what they want and that they get business involved and not just IT people as this is where most project fails as ERP implementation becomes an IT project and not a project where whole company should be involved and made responsible for success implementation of ERP. But IMHO I think operation/post go live phase is the hardest phase, Why? Usually by the time you are live few months or years have passed and now there are completely different people who will use the product and the people who approved the design are not there.The need of business and process has evolved but nobody bothered to inform IT about it and now some of the things are obsoleteThere is constant changes/modifications/improvements in the system but you have to support the live system too so you are in constant project and operations mode.Most of the consultancy have no idea about operation mode, they do provide support for various company, even inuse to be part of a support team for an already implementations product, but now when I sit on the other side of the table, I now understand how it all works.Business is never happy with the product that\u2019s live and always compare it to a product which they used previously in their older jobs and they forget all the \u2018issues\u2019 with older product and they often compare a newly implemented product to a product which was improved and made to fit need of business for over a decade.I will keep adding to the list but these are some of the reasons why I think operation phase is the hardest phase in any ERP implementation.

            "answer_text": "ERP implementation project is a mix of PeopleBusiness ProcessSoftwareCultureInformationConsultantsTechnologyThat\u2019s why ERP Project is very large in scope with a lot of risks & variables. It involves all departments and all people; You will have to deal with a lot of issues and make a lot of critical decisions. It is not just a simple IT project. It requires big changes and takes longer time than expected if not properly managed. The hardest part The hardest part is not Technology, not Business Process, but the People! The \u201cPeople\u201d side is always difficult to manage. In many cases, management fail to define clear goals and roadmap. They cannot properly explain people what benefits to expect from ERP and why there should be changes in the process. Without clear explanation, people become confused easily. They think that they will be obsolete if ERP is implemented. Then they start creating roadblocks which leads to ERP failure. Without people\u2019s buy-in, no matter how much training you provide, the ERP projects never get success. Read some articles here to learn more practical knowledge on ERP. ",
