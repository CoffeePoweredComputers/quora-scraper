For this, I would recommend using a third-party application to trace this individual. Do take note that you need to be extra precaution as some of this application requires your login details, in other words, sensitive data. By using these applications, can help you to keep track of who follow/unfollow you, most liked picture, etc. Which will probably help you to identify the niche you should focus on when creating content. Hope the above information helps. Cheers. ",
