            "answer_text": "Friends go ahead and join, it is perfectly fine. This is where every fresher struck in their careers and ruin their life. It is the experience what you gain matters rather than a designation. It is myth that you stay as a supervisor entire your life if you started career as a supervisor. Join the company learn and gain experience. May be after one or two years start applying for jobs and you will land in an excellent job. Think in another way, how long will you depend on your parents? Your father is becoming older. Your mother wants you to be in good offices. Moreover, the world respects your career path as you reach the top positions. Everyone who works at site are supervisors. They supervise and oversee the work in terms of quality, safety and productivity. One of the role of a Manager or Engineer is to supervise her/his team members. Love your job and not the designation. Enjoy the work that makes you happy and not busy! Good Luck! Pa1 ",
