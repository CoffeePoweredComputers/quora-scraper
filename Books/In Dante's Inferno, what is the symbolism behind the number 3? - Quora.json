            "answer_text": "I cannot go into great detail here, by citing examples within Dante\u2019s work, because it has been a considerably lengthy time since I have read his work. The one thing to remember about Dante\u2019s work \u2014 it is very Christian in its symbolism and his work was the key inspiration for the church and its eventual use and description of Hell. If you do some basic historical research, you will discover that the Church\u2019s notions of Hell did not actually take shape until after Dante\u2019s work. Question is: \u201cWho inspired whom?\u201d Understanding that Dante\u2019s work is Christian Specific then you will find that the Trinity is used throughout his work \u2014 not necessarily in the full form of The Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost, but in the general construction of his work, which you might notice has a lot a trinary aspects to it, and the symbolism used. What is interesting is the idea that the Inferno is somewhat divergent from Christianity in that the point of view is that of Dante himself becoming lost and it is a Roman Pagan Poet, Virgil, who guides him into and out of Hell. During the trip he meets other pagans usually in clusters of three. Dante\u2019s main goal and concern is to go and \u201cget the hell out of Hell\u201d and strive to make it into Heaven, where the object of his life, his love Beatrice waits for him, with two other women. Here you also have the trinary symbolism. The three nature of Christian dogma is rife through much of Dante\u2019s work. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been a while since I read it, but the most obvious reference points to the Trinity, or in the case of the Inferno, a kind of anti-trinity. The Devil cannot create, only corrupt or mock. When it comes to vices and sins, three is a classical schema for the problems with certain sins: absence, excess, and corruption or perversion of a virtue. Let\u2019s take a simple virtue, like love. An absence of love is cold-heartedness or apathy. An excess (toward a finite good), would be something like lust, where one loves \u201ctoo much\u201d a creature or limited good, and a perversion or corruption would be to love something unnatural or evil, instead of God and neighbor, say love money instead of anything else. The sins in Hell point to problems in the virtues that have been turned into a vice of some kind. ",
