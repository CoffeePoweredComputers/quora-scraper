            "answer_text": "If the book you wish to put on your Kindle is in a file on your computer, because you downloaded it from the Gutenberg Project for example, then you can either connect computer and kindle via a USB lead and just drag and drop, or (my prefered method) send the book as an email attachment to the kindle\u2019s unique email address. I find this way also preserve the cover, which (for some reason I know not what) is sometimes lost in the physical connection. Your Kindle\u2019s email address can be found on your Kindle in Settings - Your account - Send-to Kindle Email. I have often sent several books at the same time to my kindle and they normally take two or three minutes to appear on the reader. ",

I plug in a USB cable and send books from Calibre software on my PC - if they aren\u2019t already in the correct format, Calibre will automagically convert them for me. You can also send them to your Amazon \u2018kindle\u2019 email, and Amazon will convert and forward them to your Kindle. ",
