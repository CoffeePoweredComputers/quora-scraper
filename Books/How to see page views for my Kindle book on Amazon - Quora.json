            "answer_text": "You used to be able to track visitors on your Amazon Kindle book pages by inserting an image with a tracking link in your book description as explained in my book The Amazon Analytics Bible. However, a few months ago Amazon disabled the use of several kinds of HTML tags in book descriptions including the ability to insert images which means there is no longer a way to track your visitors on Amazon's site. If you would like to see that data, please email KDP support and ask them to offer it. If enough authors ask, they may actually start giving us better Analytics. ",
