            "answer_text": "You publicize it. You rewrite your blurb until it starts hooking and audience. You pick a different genre. You buy some ads in Facebook or Amazon, but to be frank I found $20 in Facebook ads sold $1 in books. Try and get interviewed by your local newspaper. Find a blogger willing to interview you. See if you can get on an NPR or BBC show to plug your book. I have been considering spending $750 to run an ad in a science fiction magazine for my next sci fi book. Do understand that Geico Insurance fronted $10 million dollars way back when with an ad agency and that silly GEKKO who talks with an australian accent. Those commericals cost $250,000 to $1 million to MAKE and TEST at PREVIEW HOUSE. But Geico is now every bit as big as State Farm and Farmers. They had a good ad agency, with a good idea. We did a commercial for lawyer. It cost them $2,400 for two commercials. They bought thousands in ad time at 2 am in the morning. They got CALLS the next day from prospective clients. You look at what Peacock (that\u2019s NBC/Universal Studios) has bought a ton of Facebook ads to try and get people to pay $5 to watch their original Brave New World. It takes running ads every day all over the place. No warranty. You can try a few book reading sites on FACEBOOK it\u2019s free.

            "answer_text": "Announce that you\u2019re a world-destroying entity and will reduce Earth to its component atoms if people don't buy your book. Sorry, just couldn't resist. Seriously, remember that there are millions of books on Amazon. Figures vary as Amazon doesn't reveal the numbers, but estimates range from 50 to 100 million (unpublished books, included). Active books would be from 5 to 15 million. Again, nobody knows for certain. But if I were to go with the farthest-ranked BSR I\u2019ve come across (in the 12 millionth rank), I\u2019d go with 15 million. That\u2019s the competition. This is where advertising and marketing come in. You could use AMS, 3rd party book advertisers, social media, book launchings, and a host of other options. Only your wallet\u2019s the limit. But it\u2019s like gambling. You don't know if you\u2019d get it all back. ",
