            "answer_text": "Depends on how sun-dipped Superman is. I\u2019ll give examples on a scale of sorts for a sun-dipped Superman, and feats to go along with them. I won\u2019t give a definitive ranking of these feats, I\u2019ll just leave it at them being very impressive.  1). Barely Sun-Dipped This is a Superman after only spending a little time at/near the sun. My example will be a feat of Superman\u2019s from Superman/Batman #13, where he cracks the Source Wall:   This Superman is barely sun-amped, and arguably just base Superman. I put this as a sun-dipped Superman because he blitzed Darkseid to the sun beforehand:  Note: Superman did have a motherbox, but it\u2019s unknown how it really affected him. 2). Sun-Dipped I\u2019ll be using the Sun-Dipped Superman from Our Worlds at War, and specifically Action Comics #782. I haven\u2019t read Our Worlds at War in a while, so I\u2019m blurry on the details. I think there might\u2019ve been something with Kismet, but I just don\u2019t remember. I\u2019ll have to reread OWAW. Either way, this Superman pushed Warlord, which was powered by the Big Bang:  This scan is more debatable whether or not it happened, so I\u2019ll just say Superman possibly survived a Big Bang:   Also, one detail to note, apparently this Big Bang would be affecting 11\u201313 dimensions, so if Superman did really survive it, it could be a Multi-Universal feat:  3). Massively Sun-Dipped Incredibly famous example, as well as an obvious one, the Sun-Dipped Superman from Justice League #25. This Superman did damage to the World Forger and even destroyed his Masterpiece:     I\u2019ve seen many try to debunk the feat based on out of context author quotes (where they admit to be confused later) and whatnot, but it\u2019s pretty legit to me. Of course, Superman\u2019s power is massively amplified. He flew through multiple stars on his way to punch the Forger. It is true that Forger was off-guard, but even knocking down an off-guard Forger is an impressive feat. So, these are my sun-dipped Superman feats. I could bring up more, but 3 are enough. Whether you think Sun-Dipped Superman is a Planet Buster, Multiverse Buster or whatever, I think we can at least agree that this version of Superman is extremely powerful. ",

Superman has no maximum limit to the amount of energy he can absorb, and therefore he can sundip for as long as he needs in order to defeat his opponent. ",
