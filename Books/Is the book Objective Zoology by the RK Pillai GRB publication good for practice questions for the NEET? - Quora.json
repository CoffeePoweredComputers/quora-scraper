            "answer_text": "No. Instead, use the NCERT booster by Balaji publications. I used the one on Botany and man, it was freaking awesome. Undoubtedly the best MCQ book for botany I've ever seen. I saw the Zoology one too and that too was nice. I'd strongly recommend you to buy both these books as soon as possible. (some answers given there are wrong, but they are very very few. You'll easily notice them) And focus on the questions like - how many of the following statements are correct, etc. These books will give you the right amount of exposure needed. Buy 100+ OMR sheets and practice systematically on the sheets. Whatever extra points you find while solving them (points which are not given in NCERT), jot them down in the space provided in your NCERT book or in your notes (if you have any). And keep on revising them. 3\u20134 months before the NEET - that's when I started solving previous years problem. You can solve them anytime but don't start too early. And don't solve them chapterwise. Solve them yearwise. Refer to heavy books like Trueman or Pradeep only when you find a topic that you know nothing about/ have the curiosity to know more. Otherwise stick to NCERT. And revise as many times as possible. ps: Author of the NCERT Botany booster is S. Ansari. I forgot about the Zoology one. ",
