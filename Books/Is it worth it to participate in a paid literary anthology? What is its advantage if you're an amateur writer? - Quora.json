            "answer_text": "Three year back many publishers survived with the paid anthology. That was the era when new authors were fooled by International best sellers with two-digit unit sales. The digital printing presses have opened the door for most self-publishers and vanity publishers to create a big hoax of promising dreams. Today digital printing can print one copy of a book. So how does the anthology work? A minimum of fifteen authors are invited for contributing XYZ amount. The sweet trap is created by creating an anthology contest. The promising authors are made to believe that they have been selected by the competition and they deserved to be published. However, competition is a myth. The minimum amount equals INR 1500. This INR1500*15= INR 22500. The cover pic is selected from pixabay or pixel. DTP is arranged that hardly costs INR 3000. The total number of pages is around 200 which equals 200*35p=INR 70.00/ book Each author get 10 copy max that equals = INR 700 15 authors = 700* 15= INR 10,500 The publisher earns = INR 12,000 Quality of writing- poor than my writings.\ud83d\ude1b Compiler- Publisher himself, publisher family or publisher girlfriend or boyfriend. This is for INR 1500 contribution which is rare. The trend was of INR 3500. Which means the authors turned publishers were easily able to make a handsome profit of INR 30,000 The trend was exposed thus authors were asked to buy 25 copies of the book at 20 to 30 percent on MRP. However, these publishers were contributing to Government dreams of five trillion economies by keeping the price to the apex. So if you ever get such offers then you must consider my writeup. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt there\u2019s any advantage to it at all. Whoever is running this makes their money from wannabe authors and then they put out a book (maybe) that nobody will ever read except the \u2018authors\u2019\u2019 aunts and moms. they probably charge an arm and a leg for the book, which is probably POD. If you think there\u2019s maybe an advantage is being able to say you\u2019re now a \u2018published author,\u2019 go ahead. But it will be pretty plain that you\u2019re just a schmuck! Sorry to be so unpleasant. ",
