            "answer_text": "\u2018How would you rank the Aes Sedai Ajah in Robert Jordan's the Wheel of Time based on how likely you would be to join them?\u2019 This is not a comment on the worthiness of the Ajahs. Rather, it is how likely I would join one, based on my beliefs and personality. So here goes: At the bottom I rank the Green, Blue, and Yellow. I am a pacifist (anti green), I\u2019m lackadaisical about most causes (no blue then), and I don\u2019t have the fortitude for healing. In the middle is the Grey and the Brown. I believe in civility, diplomacy, etc which seems to be a Grey thing. And without history, we would never know where we are going, so the chances of me joining the Browns are high. Next comes the Red. Yes, Elaida, and most Reds we meet are evil, bla bla bla. But their mission was a crucial one. I like to think of the Reds as police. There are more than a few bad apples, but ultimately, they exist to keep society civil. That\u2019s something I\u2019m willing to sign up for. So I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed it by now. I am more likely to join the White. I honestly believe there are few problems that cannot be solved by logic. All of that said, I am a man. So chances are high I would be an Asha\u2019man. As an aside, I would want to be an Asha\u2019man born to the Tardad Aiel. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I think it\u2019s important to point out that all Aes Sedai would perform the duties of each Ajah to a small extent. There\u2019s no exclusivity here, a healer would also try to deal with a male channeler, before going on to give counsel to a leader. I would like to list the Ajahs, and their purposes Red - To hunt down and bring to trial all men who channel Saidin, and endanger the world Blue - To take up a cause, fight and campaign for their cause and their view of justice Green - The Battle Ajah, held ready for Tarmon Gaidon to wield the Power as a weapon Brown - Seekers of knowledge and history, keepers of ancient history which may hold lessons for mankind Grey - Mediators, diplomats, counsellors to the leaders of nations White - Followers of logic, mathematicians and scientists Yellow - Healers So, ranking The Wheel Of Time Aes Sedai Ajahs\u2026. The Red Ajah. The single biggest danger in the world was men channelling tainted Saidin. A secret clique in the Red went off the rails, but as a whole their mission was to protect mankind. Of course, once the Wheel Of Time series gets going, they have no excuse to continue and should have adapted.The Blue Ajah. Justice and equality would be central to their cause. Imagine being able to walk into almost any palace on earth and command the attention of a monarch, fighting the commoners fight.The Brown Ajah. I love me some history. Plus history can teach us so much.The Green Ajah. Yes, history can teach us so much, but sometimes it\u2019s better to weave and fight. Imagine a band of Aes Sedai surrounded by vicious Warders, better than almost any soldier alive.The Yellow Ajah. Healing is vital, but I always found them one dimensional. Apart from healing, which is an easy to understand concept, what defines them?The Grey Ajah. I don\u2019t have the patience to be a diplomat, though I admire all those who do.The White Ajah. I adore philosophy, however as someone who is dyscalculic, the maths part sucks. This is a hard pass for me.There is one Ajah not mentioned here, the Black. I would hope no one joins this out of choice. ",
