            "answer_text": "It is a difficult question. As with any field when you start you need the best source possible as there is not enough experience yet to adjust and filter information. However for that same reason one can not easily judge the quality of instruction. It would be easy if we could take it down just to videos vs teachers, but that is not the case. There are all sorts of videos and all sorts of teachers. In ideal conditions a good real-life teacher is better than a good video for a number of reasons. The most important being that he can adjust the practice for your needs, videos are not interactive. He can also watch and correct you, going to classes can provide for better motivation and so on. But than again teachers might harm even more than videos sometimes, and in ways videos can not even if bad (coming from interpersonal relations, manipulations, indoctrination, financial and sexual abuse and what not). Not being strictly regulated (there are certificates of independent bodies like the Yoga Alliance but truth be told that is of dubious value) there are little objective independent criteria to judge someone's skills as a teacher. You can only go by references, and those again depend on how experienced, honest and able to judge your sources are. Ultimately it is a it and miss thing until you get a bit more experience. Search as much as you can for info about particular teachers and videos, make the best choice you can and with time and experience such question will answer themselves.  That said if you are middle aged or older or have health issues tread lightly and possibly consult a health professional (Physiatrist etc). ",

            "answer_text": "I would personally not recommend learning Yoga at home, from a DVD, CD, Book or Internet. Even all the main scriptures on this science of Yoga recommend to only learn these practices from an experienced teacher (Guru or Acharya). Why? First of all because a DVD, CD or Book cannot correct you. You might be thinking that you are doing it correctly, but if you are not, there is nobody to tell you. On top of that, there are different Asanas (postures) and types of pranayamas (breathing techniques), some of which should not be practiced if you have certain health conditions, as they might actually aggrivate the problem.  Yoga is a vast science and it is very benefitial and has great healing potential when practiced properly, but if you experiment or do it wrongly, it can have adverse effects as well. It is therefore better to first learn from a proper teacher, and once you have learned you can of course practice it on your own, at home as well. I can personally recommend the introductory programs of the Art of Living of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, as they teach you basic practices that can easily and safely be practiced at home or anywhere else after learning. I hope this answers your question :-) ",
