            "answer_text": "Funny, I\u2019ve actually considered this before. In fact I once tried to write a HTTYD fanfic and introduce a new species of Fury. It went to shit in 3 chapters because I had no idea what I was doing. The main character of the fanfic was a girl, I can\u2019t remember her name but she got renamed Ryder after she was brainwashed. Her dragon was a Twilight Fury. It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re thinking of. A specifically bred hybrid of Light and Night. It was slate gray, because that\u2019s what I thought a hybrid of Light and Night would actually look like assuming the two\u2019s color palete genes could be co-dominant. I can\u2019t remember the Twilight Fury\u2019s name, either, but he was part of a litter of triplets. His siblings I remember very well, Hades and Persephone, because I\u2019m like that. Anyway, Ryder trained her dragon much the same as Hiccup did Toothless, albeit having a much easier time of it in some ways since Hiccup knew how to train a Fury, and much a much harder time of it in some ways due to how Twilight furies came about. The Dragons in HTTYD are intelligent and easy to train when trust is established, for the most part. So that\u2019s the hard part. ",
