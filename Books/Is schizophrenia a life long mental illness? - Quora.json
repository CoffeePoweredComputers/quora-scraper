            "answer_text": "Yes, it is. However this doesn't mean that the person's life is just ruined. Consider this: when a person is diagnosed with diabetes then he is diagnosed for life but the course of such illness can vary among many such newly diagnosed diabetics. Similarly, when a person is diagnosed with schizophrenia he is diagnosed for life. But there is a difference, many clinicians misdiagnose any psychosis as schizophrenia in a hurry and in such cases psychotic episodes may never recur. Now the course of disease is not same in all patients. It depends on various factors. Some of the important factors which point towards a poorer prognosis are as follows: Strong family history.Early age at onset i.e. in adoadolescence or earlier.Type of schizophrenia: disorganized being the worst.Poor premorbid functioning.Poor compliance to medications.Poor social support.Lack of psychiatric facilities.Factors for bettter prognisis: Factors opposite to those mentioned above.Paranoid type of schizophrenia.Married.Remember, Schizophrenia has a very strong genetic basis to it & this genetic vulnerability to psychotic episodes and this genetic predisposition is irreversible.so, even if there are many good prognosis factors, the caregivers need to be aware that compliance to medications is very important. If symptoms have subsided with medications doesn't mean that it is cured. It just gets relieved. You need to discuss it with the psychiatrist about further plan. Medications may be stopped in some cases but then care is to be taken to catch any symptom pointing towards a relapse and contact the psychiatrist at the earliest In about a third cases patients become very good with medications and are well functioning. Another third improve significantly. And there is about a third who show minimal improvement. Need multiple medications & ECTs. These patients need a support lifelong and a few of these are unfortunately put in special mental facilities meant especially for such disruptive patients. However, all that said, medicines for schizophrenia are improving day by day with better treatments than ever before with very good side effect profile. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Schizophrenia is a serious and lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may cope with symptoms throughout their lives, but treatment helps many to recover sufficiently and pursue their life goals. Researchers are using new research tools to understand the causes of schizophrenia and develop more effective treatments. ",
