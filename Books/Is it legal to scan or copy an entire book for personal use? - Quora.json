And just to be clear, uploading to a cloud servers is \u201cleaving the house\u201d. If you think \u201cpersonal use\u201d means just reading the book, that would be wrong. That\u2019s the normal use of a book (or a movie or TV show or song). That\u2019s just media consumption and you cannot make copies of media for free just so you can read or enjoy it. ",
