            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not into horror fiction, so I haven\u2019t read any of King\u2019s stuff after \u2019Salem\u2019s Lot and The Shining. But I doubt his books are scary enough to make teenagers afraid of monsters under their beds. If you meant to ask whether reading Stephen King is appropriate for a teenager because of concerns about a book\u2019s \u201cadult content\u201d (whatever that means), I\u2019d say yes. I don\u2019t see why not. I read Lolita at fourteen. Didn\u2019t care for it, to tell you the truth. When you\u2019re a boy that age you\u2019re not interested in younger girls: you dream of older women aged eighteen and nineteen. James Jones\u2019s From Here to Eternity was the first big book I read at that age. This novel had over eight hundred pages, so reading it felt like a huge accomplishment. That year I also read Tropic of Cancer and my mom\u2019s copy of Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover. From Here to Eternity was an amazing book, the others not so much. Vladimir Nabokov was too mannered and fastidious a writer for my taste, and Henry Miller and D.H. Lawrence were just flat-out bad. Parents get to decide what a teenager should or shouldn\u2019t read. In that respect at least I was lucky in the parents I had. They were mostly oblivious about their parental duties, so I had a great deal of freedom at home\u2014that is, when I was home from boarding school. My dad was a certified public accountant who loved hunting. He rarely read anything, and was a bit of a prude. Had he seen me with a copy of Madame Bovary, he would have assumed it was a book about a brothel keeper. He would have shaken his head in disappointment at the way I\u2019d turned out, but he wouldn\u2019t have tried to keep me from reading it. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh yes. There is some sex at times, but it\u2019s mild. Gore and horror is what Mr King is all about. And the stories are great, for the most part. And there is nothing in them that requires you to be an adult. You just need a good grasp of the english language and reading skills. If you can find it, read Head Down. It\u2019s not fiction. King built a baseball field for little league. He is intensely into baseball and he has a team which apparently went to states, and possibly further. He wrote about the season leading to states and I personally think it was the most powerful thing he ever wrote. His love of baseball and for the kids is very clear. ",
