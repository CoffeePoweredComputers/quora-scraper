            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t think of reading as a choreIt kills me that kids now think reading is purely to improve your vocabulary and get your answers for the next assignment. Contrary to that, I personally believe that if you start to read for enjoyment purposes, the improvement in English will come sooner or later. Slowly, the passion will drive you on to keep reading and from there on, the vocabulary will just stick with you and so will the sentence structures and styles of the text. Don\u2019t think of reading as a chore. Instead, think of it as an escape into a different reality all together. Would you rather be doing algebra or fighting Death Eaters side by side with Harry? Would you rather stare at a screen or be in the arena fighting for your life with Katniss? Would you rather stone blankly in the train or be transported back to World War Two Nazi Germany, in a cramped basement learning how to read with Liesel Meminger? The choice is yours. Choose genres that you\u2019re genuinely interested inNothing is more painful than reading something that you don\u2019t like/aren\u2019t interested in. Trust me, my literature book was about a boy turning into a guava for an ending. Not very pleasant reading. Find something that floats your boat and makes reading something to look forward to. Young adult books are always a great start and make for pretty leisure reading. They also tend to be more well known so it may be easier to find copies of them, practically speaking. Make connectionsLet\u2019s say you are particularly passionate about something or a social issue you believe in \u2014 take for example, Black Lives Matter. Reading is also another way to see the issue in the eyes of different people. In the book called \u201cThe Hate U Give\u201d, the main protagonist is a student called Angie Thomas, who is drawn to BLM activism after she witnesses her unarmed black friend being shot in front of her very eyes by police. The story is told through the eyes of a student instead of an adult activist, and it offers a fresh angle of the same issue. I guess by reading books that have a social issue you\u2019re interested in also contribute to the enjoyment factor, but y connecting it to your everyday life might also make it more engaging. Right so thats my two cents worth of shit about reading that I can give and i hope it works for you \u2014 let me know HAHAH so i can improve on this list for other people as well Thanks for reading and uh,, have a good day!

            "answer_text": "Forget everything you think you know about books. Believe that all the book lovers and their \u201cbooks make you fly to other lands\u201d are just talking about a hobby of theirs. Just like a TV junkie would go on about what ever big family member show is on TV (big brother, see what I did - no? Ok, what ever). So it\u2019s just a hobby. Granted it\u2019s more popular and more acceptable to say I love books than I love TV but just think of it as that. Now you are free! You do not have to read. Honestly, plenty people are born and die without reading, not a big deal. You are truly free. With that freedom, granted by your\u2019s truly - your welcome. You can approach reading from a different angle. First, think why do you want to read. Is it too impress people? I don\u2019t think it will work. Is it to get rich? I don\u2019t think it will work. Is it because you want to, or because you want to see what the hell all the hype is? Cool! Now that you know there aren\u2019t any expectations and that books are nothing special. You can start reading what ever you like. And, if you don\u2019t use the library but buy your own books, you have my permission to bin every single book you hate after reading the first page! Just read. Pick books you might like. Recommendations, classics, \u201cbest books ever\u201d lists are all over rated! Just pick books you might like. Be it the title, genre, theme, synopsis, cover, what ever it is that might make you think you\u2019ll like the book, pick it up and read it until you can\u2019t be bothered with it any more. Read every day. I would recommend you read 5 times a day. There, if you plan to read 5 times a day, I promise you\u2019ll find the time. Those 5 times can be 5 minutes for all I care. If they are really 5 minute bursts, read 10 times a day. Pick audiobooks to listen to. And that\u2019s how you start to love reading! You can\u2019t fall in love with something perfect. I\u2019m sure you think books are perfect, they aren\u2019t! Most of them are shit. But we all love our own crap, so start reading, throw away everything that stinks and in no time, you\u2019ll find your kind of crap. I have always hesitated to get into things that I thought were amazing, somehow better than me. Books, I cared more about what kinds of book one should read than what I wanted to read. Classical music, I cared more about how to listen to it rather than just turning the radio knob to classical FM an getting on browsing facebook whilst having it on in the background. There\u2019s nothing anyone can tell you that you don\u2019t already know, you fall in love with this the same way you fell in love with other things. Just start reading, when something sound boring, believe it to be true and move on. Have you read \u201cThe old man and the sea\u201d by Hemingway. Read it, most likely you heard people love it, I thought it was crap! Read it, it\u2019s short (I think it\u2019s the longest book I have ever read) and tell me what you think. ",

            "answer_text": "I think before trying to find an answer 'How' you should try to find the answer for 'Why' i.e 'why do you want to love reading?'  Once you figured out why do you want to love reading, then the 'How to' part will become vivid. The best person to answer the 'Why' question would be you.  People read for various reasons. I think most reasons would fit into one of the below Some read out of necessitySome read for entertainment or  to keep them occupiedSome people read to expand their knowledge, gain perspectives and know about things that they cannot actually experience themselves -- like living in a Middle-earth or In the Slums of Mumbai For some, reading is a cool thing -- a thing to show off, a status in front of their peers and societyAnd some people read just for the pleasure they get out of reading. People who love reading are likely to fall into this category.  Your answer to 'Why' would probably fall into one of these categories except for the first and last one. If your answer is of the last category, they you wouldn't have had this question in the first place. If it is the first one, then it really doesn't matter whether you like it or not, I suppose you just have to do it. And eventually you may end up loving or hating it. For anything between the first and last one, reading is only a means, i.e. you can experience each one of them through other ways like travel, meeting people etc. So you don't necessarily have to love to read. You can just read when it matters and attain a similar pleasure one gets from reading through other activities. If it is the idea of 'loving reading' that you like and that is what you want to experience, then you should approach it like the way you would do to love a person. We usually don't ask \"How do I make myself love someone?\" Falling in love with someone, for most people, is spontaneous and seamless. You fall in love either at the first sight or gradually by getting to know the person. I would think it is the same for loving other things including reading. If you aren't already in love with it, then you could only try if you would gradually fall for it. Like the way you would get to know the person, get to know about reading.Explore the different genres -- try novels, short stories, graphic novels, plays, epistolary novels, fictional diaries, autobiographies, biographies etc. Try them in different mediums -- eBooks, physical books, pdfs, online- forums etc and see which one suits you. To start with pick up a genre, that you are familiar, comfortable and interested -- even for the most unexpected topic, someone would have written something about it. Always carry a book with you in some form. Try reading it when you are alone, waiting for some one, commuting or standing in a queue. Don't just stop at reading, contemplate on what you have read and observe its influence on your thoughts and actions. Finally, when you do all these, see if you are enjoying it. That is the most important aspect. When you have started enjoying reading then you are more likely to fall in love with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Here's a few tips and tricks for you to have a better reading experiences. Only read what you're curious about. A book is like a meal, you don't have to force yourself to eat what you don't like. So, choose a topic you love to begin with, buy up to 10 books of that topic and start reading. Then, eventually expand your range of topics. And remember, don't judge a book by its cover.You could read more than one book at a time. Just like any other things, once you buy a book, it's yours and you can do whatever you want with it. You don't have to watch a movie from start to finish before watching something else, you don't have to eat before drink, so you don't have to finish a book before you can start another one. Actually, reading multiple books can help you to link knowledge and information between them, which makes you remember better.Use your imagination. Books are just a bunch of boring text blocks without your imagination. Imagination is what makes reading enjoyable, especially with fictions and novels. Think of reading a book like watching a movie within your mind with sounds and images, make it a unique experience. Unlike movies and comic books, since words are open up to countless interpretations, so does imagination.Share what you read with others, get company. Nothing feels better than having people to share, recommend and discuss things you read together. Tell someone about what you read helps you to get better at story telling and remembering what you read. Moreover, it's fun, it makes you to value your knowledge, and it encourages you to read more.Apply what you learn. Get cross some interesting theories or lessons on your way reading? Put them to your action plan and test the knowledge. Once you find something useful, you give a try and it works, you'll love it. By the way, that's how learning works.Write about your experiences. Forget about literature at school, you're free to write whatever you want, express however you feel, there's no judge. Make a blog out of it, or maybe just keep a diary? The point is reading-writing is a productive cycle. The more you read, the better you write, the longer you remember, the deeper you understand. I used to hate reading when I was a kid. It just didn't make sense for me to stare at a bunch of text blocks, while reading comics and watching movies was much more visual and straightforward. Not until one day, I ran out of comic books and movies, so I decided to read a few pages of Harry Potter out of boredom, and then, reading has changed my life ever since. I spent every summer of those high school years to read from 9am til 9pm. The habit only stopped once I had my first job due to heavy scheduling. The points above are what I've learnt to make reading enjoyable. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. If you feel bored with reading, there is a strong suggestion that you are just reading the wrong sort of material. Some people force themselves to read certain types of books because it is either fashionable, or prescribed reading. Go read what brings you joy, and fulfilment. We are not robots, and we need to love what we are reading. When you feel passionate about what you are reading, it seems so much easier. You want to read and pay attention. If you are referring to set books or material for your studies, then you have no choice. If you cannot get into it, I would strongly suggest rethinking your choice of career path. To struggle for years on end is no fun and reading will be even worse. Why not start with something you really enjoy first, and then move on to more challenging books. If you enjoy movies, perhaps you can try to read books that these movies were based on. This could provide inspiration to read more. Reading is more difficult to enjoy if you are uncomfortable, or in a busy environment. Try finding a quiet, comfortable spot where you can relax and get into the book you are currently reading. If you have the room to yourself, you can play audio tracks to increase your odds of concentration. It's not a good idea to wear earphones all the time, but how just for an hour or two while you study if you are in a public space? You can probably get an audio track this is just white noise. It won't distract you, and it will keep you focused. You can set the volume only loud enough to drown out the background noise. Take a look at this site below I found with free MP3 downloads. White noise on WikipediaWhite Noise MP3 free downloads for sleeping. Ocean sleep sounds for the baby.You may also want to read these answers. How can I motivate myself to read more books rather than spending time on the Internet?Why is that I have an aversion to reading novels?Why do we procrastinate so much?  ",

            "answer_text": "How do I learn to love reading? Start by reading the articles, essays or books of your field of interest. Once you are comfortable with this start by reading other books. Always start with a book which interests you(or the topic or genre that interests you)!! Initially I used to dislike reading, but one of the books caught my eye (maybe because of its title)\u2026so I started reading and enjoyed this particular novel\u2026(It is \u201cThe 2 minute Rule\u201d by Robert Crais). After this I read those books which interested me\u2026..and so the journey began!!!! After finishing each book I found a new book which I felt was good!! Trust me, the books were fabulous!! At some particular point I felt to take a break from novels and started venturing into management, self help and spiritual books!!! Some of the books I have read are magnificent!! Every time I read a book, I feel like I am interacting with the author and that person is telling me the story or advising me or guiding me. I visualize that the book is a platform for me to interact and understand the author from his/her perspective. Sometimes a book is a compilation of years or even decades of experience of the author!! It is easy and simpler to read and learn and then try than gain the equal amount of experiences of the author. (My favorite Brian Tracy, he is a gift to humanity). Remember: You can't read all the books you have!! (Or maybe you won't)\u2026but mainly you don't need to.You don't have to read the entire book in a single stretch.Sometimes you will read a book twice, thrice or even more.Not everyone around you will have the same interest as you\u2026. So try your interests first\u2026Not all the books out there are written by experts in the field (Especially Self Help).Try to finish a small book first. Once you finish it you will be forced to read another book\u2026 If you enjoy the books you read, or learn something\u2026.you will eventually fall in love with the process of reading books. Some of the books I loved are: The 2 Minute Rule By Robert Crais The Sunflower By Richard Paul Evans Folly By Alan Titchmarsh Beneath the snow by Caroline Carver The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday Get Smart by Brian Tracy Eat that frog by Brian Tracy Maximum Achievement by Brian Tracy Who moved my Cheese by Dr. Spencer Johnson And much more\u2026. Hope this answer satisfies you and takes you to a path of success and happiness. Thanks, Abhishek!! ",

            "answer_text": "All stories must walk some delicate lines--the primary one being between the \"new\" and the \"familiar\"--and nowhere is this more important than a story's opening. If a beginning is too \"new\" then it doesn't resonate, seems alien, and doesn't establish a grounded start to the story. But if it's too \"familiar\" then it becomes too boring and too much like the story isn't going to provide a new or exciting experience.  On the other hand, you need to have \"familiar\" so readers feel that grounding and comfort with your story. You also need \"new\" to excite readers too! So proper writing accounts for BOTH.  I love that you're clearly conscious of this. In addition to the \"new\" and \"familiar,\" a story must also make the reader care. We'll read the most familiar, boring crap--if we care about it. FIRST, WHAT'S FAMILIAR/OLD OR NOT IN THIS STORY?. . . There's a scale of familiar to new for just about every aspect of a story: CharacterPlotSettingStyleEtc . . .  So if you're concerned that the idea of your opening may be too boring, then it sounds like there's too much \"familiar\" or \"mundane\" there. I don't want to seem critical--but it DOES sound as though there isn't much new about this story that I haven't heard before.  Character: A villager, unfamiliar to adventure? Not too new. In fact, probably one of the oldest tropes in this genre. Setting: A medieval fantasy? Also fairly familiar. Also very typical to this type of story. Plot: I'm unsure about this one, so if we get some fairly interesting, \"new\" ideas about plot up front in the opening, it could balance out the \"familiar\" present elsewhere. If, however, it's a typical \"peasant boy saves the world,\" beginning for the plot . . . then there won't be anything new about it.  Style: This also isn't something you've conveyed a lot about, so if the tone of the medieval fantasy was humorous, or black, or something not usually seen, then this could also help create a sense of the \"new.\" SECOND, CAN WE PRESENT THE \"OLD\" IN A NEW WAY?. . . Character: While the concept of a farmer or villager being the main character is one of the oldest fantasy tropes: Farm Boy - TV Tropes But it is that way for a reason (as TV Tropes points out).  SO . . . is there anything NEW in your version of this OLD idea?  In addition, are there ways that this character can be MORE sympathetic than the typical Villager Hero? (Preferably in a way that doesn't involve him being an orphan/adoptee, picked on by others, seeing his family killed in front of him, or humble and unassuming?) In other words, any way the character can be more appealing WITHOUT making him more typical and familiar? That's what I'd focus on for this character--it doesn't matter how much of a perspective we get of him, how \"calm\" this opening is, or ANYTHING of that nature . . . if the character is the same character we've always seen in this genre, and isn't any MORE appealing or likable than the previous iterations, then my interest is going to flag. Is he missing an arm? Is he deaf or mute? Is he not literate (It's astonishing how literate all these peasant farm hero's turn out to be)? Conversely, is he a complete A-hole? That'd be fascinating.  This character is already familiar and relate-able, so how is he interesting and new? Setting: This setting isn't new either: Medieval European Fantasy So what's different about it? I'm happy with the familiar--provided I get something new in addition. Show me something unique and interesting about this world and this setting. One fascinating thing about this old, used setting is that Tolkien's world is still fascinating in it--because Hobbiton, as a medieval village made of holes in the ground--is unique and interesting. So what's new here? Just seeing a typical day on the farm, or at the market, etc, will not be interesting . . . however well it might be written. Plot: If neither of the above options are new, then jumping right into the adventure WILL help. You may want to have a \"calm\" opening, but if the newest material you have to offer is in terms of plot, then you should probably get straight to it.  Style: If you can write the same old, familiar ideas in a new way, this opening could be the furthest from boring.  It may be a farmer in a village . . . but if it's a parody? Or a dark comedy? Or grittily realistic? That would make for a new experience and new commentary that makes the story exciting and interesting. THIRDLY, GIVE THE READER A REASON TO CARE . . . If your material is still too familiar, readers will still read if they have a reason to care. We will read about the most ordinary, typical farm villager if we care about him/her. Typically, though, this still means adding something new: mouths to feed, death of a loved one, a disease, an emotional past, etc. I could write a crap-load more about this subject, but since you specifically mentioned avoiding boring . . . I'm leaving reader sympathy at this. ULTIMATELY . . .  You can write whatever excites you--but for it to be interesting to the reader, it has to be a blend of the new and the old, and better stir us emotionally. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there are two keys to learning to love reading.  Do more of it, thenEstablish a regular time to read1. Do more of it. I think the value of reading becomes apparent once you start doing enough of it. If you're struggling with \"doing enough of it\", I think the best way to make that happen is to remove alternatives. There are two times in my life where I had no choice but to read, and my love of reading really increased. The first occurred when I was around 8. That's when my parents helped my siblings and me purchase a small shaved ice business. Beginning that summer and for many summers after, my siblings and I would take turns working shifts at our stand. Each day we would work between 2-3 hours. We lived in a small town and didn't have a lot of clientele, so we usually had a significant amount of downtime while we worked.  Coincidentally, and fortunately for us, our shaved ice stand was located kitty-corner to the local public library. Without a lot else going on during our shifts at the stand, we, almost by default, filled our summer days with reading. As often as we wanted, either coming or going from our shift, we could swing by the library and swap out our books for fresh materials. Though we didn't make a lot of money from our stand, I believe the pile of books we read while working there was worth its weight in gold. The second time occurred the summer before I started 4th grade. As the summer was winding down, my parents proposed a wild idea to me and my siblings: what if as a family we moved to the Dominican Republic and lived there for one or two years. While we children had no idea where the D.R. actually was, it sounded like a fun adventure, and we jumped on board. During the 18 months we lived in the D.R., we did not own a TV. No more after school sitcoms. No more Saturday morning cartoons. No movies. Nada. (This was the day of dial-up internet, so definitely no online streaming either). Instead, and again almost by default, we replaced all our TV time, and much more, with reading books. We started to read so much that we had to institute a no-books-at-the-dinner-table policy, else we all spent the whole meal reading. While there were many, many rewarding aspects to our time in the DR, increasing our love of reading was among the most impactful. 2. Establish a regular time to read. Once you're convinced by your own experience of the value of reading, you'll have a desire to read. But like any good intention, you won't get around to it unless it gets on your schedule. Find a time of the day when you'll regularly be able to take time to read, and start. Once you've started, you'll really feel like you're missing out whenever your scheduled reading gets thrown off or interrupted. ",

            "answer_text": "The New York Times ran an article, a decade or more ago, about how many of the books assigned in high school should be dropped from the curriculum, not because they were bad, but because they were unrelatable and inaccessible to kids of that generation, probably Millennials, and should be replaced with more engaging material. Books aren\u2019t spinach. They should be more like chocolate, and reading should be pleasurable. So the first step is to find your chocolate. Identify what you like. Superhero movies? Animal behavior? Family sagas? Action and adventure? Technology? Figuring out what holds your interest best is the first step. Next, remember that it doesn\u2019t have to be fiction to \u201ccount.\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to have won awards or be what the cool kids are reading or have the best reviews. You like what you like. And if you don\u2019t like something, put it down and go on to the next thing; if you read a book a day, you still wouldn\u2019t run out of options. So, now you have a graphic novel, or a space opera, or a book about animal consciousness or a romance in your hand. It sounds interesting. The next step is balance. Make time each day, even if it\u2019s a small amount or time. 20 minutes after you get into bed, or ten minutes in the morning. A book on your way to work, if you commute by public transportation, or an audiobook (that counts!) if you drive to work. The things is that you won\u2019t like reading if you are giving up other things you like in order to read. If you miss the football game, or don\u2019t go out with friends, or miss your favorite television show because you think you should read instead, you\u2019ll be cranky and resentful. Skip those things when the book you\u2019re reading is more interesting to you than anything else. I once walked out of a movie I was seeing with friends and sat in the lobby to finish my book, because it was better than the movie. Good luck finding the \u201cgateway\u201d book to get you started, and have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "Let me tell you how I started reading books, may be it could help you!!  It was during my 6 th std summer vacation,  I and my sister were visiting my grandparents for few days. All my cousins still had a weeks school before they had their vacations so that meant I and my sister had to spend the whole day with my grandparents till they returned from school!!  Now my grandparents had the habit of having naps during afternoon after their lunch and they would insist us to have nap as well.  My sister would happily doze off where as I had trouble sleeping in afternoon so I would sneak out of the house into the street.  After wandering for a while I used to get bored,  not knowing what to do I once went inside the library which was just opposite my grandparents home! I started gazing through the books and decided I would read one to pass my time.  I may sound crazy but trust me I took this cartoon book asterix and obelix.  It was a cartoon character book meant for toddlers. I found it pretty interesting and soon I was reading all the series of asterix book!!!  I never realised how time went,  I had to force myself to get out of the library! The next morning I found myself in the library again,  now I started searching similar books!  I found Tinkle book,  started on and on and on...  I found books to be interesting and everyday I moved to another series and I was amazed how happy I felt.  I could actually feel the character as myself when I read the book. Slowly this became a habit. I started visiting library often and read lots of books,  be it  a magazine, novel, or even a pamphlet for that matter.  Whatever caught my attention,  I would grab It!!! Over the years of reading,  had not only improved my personality but also made me to think about writing.  I started writing a blog. I am not famous blog writer but I write for myself.  To just let me know that the reader in me is still alive even after I have grown and even after having my priorities and commitments!!!  Feel free to visit my blog  http://www.revzzfire.blogspot.co.nz and let me know your thoughts!!  Cheers Thanks for the A2A ",

            "answer_text": "You can enjoy reading by not seeing it as words on a page. I know this sounds a bit confusing at first, but hear me out. Let\u2019s take Harry Potter as an example. My mom comes home from a thrift store one day with the first Harry Potter book. She asked if I wanted it as it was very cheap, and I (very hesitantly) said yes. Now I didn\u2019t touch this book for weeks and maybe even a couple months on end until I was so bored that I decided to try it out. As a very creative thinker, I tried to immerse myself into the world of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I managed to think about what I\u2019d do in their situations, what my Hogwarts house would be, etc. Needless to say, I began loving the series. A LOT. With that being said, you can\u2019t focus on the fact that there\u2019s words on paper. You need to become part of the universe your book is exemplifying. You can\u2019t just read words. To truly enjoy a book you must think outside the pages. Become one with your characters, treat them like friends. Trust me, once you end up finding the perfect series (because you will), the emotions you\u2019ll feel and your potential interest in reading most likely will start to blossom. :) P.S: If you don\u2019t know where to start, I suggest a series with a large \u201cfandom,\u201d or group of fans. It really helped me out when I got serious about reading. Examples of the first books in some big-name series include: \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d by Suzanne Collins, \u201cDivergent\u201d by Veronica Roth, \u201cHarry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s/Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\u201d by J.K. Rowling, and \u201cThe Lightning Thief\u201d by Rick Riordan. ",
