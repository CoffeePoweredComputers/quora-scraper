            "answer_text": "A Financial Advisor\u2019s main role is to offer financial guidance to clients to choose which products are most suitable for their financial situation. This could be insurance, mortgage, loans, investments, savings, retirement, or any other service which may improve a client\u2019s current or future financial status. As per TheStreet, \u201cAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), only 24% of financial advisors in 2016 were self-employed. If you want to work in the field, you'll need to work in an office, and for a company to hire you, you'll likely need a relevant degree.\u201d \u201cA bachelor's degree in finance, accounting, economics, business, or mathematics could be a good first step to a financial career. Those looking to become a financial advisor in college would also be wise to look into related courses that could help them with advising and finding work in the fields that employ them. A couple of classes about investing and financial planning could go a long way to not just expanding your knowledge, but diversifying your career options.\u201d \u201cSome advisors want to be able to help their clients by buying and trading stocks, and they'll need certain licenses. Even just giving advice pertaining to investments requires a license. Financial advisors at insurance companies will also need licenses to sell and advise on insurance.\u201d All the best to you. I hope I could answer your question properly. Thank you, Dominick Dibona ",

Staying one for years, and developing credibility in the industry is. You may choose to contact any bank or insurer, especially when they are recruiting, which can be at career fairs, roadshows, or even ask your financial advisor friends. You will be sent for an interview process. There will be a CRO check to make sure that you have never been charged in court with property crimes such as fraud or theft.
