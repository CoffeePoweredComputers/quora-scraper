            "answer_text": "There can be two aspects of this and I will write about both. Class Notes: In my opinion, my class notes played a very significant role in my preparation. I used to have multiple 400 pages notebooks for each subject and wrote everything told in the class. I believed in my handwritten stuff more than other books and studied from them at the eleventh hour. It did pay off. I also used colourful pens to make them look beautiful.Compendiums: I have had a mixed experience with compendiums (hundreds of pages compressed into a single sheet carrying almost entire information). It is required to read the chapters very very deeply to be able to make a compendium, which played an important part in strengthening the concepts. On the other hand, the job is very time consuming and tiring, and I had to make some of them twice or thrice as my definition of important points changed with time. However, I just couldn't rely on them before the exam, I was always suspicious of missing any important point in them. Hence, I am not a big fanatic of compendiums.The more you write, the better it seeps in! ",
