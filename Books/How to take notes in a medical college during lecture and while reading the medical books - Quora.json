            "answer_text": "It is impossible to revise the whole chapters of MBBS subjects before the proffessional exams, so it becomes imperative to have some notes to read up quickly during the time of your final preparation. This is what I did/do. Not the most ideal method , but it works for me. I like to study from the books over the notes. So for lectures it is ideal to have a look of the topic from the book beforehand and while in the class, note down the points that you find new or take down flowcharts, tables etc that are better than the text in the book. It\u2019s no use taking notes if you will not read them up ever again, but mindfully filtering the information that you need will be helpful. Next, I put up a lot of flags and chits on my books to write extra information or major points of a chapter so that when I read the book ,I can study faster. This way, you need not open and simultaneously read from 10 books and copies for a topic, but one textbook will have the matter that you need to know and you can revise the tables and diagrams of the textbook also simultaneously.

            "answer_text": "The syllabus of MBBS is vast and heavy. It's difficult to revise everything and learn everything. However, making notes is a healthier habit and helps a lot in learning more in less time. I believe in having all information at one platform. Be it the book or the notes. If the chapter is nicely given in some book, add the extra points and tables in the book itself with the help of sticky notes or pages. If the teacher is providing excellent data and material for the chapter to be complete, make notes and add all extra points from books to them. Such that you will have to revise only one thing, either chapter from book or notes and your topic will be complete. So, it depends on topic, the books you are reading and the teacher's lecture. Decide yourself in the first lecture of the teacher and stick to one. Good luck Akshita Gupta ",
