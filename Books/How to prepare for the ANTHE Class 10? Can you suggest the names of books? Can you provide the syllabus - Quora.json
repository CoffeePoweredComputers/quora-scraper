            "answer_text": "I appeared in ANTHE 2016 when I was in class 10th. I secured a rank of AIR 5861 and stood 5th in my school. The top 3 students were already Aakashians right from class 8th or 9th onwards at my school. Person with rank 4 in my school got AIR 5660 . So close to me indeed!!! I am sorry to waste your time by mentioning irrelevant details. Alright so coming back. I had not joined any coaching/tuition and had no one to guide me for this exam nor did I studied anything for it. Hardly any one studies for it. I have got a lot to discuss about this exam but since I have to keep the length of my answer limited so let us directly come to the point: This exam is utterly difficult. Always remember that coachings are commercial and their first priority is to make money. They want only minimum number of intelligent students to qualify for scholarship. That is why they give them the bribe of cash awards upto RS 1 lakh but also make a condition that to be eligible for cash awards one needs to get registered oneself with Akash's DLP course which is not cancelled in any case!!! So even if a brilliant student does not join Akash institute but joins some other institute then also his name is claimed by Akash institute by the name of DLP course student. So smart indeed!!!!Syllabus is of 9th and 10th. Mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics and mental aptitude. Syllabus is same for both engineering as well as medical steams.For bio NCERT is sufficient to get 60% marks. To get more than that you should prefer S Chand .For mental aptitude you need to purchase a book on PSA or any other popular book. Don't think that questions are going to be easy. The aptitude based questions are of very high level and needs practice. The questions are more difficult than CSAT of mppsc . Trust me guys it's a fact. Check YouTube vedios for CSAT preparation of mppsc to verify.For mathematics, chemistry and physics. Neither NCERT nor any refresher can help you. Questions are of very high level and only practice material and notes of Akash's foundation course can sail you through!! I know many of my friends who are in star batch of renowned coaching institutes of kota got a rank of 30k- 40k.At last I would like to say that just give this exam only either just for a practice or if you seriously want to join Akash. In all my answers related to ANTHE I have mentioned that one of my friend who was an akashian got a rank of 20 k but used to get compartment in school exams. Other one who got 9.8 CGPA got 45 k rank.So this exam cannot tell you about your capabilities. There is no negative marking so even the weak ones may fetch marks by luck. So attempt all questions.All the best!! ",
