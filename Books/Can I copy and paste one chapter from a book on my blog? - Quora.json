            "answer_text": "You probably aren't free to print an entire chapter, if the book is still under copyright protection.  Under United States copyright law, works are protected for 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from the date of its creation, whichever is less. (However, if the author's name is disclosed to the U.S. Copyright Office, the work is protected for the life of the author plus 70 years.) Copyright law does allow for \"fair use\" of a work.  Fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon or criticize it.  However, fair use principles only allow you to reproduce some of the work. However, copying such a substantial portion of the work as an entire chapter might be considered to be an infringement of the copyright holder's rights. Unfortunately, there are no hard-and-fast rules, only general rules and varied court decisions, because the judges and lawmakers who created the fair use exception did not want to limit its definition. Be aware that if the copyright holder discovers and objects to you reproducing their chapter, they may sue you for statutory or actual damages, and it will be up to a judge to determine whether this is an instance of fair use. Note you are free to publish your own analysis of the text but with only a minimal amount of quoting of the original work. ",
