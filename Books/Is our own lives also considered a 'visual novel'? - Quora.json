            "answer_text": "Our lives are, in fact, very similar to a story, we lead it looking for an answer, or looking for a purpose, or simply going through the motions. We have things that happen to us that can make us feel one way or another, tribulations and successes, and some people aren\u2019t good people, morally, but that would make for a great story. I mean, think about all the autobiographies out there, and biographies. There\u2019s visual novels on historical events, like times during segregation and MLK\u2019s look to change America. I\u2019d like to think that everyone\u2019s lives is like a story, just waiting to be written. You can put so many perspectives too, make yourself the hero or the villain, the apathetic or the much too caring. :) Things you do all write out a story. I\u2019ve had people tell me that they think my life is \u201cinteresting\u201d and it seems like it would be a fictional novel. Some people aren\u2019t satisfied with their stories being \u201cboring\u201d and it makes them adventure. Some people mis-genre their stories as romance, or action, when really our lives are so many things at once. So yes, I do think our lives are like stories, just waiting to be told. <3 tsu! - out. ",
