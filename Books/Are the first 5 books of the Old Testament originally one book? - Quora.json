            "answer_text": "The originals - or the earliest we have - of the Torah (that is, the first five books of the Bible) are written on one single scroll. None of the books included have titles. Instead, there is merely a space between each book consisting of several blank lines. This space is interpreted as a break in the text, sufficient to call each major section a separate \u2018book\u2019 (or a separate \u2018work\u2019). The names of each of the five sections come from the first major word in the first sentence of each major section (in Hebrew). We therefore call each major section a \u2018book\u2019 (or a work), each with its own particular name. So in a way, yes, the first five books of the Bible are \u2018originally one book\u2019, but that requires that we project the term \u2018book\u2019 back in time to a period when there was NO SUCH THING AS A BOOK. There were only scrolls. For a scroll to be manageable in size, it could not be insanely long. And if a written work was fairly short, it was certainly possible to include more than one \u2018work\u2019 (or \u2018book\u2019) on a single scroll mounted on rollers. ",

            "answer_text": "Are the first 5 books of the Old Testament originally one book? In the sense of one physical volume, certainly not, since manuscripts were written on scrolls rather than bound in books. Spiritually they are a unity, certainly, but certainly Genesis shows signs of itself being a compilation of older sources, rather than a text written by a single hand at a single time. ",
