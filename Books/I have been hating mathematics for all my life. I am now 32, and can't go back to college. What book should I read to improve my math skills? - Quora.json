            "answer_text": "This may not be the answer you way be expecting. Personally, I\u2019ve come to learn that my previous poor performance in Mathematical computation was not caused by my IQ or even anything related to intelligence. I was simply afraid of Mathematics. How could I not be? I had been told so many times of the difficulties an complexities it had, who was I to muster the confidence deal with it? I am no scientist! I dealt with this issue without even noticing I was dealing with it. I read self-help books, completely unrelated to Mathematics. I had completely forgotten about it, and learnt about becoming more confident in life situations, I learnt about becoming a happier, livelier person. I became that, and one day I just saw mathematics differently. It wasn\u2019t as scary as I had thought it to be. Not to say I was suddenly a Mathematical Genius (I wish), but dealing with it became less and less stressful. I certainly was not getting everything right, but I was optimistic that I could learn and become a master at it. I no longer see solving a mathematical equation as a life and death situation - if I get the answer correct, whoop-de-doo! If not, I learn what I did wrong and continue forward. My advice is to start finding ways to help you hate mathematics less, then you can go into the nitty-gritty stuff. I recommend any Mathematical books which encourages Mental Maths. Hope this helps.
