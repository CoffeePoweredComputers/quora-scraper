            "answer_text": "Feel free to take my advice with a grain of salt, because I am not a successful comedian. However I did get paid to do stand-up for around 5 years before I decided to fall back to my trained profession in software. Observe other comics - live in a club not on TV. See what works, how they adjust to the audience, try to follow their humor and predict punchlines. Become a student of comedy. A big part of the job is learning how to tailor material to an audience and adjust on the fly. How to be objective about your own material.Write Material, Refine Material, Test Material (Lather, Rinse, Repeat)Practice - find open mic nights. Get as much stage time as possible.Find your voice - All comedians have a persona or voice that drives all that they do (deadpan, topical / political, observational, prop-comic, etc.). You need to find what works for you. Why is this not first? Because until you start writing, performing, and refining - you will not connect to your \u201cauthentic\u201d voice. Maybe that voice is a character, but it will fit you like a glove.Buy a recorder and record your sets. Try to place it in a location where you can pickup the laughter (or lack thereof). Don\u2019t place it at the back of the room near the other comics (you will get pranked). Doing forensics on your material is tough, but necessary.PracticePracticePracticeNetwork among other comics, club owners, etc. To get good you need to work - plain and simple.Get lucky \u2014 I\u2019ve known a lot of great comics that never made it. Louis CK first did stand up in 1984. I met him once at a gig in 1992. He was very talented then, but it took a long time after that for him to become the success that we see today. I would rank get lucky higher, but if you don\u2019t put in the hard work this will be irrelevant.",

            "answer_text": "Most large cities have comedy classes at their local comedy clubs...It never hurts to try it, but with a grain of salt.  Many people in charge of those classes are comedians and what they teach does not foster individuality or creativity...They simply want the student to do exactly what they're doing (movement/gesture/facial expressions/topics)--GO TO OPEN MIC NIGHTS--First just to observe whappebns and if you feel comfortable with whatever ids going on.  THEN--have a notebook that you can keep organized and start writing ideas for jokes...remember they are probably not jokes yet--just the germ of an idea.  When you have warted and familiarized yourself with approximately five minutes of material, go to the open mic and give it a shot.  DO NOT E4VER EVER EVER EVER use anyone else's material and have a level of awarenesss of who  your audience is and what is appropriate for you to be saying to them...It's not just Political Correctness--but good business.  If you piss of the club owner, manager, or headliner, you may not ever be allowed to come back and try it again.    Try to get stage time as often as possible.  There are also a number of \"How To\" books in the field that can be very helpful (If anyone is interested, I can let them know).  Remember that Comedy is an ART FORM--a lot like doing music, dance, visual art experiences...and after a while you should have enough self awareness that, even if you do all the right things, it may just not be the art form fr you.  It is a combination of Talent, Perseverance, Discipline and Luck.  If, after three years or so of trying, you are not getting any better and no one is offering you opening act/MC gigs, you might want to try something else.  Don't be afraid to critically watch those comedians who you like and learn from whatever they are doing. ",

            "answer_text": "The previous responses covered most of what you need to know. When I taught stand-up comedy, the first question I asked was,\u201dIs there anyone in this class that believes they aren\u2019t right brained?, \u201c If anyone raised their hand I told them I would give them their money back and tell them to support comedy. 1.) I don\u2019t see much that was missed, so I\u2019ll add a couple of comedy \u201crules.\u201d Yes, comedy has rules. If you are going to use an accent in any part of your act, great. Just make sure that you have that accent nailed. I saw a very funny comedian tell a very funny joke that lost it\u2019s steam because he started the joke using a Spanish accent and gradually turned it into a French accent. 2.) Remember, comedy comes in \u201cthree\u2019s.\u201d I had a student tell this joke. \u201cI like to look at boobs\u2026on the beach, on campus, in a shopping mall, through a dorm window. Here\u2019s the joke in three\u2019s with adjustments to the prepositions as well. \u201cI love looking at boobs\u2026at the beach\u2026 on campus\u2026through a dorm window.\u201d It\u2019s a tad shorter, I used a different preposition at each location and had a very slight pause between each. The night after drilling this \u201crule\u201d home to my students, I was watching Jay Leno, On The Tonight Show. My class knew that I was on Jay\u2019s fax team of writers for a short while. He told a \u201cjoke of three\u201d and killed with the short list. Kevin Eubanks hollered out , \u201cAdd a couple more.\u201d Jay looked at Kevin and with the back of his right hand, he slapped the palm of his left hand three times while saying , \u201cSorry Kevin, there\u2019s the rule of three and I\u2019m sticking to it.\u201d Needless to say, the class didn\u2019t believe me when I said I had nothing to do with it. One last note, the list of three can be presented two different ways. The first is funny, the second even funnier and the third brings the house down\u2026hopefully. The other falls into the delivery of the above joke. The first one is not funny, the second one is not funny, the third one kills. Remember\u2026THINK FUNNY. ",

            "answer_text": "To become a comedian you must be quick witted and have a rich sense of humor, preferably without malice. Some people have a natural ability to see the humor in everyday life and seem to be able to create something in their speech and manner that will make most people laugh at their jokes about it. I would study other well-known comedians on youtube to see what style you have in comparison. You might try to emulate some of these personas and see if you can make strangers or your friends laugh, especially those that don\u2019t know you personally very well. It will take time to perfect your own style before you go in front of an audience. Most comedians have a thick skin when it comes to criticism of their jokes. ",

Find live comedy in your area.  It doesn't matter where you start just go there and try to find more live comedy to checkout.  If you can watch live comedy every night that should be your goal.  If you have a day job and can't manage to see comedy 5x a week, quit now 2.  Watch comedy that interests you and try to find people who you can discuss this with.   3.  get on stage and try comedy. 4-99 fail at trying comedy, but keep doing it. 100.  Relocate somewhere you can try comedy 7x a week. ",
