            "answer_text": "If you want Honest Suggestion Then I want to suggest you Following Points as Under- There is no requirement for preparation for JEE from 8th onward. Best preparation can be done as soon as you give exam for class 10th. That is the best time for preparation for JEE. Up to 10th level it is required to make strong academics for 9th and 10th. You can use reference Books for 9th & 10th for extra Problems But it should be in the same way I am telling You. Foundation for Engineering or Medical NOT Required at all but PARENTS are also flowing in the same social belief. Growth of Child at Schools Totally interrupted. How the development of personality takes place in School is NOT visible but child Learns from school a lot is well experienced By PARENTS. Some Coaching Institutes Starts Foundation of Child From 8th Class on wards Which 100% wrong direction Given By Institutes in order to earn MONEY only. From Class 6 to 10, There is no Syllabus which supports for any competition of Medical or Engineering Competition. It is required to develop strong academic foundation of student so that when he or she prepares for competition- with the solid foundation he or she can overcome the burden of competition. It is Required to GIVE nice Schooling to Student so that his or her Total personality can take good Shape. Schooling is Most Important Part of LIFE of Student where Total Mental, Physical & Social Development Takes Place.
