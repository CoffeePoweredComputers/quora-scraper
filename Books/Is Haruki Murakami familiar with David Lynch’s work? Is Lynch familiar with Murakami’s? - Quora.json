Haruki Murakami\n by John Wesley Harding - BOMB Magazine Excerpt: JWH That\u2019s a good name for a song, \u201cNowhere Street.\u201d Let\u2019s talk about movies for a second. Do you like David Lynch? HM Oh yes, very much. I\u2019m a very great admirer of his. JWH Your story \u201cThe Dancing Dwarf,\u201d is so like the backwards dream sequence in Twin Peaks. HM Oh yeah, I was so surprised when I saw that! It\u2019s a complete coincidence. JWH When did you write that story? HM Before the movie! JWH Your books deal with situations a lot like those in Blue Velvet. The average guy finding extraordinary things in a very normal place. HM We are crazy about Twin Peaks in Japan. Do you remember the room with red curtains and the dancing dwarf? That\u2019s the room I mean when I think about subconsciousness. There is something strange and special in yourself. David Lynch knows that too and so we can both create those images, the same images. ",

I read an interview where Murakami said he had heard of him only because of similar questions. I honestly call bullshit on both. If you\u2019ve read Wind up Bird Chronicles, I feel like the influence on Lynch is obvious. Sorry for not providing more solid facts! ",
