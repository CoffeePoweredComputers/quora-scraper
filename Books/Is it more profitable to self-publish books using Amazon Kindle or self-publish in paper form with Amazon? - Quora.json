            "answer_text": "Many things go into the answer to this question. Ultimately, you need to create a matrix that shows various cover price points and correlating royalties for each version. In addition, you need to consider the production costs since it\u2019s always slightly more expensive to design, lay out, and typeset a paperback book than a Kindle version. However, keep in mind\u2026 in the long run, it\u2019s not really an \u201ceither/or\u201d decision since there\u2019s usually no reason to do just one or the other. That said, I do tend to recommend to my clients that they release in just one format to start, whichever makes more sense, and then release the other format in a few months. This gives you a chance to discover things you want to change/fix after publication (which almost inevitably happens) as well as get feedback from readers. By only having one version at this point, you only need to make the changes in the one format \u2014 instead of having to make duplicate changes in two existing formats. Otherwise, here are several factors that affect the answer: Fiction or Nonfiction If your book is a novel, then it\u2019ll probably be more profitable on Kindle. In general, fiction sells much better on Kindle than in paperback. Your royalty for each paperback sale will be about 2x to 3x what it is for each Kindle sale, but most novels tend to sell more than 3x the volume of the paperback version due to the list price difference (e.g., $2.99 versus $12.95). Put another way, people are more likely to take a chance on a $2.99 book instead of one that\u2019s four times as expensive\u2026 ignoring the other advantages of the Kindle format. If your book is nonfiction, then you\u2019ll probably do better in paperback. If it\u2019s good stuff, you can charge a bit more because people value information and education higher. Your list price can easily be $12.95-$16.95, maybe even $19.95, depending on the page count, quality of your content, and your target audience. Given that the sales volume won\u2019t be much higher for the Kindle version, the difference in royalty (again, much higher for the paperback) will favor this over the Kindle version. Complexity If your book is heavy on illustrations, tables, artwork, photographs, or complicated formatting, you\u2019ll probably be better off with the paperback version. These things are at a big disadvantage in the Kindle format due to file size, ability to read on smaller screens, navigation, and the coding required to make them look good. This has little effect on your royalty, but it would likely have a big effect on sales and reviews (which affect sales). If people complain that your book is hard to follow on Kindle, that\u2019ll kill sales. Page count This has less of an effect on what you can charge for the Kindle version compared to the paperback. Regardless of page count, your Kindle version will be $2.99-$4.99; your paperback version, however, can be anywhere from $9.95-$19.95. Most people simply don\u2019t expect to pay more for more pages in digital form. So, this means the longer a book, the more profitable the paperback version tends to be. However\u2026 this difference can easily be offset if your book is fiction since fiction sells so much better in the Kindle format. Target audience As with any product, you absolutely must know and understand your target market. So, part of this is knowing what format they prefer. You\u2019ll obviously sell more by providing this. Genre As I\u2019ve pointed out, most fiction does better on Kindle, so this is more of an issue with nonfiction. Some nonfiction genres do better in one format or the other; you just need to research how yours does. One way is to look at sales rankings for similar titles, comparing their rankings within their paperback versions to their rankings within their Kindle versions. You can also check out Reedsy and Smashwords for their latest research on sales by genre and format. Author sales If you\u2019ll be doing many in-person events at which you sell your book \u2014 most likely as a professional speaker \u2014 then you\u2019ll do better in paperback. You can buy copies at your author discount, thus keeping the full difference between that and the cover price for each one sold. That can easily mean far greater earnings than you can selling the Kindle version on Amazon. Furthermore, there\u2019s no convenient way (that I\u2019m aware of) to sell Kindle versions of books at physical events. You also can\u2019t autograph them, which people like, no matter how unknown you may be. And finally, I won\u2019t go into all of them here, but there are many techniques to improve in-person sales at events that simply don\u2019t work for the Kindle version (e.g., putting copies on each attendee\u2019s seat).

            "answer_text": "It depends on the size of your book (size file for Kindle and number of pages for the paper form)and the price that you set. You can chose your price and change it accordingly. My book is available on both platforms. Just to give you an idea, my paperback book is available for $19.95 on Amazon and I get around $5.63 per book if sold on Amazon through Createspace. This is because it is a lot of pages! On Kindle, my ebook costs $14.95 and I get $5.32 (because it is such a large file/download) if sold on Amazon. I get less if the purchases are not directly through Amazon. You really need to research prices for the size of your book/file. If you contact Createspace or Kindle, they will help you with this. The good thing is that you do not have to pay any money up front to print a book or send electronic files. They do it all for you. However, this is why you only receive a percentage of the money from the sales. Hope that helps and good luck with your endeavor! :) ",
