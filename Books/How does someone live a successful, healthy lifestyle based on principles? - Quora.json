            "answer_text": "There are a great many ways to be \u201csuccessful,\u201d so I will ignore that for this post. One good way to live by principle is according to the Five or the Ten Buddhist Precepts (I\u2019m thinking of the version used in the Kwan Um School of Zen). Living by the Precepts means making a firm commitment to keeping a clear mind and helping others. I chose these precepts as an example because it is possible to keep the precepts and because doing so does not require an individual to believe in any particular religion. Doing zazen helps with keeping the precepts, because when we see into our true nature we realize we are not actually separate beings but part of a whole. This makes it easier to act with compassion toward others, since this means also acting with compassion toward ourselves. In practical terms this means for example wearing a mask when we leave the house to prevent accidentally spreading COVID-19 to others. ",

            "answer_text": "There is for us the Wisdom of the Ages as digested by familiar religious traditions. Mosaic Law, the 10 commandments, is a good start for a child. Ask yourself: does this build the civilizing process or tear it down? Understand some underlying things about humans: people are easily fooled by talking snakes, for instance. People will also learn something for a smile that they won\u2019t learn for a stick. I like the Irish folk saying \u201cIt is better to have a wooden goblet and a golden priest than a golden goblet and a wooden priest.\u201d Resolve that temple meeting helps. ",
