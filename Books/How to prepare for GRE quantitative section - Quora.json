            "answer_text": "Hi! This is a common issue that most of the students face. Everything seems good till the time Mathematics is not there, isn\u2019t and that too in an entrance exam like GRE etc, where there are lot of topics and concepts are involved right from percentage to Permutation and combination. I wanna tell all those that they must follow the steps given below to excel Mathematics (Specially in GRE).Here are the steps: Analyze: Analyze the entire GRE maths syllabus and look for your strong and weaker sections. It can be percentage, functions or any other topic. Once you are clear with your strengths, then cover that portion first so that you can devote the remaining time to other sections.Practice: Try to solve questions logically rather than just guessing the options as GRE exam is more sort of logical exam specially the Quantitative comparison section where you have to answer the question after analyzing the question properly as students tend to make a lot of mistakes in this section.Variety of Questions: Once you are done with syllabus then look for practice questions and for that you can look for various books available or online platforms. Try to practice as much as possible. Initially it can be a just practice question to try different type of ques but you must practice with time limits per ques.Mock Test: As soon as you are done with this much of your practice then try to solve mock test within time limits and try be accurate. During mock test practice sessions you may come across some issues like accuracy level, time pressure or variety of questions. Don\u2019t get disheartened learn from every mock test and try to overcome in the next mock. This way you will be able to move a step ahead every time and you will soon climb up to your destination.You can look for ncert or your school level books to develop your basic concepts and formulas. Once you are done with it, then you can practice Manhattan 5lb or Kaplan\u2019s book to practice variety of questions this will also develop your concepts that are required for exam. But one should follow the above map to get good score as it is essential to work on yourself. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Before you start digging out your old linear algebra textbooks in a big frenzy, take a deep breath and remember that you learned most of the math you need to know for the GRE in high school. Here are a few concepts you should start with as you begin your GRE prep: Basic properties of shapes (triangles, circles, squares, quadrilaterals)Properties of integersExponentsRate and probabilityIt\u2019s common for students to focus their attention on mastering a certain question type or concept they\u2019ve struggled with in the past. However, it\u2019s important to start by reviewing all of these concepts before diving in to more specific test taking strategies, which we\u2019ll cover later on in this article. The types of questions you\u2019ll face The Quantitative Reasoning section is broken up into three question types: Problem Solving, Quantitative Comparison and Data Interpretation. Here\u2019s what one should be prepared to know to answer each of these pieces: Problem Solving tests your understanding of common math concepts. This is where your knowledge of algebra, data analysis, arithmetic and geometry will especially come into play. These questions are fairly straightforward, multiple-choice questions that include five answer choices.Quantitative Comparison questions will present you with two statements and ask you to determine the relationship between them. While you\u2019ll be able to answer these questions with the basic math skills we discussed earlier, the challenge will be to correctly identify which of the following choices is correct, which will truly test your understanding of all concepts:The quantity in Column A is greater.The quantity in Column B is greater.The two quantities are equal.The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.Data Interpretation questions will ask you to analyze one or two charts, graphs or tables and answer the corresponding multiple-choice questions. You should expect to see these questions in a split-screen format, with the graphs on one side and the question on the other. This format can be tricky, as the graphs will occasionally force the questions onto a second page, requiring you to scroll down to read all the answer choices.Tricks to crack the trickiest quantitative reasoning elements While the concepts you\u2019ll need to know are fairly basic, Quantitative Reasoning questions are by no means a walk in the park. With the GRE being written to challenge test takers, your success will depend on your understanding of what you\u2019re being asked on each question. Many students starting out will get lulled to sleep and rely on their knowledge of the basics, which can lead them to falling victim to selecting an answer choice that seems correct, but fails to address the entirety of the question. So, save time by estimating, rather than dealing with the unwieldy numbers provided on the GRE. ",

            "answer_text": "Improving in GRE quant is a challenging task; however, if you can dedicate yourself and study smart, you can realize some major improvements in your GRE score. Since you are just starting out with your GRE prep, you should first familiarize yourself with the GRE exam and then take an ETS practice exam. The results of that exam will give you a good idea of what to expect on the GRE as well as a baseline GRE score. After completing the diagnostic and determining how far off you are from your score goal, you will need to devise a solid study plan. Since all students are different, it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly how long you will need to prepare for the GRE. However, on average, I see students studying for 3 to 6 months, putting in 300+ hours of dedicated study to achieve their score goals. I wrote about this in more detail in my article How long to Study for the GRE. When developing your study plan, it is important to realize that the GRE quant section is not just a math test; it is also a reasoning game. So, increasing your score takes improving skills that relate specifically to the GRE quant game. Yes, it\u2019s imperative that you know an array of basic math concepts, such as the difference of squares, 30-60-90 triangle properties, patterns in units digits, patterns in remainders, divisibility, algebraic translations, Venn diagrams, and permutations and combinations, to name just a few. At the same time, you need to far surpass simply understanding those concepts; you must develop strong analytical reasoning skills. So, must you learn math for GRE quant? Yes, for sure. Without a solid understanding of the underlying math, it will be difficult to improve your GRE quant score. Will learning math be sufficient to earn you a high GRE quant score? Probably not. The key is to learn how the GRE uses basic math to create logic-based questions. Thus, you\u2019ll need to be armed with a combination of math knowledge and analytical reasoning skills to improve your GRE quant score. To develop the math knowledge and analytical reasoning skills that you need, I suggest you seek out a course that can help you to master the quant section of the GRE. If you plan to study on your own for the GRE, you may consider an online self-study course as opposed to a prep book. Self-study courses typically provide detailed study plans and have granular analytics, so you can easily track your progress as you move through the course. The ability to track your progress will keep you more engaged and you\u2019ll be able to more accurately forecast when you\u2019re ready to take your real GRE. There are many courses available, so it\u2019s best to research your options before you commit to one. In this competitive GRE landscape, you\u2019ll certainly want to utilize only the best possible materials; otherwise, you may find yourself at a big disadvantage relative to your peers. How do you procure the best materials? GRE Prep Club has reviews on the best courses for GRE Quant. Read the reviews and see what others have to say. Most courses will have free or low-cost trials, so try them out. Then choose a course that fits your learning style and your unique study needs. Just remember that to earn a higher GRE quant score, you\u2019ll want to pursue a detailed approach that allows you to develop a deep mastery of the material. It\u2019s very hard to earn a competitive score these days without rigorous and comprehensive study; the competition is just too great. So, you must seek mastery. For example, if you are learning about number properties, you should develop as much conceptual knowledge about number properties as possible. In other words, your goal will be to completely understand properties of factorials, perfect squares, quadratic patterns, LCM, GCF, units digit patterns, divisibility, and remainders, just to name a few. After you develop strong conceptual knowledge, you'll want to engage in deliberate practice with realistic practice GRE quant questions. You can\u2019t correctly answer just one or two practice questions on number properties (or any other topic) and expect to perform well on that topic come test day. When you solve only a few questions, you create false confidence. You fool yourself into thinking that you are prepared. To avoid this pitfall, solve a wide range of questions on each topic. A good benchmark is to practice with at least 50 questions per topic. Once complete, do a thorough analysis of each incorrect question. If you got a remainder question wrong, for instance, ask yourself why you got it wrong. Did you make a careless mistake? Did you not properly apply the remainder formula? Was there a concept you did not understand in the question? By thoroughly analyzing your mistakes, you will be able to more efficiently fix your weaknesses and, in turn, improve your GRE quant knowledge. Number properties is just one example; follow this process for all quant (and verbal) topics. Here is an article that I wrote that I think will give you some more valuable information: How To Score a 330+ on your GRE. When practicing GRE quant questions, you must also consider timing. However, since you are just starting out and learning new material, be careful not to put too much emphasis on solving every question in 1 minute and 45 seconds or less. You can consider timing this way: when you are doing practice questions, there are three levels of proficiency you could be attaining for each quant category. At Level 1, you understand the logic of GRE quant questions in a category and basically know how to answer them, but you may not get them right, or you at least don\u2019t get them right consistently. This level of proficiency is a good start. At Level 2, you consistently get questions in a quant category correct, but you are not fast, taking on average well over 1 minute and 45 seconds per question. This level of proficiency is an improvement over Level 1. . Getting right answers is key. If you can get right answers consistently, you are well on your way to hitting your GRE score goal. At Level 3, you consistently get questions in a category correct, taking about 1 minute and 45 seconds per question (or sometimes less). When you are at this level of proficiency for a category of GRE quant question, you are ready to answer questions of that type on the test. Now it\u2019s time to work on another question category or topic. To develop the third level of proficiency, you must allow yourself ample time for deliberate practice. When you first begin practicing, if you try to rush through questions, you\u2019ll find it extremely difficult--if not impossible--to progress to Level 3. So, when you are practicing, do the questions untimed. Yes, you can be aware of how much time you are taking, but don\u2019t focus on the time. Generally, you need to focus on finding the correct response to each question by mastering the material and learning to use higher-level thinking, rather than on answering questions in less than two minutes (or any other preset amount of time). Remember, the best way to gain speed is to know the material very well and develop strong skills. Thus, once your GRE knowledge improves, better timing will follow. In fact, a great way to know how well you have a mastered a particular topic is to be cognizant of your reaction time when seeing a particular question. For example, consider the following simple question, with which many students who are beginning their prep struggle: 20^2 + 21^2 + 22^2 + 23^2 + 24^2 + 25^2 = ? A) 3,055 B) 2,060 C) 3,066 D) 3,704 E) 3,077 Upon seeing this question, what is the first thing that comes to mind? Performing all of the calculations by hand? Grabbing a calculator to add up the values in the expression? Are you spending 60 seconds or more just thinking about what the question is really asking or how it could be efficiently solved? Or do you quickly recognize that one simple solution utilizes the concept of units digits? If you are able to quickly recognize that using the units digits will allow you to attack the problem quickly and efficiently (see the solution below), the question becomes very straightforward. Solution: Because each answer choice has a different units digit, instead of finding the actual sum, we can just find the units digit of the sum. Let\u2019s use the units digits of each square to determine the units digit of the sum. - The units digit of 20^2 must be 0, since 0^2 = 0. - The units digit of 21^2 must be 1, since 1^2 = 1. - The units digit of 22^2 must be 4, since 2^2 = 4. - The units digit of 23^2 must be 9, since 3^2 = 9. - The units digit of 24^2 must be 6, since 4^2 = 16. - The units digit of 25^2 must be 5, since 5^2 = 25. With this, we can sum the units digits: 0 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 5 = 25. Thus, the units digit of the sum is 5. Answer choice A is the only choice with a units digit of 5. Although this is just one example of many, you see that you must have many tools in your toolbox to efficiently attack each GRE quant question that comes your way. As you gain these skills, you will get faster. Finally, once you feel you have mastered GRE quant, you can begin taking official ETS practice tests to track your progress. ETS offers 4 practice exams, which can be found here. When taking a practice exam, try to replicate the test-day experience as much as possible. Go to the library instead of taking it at home. Be sure to complete all sections (Writing, Quant, and Verbal) in one sitting, taking only the authorized breaks. After completing each test, be certain to rigorously analyze your mistakes so you can continue to determine and fix any remaining weaknesses. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Since this question ask about complete preparation plan, my answer can be a bit longer..I will try to keep it concise as well as precise! Let us divide the preparation according to three sections and try to cover all of them in 3-4 months - Quantitative - If you are good with the basic concepts of mathematics, this section can help you boost up your score with at least 5-8 marks easily. But let us assume you still have to improve you concepts. I would suggest, refer to quantitative aptitude by R.S. Agarwal. Read and understand first two pages of every chapter which contains theory part and short tricks. After getting a grasp over concepts practice questions from Kaplan's quantitative material. Do at least a chapter everyday. If you are not able to score well in quantitative section, then refer to my answer Aman Sharma's answer to How can I improve GRE quant score 143 to 160? That can help. AWA - This section requires a lot of reading and writing practice. Start reading articles from websites, newspaper and try to write a paragraph about what you have read and what did you understand. If you don't have time to proceed this way, then there is a short cut to get at least 3.5 in AWA (which I did). Find answers for issues and arguments topics on google and categorize the endless pool into different sections like education, technology, science, politics, government, society, culture, religion etc. Once you have categorized them read 4-5 answers for every section and try to remember examples that you have read. They will surely fit in any question that might appear in your GRE. But do practice writing once or twice in a week because you should be in a habit of bringing out the best in 30 minutes! Verbal - As it appears to most of us, the most tough section in GRE. But you can get a decent score if preparation is well planned. Have a mind set that you have to learn at least 1000-1500 words before you appear for GRE. You don't have to learn them all at once, but around 30 words everyday. Now let us start with book Barrens 333. Learn all 333 words perfectly. Once you are done with learning these words start practicing for questions. You have to attempt 20 questions of each type i.e. Sentence Equivalence, Text Completion and Reading Comprehension everyday. Refer to Princeton 1014 for SE and TC & Manhattan 5lb for RC. If you complete these books go for Kaplan. Level of Kaplan is slightly more than what actually comes in GRE. Along with these questions keep learning new words and revising old ones. Remember learning new is not that important as remembering old ones. Also do not learn random words, search online for 1000 high frequency words and learn them first. So if we have to conclude with what we have to cover everyday, we can say that, an article/issue/argument answer, 30 words, 1 chapter of quantitative and 60 questions for Verbal. I hope this helps! Do post in comments if you have any question. ",

I appeared for GRE twice and both the times I got 3 sections of quant, all three of them are compulsory but only 2 are rated. Pattern i.e how many questions from which section and all that, Quantitative Comparison Questions Multiple-choice Questions \u2014 Select One Answer Choice Multiple-choice Questions \u2014 Select One or More Answer Choices Numeric Entry Questions 3 DI questions, 5\u20136 quant comparison, 3\u20134 multiple choice, 2\u20133 trigonometry etc. Buy the Official ETS book and you\u2019ll get to know the pattern. Other than that practice is the only mantra, the more you practice the better you get at solving. For me I finished ETS, Magoosh, Manhattan, Nova and TMH book for quants. It\u2019s not much you can finish 1 book a week with 2 hours a day. ",
