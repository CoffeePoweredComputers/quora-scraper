            "answer_text": "For first, you need to read this alcohol law in the USA: In Alabama, beer cannot be sold in containers of more than 0.75 liters. In grocery stores, you can only sell wine and beer, for strong alcohol you will have to specialized outlets. In Colorado, alcohol can only be sold at liquor stores and pharmacies licensed to sell liquor. In grocery stores, you can only sell beer with a strength of 3.2%. Some chains acquire a pharmacy license, which allows you to sell alcohol in one of the stores. In Delaware, persons under the age of 21 cannot even enter liquor stores and bars without being accompanied by a parent or guardian. In Indiana, it is forbidden to sell cold beer at grocery stores. So, there is a small way out of this situation, you can find sites similar to this - https://700ml.ru, where you can sell your alcohol to the owners of this project. Maybe in your state, you can find the same project and can sell your alcohol to them. Kansas has some of the most stringent alcohol laws. For example, in 59 districts, an enterprise must receive at least 30% of its revenue from food sales in order to sell alcohol. But in this case, it is allowed to sell only beer with a strength of not more than 3.2%. Other alcohol is sold only in government retail stores. The peculiarity of US alcohol legislation is in the broad powers of local authorities - in many districts \u201cprohibitions\u201d are introduced, and they also limit the time and days of alcohol sales. Most states have limited sales on Sundays and public holidays. After that, you need to draw up a bunch of documents and purchase a license. In general, it is very difficult, and it\u2019s best to hire a lawyer to help you resolve this issue. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a lot of licensing involved, and indeed the requirements would vary state-by-state (for some states, it\u2019s illegal to ship alcohol, period). I would get ahold of a good lawyer who specializes in interstate commerce; any answer I could give would be woefully insufficient. One way to sidestep the problem (if you have a specific product or portfolio of products that you wish to sell) would be to join up with an established online direct-to-consumer alcohol retailer \u2014 a wine-of-the-day group, or an online wine club, or a retailer with a large online presence \u2014 and see about getting them to do the heavy lifting for you. Yes, you\u2019d give up a percentage of the profits, but it might be more efficient than going it alone. ",

            "answer_text": "First, assuming that you're licensed to sell alcohol at all, you hire an attorney to weed through the thousands of federal, state and county laws pertaining to the sale and shipment of alcohol.  You then secure the necessary permits that will facilitate your remission of sales taxes to the 50 states. Also be prepared to do battle with UPS and FedEx, who will both swear that they never ship alcohol, despite the fact that you can order alcohol that is shipped by both of them. ",

There are also issues about making sure that those underage can\u2019t get their hands on it. And, of course, making sure the appropriate taxes for the states and federal government are paid. ",
