            "answer_text": "I would think that this would explain a lot of things, like all the redundancies in his writing, telling the same scene from multiple POVs for reasons that still leave me baffled. In short, in either case, I\u2019d say that a human editor was still needed. All that said, since he started being published in 1967, this idea of a computer program writing his books seems more fanciful than his writings. This isn\u2019t a thing even now. ",

I'd feel like I must be in an alternate dimension. Talk to text barely manages a readable paragraph, so computer generated best sellers is more than a stretch. ",
