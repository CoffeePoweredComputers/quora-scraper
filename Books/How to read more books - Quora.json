            "answer_text": "I have 1800 read books on goodreads and that is only a fraction of what I have actually read. So I get asked this a lot. Some of what I am going to say might seem contrary to what you hope to accomplish but please read my answer through. Here are some tips: Read qualitively, not quantitively - I know this flies into face of your question but it is important. You do not want to read 10,000 books and not a word wiser. You wouldn't want to read 'more' if you were only after entertainment. That said, 'quality' doesn't have to mean you must learn something from a book. People who read to learn often end up with motivational books and they are not something I personally recommend. What I mean is that you should be able to feel you gained something. One quick way to do so is to keep a diary of some sort in which you can write what you have to say for a book. It might just be feelings for a character in fiction - one of reasons why to read more should be to help you to express yourself better. I do it through my so called goodreads 'reviews' (they are more like just 'views'). This way you might not have quantitively read more but you will definitely have read qualitively more.Don't set yourself goals - I know some answers here suggest otherwise but my personal experience is goals make you run faster through pages without stoping to think about what you have read. Reading should not be turned into a rat race.Read several books at a time - The idea is to spend several days with a book and yet not lose the number of books. We do lots of our thinking subconsciously. And we will able to do it more when we leave and come back to a book more often. And if we slept several nights during our reading of a book (which is when our brain does most of the processing). This will also help you to go through a difficult to read book becuase you won't read more than a few pages at a time and you can then move to other easier to read books.Do not be afraid of abandoning books - Life is too short for a bad book. If you think book has nothing to do for you, abandon it. Again, book might have something to offer, but you may think your reading abilities are not upto the mark.Find fellow readers - I live in a small town and don't know anyone who reads but Goodreads resolved the issue of finding some other readers for me. Finding other readers means you find easy recommendations and you can gain different perspectives on books you have already have read. Having someone to talk to on what you read will also make you feel more motivated about reading.Spend more time with books - This is best tip anyone can give. Always have a book handy by you. Carry a book everywhere. Mobiles have made it easier and you can now carry a whole library inside your pocket. Read every few minutes you get - even if they be two. Train your brain to enter a book or leave at it as easily as it starts or stops listening to the music.Read on different mediums - you can read hard copies, over computers or laptops, mobile handsets or reading devices and you can also listen to audiobooks. You can allocate different books to different means mentioned here. Audiobooks are best for English classics pre-1900AD. You can listen to them on your mobile in an app Librivox available on Google Play Store. This will help you read while travelling without straining your eyes. Don't use audiobooks for harder books though.Don't drive if you can avoid it - I always use public vehicles if I can't travel to a place by walking. Driving needs lots of focus for itself. At best you can listen to audiobooks.Take breaks - Some readers have recommended time lockouts. My personal experience is that one gains more if one takes a break - a minute or two if not more, after having read a few minutes. You can spend this time doing something else that interests you.Read in different poses - do not always feel inclined to sit while reading. You can walk around in room, lie on bed etc. You can read lots if you hold your body tight.Protect your eyes - Use reading apps or softwares that blue light filters and/or dark modes. For mobile handsets, I use Moon+ readers which has more options than any other reading app I know. In my laptop I use Calibre reader. If possible, don't read in dark. Keep lights on in your room and brightness of screen low. Protected eyes you can read more without letting them hurt lots.Don't be afraid of divided attention - things like talking to people or watching videos need very little of attention and you can read some easy to read books while doing such things on side. Mobiles with split screens and apps that display on others apps make it easier to read while you wait for an answer in your chat. Reading too doesn't need all one's attention except when one is still developing the habbit. It needs lots of attention but not all. And actually after some point, if you force yourself into a book too entirely when it is too easy on your attention, the wasted excess of focus will just tire you out. In my experience, people who make reading such a hard thing as needing all your energies for time being are very likely to find little time and inclination for it. Make reading a source of pleasure as easy to take in as listening to music.Read across genres - read different genres and read different forms of literature - poems, plays, novels, short stories, graphic novels, comics as well as non-fiction - biographies, essays etc; especially in the begining when you are trying to find out where your own interests lie. Whereever your interests will be, there you will also be able to read faster.Read books from different parts of the world - if you read a book from a new country you gain a lot simply in terms of getting to know about their cultures. Moreover, quality of books themselves might vary. Latin American literature, for example, tends to have a very original quality (of which 'magic realism' is one of results), books from States tend to try to stimulate readers, those of Europe are very less likely to feel inclined to do so, good books from Indian author's often convey a sense of anguish about conditions in the nation. Please note I said words like 'tends to' because it is my own general experience. And yours may not be same. And moreover even in my own reading, these characterstics weren't always true.Start with smaller books - smaller books will be faster to read and you will gain confidence. You can find out about your own interests in different genres while investing lesser energies and time in each of them. You can rate the books you have read on goodreads and it will help you find other (may be bigger) similar books. Some shorter books I can recommend are - Apology by Socrates, Animal Farm by George Orwell, Stranger by Albert Camus, No Exit by Sartre, Ones who walk away from Omellas by Ursulla K. Guinn, Mrs. Dollaway by Virginia Woolf. I think these books will also be easy to read as well.These are things I have learned from my experience. Your own reading habbits might not match mine or, for that matter, any other answers given here. So you will learn lots by trying things yourself. I am sorry for typos, I bet they are many. I am posting without rereading as I don't expect anyone to read this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "In January, I read seven books; a variety of fiction and one non-fiction. I\u2019m fairly proud of that number, given I only read 28 books last year. Reading seven books a month averages to 84 books in a year. That means I\u2019m on track to triple my yearly count. And this isn\u2019t some egocentric goal of mine. I\u2019ve always loved to read. Those 28 books last year trickled through at a very leisurely pace. But at the end of last year, I realized I didn\u2019t read for pleasure. I was sucked into the self-improvement world, disguised as the \u201cwellness industry.\u201d I latched onto well-known books like Tim Ferris\u2019s Titans and basically everything Malcolm Gladwell has ever written. And though the books contained their merit, I got a bit sick of reading to try and improve myself. I came to this crazy realization that maybe I could go back to reading for fun, instead of the sole purpose of making myself a better person. I decided 2020 would be the year of fiction. I wanted to read more narratives I loved that had me turning the pages late into the night. And so I began this year intending to up my annual book count to 40. I think it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ll knock that one out of the park (or library). But the only way I was able to read seven books this month is because of a system I\u2019ve devised. It works for me, and if your goal is to read more, it can work for you too:  Read Multiple Books at a Time I never read only one book at a time. Though 2020 is my year for fiction, I always have a non-fiction book on hand. Sometimes, I\u2019m tired. My brain is foggy, and all I want to do is read a mindless rom-com. Other times, I\u2019m feeling alert. I want to be challenged, whether that be through an educational book or deeply reflecting with a memoir from someone that inspires me. Have at least a couple of books on hand at all times. That way, you can cater your choices to what you\u2019re in the mood for.  Read Multiple Formats at a Time The various books I have are also in different formats. I wouldn\u2019t have hit seven books this month if it weren\u2019t for audiobooks. Every time I\u2019m in my car, I play a book. The radio is great and all, but I love hearing people read books aloud. Nowadays, it\u2019s like listening to a performance. Narrators do such a great job of drawing you in through storytelling. But along with my audiobooks, I always have a digital book \u2014 in case I\u2019m out and about and find myself with time \u2014 and a physical book. My point is, you never know when you\u2019ll find yourself with time, so it\u2019s always good to be prepared.  Time Pockets Are Your Best Friend Any moment when I find myself with a few minutes of free time, I read. Even if it\u2019s only five minutes, I\u2019ll dive into a book. I call these \u201ctime pockets,\u201d and they\u2019re the moments in your day when you have a few to twenty minutes to spare. It may be while your kid plays at the park or you\u2019re waiting in your doctor\u2019s office, but these moments are great for getting in a few pages. Pro tip: if you have a bit of time to read before you need to leave your house, set an alarm on your phone. Rid yourself of the distraction of having to pay attention to the time.  Have a Running List of Books You Want to Read The feeling of completing a great book is joyous. But not so much if you suddenly realize you have nothing to move on to. Keep track of books you want to read either in your Notes app or on an Amazon wishlist. That way, when you\u2019re deciding what to read next, you don\u2019t need to go searching for ideas; you have a list ready to go.  Follow Book Review Accounts on Instagram If you\u2019re itching to discover new books rather than default to popular ones you hear your friends rave about, I suggest turning to Instagram. There are a plethora of accounts run by book enthusiasts. They give you a quick synopsis of the book along with their general takeaway. Save the books you find interesting to your profile. Then, when you\u2019re looking for your next book to read, go back to all your saved posts. No matter what genre you love \u2014 sci-fi, memoirs, thrillers \u2014 there\u2019s an Instagram book review account for it.  Create a Goal A goal keeps you motivated, though I hope your love for books does that too. Having a goal in mind shouldn\u2019t be stressful; it should be fun. Knowing how much knowledge and narratives you\u2019re going to consume in 2020 should elicit excitement, not dread. Whatever you do, though, don\u2019t create an unrealistic goal. If you read 15 books last year, chances are a book goal of 100 isn\u2019t within your grasp. Be reasonable with your goal. You can always increase it if you\u2019re ahead.  Go to That Thing Called a \u2018Library\u2019 If the idea of buying all these books makes your wallet squeal or you\u2019re worried about the trees, head to your library. I know I don\u2019t need to explain what a library is, but honestly, I don\u2019t understand why more people don\u2019t utilize this resource. The library orders books you can\u2019t find. They suggest great new books in your genre. They even offer a free service called Libby. With your library card number, you can use this app to rent digital and audiobooks free of charge. I use Libby for all of my audiobooks and have saved myself a lot of money doing so.  Genuinely Love to Read I still believe that if you don\u2019t like to read, you haven\u2019t found your genre of choice yet. But the fact is, if you hate reading, you\u2019re going to have a hard time reaching your goal. Like any endeavor, want will only get you so far. You need to have a passion and genuine interest. There\u2019s room to cultivate a love for reading you didn\u2019t know you were capable of, though. Explore genres and find what you really love. You have a whole year to find what creates a spark in you.  Summary Reading is honestly magical. Within hours you can consume knowledge that took researchers decades to obtain. You can be transported to a remote village across the world. You can traverse divides between you and those you\u2019ve never understood. And with these tips, you can enjoy even more of this magic.
