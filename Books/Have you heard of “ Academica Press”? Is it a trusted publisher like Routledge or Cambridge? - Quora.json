            "answer_text": "Routledge and Cambridge University Press are two of the most prestigious academic publishers. Having a monograph published by either of them would be a useful step towards promotion or tenure in most universities, particularly in the humanities (scientific disciplines tend to value journal articles rather than monographs). Academica Press does not have anything like that level of prestige. But, from what I can gather here, https://www.chronicle.com/forums/index.php?topic=66682.0, it is not a vanity press either. It is probably not difficult to get a book published by Academica, but if you did so, there would be a chance that some university libraries would buy a copy, and maybe even that the book would be reviewed in a few specialist journals. On the page I\u2019ve just cited, Academica Press is compared to Cambridge Scholars Press - which is not to be confused with Cambridge University Press. I just wrote a review of a book published by Cambridge Scholars Press for an academic journal - so publication with a publisher on that level can attract some attention to your work, yay! The book was mediocre, and I gave it a poor review, making a mental note to steer clear of that publishing house in future. Boo! ",
