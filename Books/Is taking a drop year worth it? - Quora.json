If your rank will jump from 1,00,000 to 1,000 it will be worth(just an example) . It is very difficult to take a year drop(talking about jee aspirants) . It takes your effort of one year which you could have applied somewhere else, it takes one year tution fee from you, it takes away your confidence , it takes away all your pleasures, all your enjoyment, even your friends and in return gives you nothing other than frustration. You will see your friends joining prestigious institutes and uploading pics of their new college life. It will frustrate you but will leave a spark in you- to get even a better college than them! You will deactivate your social media accounts, loose contacts from all your friends saying that you will see them after one year, sit in a room and just focus on your goal. So the question was , is dropping a year worth ? NO ! Just think , you give one year of your life and you have to sacrifice what not! It's not even sure that you would excel- the statistics says so. Don't you think that you can utilize this one year somewhere else. But\u2026..what if you really land with a good rank! What if your rank comes within 1000 ? Don't you think it will be worth! Dear readers, just aspire to be great! And you will be one day. If you have the confidence that you can do wonders, go ahead! Winners always have to take risk. What matters is how you will achieve a good rank. It really doesn't matter how you did it, whether you dropped a year or not. Remember , if you will land safely, nobody not even you will think of your crucial one year. What if your friends will be your senior? Stay positive! You will still be friends. Moreover, if they will be one year ahead to you, you will learn from their mistakes and try not to repeat it in future. Just focus on your goal. Leave the rest! Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": " I am glad you are asking this question! At-least someone is asking it before taking such a step. Taking a drop is a crucial decision and many people tend to take in haste without thinking of the consequences. I am not saying that it is not worth it. Sometimes, one must take a break to take life in the right direction but take it only if necessary. Don\u2019t make it an excuse to escape from your present realities. Escape is never a solution for anything. One must face the problems to get a proper solution. You can refer this blog to get clarity on this question. It is well-organised and offers multiple options on what you can do. Moreover, it states the reality i.e., Pros and Cons of the taking a drop. This will help you gain better insight before making a firm decision. Is taking a drop worth it? Thank you! ",
