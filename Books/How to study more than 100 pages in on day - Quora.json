            "answer_text": "It depends on your studying pace. If you never studied over 50 pages a day how can you possible study 100 pages like you try to run 1000m but never run over 500meters. So now you have two tactics one for that you might get close to 1000m and try to accomplish a better running result that is within your range and another is you try to accomplish MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. The key of first tactic is to follow the traditional method like others mention but in a very refreshed spirit. You may study after a sound sleep and maybe even have a REDBULL to break the record. Never study in tired condition that means reduce distractions as many as possible and stay only with the study. Secord tactic is all about creating shortcuts to accomplish the 1000ms. Read the book into a novel. Create stories with timelines for the content. Like you are watching a movie in your mind and make it as vivid as possible. Like growing a tree and add branches and leafs as the content move on. At the end you will have a big tree in your mind and then try to read through all the content like you refresh the pages. You need some memorizing technics to do that. ",

            "answer_text": "Look through the pages quickly, reading the words very quickly and underlining details or important facts you might think will come on a test. Remember vocabulary is important so if you see words you don't understand, write them down and find the definition.If it is a book, you can either listen to the audiobook online or find a summary onlineIf it is on a specific subject, like physics, I recommend watching youtube video\u2019s summarising and explaining the main points in physics.Time management is key in big subjects, so I hope next time you remember to read maybe 10 pages a day a couple weeks before your exam and also taking notes. This usually is stress-free and takes less than 30 minutes a day.DONT GO TO SLEEP TO LATE. Health is important while studying. If you eat healthily and drink water while studying it will help you out. Maybe not the first time but if you keep doing it you will see a difference. Caffeine is not the best thing if you are low on energy. I recommend eating a bowl of fruit (apples especially) and cold water.",
