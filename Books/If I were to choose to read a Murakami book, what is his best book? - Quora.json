            "answer_text": "I would say that it really depends on your disposition. Murakami's books are incredibly consistent in that they all have the same alienated-lost-soul-je ne sais quoi quality about them that makes them so memorable to readers. But each book is still new and interesting in its own way because of the assortment of themes he likes to overlay -- it's difficult to convey without having actually read his books. If you want a primer on Murakami and his style of writing, I would recommend Pinball, 1973, South of the Border, West of the Sun, and/or A Wild Sheep Chase. If you're feeling particularly lonely or detached, try Sputnik Sweetheart and/or Norwegian Wood. If you want something a little more thoughtful and complex, try Hard-Boiled Wonderland & the End of the World, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and/or Kafka on the Shore. ",

As Mike said, \"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\" is too hard and complicated to understand because of too many un-solved mystery.After reading all his books, I still dont get it.  If you like a short novel, I would like to recommend; \"A Slow Boat to China\"\"The Second Bakery Attack\"\"The Elephant Vanishes\" \"The Silence\"\"All God's Children Can Dance\"\"Super-Frog Saves Tokyo \" Last 2 short novels were written after the big EQ (1994) in Kobe where he grew up. After 3.11 EQ in Japan, I re-read these novels many times.  Finally, my advice is same as Mike. Please read all his book. we can discuss about it someday. ",
