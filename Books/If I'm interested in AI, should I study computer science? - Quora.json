            "answer_text": "Don't worry, most undergrad curricula for computer science don't even involve much AI. If you want to learn about AI, I think the best thing to do would be to learn on your own. AI is a very broad field. If it's something that interests you, then I recommend starting by reading a book that surveys the areas within AI. Find that area that really sparks your interest, and  then use your knowledge to make cool projects! Here's a good collection of books that you can read online.http://www.onlineprogrammingbooks.com/ai-and-robotics/ I also highly recommend learning a bit about machine learning. It's the future. It's useful nearly everywhere, and is a great thing to be familiar with when looking for a job. I personally learned the basics through Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera, and then I later moved on to doing things in python with scikit-learn/pybrain and playing with data sets on kaggle. I think this is a great way to learn about the breadth of algorithms and start taking off the training wheels. ",
