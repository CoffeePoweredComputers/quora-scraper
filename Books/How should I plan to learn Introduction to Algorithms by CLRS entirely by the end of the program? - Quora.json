            "answer_text": "The answer assumes that the Bachelor's Program is in the discipline of Computer Science. Here is what I think can be a good plan. You will surely get enough time to read this book. But here is what I think will add to your experience and ease the learning process 1) Brush up the basic mathematics, some calculus and linear algebra.2) Brush up discrete mathematics (Discrete Mathematics by Kenneth H Rosen is a good book)3) Make yourself comfortable with some programming language, like C, C++ or Java (a scripting language will suffice for most of the cases if not all) Once you are done with the above, you can follow some advice from my answers here : Dharmendra Prasad's answer to I just bought \u201cCLRS\u201d. What's the best way to obtain the knowledge this book offers?Dharmendra Prasad's answer to How many people have read \"Introduction to Algorithms\" cover to cover? Would you recommend reading this book cover to cover? What are some suggestions for someone who is about to begin?Dharmendra Prasad's answer to I am a person with an average amount of intelligence. Is it possible for me to learn algorithms from the CLRS book? ",
