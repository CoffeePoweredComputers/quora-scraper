            "answer_text": "I realised how interesting this question is only when I heard my inner voice say: \u201chow obvious, of course it does\u2026\u201d But wait. Does it really? Countless online business coaches and productivity gurus tell you that reading increases IQ, right? Look at Warren Buffet, right? He reads a lot and he is successful, so it must be true, right? Buckle up, ladies and gentleman, it is time for peer-reviewed and evidence based no bullshit science!  Imagine you asked many people about their reading habits and then measured their IQ. This is the evidence that has long been produced in research with various results. For example, Frank Smith\u2019s famous claim \"Literacy doesn't generate finer feelings or higher values. It doesn't even make anyone smarter\" (1989, p. 354) goes very much against what we all hope to hear. Luckily, there is more research with brighter results. Stanovich (1993), for example, states \u201c[i]f \"smarter\" means having a larger vocabulary and more world knowledge in addition to the abstract reasoning skills encompassed within the concept of intelligence, as it does in most laymen's definitions of intelligence (Stanovich, 1989; Sternberg, 1990), then reading may well make people smarter.\u201d Let me tell you why this is a really tricky question to answer in the first place. It has to do with two main problems: causal ordering and measurement. Bear with me for a moment, I promise, there will be an answer in the end. Lets first talk about the problem of causality. What is rather tricky is the implicit causality in the question we are asking: Does reading improve IQ? So, if I read more, will I be smarter? Suppose that we repeatedly find that reading is highly correlated with IQ. Does that mean that reading will make you smarter? It might, but not necessarily\u2026 The problem here is with the statistical evidence that we use to back our claims. Correlation itself is not enough to prove causation. Suppose you would be asking a different question: Do smart people read more? and you would find, again, a strong correlation between reading frequency and IQ. Does that mean that smart people read more or that reading improves your IQ? I hope you get where I am heading. Correlation is not causation.  How can this be solved? In an absolutely ideal scenario, you would take a random sample of people and randomly split them into two groups. This is routinely done in randomised clinical trials (RCTs) that are used for drug trials and are considered the golden standard to establish causal effects.  Having split the sample into two groups, you would introduce a manipulation (treatment)\u2014prohibit one group from reading and command the other group to read regularly. After some time, you would measure the difference between groups\u2019 average IQs. Since people were allocated randomly into both groups, at the initial point the groups were equal in their average IQ. Both groups had the same probability to contain geniuses and idiots\u2014people whose IQ can be improving, stagnating, or degenerating (this equality can and should be verified to be sure that the groups are as equal as possible on all the observable characteristics). The only difference between the groups is therefore your intervention (treatment)\u2014reading or not reading\u2014and thus you can claim that the difference in IQ was caused by reading. However, and here is the trick!, in real life, we cannot command people to read or stop reading, and even if we tried, they would possibly do as they like. Therefore we are bound to observational studies\u2014those that do not try to change anything about people\u2019s behaviour, but rather rely on observation to get as close as possible to the RCT setting. The causality can then be reached by using longitudinal panel data\u2014data measuring the same people several times and see if their decision to start reading more increased their intelligence later in their life. Something like this has been done by Ritchie, Bates, and Plomin (2014), however instead of focusing on the adult population, they worked with children age 7\u201316. To get rid of the influence of other genetic and environmental characteristics, they worked with identical (monozygotic) twins. The idea was the following: Since these twins were raised in the same environment and had the same genetic predisposition, would early adopters in reading experience a higher boost in intelligence later in life? And they conclude, \u201c[i]n a longitudinal analysis of cognitive development in monozygotic twins, assessed in five waves from ages 7 to 16, we found support for this hypothesis. Twins with better earlier reading ability compared to their identical cotwin tended not only to have better reading at subsequent measurements but also higher scores on general intelligence tests.\u201d and \u201c[w]e also found that the associations are not restricted to possible effects of reading on the verbal domain\u2014mainly affecting vocabulary and general knowledge\u2014but extend to associations of reading with nonverbal intelligence\u201d (Ritchie, Bates & Plomin, 2014). The same data was later reanalysed by Bailey and Littlefield (2016) by the means of different statistical models in order to check the robustness of the conclusions. They state, \u201c[r]eplicating the findings of RBP's previous analysis using the cross-lagged panel regression model on the same data set, we found that previous reading ability predicted later IQ consistently across development. However, we found that the model exhibited poor fit to the data. The state\u2013trait model [the new model they have used] fit the data very well but showed less evidence for effects of individual differences in children's environmentally caused reading ability on their later intelligence.\u201d (Bailey & Littlefield, 2016) So, yes, recent evidence suggests that reading can really improve your intelligence\u2026 at the age 7\u201316. Do we have reasons to believe this could be generalized to the whole population? Development of cognitive abilities of children will certainly differ from those of adults. Not only are they more open-minded to learn and try new things, but also they go through much more hands-on experience and trial-and-error. If there is \u2018anything\u2019 that kids have (i.e. open-mindedness) and we as adults don\u2019t, this can invalidate the generalisability of these findings to the whole population. Nonetheless, there is pretty solid statistical evidence that early in your life, reading can help you improve your intelligence later on. Nonetheless, there is another problem. Any effort to measure these elusive concepts such as intelligence, smartness, etc. will necessarily be challenged by its measurement. There are millions of intelligence tests out there\u2014which one is the right one? The one with more abstract questions about shapes, or the one with more verbal puzzles? This is why researchers very often differentiate the effect of reading on different aspects of intelligence: emotional, verbal, nonverbal\u2026 And this allows us to distinguish the most consistent effects out there. Recently published results of several experiments by Kidd and Castano investigate the effect of reading literary fiction and non-fiction on \u201cthe human capacity to comprehend that other people hold beliefs and desires and that these may differ from one's own beliefs and desires\u201d (2013, Abstract). Some may claim that this is not intelligence per se, but what else makes us more distinct as humans than our ability of empathy, cooperation, and socialisation? The results consistently show that \u201creading passages of literary fiction, in comparison to nonfiction or popular fiction, does indeed enhance the reader's performance on [such] tasks.\u201d All in all, what do we make out of it? The statistical evidence suggests that reading early in life helps immensely not only with verbal abilities and emotional intelligence, but also with abstract reasoning. Later, experimental evidence by Kidd and Castano (2013) provides evidence that reading fiction is pretty good for your emotional intelligence and empathy. If I were to make a judgment call, I would say that reading makes you smarter. Not only because of the evidence provided above, but also because you expose yourself to different perspectives and thought processes of the authors. You absorb how other people think, their heuristics, which helps you solve similar problems later in your life. These \u2018skills\u2019 might be hard to measure, but I personally find them as very possible outcomes of reading based on my personal experience. Moreover, reading requires patience and undivided attention. Practicing these skills often will spillover to other spheres of your mental achievement. No doubt, my friends, reading is good for you\u2014be it your intelligence, outlook, or empathy. Happy reading!

            "answer_text": "IQ is usually measured using a two part test. One part is verbal, and the other part is performance related. Here is a list of what is measured on the verbal part of the test, which I have taken from IQ Test | Encyclopedia of Psychology : \u201cVerbal scales Information: 29 questions \u2013 a measure of general knowledge.Digit Span: Subjects are given sets of digits to repeat initially forwards then backwards. This is a test of immediate auditory recall and freedom from distraction.Vocabulary: Define 35 words. A measure of expressive word knowledge. It correlates very highly with Full Scale IQArithmetic: 14 mental arithmetic brief story type problems. tests distractibility as well as numerical reasoning.Comprehension: 16 questions which focus on issues of social awareness.Similarities: A measure of concept formation. Subjects are asked to say how two seemingly dissimilar items might in fact be similar.\u201dIn my opinion well-chosen novels could improve your general knowledge. You would need to read historical fiction, technology-based science fiction, or fiction set in different locations around the globe for this to work. Reading novels could certainly increase your word knowledge, but only if you conscientiously look up those you are even slightly unsure of. No cheating and expecting the context to reveal the meaning to you. Comprehension and social awareness might also be enhanced by reading novels. In order to gain this benefit you would need to think as you read, asking yourself questions such as, \u201cWhy has this character said this? If I said this to a friend of mine, how would they react? How might a different friend react?\u201d or \u201cWhat would this character\u2019s facial expression be like at this moment?\u201d and so on. However, having an interest in reading in these ways is probably a marker for a high IQ in the first place, which is why these methods are used to assess it. Does it really matter? Why not just be yourself and accept that you are good enough as you are? Emotional intelligence is important too, you know. ",

            "answer_text": "IQ is perceived as natural intellegence, partially biological, genetic and a result of your early upbringing. I\u2019m a bit above average but definitely no genius. To describe IQ, I use cars as a metaphor. Say, your friend who has rich parents, gifts him with a new Lamborghini, while all you can afford is a used Honda Civic. When pitting the two cars in a race there is no question that the Lamborghini will leave you in the dust. Here is the kicker though. Realizing that you still love your car, you take care of it by regular maintenence, oil changes, and eventually decide to customize it by adding performance parts and transforming it into a new badass rice burner. Your friend, on the other hand, does not maintain his Lamborgini, runs it into the ground, and is left with a pile of junk. It still may run, have speed , and can still beat your jacked up Honda, but it will not be as easy since your car performs better than it previously did while your friend did nothing to improve his. You can definitley improve mental ability by constantly reading, exercizing, good nutrition, and by exposing yourself to new knowledge, new experiences, and learning new skills. Having known several \u201cgeniuses\u201d in my lifetime, I can definitely attest to the fact that IQ alone has no bearing on one\u2019s happiness or sucess in life.

            "answer_text": "In a way it can increase your score on an IQ test, but it may not strictly increase your intelligence. However, reading does have a positive impact on your knowledge. Several IQ tests incorporate vocabulary components in them; not strictly your knowledge of words, but your understanding of concepts. Having a higher level of contact with more complicated words is likely to produce positive effects on how well you score on these tasks. It\u2019s a little difficult giving examples of how this occurs without also providing insight into the testing material. But seeing as any number of people here have had an IQ test done, I\u2019ll describe things in a way that anyone who has done the tests will be familiar with; and could describe as well. You might be asked to describe an object or concept, such as \u201cwhat is a wallet?\u201d or \u201cwhat is weather?\u201d. You may also be asked to describe how two terms are alike, and as the material gets more challenging, you may struggle to find similarities. Answering \u201cin what ways are the beach and the desert alike?\u201d may seems pretty straight forward, but when you start being asked questions like \u201cin what ways are discrete and overt alike?\u201d, most people are likely to have difficulty answering with confidence; particularly when there are multiple (correct) answers that may be necessary for full points and when the concepts appear to be opposites. This is to say that people may know the words, but may lack enough knowledge or insight to properly explain the similarities. Also, it should go without saying that I\u2019ve made up these questions (there are correct answers, as far as my understanding goes); you wont find these in IQ tests. ",

Because IQ is a very restricted measure, but what people perceive as intelligence comes from a whole multitude of factors. I read \u2026 A LOT. Because of this I have a vast amount of borrowed experience \u2026 I have lived other people\u2019s lives, I have been inside their minds. I have been exposed to a lot of different knowledge sets, I have been buffed and burnished by many different perspectives. Because of this, I SEEM to others to be a very deep thinker, I\u2019m not really \u2026 but only my innate honesty compels me to say so \u2026 I\u2019d actually prefer people to think me the genius I\u2019m not. Can reading increase IQ? That\u2019s debatable \u2026 but an average IQ person who\u2019s well read and has actually thought about what they\u2019ve read can out-perform a high IQ person who\u2019s mentally lazy (and I know a few of those!) So, in the end \u2026 who cares. Reading WILL help you in life, even if it\u2019s not by increasing your IQ. ",

You\u2019ve mastered talking in that language, however, you don\u2019t know how to read it or write it. By taking baby steps in reading in that language, you increase your familiarity with the patterns in the language, the tones of the language, and increase your fluency by reading aloud. As you continue reading aloud in that foreign language, you eventually start to interpret the language faster and the meanings buried within each word or sentence that you can easily say it aloud in your mind as fluently as if you were speaking it. By reading, you also gain knowledge to whatever it is that you like to read. It doesn\u2019t matter if the books you\u2019ve read are fiction, sci-fi, romance, etc. you can learn anything from reading books such as how an author catches the reader\u2019s attention to how and author creates a string of words that are considered to be best selling or an enjoyable book.

Intelligence simply defined is your ability to adopt to new things/environment. The faster you do the intelligent you are. If you are asking that if reading books will able to you score higher on a IQ scale then it is highly unlikely, it is like asking if eating bananas will make you taller. Bananas are good for health but they, in no possible way make you taller or shorter. Similarly book reading is good for you as it will improve your knowledge and understanding of things but it won't raise your IQ. IQ is genetic, it is pre determined. A huge circle of experts believe that intelligence is too diverse to be calculated by tests and given a specific number. Stop worrying about IQ and just remember reading will make you better in every possible way, just bank on that. ",

See IQ is a measurement of how you apply knowledge. Without any knowledge your IQ would be near zero. Reading can, of course help gaining knowledge. If you can apply this knowledge to solve puzzles, issues, problems, then, it could help your IQ score. For example An IQ test could have the question of writing down the next number in sequence. 1, 4, 9, 16,\u2026 This is of course simply the quadrate of the numbers 1 to 4, so the next should be 5^2=25. However, therefor you need to have the knowledge of quadratic numbers actually being a thing, or you will never hbe able to solve the question. Reading about quadratic numbers will gain that knowledge to be able to solve the question. IQ rather is knowing with the above example you could also solve 168, 195, 224, 255, \u2026 With the number 288. ",

The reason is that IQ is, by definition, your score on an IQ test, and these tests often (though not always) contain questions involving language. By practicing your understanding of language, you thereby increase your IQ. Of course, the best way to increase your IQ is to take a lot of IQ tests; any successful student knows that test prep makes a big difference on standardized tests, because it displaces the challenge of the test from figuring out the questions to figuring out their answers. If you\u2019re asking this because you\u2019re wondering whether you should read more, let me propose that if the only benefit you derive from reading is being able to fill in sentences and make word analogies on a test, then you are doing it wrong. Reading increases your expressiveness, it stimulates your imagination, it encourages you to explore intangible ideas about people and times and societies, it gives you the opportunity to challenge implicit assertions and assumptions both in yourself and in the text. Find me an IQ test that can put a score on those things. ",

I also, when reading self-test and brain-teaser books, pushed myself to be able to do them.

Because, on one hand, reading improves the cognitive processing by activating your brain and keeping it \u201cfresh\u201d, but overdoing it, can cause laziness in terms of thinking patterns. It completely depends on, how you do with the reading. I mean, we have to consider, do we convolute the information, do we transform it - do we, further process it.. It\u2019s, kind of a hard thing to really accentuate in terms of, \u201cDoes it strictly increase IQ\u201d. And, besides that, just reading, is in of itself benefitial in terms of, you know, gaining knowledge. Gaining knowledge, will always be important regardless of your IQ, really. I mean, that\u2019s, that\u2019s the fundamental basis of doing research in some forms, you know. But it\u2019s about: What do you read How do you use it Just, reading fiction or what not - won\u2019t really do much, in the long run, if you do strictly that, to the point of overdoing it. But otherwise, i think it\u2019s definitly healthy. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the amount of reading. If one is already a prolific reader, then the test subject is already applying obtained/learned knowledge to abilities. If one does not read (obtain learned knowledge) and decides to become a prolific reader, then, yes, IQ would go up. Here is the thing \u2014 each person is born with innate abilities. You see it all the time in sports where you can witness this happen physically. Those who add to their innate abilities physical strength training, muscle memory, and practice to perfect. Tiger Woods, for example, showed abilities as a 2 year-old. But, it was his years of practice and training that turned him into one of golf\u2019s finest athletes. With intelligence, each of us has whatever our genes provided as innate abilities of intelligence. But, without obtaining learned knowledge \u2014 observing as a baby/toddler, education and devotion to learning \u2014 provides data for your innate abilities to process. The more data available, the more intelligent. So, when can intelligence increase? When the test subject is able to increase data faster than their age reduces their expected increase of data (that is, just living day-to-day you learn new things). Since IQ is mental ability divided by physical age, you have to keep up with age. For example, a 20 year-old will have to achieve twice the mental result as a 10 year-old \u2014 20 year-old = IQ100 = mental score 2000 / 20 = IQ10010 year-old = IQ100 = mental score 1000/ 10 = IQ100",

But in the knowledge subtest, it would help to know historical figures and some basic science facts. However, you don\u2019t know which historical figures they will ask you about or what scientific questions. You would need to read relatively prolifically and then retain those details, and all on the off chance that you get your IQ tested. The knowledge subtest doesn\u2019t necessarily test your general knowledge but your long term memory - ie your ability to recall information. So read all you want, but if you can\u2019t retain information and recall that information at a later date, no amount of reading will make a difference. ",
