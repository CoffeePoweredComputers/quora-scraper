            "answer_text": "Some that I like: Motif Investing \u2013 A truly unique and innovative approach to investing. Motif allows investors to build their own \u201cfunds.\u201d This essentially means that you can buy a wider variety of stock for far less expense and effort than any other investing platform. I think this is a great platform, particularly for someone who wants low maintenance investing. Fidelity Investing \u2013 Fidelity is a staple platform that has been around for years. They have a quality user interface, helpful support staff, and reasonable costs at $7.95/trade. Fidelity also offers a robust amount of resources to help in investing education and research. TradeKing \u2013 TradeKing is a great platform as well. The user interface is very simple to use and the costs are about as cheap as you will find. TradeKing may not have the same breadth of resource support as Fidelity, but they only charge $4.95/trade. OptionsHouse \u2013 Like TradeKing, OptionsHouse offers some of the lowest cost trades available at $4.95 each. Their trading platform made Barron\u2019s \u201cBest of Online Brokers\u201d list with 4.5 stars. Barron\u2019s has also selecting them as the platform \u201cBest for Options Traders\u201d for six consecutive years. Hope this helps. I am happy to answer follow-up questions.
