            "answer_text": "No, the Bible is meant to be read, and not necessarily in any particular order, but it will be difficult to understand without the Holy Spirit residing inside of you. For those of us who have a working knowledge of the Christian faith, we know that without being \u2018saved\u2019 the Bible is not easily discerned. In order for anyone to be \u2018saved\u2019 they must ask Christ (in the form of the Holy Spirit) to come and take-up residence in their life. Growing up in a Baptist church preachers boldly told you about Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit (the Trinity). Three individual personalities wrapped in one unifying body (Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost). What I didn\u2019t learn or understand was how they operated\u2014 together and individually. With two children and two divorces behind me, I knew, I was in need of a locale change. At the insistence of a friend, we packed all of our belongings and moved from Detroit, Michigan to Oakland, CA., (the year was 1976). It didn\u2019t take long for me to landed a job with Parks and Recreation which was housed on beautiful Lake Merritt. What impressed me the most about the workplace atmosphere was employees were allowed to read at their desk during their free-time and a shower was available for those of us who wanted to run the lake. One day I noticed the receptionist reading a Bible while sitting a her desk. I asked her how was she able to understand what she was reading. You see, I had found a Bible laying in the street a few months previously, and it was impossible for me to read it with any clarity. She said, \u201cThe Holy Spirit was guiding her.\u201d Immediately I knew I wanted what she had. Today, I know for certain that that encounter was a divine appointment. I was being drawn supernaturally into an everlasting relationship with Jesus Christ. From that moment on, Christians seemed to appear out of nowhere. They began feeding my soul with knowledge and understanding of who Jesus was and how He operated in our lives. The Bible is an amazing book, perhaps one of the most fascinating books ever written. It is filled-to-overflowing with nuggets to help us live more productive lives. A book that I can only absorb in small pieces because it is rich and powerfully life changing. Only small doses for me \u2014 it is meant to last a lifetime. ",

            "answer_text": "One can be forgiven for thinking religion and God are friends. I mean, religion tells us so. But what if it's not true? Many believers have come to the conclusion that \u201cGod hates religion\u201d. There is even a website with that name. GodHatesReligion .org .au Religion says salvation is EARNED. The gospel says salvation is IMPUTED as a FREE GIFT. Religion says a right and clean standing with God is EARNED. The gospel says a right and clean standing with God is IMPUTED as a FREE GIFT. Religion says study or read the Bible. God says study or read the Bible's message \u2013 the liberating gospel. The outcomes are very different. Here's just one of many pictures of this. 86% of American Christians have attitudes and/or actions that are more like the Pharisees than like Jesus (Barna, 2013). A gospel-focus changes everything. Here's how you can \u2018read\u2019 your Bible in 30 minutes and get the self-righteous \u201cgnat straining\u201d \u201ccamel gulping\u201d Pharisees' nickers in a knot: Use a tool like BibleGateway dot com, or BibleHub dot com, or the YouVersion Bible app.Search for these words or phrases in your Bible translation: gospel, \u201cgood news\u201d, \u201cglad tidings\u201d, \u201cgood tidings\" and \u201cnew covenant\u201d.Highlight or mark each occurrenceTally up the total hits for each book of the Bible, and make a total (should be about 100 to 150)Make a total for the books written by PaulYou have just made a great start in un-redacting the gospel message. Religion invests huge resources to redact, ignore and contradict the liberating gospel message. Bear in mind there is nothing religion secretly fears, hates and opposes more than the un-redacted liberating, enlightening, and empowering gospel message. How so? The first mention of the gospel is called the protoevangelium or protevangelium. It is the first written death sentence against religion: Genesis 3:15, Matthew 23 esp v15, John 8:44, Galatians 3, and Revelation 18. Also the religious empire is nothing without adherents. And the gospel message was specifically designed to set us free from religion. Jesus came to set us free from religion. Religion cannot tolerate people finding and following the real Jesus. That is why each religion fashions a counterfeit Jesus (or messiah) in their image. One religion claims that (their) Jesus did an inspection of all religions in 1919 and appointed them as the only true religion over the whole earth. Only their adherents now regard their own teachings back then to be apostasy today. And here's the kicker. Until 1950 they taught that \u201call religion is a snare and a racket\u201d. You can't make this stuff up! So we have a choice: \u201creligion vs the gospel\u201d. As the grail knight in \u201cThe Last Crusade\u201d warns: \u201cchoose wisely\u201d. ",
