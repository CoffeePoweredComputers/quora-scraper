            "answer_text": "Benefits? This is somewhat a multi-faceted question. From a brain point of view, a physical book (not electronic reader) seems to allow the brain to process information in a more complete and permanent way. Much like cursive writing, reading a physical book seems to imprint information in multiple sections of the brain. Reading and the Brain Reading Fiction Improves Brain Connectivity and Function From a more esthetic point of view, each is not inherently superior. Each does certain things very well, and other things less well. Let\u2019s look a three quick things: The Car Chase: one of the most fun things in film. Cars and their drivers perform feats obviously impossible to survive, but it sure is fun to watch. Action events like car stunts and gunfights are perfect for the visual. In a book, the description of a car chase can be like watching paint dry.The Lover: the man is looking at a picture of his wife, or late wife, or someone else\u2019s wife, whatever. In a movie, it\u2019s a guy looking at a picture. Music helps, but an actor can only carry the scene for a moment before boredom sets in. In a book, however, this scene can go over the history, the controversy, the pain and suffering. A talented writer can wax eloquent for a good while on a man sitting doing nothing.Stephen King: his most successful movies are non-horror work (Stand By Me, Shawshank Redemption, etc). Odd for a writer known for his horror work. It\u2019s pretty simple, actually. Read a King horror story, and his ability to create fear in the mind goes far beyond anything a moviemaker can film. The \u201cmonster\u201d is almost always disappointing to anyone who read the book.For me, the book is always a greater pleasure. But a well-crafted film is a wonder to behold. We can even toss in television, at least over the last 2 decades. Enjoy them both, each has its strengths. ",

            "answer_text": "Movies are always going to be an impression of the producer and director\u2019s interpretation of a screenplay that is based on a novel. To my mind, one of the best examples to illustrate the importance of reading a book over watching a movie is the Twilight series. I love the books and thoroughly enjoy the movies. However, some of the acting doesn\u2019t make sense if you haven\u2019t read the books. I\u2019ve heard criticism levelled at the actors for this, but it\u2019s not entirely their fault. Stephanie Meyer has long sections of text where she explains what\u2019s happening, what a setting looks like, what\u2019s going on inside a character\u2019s mind. This is especially true of Bella. Too little of her dialogue or scenes that involve her portray any real emotion within the novel. We\u2019re told way too much. This means that neither the screenwriter nor the actress had any substance to work with. Relying on the movie creates an image of wooden characters who over-act or behave in a way that just doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026 all because Bella\u2019s internal monologues just don\u2019t translate to something that a screenwriter could turn into meaningful action. As another example, there are things that happen in the Harry Potter books that just don\u2019t make sense to people who have only watched the movies. JK Rowling included scenes which did not make it into the final films. As a result, parts of the films make no sense because they miss the bits that explain why characters make particular decisions\u2026 all for reasons I don\u2019t really understand because I\u2019ve no experience in the film industry. That said, the Twilight and Harry Potter films do a good job of showing the story the respective authors invested a great deal of time and effort creating for our enjoyment. ",
