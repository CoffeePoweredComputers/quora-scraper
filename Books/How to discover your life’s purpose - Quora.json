            "answer_text": "You can discover your life's purpose by looking up the environment around you and where you currently are in life. For me this included looking at my family history of being in the police force. Thankfully I have managed to get to an academic standpoint where I am qualified to follow the same route as thoes members of my family. I've been wanting to do policing as a child, now as an adult I am able to fulfill my life purpose by following that goal. Whe truth is what people don't seem to realise about \u2018life's purpose'. It's not always to be the greatest, or to be the most successful, the most handsome, and the richest person you can be. Discovering your life's purpose is all about giving your life purpose. I know how silly that may sound but in layman's terms, that means doing whatever you feel is right, with your life. The easiest way to discover this is by realising that you only have one life and the possibility of they're being a life after death is very thin. Take this information and use the time that you have on this earth, spent doing whatever you want. Do you want to spend your life doing your childhood dream career. Go ahead! do you want to rewatch all the episodes of breaking bad whenever you can because you enjoy the show so much? Do it! Do you enjoy smoking marijuana often. I'd say go ahead and do it. As long as you aren't being destructive to yourself or hurting others, I think the best thing you could do is whatever you want, and to see where life takes you from there. That is how you discover your life's purpose. ",
