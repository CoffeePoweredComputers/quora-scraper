            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not really possible to say which is easier as there are many styles of playing for both 5 string and 4 string banjos. Here\u2019s a quick summary. 4 string tenor banjo Early Jazz accompaniment using frequent chord changes. Sometimes the strumming can be quite complex and be interspersed with single string playing. I don\u2019t play this style but I\u2019d guess it\u2019s quite difficult. At the very least a good knowledge of chords all over the neck would be necessary. The tuning is CGDA.Single string mostly first position melody playing, as used in Irish dance music. No chordal knowledge necessary, but fast single string picking required, especially for reels. Also the repertoire is large, and the banjoist will often want to try to ornament the melody by playing fast three note triplets at various points to give the tune an extra rhythmic kick. Since these must be picked with the plectrum (pick) rather than produced with the left hand, this ornamentation is quite difficult to do at speed.5 string tenor banjo Traditional American playing styles, including frailing and other fingerpicking sequences. (Frailing is, I believe, a special type of fingerpicking where during part of the sequence the finger sounds the string with a downward motion). I don\u2019t do this but I do fingerpick the guitar and my guess is that once you\u2019ve mastered the sequence, it\u2019s probably quite easy to apply the various patterns to many songs. However, the banjoist playing this style can also play fast dance tunes and to do so must incorporate left hand articulations to play some of the notes (hammer-ons and pull-offs). I\u2019d imagine this is pretty tricky. Also banjo players playing in this style often use many different tunings.Bluegrass style banjo. This is a fingerpicking style incorporating rolls. These are frequent three note sequences (not triplets), that can give a very distinctive feel to the music. I don\u2019t play this style, but I think once one has learned the many possible rolls and develops a feel for combining them, they can be applied to almost all bluegrass songs. But I think getting a good feel for the rolls is probably quite difficult. Because the continuous stream of notes is produced by three fingers (thumb, first, and second, usually wearing fingerpicks), bluegrass banjo players can play very fast with greater ease than, say, a tenor banjo player (or mandolinist) who has to drive a single plectrum (pick) through the string(s) for every note. One downside of bluegrass banjo is that it\u2019s difficult using rolls to play many dance tunes note for note, and indeed bluegrass banjo player using this style often approximate the melody when playing dance tunes. But some players do manage to follow the melody exactly (like a fiddle or tenor banjo), by employing techniques that I think have now become part of the playing style of bluegrass banjo. Simply from watching players play in this style (exact note for note renditions of fast dance tunes), makes me think this is extremely difficult.",

            "answer_text": "Played in a basic way they are about the same. But both have their own challenges. As others have stated it mainly depends on the type of music you want to play. In my case I play 5 string standard and 4 string tenor. I use the 5 for Bluegrass ( 3 finger picking with picks) and Old Time Country ( \u2018Clawhammer\u2019 or down picking) The tenor I use in \u2018Irish\u2019 tuning (tuned GDAe an octave below the mandolin or fiddle) played with a plectrum or \u2018flat pick\u2019. For Bluegrass one needs a reasonable collection of chords (mainly in open G tuning) , several thumb and 2 finger \u2018rolls\u2019 (picking patterns) and several licks\u2019. Fingerpicks are used for volume and precision especially at speed and are used by most bluegrassers. It takes discipline and practice to master these. Timing and syncopation are very important. Melodically the style is mostly fairly basic and consists mainly of simple melodies (such as in a song) surrounded by lots of arpeggios in a chord for color and sound. Many instrumentals are built around chord progressions with licks. To play intricate melodies with 3 fingers can be tricky as you are crossing the strings from one finger to the next. This produces a smooth \u2018bell like\u2019 quality but the technique is quite different from straight Bluegrass or \u201cScruggs style . The pure melodic technique is called \u2018Keith\u2019 style after Bill Keith who developed it in the 1960s.The bluegrass style has both a \u2018lead \u2018 component for soloing and a backup chord style for comping. It is mostly played with others.The 5 string in old time style is perhaps more suited to Folk or old Country music. It\u2019s great for solo playing and singing as it provides its own accompaniment. The right hand picks in a downward motion hitting the strings with the back of the finger nail while the thumb plays the high 5th string mainly on off beats. It is primarily rhythmic with simple chords. Once you\u2019ve got on top of the picking technique (which can take some practice) it can be a very enjoyable and rewarding style. Great for playing by yourself or jamming with others.The 4 string Tenor banjo (GDAe) with it\u2019s shorter neck and tuning is ideally suited to melody playing as well as chords. It\u2019s ideal for flat picking Jigs and Reels, Hornpipes etc in the Celtic style and a lot of fun at Pub Jam sessions. It\u2019s mostly built around scales and fast flat picking ( with a plectrum). The basic tunes can be straight forward but the Irish\u201d style has a lot of ornaments eg triplets like the pipes. This requires a lot of practice and the key is timing and not trying to play too fast at first. There are a lot of tunes online in mandolin Tablature as the tuning is basically the same. The banjo is an octave lower.The key to playing these styles is Practice\u2026..lots of it, listen \u2026.a lot and watch others and get some lessons. A teacher can be best but there\u2019s some good stuff onlineAbove all, have FUN. The banjo is a \u2018Happy\u2019 instrument. ",
