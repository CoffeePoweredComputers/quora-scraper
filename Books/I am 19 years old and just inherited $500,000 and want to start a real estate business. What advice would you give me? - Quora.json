            "answer_text": "Best advice I would give you: Can you start this business without investing any of the money? If you can, then you have a real business. Use the $500,000 and invest it, but in future you and not your business. Real estate is a great investment. So are dividend stocks (I have a soft spot for Cash Flow Investments). If you are thinking of investing in real estate by acquiring cash flow rental properties with your money, and then leveraging the growth and appreciation into new properties over time, then I say yes: do this.  If you are thinking of starting a fix and flip company, or a real estate sales (Realty) company, then I say invest your money and start the company with 0 money.  If you invest your money in passive income, then this will support your living expenses. But if you invest it into a company you aren't passionate enough to start with zero money, then my fear would be frivolous investment that won't last long.  This usually includes:  A sick logoA dope websiteSleek business cardsCool catch phraseSweet office spaceCompany swagAll of these items cost money and will make you zero money. This is also where most of my clients who inhereit wealth spend their money before they hire someone like me to tell them how to make money in business.  Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of starting a new business. But I don't love the idea of \"now I have money so I will do this\" because if you were passionate enough about succeeding then money wouldn't stop you.  If you have read this far, then you might read a little further, so: My number one priority in every business, company or venture I start is how can I get this up and running so it makes money every moneth, and doesn't need me around to run it. Some people might not understand this, but those that do will be successful.  Businesses, especially, start ups and new ventures, require a LOT of time and energy. This is anot a bad thing, its a good thing because it weeds out the weak. I have started several time intensive companies. They are great because they can make you A LOT of money. But the hours are long, the stress is real, and eventually your success comes down to hiring the right people and firing everyone else.  With $500,000 to invest, there are a lot of opportunities to turn that into income. Investing it into a new business is one way to turn that money into a full time job. There is nothing wrong with working hard.  In fact, my credo has long been: \"To Work Harder AND Smarter\". So my best advice to you would be is this venture working harder AND smarter? Or are there smarter options out there for you? Businesses don't need start up capital to succeed. They need the right people and right leader. A good idea with the wrong people will ALWAYS fail. But the right people with the right leader can do anything.

            "answer_text": "I assume you mean residential realty? You basically have two options: Bring top producing agents in or become a top producing agent yourself. I became licensed at a young age and I can tell you that people want an experienced person to handle their property. So you would be wise to bring on, or partner with, experienced professionals with local expertise. First, you'll need to stretch that $500k out so that it can cover your living expenses for the next 3-5 years. I suggest you save $450K, and use the other $50k to live on for 1 year. Get licensed and get hired by a successful brokerage and spend the next year learning everything you can about the business. Here's a checklist of what you'll need to acquire:  Self discipline to resist all the traps out there (drugs, booze, leisure, material possessions)Real estate licenseLocal market expertise Relationships with top agents Deep understanding of running a real estate business (running a company requires a different skill set than being a successful realtor.)Broad understanding of  the real estate industry. Experience buying homesExperience selling homesNow you are ready to make smart moves forward and you won't waste the rest of your life regretting how when you were 19 you blew the biggest opportunity imaginable.
