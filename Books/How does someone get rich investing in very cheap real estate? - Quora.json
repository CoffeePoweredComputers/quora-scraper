            "answer_text": "If i were starting over again and wanted to get rich, i would only use multifamily residential real estate. I would not have bought my own home, because a single family home (SFH) inevitably turns out to be a giant money pit. By using MFR instead, you can profit very nicely from the economies of scale. The price per unit is likely to be much lower, but the rents will only be a little bit lower. You also have scale working for you structurally and therefore will have lower capex costs on a MFR property. Another benefit is that you will be able to go to one place to pick up a bunch of rents, rather than needing to drive all over town. Buy in a pretty good area, one in which you would be willing to live if necessary. NEVER buy in a ghetto, no matter how great the deal seems. Ideally, you want to buy the worst property on a pretty nice block, so that when you spend money to upgrade the property you will greatly benefit the entire block by transforming the worst property into one of the better ones; that will raise everyone\u2019s value, but especially yours! Another objective is to buy the highest density in the neighborhood (buy a duplex in an area of SFHs, or a 4-plex in an area of duplexes, or best of all, an apartment complex in an area of SFHs! DON\u2019T buy an apartment complex that is a part of an apartment row, because no matter how great you are as a landlord, you will have crime problems coming in from the neighboring apartment complex. One of the most important aspects of the issue of \u201clocation, location, location\u201d is housing density! After you spend all your positive cash flow on improving the property, you will be able to drive rents, as well as to find higher caliber tenants. After 2 or 3 years of pushing value, you will be able to sell at a big profit, and use a tax free 1031 Exchange to roll all your profit into a bigger place with more potential. Pretty soon, you will be rich \u2014 and on your journey to wealth you will have been able to be a blessing to all kinds of people by providing a nice home for them. Good luck investing! tim ",

            "answer_text": "Slowly. Don\u2019t take big bites until you know what you\u2019re doing. Start small. Buy ONE house, close to you so you can learn from your mistakes. You will limit how big the mistakes are by keeping your eye on the place and you can do that most easily by having it nearby. Being a landlord is not a get-rich-quick scheme. But if you do it right, it IS a way to create long-term (so-called) passive income that will create wealth for you over the years. But don\u2019t flame out by trying to do too much, too soon. Take your time and learn the ropes. ",
