            "answer_text": "I really enjoyed your poem. Especially this line: \"Theold, mighty, former king discoursed something.It is simply about nothing, but it tackles almost everything.\" I'd have to get into a a rather long story as to why that particular line relates a lot to me and who I am, so let me just tell you I really enjoyed your poem, and I imagined it as a series of images going on in my head.  Please keep writing :) you're really good. And by sharing, you can connect with people everywhere. Perhaps find people who feel the same/similar way as to the feelings that brought about the poem. It could be great for yourself and others, and really, make the world a little better. If you want, we could also share our writings and whatnot, I write as well. Mostly stories, but also thoughts and attempts at poems (poems are difficult for me. I really respect your skill with them). ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A..  If you pay any heed to what do I have to day then, here I go..  a very very very long way to go you have to go.  A prose is a prose a poem is a poem. Good thing is that you have not tried to rhyme the poem, though there's a tendency, but there's not much effort towards rhyming. thus the spine of the poem remains intact and your poem, you saved, from a suicide ;) Now comes the expression part, to convey the message ahead. You did convey the message ahead, however, it lagged in worthiness of the words. For the theme of your poem, the story seemed to me irrelevant and too long and draggy. Use the scissor mercilessly on your own work. That's the key to be able to write a crisp and beautiful poem. Don't let one word, one line let drag the subject. Make it a four lined poem, but make it hit the head of your reader and make it crisp like crispness itself. Every poem is a statement of it's writer - said Mr. Dhoomil - it's correct. And make it your statement in your best way. Don't let your poem become fantasyland for the mediocres, no harm in letting a mediocre not understand your poem. Let it never fall in wrong hands, unless you have pledged to earn from your poems. because if you are earning from your poems, then you'd most probably write what people like to read and thus stepping into very very shallow waters. You got the right things in you, your poems tell that. - you are not attracted to rhyming. - you are not attracted to overflow of emotions like love or fantasy poems most people like - you know how to start and end a poem All you gotta do is to use the scissor and let only the best words wet the paper, stay right on course from the moment you develop the theme in your mind to the time to jot it down on the paper. All the very best to you dear friend. Don't let the sound of your own wheels, drive you crazy. ",
