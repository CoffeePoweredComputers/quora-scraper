            "answer_text": "A foreword is for nonfiction and it\u2019s written by a third party i.e. not the author. The aim is to give the book credibility, so the third party should be well-known, influential, or popular in the subject matter you\u2019re writing in. There\u2019s little point getting a nobody to write your foreword. A preface is for nonfiction and it sits outside the book\u2019s main contents (thus pre-face). It tells the reader why you wrote the book and the book\u2019s purpose. It might be, for example, the experience that inspired you to write the book. It\u2019s optional and most books don\u2019t need a preface. A prologue is for fiction and it comes before the main narrative of the book. It may be a brief summary of the events preceding the book, or it might be a pivotal moment that will happen in the book. It\u2019s optional and most novels don\u2019t need a prologue. An introduction is for nonfiction and it welcomes readers to the contents of your book. It tells them what the book is about, who it\u2019s for, how it will work, and why they should read it. In nonfiction books, a strong introduction is vital as it sets the readers\u2019 expectations for the book. If your book is fiction, it shouldn\u2019t have a preface or foreword. If it\u2019s nonfiction, it shouldn\u2019t have a prologue. It might have a foreword or preface, and it definitely needs an introduction. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you know this by intuition as well as necessity. I added a prologue to the novel The Death of Ichabod Crane so the narrator could lay out his situation. This allowed chapter one to cut to the chase of his need to collect a debt in Sleepy Hollow. The reader already knows he is a bill collector who . . . The next one and my dissertation didn\u2019t require one. The second novel opened with a woman oversleeping and then slowly realizing something was very wrong. The dissertation, on Byron\u2019s use of sacred architecture, begins with a chapter of Byron and the medieval cathedral. It also touches on shrines in Romanticism. There was no need for anything coming before that vital chapter. The one I am working on has a prologue which introduces the narrator and an overview of his late friend\u2019s life. It works to clue the reader in as to who the narrator is, a loyal but quirky friend, and who the hero/anti-hero of the tale is, an English lord who became a pop star and then died for a political cause. In other words, it sets the stage and allows the tale to begin. Think of the reader. Should they know something before taking the plunge? If yes, give it to them. ",
