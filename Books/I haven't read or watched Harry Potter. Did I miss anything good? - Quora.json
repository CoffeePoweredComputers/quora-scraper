            "answer_text": "The books are amazing, and there\u2019s nothing out there quite like them. The movies are well done on the whole but the books are at least 10 x better. Here are some of the best aspects of the books (partially edited from an answer I gave on another HP question): Characters: One of the huge strengths of the series is the incredible depth to many of the characters; you feel you truly know them, that they are 3D people. And many of them are some of the most interesting characters ever written. Some are intriguingly complex; others are simply beautiful personalities, others evil but in a realistic, rounded way. You find out more about certain characters as time goes on, drawing you in further. World: The world itself is thought out in great detail, so that you feel you are a part of it, immersed in it. It has great depth and is very engaging. It is written in such a way that you think it could almost be real, if you could just go through that secret entrance into the wizarding world, as their world is written as secretly co-existing alongside ours. It\u2019s beautifully described and the images it brings are as real as any movie. Reality: It has a very \u201creal\u201d feel to it in the issues involved which are handled beautifully and teach a lot about friendship, loyalty, compassion, love, etc without ever feeling \u201cpreachy.\u201d You learn with the characters. Plot: There are numerous twists and turns in the plot that keep you on your toes. The plot is complex but very understandable and engaging, revealed bit by tantalising bit as each story progresses. The books develop and deepen as they go. Wide-ranging Appeal: This series is so well-crafted that it appeals to a huge range of ages and personalities. It is fun and easy to understand on one level, and yet complex and deep as well. It is fantasy, and yet brings in real modern life too in a fun way; it\u2019s adventure, and drama, and mystery, with a healthy sprinkling of romance. Fun: It is also simply an extremely fun fantasy world with a lot of witty humour, adventures, dragons, castles, secret passageways, trolls, unicorns, etc! So in summary, there\u2019s a whole lot to love! Do give them a try if you haven\u2019t already - you\u2019ll be giving yourself a wonderful experience! :) ",

            "answer_text": "If you watch the first film in the Harry Potter series,  Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone, and like it; you definitely will like all the rest. Except for possibly the change in Dumbledore's after Richard Harris unfortunately died. Richard Harris was the Dumbledore. Although, Michael Gambon does grow on you. After, all, he is Dumbledore in the remaining six films.   All the main characters and fundamental plot elements are established in that first film. Which was perfectly cast, scripted, imaged, edited and directed. The rest of the films are elaborations on a journey Harry, his friends and numerous other characters throughout the Harry Potter World make until the final film denoument in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part II. 8 films in total.   An adventure of love, friendship, loyalty, betrayal, torment, cruelty, hope and success as Harry Potter confronted numerous conundrums and obstacles as he moves to accomplishing his final objective. This series also contains one of the most evil villains ever depicted on film. Moreover, we get to watch three of the main characters actually grow up. All within the incredibly vast milieu of a school for young magicians in the vicinity of modern London.   I didn't start reading the books until after the Prisoner of Azkaban. Mainly because I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen. And despite this, I still loved the movies just as much.  The Harry Potter films are the most successful film franchise ever created. Although they might soon be replaced by Star Wars. ",
