            "answer_text": "Sadly, it is overweight. You are supposed to be 100 to 131 pounds. You need to lose around 40 - 50 pounds to be fit by what you\u2019re stating. Now, I\u2019m all for body-positivity. Curvy, Flat, Thin, Chubby, Tall, Small, everyone\u2019s beautiful! But being overweight and slowly killing yourself is nothing to be \u201cpositive\u201d about. Now, these next couple parts will just be weight loss tips. Now, you\u2019re only 12, so I don\u2019t want you to try anything dangerous. I would suggest for you just working out an hour a day. It could be just walking, or running, or a whole treadmill, or a workout app! Don\u2019t STARVE! Just eat light. Maybe eat more rice and quinoa. If you put kale in an oven with Olive Oil, it\u2019s really good AND healthy! Try a chickpea salad aswell! Baked asparagus, while it makes your pee smell funny, is your best friend. 500 calories is a pound! You usually can\u2019t lose a whole pound in one day just with workouts, it takes around a week to do it the healthiest way. So I would suggest: Tracking your regular food intake every day. And I mean your REGULAR FOOD INTAKE, not a diet one! Get a notebook, or a journal, and write down what you ate, what time you ate it, and the number of calories it had. Then, find out the average of calories you consume, and cut 500 from that.Then, start your journey! Go ahead and start your diet + working out! I suggest eating, then working out, then eating, since that order prevented me from overeating when I was around 9 doing dance (trust me, I was CHONKY). You eat light, then work out, then eat after that, and you barely even feel hungry! Also, make sure to eat slowly, as your brain takes 20 minutes to get the signal that you\u2019re full, and some of us eat quickly, which isn\u2019t giving the brain time to receive the message before we\u2019ve overeaten.Drink lots of water! Water helps your metabolism, and it keeps you from eating too much! Also, water is just good.Find fun ways to work out! Me personally, I go onto my bike and ride around, or I\u2019ll pop out the ol\u2019 Wii and do Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 3 on Workout Mode! You might be a little sore, but as the saying goes, \u201cNo pain, no gain.\u201dThat\u2019s all I have for you! I hope you do become a healthy weight, and you have fun! <3 But seriously, chickpea salad is the best. Try it :D ",
