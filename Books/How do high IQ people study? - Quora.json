            "answer_text": "Until about my late 30\u2019s, I had a photographic memory. I also tended to understand things, easily. So, to study, I would read something, and if it were my own book or copied article, I\u2019d highlight it. I took notes in class, but never referred to them, because the act of writing them down committed them to memory. That was it. In a test, or when writing a paper, I could \u201cpull up\u201d the image of a paragraph or formula; so I didn\u2019t have to spend a lot of time practicing. I could start reading a book at midnight, finish it at 2, write the paper in an hour, and get an A. Papers poured out, in orderly fashion, sans outlines or rewrites. I want to add, for other students and parents, that kids like that can be bored, without realizing it. I usually ignored homework, until I had to do it; and often got bad grades in math, because, although I could explain concepts to other kids, I didn\u2019t bother to hand in homework. My senior year in a selective private high school, I was looking forward to a Prince concert (that dates me) on the first Monday of Spring Break. But, the week before that, my Chem teacher called my parents and told them that I hadn\u2019t handed in one scrap of homework, all semester. So, I was grounded until I got it all done. I was glued to my chair, from Friday night through about when the concert was starting on Monday, ripping through all of the chapters, handouts, and homework. I missed the concert. Later, my teacher called my parents, amazed that I had gotten it all right, despite the speedy approach. I wasn\u2019t used to people noticing how smart I was, other than to say, \u201cYou\u2019re/She\u2019s so smart.\u201d, but they didn\u2019t usually get it, in any deeper way. The Chem teacher the year before was fond of saying I was the smartest student he\u2019d ever had, and I should do more homework. Since I was rather isolated, even from my parents, in this regard, even though I had friends, rather than thinking to discuss this with anyone, I just felt resentful that stupid people who studied hard could get good grades, and kudos - kudos for being dumb and having to study! I knew not everyone who had to study was stupid; but, one of the highest achievers in my class was, in fact, stupid. She just studied all of the time. I felt dismayed that society was pumping out dumb doctors, policy makers and engineers, who really should be doing something else. (Sadly, I have found that attitude to be right on the money; and my opinion is backed by a world famous surgeon who saved my life once, and then told my parents and me to stay away from specialists, as they would \u201cruin my life\u201d. - And, he was a chief of surgery who trained residents from Harvard and Yale. In my life since, I\u2019ve frequently been amazed by the stupidity of doctors. I was once at a lecture by Francis Crick, which was also attended by a very famous doctor/author who asked, when Crick made the simple and obvious point that genetics often provide a base or necessary precursor to another characteristic which still requires environmental input in order to develop. The author doctor raised his hand and asked, \u201cBut, what about with twins? ???!!!! Blech. I have to admit that this author has done some good by raising awareness of certain issues; but this illustrates my pet peeve, all the same.). It was only after the experience with the Prince concert that I began to understand how boredom affected my work. In college, I realized something else. To explain, I\u2019m looking back on 6th grade, when my parents had decided to send me to private school, and testing showed that I needed to improve my math skills. So, I saw a tutor for a year. She remarked to my parents that I wasn\u2019t careful, when doing math on paper, but that I understood the concepts. The remark gave me a mental pause for about 30 seconds. I wanted to say, \u201cBut, I AM careful.\u201d. However, I was so used to having everyone around me make unfounded assumptions like that without really looking into things, that I had learned to keep my thoughts to myself. What a curious, intelligent person would have said would be along the lines of, \u201cShe understands the concepts, but makes errors on paper. Let\u2019s try to figure out why.\u201d. Back to college, when I took chemistry, and had a hard time on tests, even though I got all of my homework right. I saw a tutor, and she also remarked that I understood how to use the formulas, but made mistakes on paper. Yet, no one thought to address this. I continually ran out of time, taking the tests (only in math related classes), and got poor grades, because of it. I got an A in lab, a C on tests. I took the class over, and for some reason I still can\u2019t explain, got an A on the tests and C in lab. I gave up and took the B. It was for this reason that I gave up on going to med school. Well, that and that I always chose to do my reading for other classes before math and science, unless it was neuropsych, which I liked. Decades later, I had a friend who was a Psychologist and spent her entire career doing learning disability testing for public schools. I asked her if there was such a thing as being dyslexic only with numbers, not letters. She said that, as far as she knew, there was no specific diagnosis for that, but there was no reason it couldn\u2019t be the case. If anyone had thought of that, I could have requested more time to finish the tests, and would probably be a doctor today. The only reason I had thought to ask my friend about it was that, as a county social worker, I had noticed how odd it was that, when I needed to fill out a form with a bunch of numbers, as with accounting for how donated money was spent on foster kids on my caseload, I had to ask the clerks to do it, because it would drive me into a brain fog crash, and made me feel extremely anxious to have to deal with it. I knew how odd it was, because, at first, the clerks looked at me as if I were trying to shirk my work; and, I had to explain the situation. I could do math in my head faster than anyone else, usually; but written numbers drove me around the bend. I\u2019ve always kept a running balance of my bank accounts in my head and have never bounced a check (we used to use checks, lol) because I wrong. At a point in my life when I wanted a change, and really didn\u2019t care what it was, as long as it was interesting, I decided I would like to go to grad school and get a PhD in Sanskrit, which I had enjoyed studying, in undergrad. So, I got out my text books (it had been over a decade since I\u2019d taken the classes) and started to relearn first year Sanskrit. I often studied in a cafe near the local U. But, I had discovered, to my dismay, that my photographic memory was gone. I was trying to memorize something, one day, when a prof from the U sat next to me and volunteered: \u201cSome people use mnemonic devices, like (this and that, which I can\u2019t really recall, as 25 years have passed).\u201d. I said thanks, but was horrified. Mortified. To get to and through grad school, I\u2019d have to relearn how to learn! It was probably more distasteful to me than daunting (My brain had given out!); but, that and the fact that I couldn\u2019t get a scholarship spot in a Summer intensive I needed, the upcoming Summer, to catch up in order to apply, anyway, ended that plan. (A military friend told me that military peeps suck up the scholarships, as Sanskrit is used for developing some codes). One other somewhat related point is that education pros have realized that there are very different kinds of intelligence. A person can be practically nonverbal, but be highly intelligent. Education really should be geared to address a person\u2019s strengths and give guidance towards a life of success. But, need I even say that this is rarely the case? I knew a theatre student at NYU who could dance so eloquently that it was exactly as if she were speaking to you. But, when she did speak, no one - not one person - could figure out what she was trying to say. It was like gibberish. Think how much better our world would be, if we let the smart people do what they were good at, and guided the dumb ones to what they were good at. We\u2019d have good docs, good medicine, good, clean power, equitable wealth distribution, good, working social programs, a happier and more productive (but not in the same way) populace, an economy that supports life instead of ruining it. But, for this to happen, the focus has to come off of wealth hoarding, because dumb and evil people succeed well at that, and then they have the power. Life could be so beautiful for everyone, if we\u2019d just stop for one second, temporarily suspend our disbelief, and let a new idea arise. Then, the idea would take root and grow, even while we were back to our usual head in the sand lives; eventually, some generation would reap the benefit of that one single second. One final point I want to make is that, besides the loss of the photographic memory, I\u2019ve experienced cognitive decline, due to a disease, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.). It\u2019s mainly a short term memory loss; but I can also no longer do math in my head. It\u2019s hard to deal with figuring out new things, like how to get an app for my heart rate monitor that will organize the data as I need it to, given that there are so many apps and thinking actively about things is hard for me, now. I\u2019ve been denied disability and have descended into poverty, because of it. But, a few years ago, I bought some phosphatidylserine; and, within 3 months, I could remember phone numbers, again. I would advise anyone who values their mind to do some googling about safe supplements which can protect brain cells from stress, chemical, and physiological damage of various kinds, and help them to recover from damage, and take them, even before age or illness can cause any harm.

            "answer_text": "My IQ has tested at 145 twice, many years ago. I am unwilling to take a new test. I seem to think about things very slowly, in some cases, but over a very long time, and years ago conjectured that ability to solve problems was as much a matter of interest and willingness to ponder them, as any kind of ability or method. I find myself relating only to the answers of 160+ people. I do not think this is because my IQ is that high, but perhaps I have a slower brain that thinks in that way. I can *not* memorize easily or read fast. Many of the apparently 130+ types gave advice on study habits. What works for one person may not work for another. Find your own strengths. Gradually expand the ways you study or learn when you find the resistance to expansion low. Each fall in college, I\u2019d try to do all the homework and not fall behind, as I didn\u2019t like the anxiety of it. I\u2019d get fatigued, my grades would be low (for me), and I\u2019d \u201cgive up\u201d in the spring and go back to being a slouch. My grades would immediately come up. I hate textbooks. Hardly ever got anything from them. Most are written to impress professors, who after all control their purchasing. The explanations are tediously poor, and sometimes absolutely wrong. Most perplexing, information is presented as fact, without the history and references and identification of unknown and controversial points, and yet this style is completely unacceptable in writing scientific papers, which you\u2019ll have to do later if you progress to graduate level in any field. In class I would try to figure out what was coming next instead of listening. Then I listened just enough to get confirmation, or not. Any subject that depended on laws of nature I did well in. Any subject that depended too much on human-generated standards and procedures and interpretations, I did not. I withdrew failing from an accounting class on account of it was too arbitrary for me to figure out. That is not to say textbooks are useless. Often I would buy one with good intent, and it would sit on the shelf. After some years, sometimes without reading it at all, I would find I understood most of it. I suppose this is because my mind was unconsciously figuring out what it must say, but I do not know. I call this the Edgar Cayce method, because he said he could know what was in a book by putting it under his pillow. Although I spent my early life figuring things out, in the last couple of decades I have had a high emphasis on empirical data. It comes down to it could be this way or that way, and you have to have experimental data to understand how the universe actually is. I find that other supposedly smart people often disdain experimental data, disdain even the word empirical, and would rather explore a mathematical formula than the real universe. I think they are immature, like when I was young, and unwilling to read the textbook of the real universe. Certain social situations would give me headaches when I was young. But my friends would get headaches from working math problems, which I did for fun (proofs and things, not numerical problems). So I came to believe it was a matter of how brain resources were allocated. Obviously I would flunk a social IQ test. Speaking of tests, you have to know how to take them. Is there a penalty for guessing? If not, then mark every question randomly that you haven\u2019t answered as time runs out. If so, mark only questions where you can eliminate some answers. Several people complained their willingness to consider alternatives messed them up on tests. You have to figure which answer the person of lower IQ who designed the test had in mind. That is part of the test, figuring out the people who made it. I did very poorly at things like interpreting literature until I discovered Freud and Jung. This gave me a theoretical basis for it, and suddenly I was a whiz in a new area, astounding my friends with interpretations of their dreams. This wears off after a while, as it reveals uncomfortable things, and I\u2019ve lost the skill without practice. While half listening to lectures, even in high school and continuing through graduate school, I would nearly always work on homework or problems in another class. This made better use of my time. Being less bored, my mind did both tasks better. But I think this is because I am easily bored, not smarter than others. On objective measures of memory and even figuring out analytical puzzles, many other A students could run circles around me. I once read a book written by a person with multiple personality disorder who got a PhD, while exhibiting the disorder. She claimed she could exhibit two personalities at once, one on either side of her body. One would listen in class, while another worked homework in a subject it was good at. I was insanely jealous of this capability. It was the premium version of what I did poorly by time sharing. I could never manifest even a slightly different personality, or any other mystic quality, despite years of studying everything from meditation to astral projection. There was an un-timed test of 160+ IQ people floating around in the 70s. I could never get very far with it. The problems were both too difficult and too uninteresting. I would not do all that work just for a test score. But some famous but seemingly simple problems I worked on for 50 years. I believe I finally solved one (the paper is in peer review, it\u2019s probably taking them a while to assess it). No one else was willing to work on the problem that long. I kept coming back to it. When I made some unrelated discoveries in the field of relativity, it boosted my confidence and I gave it one last try. (I\u2019m not willing to say what it is until and unless the paper is accepted.) My favorites among the other answers here: Barnard Collier: High IQ people are more visual. I agree, and loathe the attitude now prevalent in some fields that \u201cthings are complicated and you can\u2019t really visualize them.\u201d I\u2019ve posted many answers on Quora having to do with visualizing various aspects of General Relativity. I did not understand what Collier meant by \u201cnot necessarily optical.\u201dFiona Wallace 160+: Looks for weaknesses and counter examples of new ideas, then looks for the cascade effect of how it affects other knowledge. Only a couple of other people mentioned the cascade effect, and no one that I noticed mentioned Fiona\u2019s concern about validating knowledge, which I think is critical. If an authority assures you something is so, they are covering for their lack of certainty, because humans are not so smart as to fully understand any of the areas they dabble in. If they did, society would be stable, everyone wealthy, and we\u2019d have spread over the galaxy by now.Leah Bayer 160+: Listens to understand, doesn\u2019t traditionally study.Jaidev Ramakrishna 163: Aced exams on half-remembered information, made intuitive leaps, 90% of studying a few hours before the exam, panic driven.Jeffrey Robinson 160: Read a lot of Asimov. Reads textbooks before class without understanding much, but then class is easier.Patricia Thompson: Most smart kids procrastinate.Bernd Schmidt: Sleep on it as often as possible.Charlotte Neumann: Better at theory, makes ridiculous mistakes (me too) and has trouble following her own train of thought (ah, that, very frustrating but common and related to the ridiculous mistakes).Answers that illustrate methods I cannot seem to use, or that are very different than mine: Shulamit Widawsky: Group study. Though occasionally I pick up new points of view from others, mostly it wastes too much time. So only if I am stuck. The committee approach at most work places I find intolerable.Hope Laust: Good memory. Other people accuse me of having a good memory. But asked to remember a specific thing, most likely I will fail even if it is important. I only remember odd things that happen to stick in my mind.And one of the most thought provoking answers: Mark Levinson: There comes a day when you \u201chit the wall\u201d and have to learn to study like the B-students. (Yes, happens to me a lot. But I may become an F-student like with the accounting.)What happens when you hit the wall, and what you do, separates the men from the boys, so to speak, or the women from the girls. If you accept becoming a B-student, then that becomes what you are! I prefer to fail. The B-students cannot grasp the long range implications, and quickly become unaware of it. They have already \u201cgiven up\u201d on the full understanding. They can manage on rote learning only so long as it applies. Some are better at wrote than others, and may be able to discover narrow ideas, but they will not discover the cascade effects that Fiona mentions, nor will they be able to evaluate the truth of what they learn.If the problem remains interesting, the solution is to give up being a student, and work on it as an amateur. This way you can spend the rest of your life on it, if you wish, and achieve the understanding you could not on a university schedule. I have always thought it irrational that PhD\u2019s were granted at the beginning of a career instead of at the end. And if the problem does not remain interesting, move on to something you are good at.",
