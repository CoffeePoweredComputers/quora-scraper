            "answer_text": "Things take time. If you wanted to fly a plane, what would you do? You'd find a ground school and take lessons. If you wanted to play the piano, what would you do? You'd find a piano teacher and take classes. What makes writing any different? Writing is an art, but it\u2019s a learned art. To ask someone how to write a story is like asking \u201cHow do I climb a mountain?\u201d You don\u2019t, unless you\u2019ve had the training. And no, it\u2019s not rocket science, but writing is something that needs to be studied and practiced. Anybody can sit down and write crap. You see it all the time in self pubbed books. Most people will tell you to just start writing, and keep writing, but I don't agree. It's not enough to just write every day if you don't know what you're doing or how to improve something. That just means days and weeks and months of useless writing. It's like not knowing how to knit so you just keep making loops with the yarn. You can't get better, you can't turn that into a scarf ... you have the desire, but you don't know how. I'm going to give you my stock answer that I give everyone who asks me this question. I'm going to give you some good advice on how to learn the craft, and give you a place to send in some of your work when you're ready. In order to write stories that people want to read you will need to understand how to put one together. There is a definite pattern and rhythm to it. And there are certain expectations from the editors and publishing houses as to how your story is laid out. You will need a good imagination, one that can look at a situation and picture all sorts of different scenarios. You need to be able to ask 'what if' and come up with twists and lines that are new and fresh. You will need to be able to research things. For example I wrote a story set in Iran where there was a wedding. I had to research how the wedding would take place, the food, the customs, common Iranian names, clothing, etc. in order to write an interesting yet correct story. Take classes in writing; grammar and punctuation (very important... lots of self published books are swimming in glaring errors and typos), character building, dialogue, plotting, pacing, point of view (POV), inner and outer conflicts, subplots, scenes and sequels, genres, story boards, twists, chapter hooks, suspense, killer opening lines, and satisfying endings. If you're going to write sci-fi you will need to take classes in world building. Each genre of book has its own set of expectations from the reader that you will need to fulfill. For example a murder mystery must have clues for the reader to try and solve. A romance needs a happily ever after ending, known to writers as an HEA. A thriller needs fast pacing and danger. There are classes in short story writing. Where to find these classes? Local community colleges often offer writing classes. My local library has classes seasonally. Best of all there are hundreds of classes you can take on-line. They run about $25-$35 each and range from 2 to 4 weeks. Google on-line writing classes and you will get lots of sites. Try SavvyAuthors. They have classes year round. You don\u2019t have to join either one but if you do you get a discount on their classes. Just because a class might be about writing romances, writing is writing; many of the same principles apply to other genres. So don\u2019t hesitate to take a course on character building or writing scenes just because the site caters to romance. There are sites that offer expensive classes, so be careful. I\u2019d recommend starting with a few less expensive ones to see if you really like writing and want to continue. IMO it is not necessary to have a degree or to take an expensive course to write well. Sometimes there are courses at the local library. Read a lot. Get a feel for how a story is told; how it starts, how it progresses through the story to a satisfying end. See how your favorite author keeps you interested. I don't know your age, but when you are able join some writing groups, even online groups are helpful. Oftentimes these groups offer lectures and classes in writing. They share their work and critique each other. You are a young writer, but there are quite a few successful young novelists. This kid was 17 when he wrote this Eragon. Google it. Here\u2019s a place for teenagers to submit stories \u2026 and they pay! One Teen Story \"One Teen Story is looking for great short stories written for the young adult audience ages 13 and up. These stories should deal with the teen experience (issues of identity, friendship, family, coming-of-age, etc.) and should be geared primarily toward an audience of teen readers. With that in mind, gratuitous profanity, sex and drug use are best avoided. We\u2019re open to all genres of literary fiction between 2,000 and 4,500 words.\"  Payment: $500 Best wishes in your quest to write. The world will always need good writers. ",

            "answer_text": "First thing first your age isn\u2019t that relevant. You want to do something go for it! Don\u2019t write a book for the sake of writing a book takes a lot of time and effort if you want it to be to a good standard. Anyone could write a book i they felt they had to but it would lack that spark books such as Harry Potter, the hunger games and any of terry Pratchett\u2019s books have. However if you have a genuine idea there is ways you can go about it to make the whole thing slightly easier because although you may want to write it, it does take effort. The first thing before the idea is to read other books. Get a feel for what style works and what style you can really make your own. if you try to mimic a style it can make editing the book or writing later in the book more difficult. Think your idea through thoroughly and draw up a sort of plan. this can be a list of events with characters and a bit about them unless you are choosing to write a factual book in which case you should gather the facts and make lists of what you wish to include. Start writing the book whilst referring to the plan. Just go with the flow. The first draft is the writer telling them the story. If you are writing using chapters you really have two choices you can write a chapter then edit it till you are happy then write the next chapter and edit it and do it like that or write out the whole book read it then rewrite (or edit if you are happy.) When editing you should check spelling grammar punctuation and make any story line changes you want to make. The best bit of advice for going about writing a book is write the book you want to read.
