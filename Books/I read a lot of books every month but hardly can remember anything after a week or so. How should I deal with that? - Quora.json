            "answer_text": "\u201cSome books should be tasted, some devoured, but only a few should be chewed and digested thoroughly.\u201d Sir Francis Bacon I completely agree with this. Last year I read War and Peace\u2014a chapter a day. (That was the plan, but with the longest chapter coming in at 9 pages, it was not hard to knock off a few chapters in one sitting.) I did OK with the characters and their multiple names, and I could picture the action and settings quite well. I even did OK at attempting to translate the French before reading the footnotes. Can I now tell you in detail what happened at any point? Not really. I can tell you that my formerly favorite book, Gone with the Wind, is stolen from Tolstoy. Now, can I tell you in detail what happened at any point in GWTW? You bet. I\u2019ve read it more than 20 times. And Then There Were None/Ten Little Indians? Yup. And every time I reread that one, I pick up new clues. I devour the newest Michael Connelly, Robert Galbraith, Sue Grafton. Can I tell you much about them? Nope. But I love reading them! If it is important to me that I remember content from a book, I take notes, highlight, or make notations in the margins. This happens when I read for my own schooling, for work-related topics, or for titles I\u2019m teaching. I\u2019d add a bit to Bacon\u2019s quote. There are some books I\u2019d spit out(looking at you, Twilight saga). And right now, A Wrinkle in Time is that huge forkful of *pick your food* that you just dread bringing to your lips. I didn\u2019t get it the first time I read it, but it\u2019s our \u201cBook Club\u201d pick. So I have to force that giant chunk of Spam down. Decide for yourself how to separate the books you read into the tasting, devouring, and digesting categories. ",

            "answer_text": "I have the same issue. I actually have this issue with everything I read/watch/listen to. And it\u2019s very annoying. When I read, watch or listen to something, I put pause after a chapter or a big chunk of information and write it down. I just write a small title, and a few bullet points of what I thoughts was interesting to remember. I write everything on this app called \u201cpaper\u201d. It\u2019s not an app, it\u2019s a Chrome extension. The advantage of using paper is that each time I open a new tab on my computer, I access the extension on the screen. I have a quick view of everything I learned this week/month. After a certain time (when it becomes cluttered), I archive and start afresh. To be honest, I still forget half of the things I learn. But at least now it sticks to my eyes and my brain for a bit longer, both because I write it down, and because I access it all the time :) ",
