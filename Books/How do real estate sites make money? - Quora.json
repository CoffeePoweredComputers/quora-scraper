            "answer_text": "There are 3 principal ways in which real estate sites make money: Broker subscription: Real estate sites register as many brokers as possible on their platform. These brokers list properties on real estate sites to generate leads from potential buyers. The brokers generally purchase a monthly subscription from real estate sites to list properties.Banner Ads: Real estate sites also promote targeted advertisements on their sites. Real estate builders or brokers generally buy these banners to promote their properties.Data: When a user or broker lists the property on any given real estate site, the user or broker is ultimately providing a lot of information to the real estate site. Real estate sites then use these data points about properties, customer preferences, prices, etc. to generate market insights that can be sold to private equity investors, banks, investment funds in the form of reports or analytic.",
