            "answer_text": "I have published a few courses on skillshare my self but my similar courses were more successful at other platform , as I user I am not sure if its worth your money an effort to subscribe to skillshare, other platforms like UDEMY are checking the quality of the training Material thoroughly : they check Audio, Video , Instructional design , and the language used , which guarantees the quality of the uploaded material , I hope you will not get me wrong , UDEMY is not 100% perfect , they have to look into their Review system , because there are some loopholes , and some people are using these loopholes to get high rating for their courses and once they have high rating the courses can sell more , but at the end you can decide after purchasing a course, if its not up to your expectations you have a 30 days money back guarantee , which is very good for you as an end user , such feature is not available with skillshare or some other platforms .

            "answer_text": "Skillshare offers over 22,000 online courses supported by 5000+ teachers so everyone will have a slightly different experience but the hobby/ creative courses are generally better than the business/ technical ones. Most of the videos are relatively short, video-based learning with just one final project and zero exams. Most of the courses are fairly well structured and the best ones are well tied to their projects. Aim for one with lots of projects and an active community as those seem to be the most useful. We found Skillshare more closely resembles Youtube than it edX. It is best for when you have a relatively simple thing you want to learn like a basic intro to a skill. For example: shooting great black and white photographs or learning basic Adobe Photoshop. Skillshare is not accredited by Higher Education institutions (think Universities) or companies looking to promote their tools (think Microsoft & Adobe). So don\u2019t expect a huge reaction from Uni\u2019s or employers if you drop your course. Plus you don\u2019t get a certificate. If you are looking for courses in business or for a deeper dive into a subject check out Coursera, PluralSight, Udacity. Thanks for reading!
