            "answer_text": "No he is not. Not even close. Greatest living economist usually refers to economists whos work either influenced a branch of economics or has widely affected policy, to which sowell has done neither.

            "answer_text": "He's my personal favorite living economist, but there are quite a few living Nobel Prize winning economists whose achievements I don't even understand. I find it unlikely that we can tell who will be greatest from the present day; that's something that historians in 30 years will be able to estimate far more objectively and empirically than we can today, ",
