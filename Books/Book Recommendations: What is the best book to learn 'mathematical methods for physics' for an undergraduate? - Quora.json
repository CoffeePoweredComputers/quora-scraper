            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s like you didn\u2019t even google the exact phrase! Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering by Riley, Hobson & Bence I mean, the phrasing is almost exactly what you\u2019ve already typed\u2026. Ether way, RileyHobsonBence is pretty much the bible of first year physics at Oxford, and the math in it takes you all the way up to the middle of third year (so I am told). It is packed full of questions to do and whilst I dislike some of the ways it treats linear algebra (there is a much simpler way to do some of it), it is a very good book. ",

Ten years out of college and I still thumb through it now and then.  It's the assigned undergrad textbook at the university where I work now. I've seen other folks use Advanced Engineering Mathematics by Erwin Kreysig, and for grad students, Arfken's  Mathematical Methods for Physicists gets uses a lot. If you're an undergrad, pick up a copy of each from the library and see which you like better.  You can always pick up older versions cheaply, too: the content doesn't change much between them. I'd be interested to hear what you end up with! ",

Mathematical methods physics and engineering comprehensive guide 3rd edition It may look large and intimidating at first, but the earlier chapters are quite accessible if you have the equivalent of AS Further Maths (in UK) or are willing to do a bit of self-study about complex numbers and exponential functions. I still use this book regularly for my research, and its resale value is high if you want to pass it on after a few years. ",
