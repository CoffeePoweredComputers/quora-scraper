            "answer_text": "Definitely. It is the Word of God. It is God\u2019s message to the world. It is unlike any other book, because it is authored by the inspiration of God\u2019s Holy Spirt. He inspired men to write what they did, over thousands of years. I\u2019m sure some did not even fully understand what they were writing, especially the prophetic books. But it all comes together the more you continue. The more it is studied, the more amazing it becomes. Because it is a spiritual book, and \u201cdeep\u201d, one should pray for understanding as they read, and for God to show them what they need to know. He will show you surprising things. I suggest you start in the New Testament and learn about Jesus Christ. He is the key to everything in the Bible. Pray, that is, have conversations with God about anything and everything that you are discovering. Don\u2019t expect to understand everything immediately, but take to heart what you do understand, and put the remainder \u201con a shelf\u201d for the time being. More and more will unfold as you continue. There are many things that are interwoven from book to book and from one time period to another. Jesus said, \u201cIf you continue in My word, you are truly My disciple. And you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.\u201d (John 8: 31\u201332) The first 4 books of the New Testament are eye-witness accounts about the life and teachings of Jesus, written by the disciples Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. John is my favorite because he most clearly describes who Jesus is. There is some overlap but each one contains some information that the others don\u2019t. These 4 books changed my life. Then after you read those, the book of Acts is the exciting account of how Christianity spread and about the early disciples, including persecutions and miracles. The book of Romans was written to the believers in Rome and contains important explanations of doctrine, especially what faith in Christ accomplishes. The rest of the New Testament is short books which were letters of instruction and encouragement and some correction to believers in other newly established Christian churches in various places. Each one has a particular theme and is still important advice for us today. The last book is Revelation and was written by John when he was old and Jesus appeared to him and told him what to write about the End Time or the Last Days. It has not happened yet and is difficult to understand everything because it contains a lot of symbolism, but it is about the Tribulation period and when God will pour out His wrath on those who are left on the earth after the Christians have been taken to Heaven. It requires deep study, but the first few chapters and last couple of chapters of Revelation are easily understood. Then when you are ready to tackle the Old Testament, the first book of Genesis contains much. Be sure to check out Psalms and Proverbs - they are both special and any chapter out of them can be read anytime. Psalms is full of worship and prayers and all kinds of emotions. Proverbs gives us God\u2019s wisdom. The Old Testament is the Jewish religion, and in it we learn much about God and the promised Savior. \u201cMan shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.\u201d - (Matthew 4:4) ",

It contains some really absurd stories and constantly contradicts itself. How then do you suppose that it could help build a relationship with another entity for which there is absolutely no empirical evidence? When you see other answers here, they'll be studded with quotes from this nonsense tome. Ask yourself of any claim: How could they know this?Is there ANY evidence for the claim?Most people who spout this stuff are only repeating what others have said. None have met a god or conversed with one. They even have the arrogance to say that they \u201cknow\u201d stuff when in actual fact - they can't and don't. They will tell you that you should have \u2018faith\u2019. This means that you should believe WITHOUT any evidence. They have the temerity to call this \u2018reason\u2019 and \u2018logic\u2019. In any other walk of life, when would this be acceptable? Why should religion get special pleading? Do you know of any banks that would provide a mortgage based on faith? Go to DTMV and ask for a license to drive a large truck. If they want you to sit some kind of test tell them that they should just \u201chave faith\u201d. For the same reasons - that should be sufficient. You may also tell people that you have the cure for cancer. All they (patients) have to do is ask and Jesus will give them. IT SAYS SO IN THE BOOK, SO IT MUST BE TRUE. ",

By the way, the Bible never says it helps you \u201cbuild a relationship with God\u201d. It says all kinds of different things in different places because it is written from the perspective of old societies who were constrained by the development of religion at their point in history. You can invest meaning in whatever you want and you can hang around people going to bible studies who confirm your view. If it helps you to believe that- good for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. God revealed himself through the Bible. There is natural revelation (His creation), and then there is special revelation (the Bible). The Bible reveals God\u2019s purposes for you and for the world. Not only that, but the Bible was not written by man\u2019s interpretation. Every single Word was written by the inspiration of God - each Word was God-breathed. As we read the Word, God is revealing Himself to us and we are developing a relationship with Him. Imagine if your mom wrote you a letter once a week. She is revealing herself in each letter. If you didn\u2019t read it, you\u2019d still have a relationship with your mom, but if you did read each letter every week you\u2019d be drawing closer to your mother as time goes on. Imagine next time you see her how close you would feel to her, and you\u2019d both feel like you know each other. It\u2019s the same with the Bible on even a greater scale. I encourage you to start reading. It\u2019s not as easy to read as your mom\u2019s letters. It takes time to get to know the mind and heart of God. But you will and it will all be worth it! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. But you must read it in depth. Any English translation has flaws and thus you are encouraged to go once through lightly and then dig into Genesis with an amplified version. Lucky is he that speaks Aramaic fluently as that is the original language of the Bible. After Genesis, you might be wise to take up the gospels followed by a study of Paul\u2019s works. The apparency of discrepancies is from the faults in translation from the original Aramaic, into Greek and into English. A dig into an apparently incoherent section would usually reveal a faulty translation and a failure to bring out the full flavour of the original Aramaic. Further, the Hebrew mind is an action based one whereas the Greek/Western one is a conceptual one. The Hebrew is based on agricultural society and the concept of cycles such as seasons. These make a difference in meaning. Your reading will bring up an understanding of a God who is seeking to communicate with those he created and to have a meaningful dialogue with them. And yes, he does communicate back as things seem to happen \u201cby accident\u201d to help you develop your relationship with Him. Do not fall into a trap of relying on another to create or establish a relationship except Yahshua (aka Jesus), Yahshua is the gateway to YHWH and has a special place in this but is not a via. He did the hard yards to make it possible for us to be allowed to communicate to YHWH. Yahshua is an example to us of how we should live our lives. But he wants us to build our relationship with YHWH directly but in so doing mention that he was the one that made the introduction (in a way). There is nothing in this world more important than establishing a relationship with THE Creator. ",

Not only were they miss understanding the bible, they were abusing the followers of their faith, ignoring Gods message of compassion and care. To add insult to injury it was the religious elders who conspired to crucify Jesus. The men who spent the most tome reading and studying the bible were those who orchestrated Christ\u2019s death. Jesus said, if you love me keep my commands, He meant. If you love me, go and love other people as I have loved you. The Pharisees read the bible but didn\u2019t have love, that\u2019s why Jesus left us with one law, one command, love others.
