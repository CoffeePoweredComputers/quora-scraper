            "answer_text": "Book stores buy their books from distributors so they can get their 50% discount and 90 ninety terms (90 days to pay or return the covers for credit). Ingram and Baker and Taylor are the US distributors. The corporate office looks at the distributors catalogs to see what\u2019s new and sales data. Because the corporate office does the buying for all their stores, they order thousands of books to be shipped to various stores across the country. These are the books that achieve shelf space. There are a few others that can get shelf space, however most of the shelf space books are those on a time limit. The goal is to sell them or return them (the covers) for credit within the 90 day period. They choose books with excellent sales data so they have the best chance of making money, but if the books don\u2019t sell they at least know they can get credit and won\u2019t have to pay for them. This is why for many years, books used to have a statement inside that said it was illegal to own a book without a cover, because it meant the covers had been removed and returned for credit, but the actual book had been put in the dumpster. Individual stores have limited purchase authority to make special orders for books requested and ordered by customers for books they don\u2019t have in store. When making special order purchases, they purchase only what they need and do not order for stock. At times, in order to acquire special orders they must go outside their distributors which means they lose their discounts and return ability plus pay shipping which means they can go in the hole on special orders paying above what they will sell the book for to the customer. Books they can\u2019t return yet want to take a chance on, they will add to their book list online since they don\u2019t have to maintain inventory because they can order and have the book(s) drop shipped after receiving an order. This opens the doors to many books they don\u2019t purchase for in house sales. ",
