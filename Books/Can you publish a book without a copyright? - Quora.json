            "answer_text": "If you mean \u2018can I publish a book that is not copyrighted\u2019 as in does not have copyright protection, the answer is yes, but you have to take some steps. If you mean \u2018without a copyright notice,\u2019 the answer is also yes, but any published material automatically attains copyrighted status, so even without a notice it will still be copyrighted. If your intention is to make it copyright-free and give up your copyright, there are different ways to go about it. You could just put a declaration in the book that you are putting it in public domain (PD). I\u2019m not sure if that is legally binding, however if someone copied something and you tried to prosecute them, it would probably be a good defense. Or you could use Creative Commons (CC), which is a legally constructed way to control your copyright. CC actually also has a PD tool. Or you can construct a license which retains some rights from the least restrictive of \u2018attribution\u2019 where users have to acknowledge you only and can use the work in any way they choose, to non-commercial (NC), no derivatives (ND) i.e. it can\u2019t be modified, and also must have attribution., ",

            "answer_text": "Once a book (manuscript) is created it\u2019s automatically in copyright. If you don\u2019t post a notice that doesn\u2019t lose your copyrights, it just makes it harder to secure rights or get damages. Same if you don\u2019t follow the laws of your nation. That makes it hard or impossible to get damage money. But the moment you fix a work that can be seen or heard it is automatically in copyright in 150 nations. Now, if you\u2019re talking about publishing a book from Public Domain sources, like 20,000 leagues Under the Sea, yes you can PROVIDED you do the typesetting. You can\u2019t just scan a major publisher\u2019s reprint. I suppose you can import a Gutenberg TEXT file and then create a font for the chapter titles, book title, put it into Garamond or Times New Roman, maybe make the first letter of the new chapter larger or ornate and you can publish that and even apply for a copyright on your graphics if they are original.

It is really a stupid answer to tell you that you automatically have copyright. Technically, you do \u2014 but you don\u2019t have a lot of protection. You can neither get into federal court, nor make a claim based on 17 USC 101 et seq., without registering \u2014 not to mention there is likely to be an issue of proving WHEN you created the material. Whether you can afford to mount a federal suit, even if you do register, is another story. JA - M.S., Juris Doctor, LL.M. Intellectual Property No legal advice is intended. ",

You can, however, issue a non-exclusive grant of all rights to anyone who wants them, which has pretty much the same effect as not having a copyright at all. ",
