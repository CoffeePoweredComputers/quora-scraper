            "answer_text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve been there. Still there sometimes, often around holidays. TL;DR: It\u2019s actually a good thing you broke up, for reasons explained below. Now it\u2019s time to get help coping since you\u2019re not doing too well on your own. Something about John Wayne at the end. Now that you know that I can comprehend your situation, I will now commence tearing your argument apart bit by bit. \u201c[\u2026] dumped by my ex-girlfriend. She was right about me; [\u2026]\u201dYeah? Why, what\u2019s her proof? (seriously, tell me why she\u2019s right in objectively provable lemmas in the comments, after knowing my argument pressed in the next three sections) \u201c[\u2026] I\u2019m nothing, [\u2026]\u201dNothing has no mass. You have not only mass enough to punch keys in on a keyboard, but you actually wrote your woes. YOUR WOES! \u201cNothing\u201d is incapable of feeling bad about anything because it\u2019s only an abstract concept of the total lack of things. In reality \u201cnothing\u201d truly doesn\u2019t exist in the physical world, but you do. Thus, you are something. Beyond being a human, we just don\u2019t know what it is yet. \u201c[I\u2019m] a joke and a useless, clingy idiot.\u201dI don\u2019t know. Jokes are supposed to be funny. You seem to be a person in pain instead. Useless is a point of perspective. e.g: I\u2019m useless in the kitchen, since the best I can do is shove stuff in the slow cooker for the day and come home to a warm meat mush, though I\u2019m the objective best at cleaning dishes and seriously don\u2019t mind doing it. So, to her, what are you useless at? Also: what was she trying to use you for? Boyfriends & girlfriends (I don\u2019t know your gender) should be loved, not used. Since, obviously, the term \u201cuseless\u201d inferred that she was trying to use you for something, which means \u201cclingy idiot\u201d is total bullshit. That\u2019s because you actually loved your ex when she wasn\u2019t all that in to you. It\u2019s not your fault she left, and it may have been for the best since the arrangement wasn\u2019t mutual and she wasn\u2019t mature enough to admit that she was the callous, unfeeling idiot herself. Good riddance to her! I hope your next lover is better. \u201cI can't get a job anymore because I spend most of my days in my bed waiting to have the courage to die.\u201dThat\u2019s pretty severe depression, which is a pretty severe problem itself that can affect your thinking in rather poisonous ways. I had to deal with this not too long ago, but I at least had the wherewithal to get help when I was legit ready to take my life. You need to do the same; check into the hospital. The emergency room will accept you. It\u2019s on par with having a serious injury. Both will kill you. Both require medical help. \u201cMy friends won't talk to me anymore because of my negativity.\u201dWhat could they possibly do to make you better? Would you be able to stay that way after they did this magical thing? It\u2019s not that your friends are avoiding you because of your negativity, but because they seriously don\u2019t know how to help you. You need a trained professional to guide you through this, not your buddies. You need immediate help before you actually lose the fear of dying and decide to give it a try. What stopped me wasn\u2019t the fear of death, but the fear of surviving with a permanent disability or hideous injury. I\u2019ve gone beyond where you\u2019re at, though not that much farther. I had to go to the hospital. They didn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d me as much as put me on a life-improvement plan so that I can learn to better deal with myself and my issues. Also, while there, I did meet some pretty nice people who were dealing with similar problems, though through different causes. It helped me feel less alone. One of them talked just like John Wayne, it was pretty great when he read the daily newspaper to the ward! ",

            "answer_text": "I think you should give yourself a chance to recover before you kill yourself. I felt that way, My psychiatrist asked me to promise him I wouldn\u2019t make any serious decisions for three months to see if the medications could help me. He asked me not to quit my job, move out of my house, leave my wife and kids, or kill myself. When the three months were up, he asked for another three. At the end of six months, my depression had lifted just enough for me to have hope that I might not feel this way forever. It\u2019s eight or nine years later, now, and I\u2019m still alive! I\u2019m usually not feeling bad depression. Occasionally I dip down towards feeling like life is too painful to keep on going, but that hasn\u2019t lasted more than a few days or weeks in the last eight years. I was totally convinced I was a worthless loser. Those are the exact words, I thought. I thought everyone would be better off without me. Now, I have decided that it\u2019s ok to pursue what I find meaningful. I don\u2019t have to try to be what I think others want me to be. I have pretty much given up feeling shame about all the horrible things I did and all the harm I caused people I loved. I have stopped judging myself. I have stopped keeping secrets. I no longer pretend to be someone I\u2019m not. All this has taken a lot of pressure off of me, and so it\u2019s ok to be myself, instead of something I am totally ashamed of. I could easily slip back into the shame, and I do, from time to time. My recovery is a work in progress. It\u2019s always touch and go. However, I just want you to know that it is possible to learn to accept yourself as you are, and that will make your life a lot easier. It\u2019s not easy to do this. It takes lots of work. It takes years of work. It helps if you can devote your life to your recovery. In a way, you have to, because if you don\u2019t recover, then you could well end up ending your life. In any case, I\u2019m not trying to sugar coat anything. I hated that when I was depressed. This is my real experience. Yours will be different, but it might also be similar enough that you can end up in recovery, too. ",
