            "answer_text": "There are two types of Google Trends alternatives. The first do not rely on the data collected by the Google search engine and the second ones do. Major search engines like Baidu in China, Yandex in Russia, Bing/Yahoo offer their own services similar to Google Trends. These are free to use, to my knowledge. Bing\u2019s service is integrated into Excel as an Add On. It is called Bing Ads Intelligence. I think the data from yahoo is also integrated in it. I couldn\u2019t find Yahoo\u2019s version. Earlier, before 2012, yahoo had a service called Clue, which offered similar results like Google Trends. After the contract with Bing, I think yahoo has decided to concentrate their focus on other projects, but provide their search volume data to Bing Ads Intelligence. Baidu\u2019s service is https://index.baidu.com/ . To try it out, one needs a phone nr from China. Yandex alternative to Google Trends is https://wordstat.yandex.com/. There are other search engines like Naver from South Korea, ask, aol. I don\u2019t know whether they have similar services like Google Trends. There are also sites like semrush, moz, serpstat, keywordtool, etc.. I think they collect data from big search engines like google, amazon, bing, etc. and try to gain insight into the data for their customers, website administrators. ",
