            "answer_text": "The first story in the Sherlock Holmes series is A Study in Scarlet (Collins Classics) by Arthur Conan Doyle This is the story of how Dr.Watson, the narrator, met the eccentric Holmes for the first time and how they became flatmates. While it isn\u2019t the best of stories from a \u2018detection\u2019 point of view, it is a good introduction to the two main characters, serves to set Holmes up as the \u2018hero\u2019 and also introduces the logical deduction techniques that Holmes uses. The Hound of the Baskervilles (English) by Arthur Conan Doyle is great for the ominous, supernatural atmosphere it creates. No wonder many people have mentioned it as their favourite. Both of these are full-length novels. The other 2 novels, the Sign of the Four and the Valley of Fear, are, IMHO, not as good. Amongst the short stories, The Adventure of the Speckled Band and The Five Orange Pips are similar to The Hound of the Baskervilles in that they have an atmosphere of doom and horror about them. The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet, The Adventure of the Naval Treaty, The Adventure of the Priory School and The Adventure of the Second Stain are about respectable professional men of standing in society who are desperate because of theft/kidnapping from under their very noses. The Adventure of the Six Napoleons and The Adventure of the Red-Headed League start with strange situations that Holmes finds a simple solution for. And Silver Blaze is notable for the famous \u201ccurious incident of the dog in the night-time\u201d. I like The Adventure of the Dancing Men too, because it offers the reader a chance to try their hand at code-breaking. All of these are worth a read. P.S. You can read any of these stories online here, to check whether you have a taste for Holmes :) ",

            "answer_text": "The Sherlock Holmes series is nothing but a collection of short stories. The books are generally sold as Volume 1 and 2. A study in Scarlet is the first Sherlock Holmes story to be written. So you can start with that to understand Holmes and his chemistry with the Scotland Yard and Dr.Watson ;) The best thing about the Sherlock Holmes series is that the stories are never too technical or incomprehensible. Watson\u2019s narrative is simple and from a layperson\u2019s point of view. So you shouldn\u2019t have any problems with understanding the plots. Good luck and happy reading! ",
