            "answer_text": "There are smaller presses such as Subterranean Press (a SF press). They are well established and publish a variety of authors. There are similar presses for various genres. It helps to be well known -- at least published -- otherwise their risk is just too high. I suggest consider publication in a collection. Short story and novella length collections are published by all main vendors. Many are looking for new authors. Then there are magazines. Many literary magazines accept longer stories although it may have to edited into parts and split among issues. Again, if the story is good being an unknown is not a big problem. Obviously online publication is an option. There are reputable publishers handling online material. You don't have to go it alone if you want traditional publishing methods such as editing, proofing, artwork, and promotion.  ",

But it's an interesting concept for a big publisher with enough resources and coop money to get it into counter or endcap dumps in a lot of retail bookstores and nontraditional venus like supermarket checkout. In this TLDR era, a standalone work of fiction that was 32 pages long, by a major author (to start), just long enough to be perfect bound with a spine, that got major reviews, might make it.  ",
