            "answer_text": "The apostle of Jesus said God is love..not just an example..he is love. Love is also explaned in an applicable way..I believe God\u2019s nature is the same - Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance. ",

I'm a Muslim, and Allaah(God) says that he loves each one of his servants(i.e; each on of the people) like that of seventy mothers do to their only child and what's better than that. ",
