            "answer_text": "When you initially publish the book, amazon will ask for what kind of royalty would one prefer, usually it is either 30 percent or 10 percent with each having it's pros and cons. Once your book is listed on Amazon and sales happen, you can see it in your amazon kdp control panel. Your royalty payment will be calculated on a monthly basis. The payment will start on the third month from the date of publishing. For eg , if your book got published in March , your payment for the whole of March will happen around the last of May; like wise royalty for April will be paid around the last week of July , so on and so forth. The payments are separate for each amazon domain. IE your royalties will be separate for amazon.uk, amazon.in, .Ca etc ",
