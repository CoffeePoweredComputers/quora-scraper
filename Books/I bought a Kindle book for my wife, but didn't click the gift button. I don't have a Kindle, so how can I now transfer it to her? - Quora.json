But you can return the ebook you bought, and buy it again for your wife. Have you ever sent something back to Amazon, because it was damaged, they send the wrong color, etc.? Same process. Go to your list of orders, click on the order, and choose to return the product. Choose the \u201cbought by accident\u201d option. You get an email that the purchase price will be refunded. ",
