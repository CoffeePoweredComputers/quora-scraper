            "answer_text": "Although the Bible is made up 66 smaller books, (even Wikipedia describes it as \"a collection of sacred texts or scriptures...\"), it is still one book. In fact, in an article titled \u2018The Bible is a library, not a book,' Karl Giberson suggests that since the Bible is composed of several distinct books, the factuality or otherwise of a single book doesn\u2019t bear on the other books. According to him, \u201cYou cannot simply read a book like the Bible\u2014you have to read it through complex filters to properly understand it.\u201d In other words, you may accept the epistles In the New Testament and not believe that Exodus in the Old Testament is a historical reality. Responding to Giberson's treatise, Lita Cosner makes the following insightful remarks: Giberson\u2019s point seems to be that because the Bible is made up of lots of different documents, some of them may be more valuable for history than others; some may even contradict others. And if we were talking about a purely human document, it would be reasonable to expect this, because the documents were written over a period of many centuries. But Christians believe that God inspired Scripture in such a way that it does not contradict itself. Furthermore, Giberson\u2019s argument doesn\u2019t get him off the hook, because the NT authors cite Psalms as theological authorities. The view of the NT authors is that when interpreted correctly, all of Scripture is authoritative and binding. We can see that from how they use the Old Testament. What Christians should find troubling is how self-identifying evangelicals can so easily find inventive ways to reject Scripture while still holding on to some vestige of faith. This eventually becomes almost indistinguishable from the opinion of an atheist who doesn\u2019t believe in God in any sense the Christian would recognize, but thinks Jesus is a \u2018nice guy\u2019. But as we\u2019ve argued many times before, Jesus cites Genesis as history, and taught that Adam was a real person, and that the Flood was a real, global event. If that is the case, and if Genesis isn\u2019t the history Jesus thought it was, then Jesus can\u2019t be God, because He was wrong. So is the Bible one book or 66? It\u2019s both\u2014the 66 books were penned by many different authors over a span of over a thousand years, but the overarching messianic narrative binds them together into one unit. And they collectively bear witness to God\u2019s creation and His redemption of that creation. It\u2019s no surprise that Giberson\u2019s\u2018complex filters\u2019 work against the plain meaning of Scripture. http://creation.mobi/bible-one-book ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible is an anthology - a collection of stories written by as many as 40 different authors. These stories, for the New Testament, were written at various times after the death of Jesus - anywhere from 40 years later to hundreds of years later, depending on which historians you believe. None were actually written during the life of Jesus. There was no documentary team following Jesus around writing down what he said and did. All of the stories of the bible were written over about 1600 years. The Bible, as we read it today, has been translated into many languages, often from other translations. Errors creep into translations. Different languages do not always have the same meanings. Personal interpretations distort the originals. The King James Bible is a rewriting of the bible ordered by King James of England to \u201cconform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy\u201d. It was completed between 1604 and 1611 - recent enough history that we have quite a few records about it. So, no, the Bible isn\u2019t just one book and it doesn\u2019t have just one author. The originals have been rewritten many, many times by many different people over the centuries. ",
