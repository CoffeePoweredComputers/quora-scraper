            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not how many books, it\u2019s what books you read. On top of that, it doesn\u2019t matter what you read if you don\u2019t enjoy it. The only thing worse than having to read a dozen books is trying to read about a boring topic. But that\u2019s getting philosophical and what not, so I\u2019ll just give you the answer. Go for mostly non-fiction. Any topic. What ever you\u2019re interested in would be that best to go for. Like the civil war? There\u2019s a book called The Civil War, if I\u2019m not mistaken, that covers almost everything about it. Quantum Physics more your style? In Search Of Schrodinger's Cat covers the theories but not the mathematics. Prefer to think about ancient times? The Conqueror, about Alexander the Great, reads like a novel but is (more or less) historically true (warning- a little NSFW, so don\u2019t read it in school). If you can\u2019t find anything at your school, go to a local library. You can always find something there. The number of books you read depends heavily upon how fast you read. With a clear schedule, you could probably go one a week, depending on the book. With the things you have to deal with everyday, Don\u2019t be disappointed if you only get through a book a month. The important thing isn\u2019t how many books you\u2019re reading- it\u2019s the fact that you are reading. A lot of people put books down one they leave high school/college and never pick one up again. Even if you can only read a couple minutes a day, you are still improving your knowledge on whatever you read. And don\u2019t be afraid to go back to non-fiction once in a while, cause even the most interesting topic gets boring after a while. ",
