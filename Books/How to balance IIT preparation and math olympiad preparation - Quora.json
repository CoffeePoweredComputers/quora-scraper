            "answer_text": " Mathematics is not a subject to read students commit a blunder by reading the solutions to the problem instead of solving it. Even if a problem takes more time than required because such questions teach us which concepts must be applied where. Olympiad type problems tickle the brain and develop and aptitude to handle tough and lengthy questions such questions sharpen are innovative skills and a single question might test a variety of concepts in a single go. I am not recommending you to solve a huge number of Olympiad problems but affair bit of exposure visually help you in solving Jee mathematics problems. You will surely underperform if the in the subject if you consider Olympiad as a burden. Don't consider it to be a gallows pole take interest in solving problems that evade you and you will surely excel in both Jee mathematics and Olympiad mathematics. A word of caution mathematics is not something which follows no set of algorithms nor has definite formulae for every question mixing and matching approaches is the best way object best way. Objective approaches need to be used with caution at times they tend to waste more time than they are expected to save. The most common mistake that people make is they don\u2019t choose the right set of books to prepare for Olympiads. This is the book that I recommend that will help you crack RMO and INMO easily if you go through it: Arihant\u2019s Maths Olympiad book You should visit my blog where I frequently write about JEE related stuff and what it takes to score a good rank in JEE Advanced.
