            "answer_text": "Not bad at all! Your comprehension is much higher than mine was before I was professionally trained. Most people read at 250wpm, give or take. Speed reading starts at about 450wpm. The world record is around 4500wpm, but honestly, I don't believe that the average person can read beyond 1200wpm and maintain high enough retention for any sustained period of time. I've met some people who read 2,500wpm (my partner), but I think they may have a genetic advantage. We've trained about 60,000 people through our online courses, and most all of the folks I hear from who don't have a disadvantage like dyslexia report 500-700wpm speeds. It's rare that I hear from someone reading faster than 1,000wpm - especially because I myself can only reach 800wpm at my peak. (I average 650-700wpm depending on a multitude of factors)  ",

            "answer_text": "I personally read at 3 times that speed with only slightly worse comprehension (79%) but depending on where you started from it is pretty good especially if you haven\u2019t had formal training or have consistently struggled in English classes. If you keep reading faster and faster every day you will eventually be able to read at 500wpm then 600wpm just keep working also congratulations on having that high of a comprehension I have some friends that read as fast as me but only have 40\u201360% comprehension.
