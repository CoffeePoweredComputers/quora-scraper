            "answer_text": "Many people here gave great answers. Don't forget, there's never one correct answer to explain a work of art. So all of then can be valid. I will add a few humble points myself. Fitzgerald is a part of the \u2018Lost generation\u2019, as Gertrude Stein dubbed them, among which is Hemingway and some others, and on its outskirts, Ezra Pound as well. They were \u2018lost\u2019 after WW I and floated around Europe and especially Paris, Italy and Spain ( Sun Also Rises,etc), looking for their lost identity and expression, after the trauma of the Great War, in which Hemingway even participated and got wounded ( Farewell to Arms). They generally drank a lot and got into fights, played tennis, watched the bulls run in Pamplona, went fishing, drank some more, went skiing, had affairs and got into arguments. Among all this business, they managed to write as well. Some of it was great. Check out Woody Allen\u2019s film Midnight in Paris! An excellent farce of these times, with many of the famous artists of the time portrayed. Fitzgerald was particularly concerned with wealth. He was not wealthy, and his girlfriend, the famous Zelda, was very upwardly aspirational. I believe she wouldn't marry him before he made himself famous. She's very much a \u2018Daisy\u2019, self-involved little spoiled girl. It's important to remember that this was a time of great disappointment and the breaking off, forcefully, from the wonderful pre-War World. The World will never be the same after this War. Great Gatsby is clutching on to the greatness of the pre WWI, which he was not a part of, because he is a self made, nay, a self made up man. He is great if Trump is great. He has that kind of greatness, though he's not as malevolent. He's a mirage. He's not entirely real at all. He lives to impress and he aspires to greatness, to win Daisy, the vapid, bloodless, pale interpretation of the American Dream. Sort of like a Melania Trump. Completely borin, empty clothes\u2019 rack, who is capable of producing one daughter, to whom she pays very little mind. A sexless, brainless wisp of a woman, who's an immature little girl, incapable of any realness. And this is whom Gatsbyy wants so much! However, she's not completely without a charm, she has a charm of a cotton candy from a country fairgrounds. She's a junk food version of a damsel in distress, of a \u2018Lady\u2019 worth fighting for. All fake, all a lie. Much like America is now. Great Gatsby is not \u2018great\u2019 at all. What's great is his delusion. Much like American aspirations for material wealth and outwardly flash, it has no substance, and it's all based on lies and manipulation, even criminal activity. And what's more, it will never give its actors real fulfilment or happiness, because that comes from a balance of hard work, altruism, education and then personal pleasure. ( Check out the emptiness of being a Kardashian and \u2018keeping up\u2019 with that!) Worse yet, it ends in loneliness and murder. What's great about that? Yes, Great Gatsby put on a great show. It was great entertainment. But for himself, Gatsby remains small and lonely. I suppose, only his love for Daisy is great. However, it's all a selfish romantic bubble as well, though in some ways Gatsby and Daisy are well suited, since they are both infantile, self impressed figures. Tom keeps Daisy grounded, even though he's cruel. I still believe his love is more real than Gatsby\u2019s. Look at the position of Gatsby\u2019s manse. It looks onto the old moneyed Connecticut from the nuveau riche Long Island. ( I live on the \u2018Gold Coast\u2019 of Long Island, close to where Gatsby\u2019s house supposedly was!) his whole life is trying to be something he's not! What a rude awakening! Much like the America of today! There's a rise of the wealthy, and more and more poor. \u2018MAKE America GREAT again!\u2019 slogans like that. What does that really mean? Get an orange tan and a vapid looking wife, no education, made up achievements and get a bunch of brash wardrobe? Throw lavish parties for people you don't know? Befriend criminals? Get involved in get rich quick schemes\u2026.all the while longingly looking onto the other side you can never reach, the other side who's time is probably over anyway!? So, in conclusion, the Gatsby is \u2018great\u2019, because his illusions and aspirations are great. He may be great to the untrained eye. But up close he's a lonely, empty, shell of a made up man. However, he did have some true romance to him. The tea party made for Daisy was my favourite. They tried to rekindle their youthful romance. There was a great esthetic to that. It didn't translate into real life. They caused harm. But it was a brief splendor in the grass. Gatsby is unforgettable. The juxtaposition of the dreams, illusion and harsh reality of the brutal ruling classes and suffering working class..etc, is striking. The last flash in the pan of how Amreica may have been great once\u2026before the Great War\u2026a last look into the dying Old World, of carefree lulled existence and endless parties and bottomless champagne\u2026that all is very romantic and enchanting\u2026but it's not real\u2026the gas station on the way to the harsh and rough NYC is real\u2026the dead body in the pool is real\u2026the cheating husband is real\u2026the hysterical mechanic\u2019s wife is real\u2026the heat of a Summer afternoon in NY is real\u2026. However, I will never forget Gatsby\u2019s crisp white suits and Daisy\u2019s floaty dresses and their dreamy looks\u2026after all, that was the movie my Elementary School ever first Boyfriend watched on our ever first date! And he was so embarrassed that he sat in a row in front of me\u2026aaahh\u2026those were the days! THEY were GREAT! Ps I do recommend reading Great Gatsby and Tender is the Night. And seeing the version of Gatsby with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. Make America read the Greats again! ",

            "answer_text": "\"The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald's third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career. This exemplary novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted \"gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,\" it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s. The Great Gatsby is one of the great classics of twentieth-century literature.\" --From the back cover of A Cornell Edition of The Great Gatsby.  Character sketch of Jay Gatsby-The Great Gatsby You'll find full description of Jay Gatsby at LitCul.com however I'll cover few points here. Gatsby is no more than a simple man who lives, loves, and dies. But perhaps he is much more than that \u2013 a hero for all dreamers, one who stands for the survival of his dreams even in the face of unconquerable adversity, and one who dies tragically, an honourable yet empty man, with an army of faithful readers mourning his defeat in death but unceasingly admiring his disposition in life. Perhaps, just maybe, it is what he is fighting for that everyone can relate to. When it comes down to it, Gatsby is fighting to chase a love that is slipping too quickly into his past for him to catch. We, as the readers, know that Gatsby\u2019s desire for Daisy\u2019s love is a hopeless case, yet we want so badly for him to be happy; it is this paradox that brings us all together in support of Gatsby. It is what makes us hate Daisy when she cries over the shirts. It is what makes us love him when he puts his pride aside to hide in the bushes to make sure she is alright. It is what makes us sick when Gatsby\u2019s body is floating dead in his pool. It is what makes us feel as though we are there at his funeral, mourning the loss of a close friend. In Gatsby, F. Scot Fitzgerald has developed a character that can only be considered great, and develops it all the way to the end of the novel. He created Jay Gatsby to embody the American dream. That unique American ability to go from rags to riches. A dream that is the epitome of all dreams, and that all people have dreamt at one time or another: The poor boy or the broke soldier having the very very rich girl, and rising to the class of the rich and famous. James Gatz, the man who would become Jay Gatsby, had only $5 in his pocket when he arrived in New York and met Wolfshiem(from the end of the book after Gatsby's death) This little piece of info shows that in a mere 3 years, he went from nothing to owning one of the largest houses in New York speaking to the most powerful people around, and throwing parties that every important person in the Us attended. This is the American Dream. F. Scot Fitzgerald places him as a mid-west good old boy, who went into the Army to fight \"the great war\". He is the all American boy. Then we find out that he had a list of things to guide his life and become great. Even though F. Scott Fitzgerald could have stopped there, he did not feel that James Gatz had truly become great. He points out that Gatsby, unlike everyone else, achieved this greatness for love. When one person selflessly gives themselves, sacrifices themselves, sacrifices everything they have, and even gives their life for someone else; they are greater than anyone. Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy, to win her love, is the dream he lives for, and hope sustains him. Daisy is Gatsby's version of the American Dream, the love of his life, the perfect housewife, the ultimate status, \"the king's daughter, the golden girl\" (however all of these qualities are just Gatsby's idealization of her after dreaming about her for five years) and he is willing to sacrificing everything to obtain her. James Gatz lived his entire life to love Daisy. When he shows her the stuff in his house, he's showing her the house he has created for her. He doesn't really care for any of this - it's all done specifically for her. Even the parties stopped when she didn't like them. Eventually, Gatsby wins Daisy's love but this is short lived due the confrontation with Tom, where Gatsby is defeated, as Tom establishes that Daisy will stop having an affair because she is part of the Establishment, and Gatsby is a law-breaker. This is the point of the novel, where the limitations of Gatsby's greatness are revealed, as all he lives for are dreams, idealizations of reality which will ultimately leave him unsatisfied as he will never reach that perfect world in the end, he says that he will tell the police that he was driving, he waits outside her house like a gallant knight, and finally takes a bullet for her for her so that she may live on. Jay Gatsby has lived and created all that he has in the name of love and the name of Daisy, not James Gatz or Jay Gatsby.The last comment from Gatsby is about Daisy coming to him, and Nick responds by stating that Gatsby is better then all of them. So Gatsby dies for love and for the people. Moreover he is great in all desires and all his dids. You can also read 'The Great Gatsby' Summary ",
