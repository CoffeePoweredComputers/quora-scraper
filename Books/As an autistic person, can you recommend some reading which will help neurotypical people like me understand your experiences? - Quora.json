            "answer_text": "Hi Paul, I hope I interpret your question correctly. When you say \u201c\u2026 understand your experiences\u201d - I\u2019m not sure if you mean literally you want to hear individual accounts of what it is like to autistic.. or if you are looking for a general \u201coverall\u201d sense of what it is like being autistic? I\u2019m reading a book by Ian Ford called \u201cA Field Guide to Earthlings\u201d - It is a break down of how neurotypical people conduct their lives.. How they function. It is a guide for Autistic people to understand NT people. It may give you a sense of what we do not understand about NTs. Sort of a reverse psychology\u2026 If you see how we have to break down your behavior, it may give you a sense of how we think and operate differently than you\u2026 Just a thought. You will see me emphasize this in almost all my answers: That ND and NT people have neurological systems that function in totally different ways. This difference affects the fundamental foundations of sensory input - thought processes - physical and psychological needs\u2026. etc. This directly affects how we communicate and build our social structures. How we control ourselves\u2026 regulate our nervous systems - what we attend to, how we learn, etc.. What you need to understand is OUR experience of autism is as normal to us as your experiences of being neurotypical is normal to you. It is also mostly an subconscious experience.. This is why autistic people can live among NT people and never question that our experience is any different than yours. I went 59 years before I discovered I was autistic! I have a friend who has synesthesia. Where the senses will cross\u2026 where another person\u2019s emotions become their own.. or where you can smell red or feel it or hear it. From her perspective that is normal\u2026 and people do not talk about \u201cnormal\u201d.. it is just assumed to be \u201ccommon sense\u201d . I remember about 13 years ago\u2026 I was at work and someone brought cookies. As I was eating it.. I said Oh\u2026 cinnamon, real butter, brown sugar, a little salt, vanilla, \u2026 And people looked at me like I was performing a magic trick. I though everyone could pick out the individual ingredients of food. It still did not register that this was unique in any way. Just like every NT has a unique experience of life.. so does every autistic person. I cannot know what another autistic person is actually experiencing. BUT - we do have a common sense rooted in our type of neurology. We understand heightened senses\u2026 thinking in routines and patterns. Styles of communication and socialization. Thought processes, hyper focusing - special interests. Self stimming - Common comorbid disorders like ADD - Alexithymia - Echolalia - OCD - This is a reflection of our NORMAL Neurological processes. If an NT was raised in a totally autistic supportive society, because of the absence of a true connection with the autistic people around them, they would KNOW they were with other NTs because of a shared \u201ccommon sense\u201d We feel this strongly among ourselves because we have been \u201cisolated\u201d within an NT society. This is why I strongly emphasize letting autistic children BE autistic ( as well as adults) - This is why I say, the neurotypical society evolved to support the NT neurology not the Autistic neurology. Every effort should be made to make an autistic child\u2019s environment as supportive of their neurological \u201cnormal\u201d as the neurotypical child\u2019s environment is supportive of theirs. I would like you to listen to some of the interviews I\u2019ve recorded. Just conversations with others who are autistic, about their lives. What they experienced growing up\u2026 Many are late diagnosed and still discovering and embracing their autistic traits. People who are autistic learn about them selves by relating to common experiences in these videos\u2026 it is a way we find our own autistic traits.. Traits that have been buried under years of \u201cmasking\u201d to the point we do not know what our \u201cautistic\u201d expressions are. These are on YouTube at my channel called \u201cMy ASD Journey\u201d It started out as short web-cam vids of my pre and post diagnosis process. What was going through my head as I tried to understand, \u201cI really am AUTISTIC!\u201d The ones called \u201cDiscovering Autism\u201d are the interviews.. Its a work in progress as I get better equipment and my skills develop too\u2026 \u201cAutism Inside-Out\u201d are my own thoughts of different topics I was trying to understand\u2026 It is important to remember that every person with autism is very unique. More so than the normal variations within the NT population. So if you are trying to get a general sense what we experience, you will find HUGE variations and combinations of traits. You will almost be starting over with every person you meet. Remember we are fundamentally different than you.. But we share similar needs like social / emotional connections. We like to feel good about ourselves\u2026 and feel we contribute something to others. Talk about things that interest us.. and so on.. But there are great variations among us about how we do this. Some of us will have PhDs\u2026 some will be non-vocal and struggle with daily living skills. Yea\u2026. THAT big of difference. Keep an open mind\u2026 Give us time to understand YOU as well\u2026 Also know that many autistic people have had hurtful and even harmful experiences in the NT society.. whether intentional or unintentional. Once bitten- twice shy! Keep that in mind. But know\u2026. we really do want to know you if you really do want to know us! Thank you for reaching out to our community! ",

(We are a very loquacious people.) My version of an answer is this; Quora. Here you get multiple Autistic authors so you will get a good range of the \u201cAutistic experience,\u201d the good, the bad, the beautiful and the ugly. You can begin to see our unique variations. The official literature will give you descriptions of \u201csymptoms,\u201d here you will get descriptions of how it \u201cfeels\u201d to be Autistic. If you have good observational skills you will see the individual ways we (Autistic people,) experience, interpret, and cope with the \u201cchallenges.\u201d You will also see our social and communicative differences in HOW we answer questions, HOW we interpret the wording of questions, and sometimes the consequences of using ambiguous wording in said questions. On Quora you will get the experiences of those diagnosed early in life, those of us diagnosed late in adulthood, and those who haven\u2019t been able to get a diagnosis. (Lack of money for physical/mental healthcare is a massive factor and challenge Autistic people.) 20 minutes of surfing the answers in our little corner of Quora will give you a good starting point in learning how we experience the world. Books aren\u2019t that good at describing our existence because unless it is an Autistic author, you are getting conjecture, not actual real life experiences. They can imagine what it is like, but can never know. (Just as I cannot \u201cknow\u201d your life experience.) They will tell you all about \u201cAdherence to rigid patterns of thought or behaviour,\u201d but can never elucidate how it feels to be bound to an internal set of \u201crules\u201d you cannot break, no matter how much you want to. The effort and agony doesn\u2019t translate well. TL/D(or can\u2019t)R Choose Autistic authors. Surf Quora\u2019s Autism space, this gives you a large sample population to examine. Don\u2019t ignore the angry answers outright. That pain is usually caused by the struggles Autistic people commonly have living in a social environment we are not designed for. There is bile, but that is clinically significant as well. Ask us ANYTHING but be very specific of the wording of your question. We will generally answer any question: The more we need to \u201cdecode\u201d the question, the likelier we are to miss the answer you were looking for. Thank you. Your question came at a time I am feeling very misunderstood and ignored. I appreciate knowing that a human I will never meet cares enough to try and understand my reality. Be most well. ",

We\u2019re so fundamentally different than you that unless you could walk in our shoes (which of course you can\u2019t), you are just as incapable of understanding us as we are of understanding you. My experience with my neurotypical friends has been that no matter how much l try to explain it or no matter what they read about it, they still don\u2019t get it. Their attempts at mirroring back to me what they think they \u201cget\u201d amounts to the blind taking stabs in the dark. In the same way, their unrealistic expectations of me remain unchanged. No matter how much l tell them l am incapable of meeting their expectations in some area, they are unable to really believe or accept that. They remain frustrated, baffled, and judgmental. They think if l know that l can\u2019t do something, that l can therefore learn how to change or be different. But l can\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible. My brain is hardwired the way it is. There are no workarounds. l can try to pretend to be something l\u2019m not, to try to fake a superficial approximation of an appearance. That might make them a little more comfortable sometimes, but it\u2019s just an illusion, it\u2019s not really happening.

Just enjoy the reading. It will guide you towards seeing things from different perspectives. Which is much needed around Autism & Asperger\u2019s. \ud83d\udc97With the books you pick it up without dedicated effort.  The scholar\u2019s path is along the extensive work of Dr. Grunya Sukhareva, Dr. Hans Asperger, Dr. Natasha Campbell, Dr. Franz Xaver Mayr AND Pestalozzi. When you look into it learn from them to look with the \ud83d\udc97 ! It\u2019s ever-present. Dr. Asperger\u2019s work and results with SOS Children's Villages - Wikipedia in the 1960s and 70s does tell it all. But without walking in the footsteps of a giant one can still miss seeing the vast landscape of autism. Dr. Asperger wrote about 100 scientific papers but the needed answers are in thinking through how he got to the findings. Researchers present results but no maps for how to get to them. Some provide raw data, which helps. Discoverers like Vasco da Gama and Marco Polo got us some sketchy overview and maps of planet earth but it was satellite images and ev. Google earth that mapped out the planet completely and in a very useful and accessible way. We got a surface overview but still nearly no info on all the depths of the oceans and when it comes to the inside every mother gets better ultra sound pictures of the baby(ies) while the baby is still in the belly ;) It seems that that compared to Autism-mapping will turn out to have been a simple and easy job. Dr. Asperger realized the necessity to research and define any aspect of Autism from the outside until one hits something scientifically solid. The normal and common scientific approach is to work from the inside outwards and look how far it reaches. Which is what Dr. Kanner did and this is still reflected in the DSM5. Working from inside out one will find that Autism, just like the universe never really ends - that it rather \u2018dilutes\u2019 first into a vast array of comorbidities until a sparse number of true NTs is left but we can say for sure that there is more \u2018out there\u2019 by changing species via looking at chimpanzees and gorillas first. Finding a clear separating line from apes to humans is easy. When it comes to NTs with some Autism comorbidity(ies) we don\u2019t even have a name for it yet although it is the majority of the world population. What is needed next is a Vasco da Gama of autism and to accept that we are still far away in time from a Google-Autism. The minimum needed to understand is that Autism is like a hilltop full of TV, Mobile phone and radio towers and that signals are received in some places and not in others until all fade so much that there is no reception at all = NTs. Of the hilltop transmitters we know only one well, the digestive system and we can see as well that genetics are not a main source or cause. To provide a beginning, a kind of launchpad into overview I put the Asperger's space together. Please use it the way it is meant to - a tool! All the best, \ud83d\udc97 W Please see the vast playing field of NatURe first: Which co-morbidities and co-occurrences regarding Autism (ASD) are you aware of? ",

However, one of the best overall sources of information on autism and it\u2019s many and varied co-morbid conditions, comes from Tony Attwood in Australia. Professor, clinical psychologist and parent to an autistic son, he is one of the best as far as diagnosing and treating autism. And while most of the professional world is still wearing blinders regarding autism, he is a font of knowledge with the clinical experience and observational skills to not only explain autism to the neuro-typical world, he explains it to us, the autistics!

            "answer_text": "Yes. On YouTube, I sometimes watch talks by someone called Professor Tony Attwood. He\u2019s written books on autism and although I\u2019ve never read them myself, judging by how much I identify with what he says in his talks about people with autism, I think they should be good books. Also, if you\u2019re in the UK, then the National Autistic Society website has a lot of information about autism. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s like for others, but for me personally a small logical thing can upset me. Like a curry we usually have isn\u2019t the right yellow. But I can describe the feeling now, if you lay down or stand up and stretch up, just keep stretching and don\u2019t stop. That\u2019s what it feels like. You feel adrenaline and you literally feel you heart and you start to get filled with energy that feel vibrate which makes you jump up and down, contort and flap your hands really hard. And it doesn\u2019t stop until the mistake is corrected. But the worst part is that you KNOW its nothing to be upset about and you are present in the moment KNOWING it\u2019s not something to be mad about. But your body disagrees. That\u2019s the common scenario. It\u2019s happened when someone comes and puts a puzzle piece in the puzzle you are doing, smells and/or textures could set you off. Getting hugged could cause a lash out and quick scream. 9/10 I catch these meltdowns. But usually I black out. Hope this was helpful.  ",
