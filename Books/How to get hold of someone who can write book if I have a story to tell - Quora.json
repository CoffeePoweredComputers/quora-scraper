            "answer_text": "Ghostwriting has been a time-honored profession in the publishing industry. There are many people who have interesting stories to tell, but are absolutely terrible at writing or putting those stories in text in a logical manner. Ghostwriting is also very secretive, as most people who have had their books ghostwritten don\u2019t want the public to know they weren\u2019t really the ones who put their words into narrative prose. Also, readers tend to bristle when they discover the person whose name is on the cover wasn\u2019t actually the person who wrote the book. This very negative reaction is the key reason that most publishers try to keep the ghostwriting as secretive as possible. James Patterson has sold over 300 million books. He regularly uses ghostwriters for his novels, admitting that he is much better at dreaming up the plots than he is producing the actual prose. To be fair, Patterson credits his ghostwriters by naming them as cowriters on his novels. So he is very open about the fact that he employs ghostwriters. Most celebrities who have \u201cwritten\u201d books did not actually write their books. The ghostwriter who is hired to write for them may spend several months interviewing the celebrity on the subjects the celebrity wants to touch upon about their lives and then writes the prose based on those interviews. The work is then reviewed by the celebrity, to make sure there aren\u2019t any irregularities or false entries\u2014or stuff they don\u2019t want public\u2014and the ghostwriter adjusts those parts as requested. When the manuscript is completed, it goes to editing, then publishing. Why use a ghostwriter? In the case of most celebrities, they don\u2019t have the time to write while working at whatever it is that made them famous. Some people have interesting stories to tell, but just cannot write it out. Others have great story ideas, but cannot put those ideas to words. Why would someone want to be a ghostwriter? There are some people who love to write, but lack the talent to create story ideas. I have friends who look at me like I\u2019m some sort of monster because of how all these wild ideas keep coming out of me. A common question I\u2019ve heard all my life is, \u201cHow the %#@! do you come up with this stuff?!\u201d Just because someone can\u2019t come up with a story idea doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t write beautifully if given an idea to run with.

The way that you write the story will be significantly different that someone else. But, if you are completely opposed to writing the story, then try to find a family member or friend who is willing. Or possibly someone they know. Don\u2019t limit yourself just because you have not done something before. ",

You can search for a creative writing course and pen it down yourself, maybe with the help of a tutor. If you think the story is really good and should be published, you can write a small pitch and contact literary agents: if they find it compelling they\u2019ll sifr you with a ghost writer :) ",
