            "answer_text": "Depends a bit on how you define \u201cpopular.\u201d Are Visual Novels more popular in Japan than anywhere else in the world? Yes, they certainly are. But let us take a closer look, here. Are they popular enough to: \u2026 have a multi-million dollar industry behind them?\u2026 release hundreds of titles every year?\u2026 have public ads hanging in subway trains/stations?\u2026 have tie-ins with cafes and shops frequented by young people?\u2026 fill dozens of floors in the shops in Akihabara and elsewhere?The answer to all of that is \u201cyes\u201d.   You can literally get lost in there\u2014and all those shots are just from Akihabara. But that\u2019s not the whole story, either. Because despite all that popularity, they are still a phenomenon largely confined to the Japanese 2D-subculture scene. And even within that context, they are still massively less popular than manga and somewhat less popular than anime. So, to continue the list, are they popular enough: \u2026 to be known, understood and accepted by the general population?Not really.\u2026 that an average Japanese would have touched one in his or her life? Not really. So there. They are kind of a big thing in Japan. And any (esp. male) youngster between 14 and 25 will have heard of them\u2014quite possibly even have played one, if he is into anime in general. But even so, they are still nowhere near to being a \u201cmainstream population\u201d phenomenon. ",
