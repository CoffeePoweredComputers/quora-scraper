            "answer_text": "Friend, You are not alone. The cool thing is that, unlike many people, you\u2019ve chosen to ask this question and seek ways to improve. Reading was one of my favorite things growing up. After suffering severe brain injuries in a car accident, my ability to read was severely compromised. In elementary school, I read as a college student. At college age, I read as an elementary student. How do you fix it? WORK. Read everything. All the time. If you don\u2019t understand a word, look it up. Take classes on grammar so that you understand what all these little punctuation marks actually mean. Sometimes, understanding what someone is saying is a product of understanding \u201chow\u201d they\u2019re saying it. If you can\u2019t look up a word, look for context clues. If an author calls something \u201catrocious\u201d and goes on to talk about how bad it is - or why it\u2019s so bad, that gives you a hint. Atrocious isn\u2019t good. When I don\u2019t understand a word, but I don\u2019t want to stop reading, I write it in the margin and look it up when I\u2019m done with that chapter. So. There\u2019s some tips for improvement. Good luck! (By the way, I recovered my reading ability and went on to get honors degrees. I think I read better now than I did before my injuries.) ",

            "answer_text": "Visit the johnson o\u2019connor institute website and take advantage of the vocabulary resources Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation you\u2019re right! slow reading is typically a function of low comprehension. believe it or not, your comprehension can improve as your reading speed improves.There are two things holding you back. Vocabulary - lack of familiarity with words slows you down a lot. by builiding your vocabulary you will avoid the problem of words you don\u2019t know or recognize slowing you down.. Subvocalization - a bad habit is deveped in the primary grades when the teachers ask students to read out loud. We learn to vocalize what we read. you can\u2019t speak faster than about 250/ wpm. the result is that because many of us subvocalize, our reading speed is capped by our talking speed. you can unlearn subvocalizing by forcing your self to say nonsense words while you read. essentially you simply talk outloud any nonsense words (lalalalala) or whatever to \u2018break\u2019 the habit of talking to your self while you read. over time, the connection between your eyes and your vocal chords is broken freeing your eyes and mind up to safely read above your talking speed. I took Evelyn Wood in college and still read comfortably over 1000 wpm. ",
