            "answer_text": "Usually going to Manage Your Content and Devices and removing past devices will do the trick (as noted elsewhere). If you have the device (particularly with iOS, I've heard), it can be helpful to actually remove the book from the device and let the device sync. I have heard of people having issues with Kindle Apps, where de-registering them doesn't fully free up the license. I've also heard of this happening after updating the Kindle app, where the system thinks the new version is a new device. If licenses end up \"trapped\" like this, contacting customer support can help. I've also heard of one other issue causing the problem (not sure if it's still an issue). If your credit card on file has expired, you may get this error. I believe it has something to do with authenticating that the purchaser is real (because you can decrypt the books and share them online - I believe they are watermarked so that they can track that back to the purchaser, who they would like to be a real person). Some people crack all their books, to avoid concerns like this (particularly after Amazon deleted Orwell's books from people's devices a number of years ago, and refunded their money, after realizing they weren't authorized to sell electronic copies of it), though I've never heard of somebody not being able to access their content after taking the steps listed above.

            "answer_text": "What kind of license do you have? Kindle Unlimited? Despite its name, it doesn\u2019t allow unlimited borrowing. You can only borrow ten books at a time. If you have already borrowed ten books at the moment, you need to return one before you can borrow the book of your choice again. There\u2019s also a device limitation. I believe it\u2019s currently six devices per user. If you\u2019ve tried to download the book to a new device, Amazon may not allow it. In this case, try downloading it to one of your regular devices. Or go to your Amazon user dashboard and delete any device you\u2019re no longer using, e.g. a Kindle that broke years ago. This is the general situation. There may be regional differences depending on the country where you live, because Amazon has different rules on Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon de, and all the other Amazons. Also bear in mind that Amazon keeps changing rules all the time, so what worked last year may no longer apply, and what is correct today may no longer be valid next week. I hope this helps. ",
