            "answer_text": "Kon\u2019nichiwa! (^_^) Hello! (^_^) Ogenki desu ka? How are you? Well, Japanese (Nihongo, \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e) is one of the most seemingly-impossible-to-learn languages. Learning to speak, read and write this language isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea. The Official Language of Japan (Nihon, \u65e5\u672c meaning: Land of the Rising Sun).Spoken by ~128 million people (about 1.8% of the world\u2019s population) Has an extensive grammatical system to express politeness and formality.Like we Indians, the Japanese also never forget their language and culture after settling down in other countries. Question: Is learning Japanese for an Indian helpful? Yes, from a career or business perspective. If you\u2019re interested, then why not? For further explanation to the query, please refer: Shivam Narang's answer to Is learning Japanese language useful for Indians? (hope this helps) Otherwise, if you're interested in pursuing your higher studies in Japan (Master\u2019s or Research or Doctorate) in English/Japanese courses in field of: (A) Japan related Humanities (B) Japan related Social Science (C) Information Technology (D) Mathematical Science (E) Physics (F) Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (G) Biology and Biotechnology (H) Agriculture and Fishery (I) Environmental Science (J) Pharmaceutical Science (K) Geology and Geoinformatics (L) Civil Engineering (M) Architecture (N) Material Science / Engineering (O) Electrical Engineering (P) Electronics & Communications Engineering (Q) Mechanical Engineering (R) Aerospace Engineering (S) Robotics. Then you should definitely give a try. Embassy of Japan in India:Studying in Japan All application procedures for Japanese Government (Monbukagakusho: MEXT) Scholarships are conducted through Japanese embassy/consulates in India, or institutions of higher education in Japan.  Despite being intimidating, Japanese is not that hard as one may think! It\u2019s a highly analytical language, as: Japanese nouns have no genders, plural forms, or accompanying articles to learn.The language also has only two verb tenses, present and past, and includes very few irregular verbs.Spoken Japanese has only 5 vowel sounds and spelling is phonetically consistent, making the language relatively easy to pronounce.The Grammar of Japanese is very similar to that of Korean. Both languages have an equally advanced system of honorifics for showing respect.Japanese takes its Kanji writing system from the Chinese system of ideographs.Learning Japanese brings you a step closer to taking on Korean or Chinese because of the above two reasons.  There are four different writing systems of Japanese: R\u014dmaji, which is simply the latin representation of Japanese. ( As illustrated earlier: kon\u2019nichiwa or hello)Hiragana is the Japanese alphabet. All words can be written in it. 3. Kanji characters are originally from China. China uses only Kanji (and is called Hanzi)   4. Katakana is used to write foreign, 'borrowed' words in Japanese. Eg : Taxi (English) : \u30bf\u30af\u30b7\u30fc (Katakana) and Takush\u012b (Romanji) - sounds similar, but pronounced (kinda) differently due to English & Japanese separate accents.  Eg: Japan in english, Nihon in r\u014dmaji; Hiragana: \u306b\u307b\u3093 ; Kanji: \u65e5\u672c ; Or say:  Hiragana was created from Kanji to write some letters faster than writing with only Kanji. Combining all of them in a sentence will then will you realize or easily define some signs and read even faster.  Traditionally, Japanese is written in a format called tategaki, which is inspired by the traditional Chinese system. In this format, the characters are written in columns going from top to bottom, with columns ordered from right to left. After reaching the bottom of each column, the reader continues at the top of the column to the left of the current one. 2. Modern Japanese also uses another writing format, called yokogaki. This writing format is horizontal and reads from left to right, as in English. Despite facing difficulties, I still am learning the language on my own and I enjoy it (just yokogaki), THANKS To Duolingo.  Japan is a very interesting country: With high level of technology, beautiful culture, polite, punctual, clean, innovative and very-hardworking people live there. Some specialties : \u00b7 Ramen or Sushi or bento dishes\u2026.. (respectively)     \u00b7 Samurai, ninja, yakuza, sumo \u2026 (respectively)      \u00b7 Sakura (cherry blossom) festival   \u00b7 Kimono (Japanese traditional outfit)   \u00b7 Japanese Dolls (Hina dolls)   \u00b7 Karaoke   \u00b7 Anime   \u00b7 Manga  and so on.  Conclusion: When you learn Japanese, you become not only proficient in the language but also gain an insider view of the culture. Japan is already added to my bucket-list. How about you?
