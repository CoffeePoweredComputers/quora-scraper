            "answer_text": "Here is what I can interpret from your spread. Past - 6 of pentacles, 7 of cups, death reversed: This guy is someone who you know from long time and the relationship was pleasant initially. He made you feel valued, and it was not a superficial kind of relationship. You might have split for short time before, but again reconciled. Let me know if this is the case. Since the relationship holds so much importance for you, you have been really confused in the past with lots of things going on at same time, lots of opinions from different people. Your mind has been going in multiple directions at the same time. These confusions could be the reason your relationship deteriorated at the first place. Death reversed says that you\u2019ve not been able to make any concrete decision in past, resulting in an on-and-off relationship. Present - The stars reversed, the magician, 3 of swords: Owing to confusions and accumulated emotions since long, you are now giving up on hope on this relationship. However, your thoughts are forming your reality. Even at this point, if you introduce even slightest hope in your relationship, you can save it. You have everything in place, but hopelessness and the notion that things cannot become better are killing your relationship. Obviously, a lot of disappointment is what you\u2019re experiencing at this time. Future - 2 of pentacles, the sun, 5 of wands reversed. If you go on with this relationship, you may have to juggle between various aspects of your life, perfect the balancing act and keep aside notions of others. This way will not be easy and will give you a lot of fight. However, if you overcome this phase with positivity and balanced approach, I can see a lot of promise and potential in your relationship. My initial thoughts are you shouldn\u2019t move over in a hasty manner but fight for it for one last time. Try to overcome fear, hopelessness, and try to bring more balance to your life. I end with saying that this is what I interpreted from tarot cards in your spread. However, you are the best person who knows about your specific life conditions. Do what your heart and intuition says you to do. ",

            "answer_text": "From my point of view, too many cards for such a simple question and \u201cshould\" questions aren't good, basically because the choice is yours. I would have asked \u201cwhat would be the most likely result if I made a move on X?\u201d. Anyway. 6 of pentacles / 7 of cups / Death reversed. In the past there was some mutual interest, even subtle flirting, but it didn't go further than that. The Star reversed / Magician reversed / 3 of swords. Pain and destruction. Not a good idea. 2 of pentacles / The Sun / 5 of wands reversed. Trying to turn the situation in your favour by \u201cdecyphering\" an interest that is not clear leads to conflict. Not a very good idea. Next time though, keep it shorter. ",
