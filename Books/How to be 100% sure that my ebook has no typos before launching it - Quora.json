            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t. Look, in the most professional and conventional of publishing methods, a manuscript is seen by an agent, who reads it, makes suggestions, and flags any obvious errors. It\u2019s submitted to publishing house, where at least one editor reads it, and if it\u2019s really being considered, probably gives it to someone else to read as well. They discuss it, and also mark any obvious errors. After the book is acquired by the house, it will go through a story edit, a line edit, and proof and copy edits. After each pass, it will go back to the writer, who has an opportunity to clean it up. Next, it will go to a type setter, or the modern equivalent. There are more opportunities to clean it up, although technology has some new and interesting ways of introducing fascinating errors at that point. Next, without going into details, it becomes a book. Before it\u2019s ready to be sold, copy and marketing and rights and maybe even art has read it, and at each point, they\u2019ve had the opportunity to point out that there\u2019s a spelling error on page 23. Now, this is with the most professional, most robust publishing process, a house that employs many people for the express purpose of getting everything right. Even with a book that is published by, for instance Random House, there will still be the odd typo or error. With a self-published e-book, you are dependent on yourself and a spell check to get everything right, and that spell check can change many things to words that are spelled correctly, but are the wrong word entirely. As an example, a rather famous writer at one point had a book with the phrase \u201cMy customers are always right,\u201d but due to the wrong spelling, it was automatically changed to \u201cMy costumers are always right,\u201d which is not the same thing at all. So, if you are self-publishing an e-book, your goal is to minimize any errors so that your text is not riddled with them, and they are not a distraction from what you have written. Go over that manuscript at least 3\u20134 times, always with time in between, and pay a professional to have a go at your manuscript as well. That\u2019s your best bet. ",

            "answer_text": "Heh heh heh. You can\u2019t ever be 100% sure, and I speak as someone who publishes books for a living. This is maddening, given that we devote a massive amount of time and effort to cleaning up manuscripts. Editors, copyeditors and proofreaders go through the manuscripts, layouts, and plotters multiple times hunting typos. The standard you want to hit is 100% clean, but you won\u2019t hit that all the time, and every big publisher - even ones where there\u2019s a whole department for cleaning up books - has a reprint correction book. The more hours and eyeballs you put in, the cleaner books get. If you\u2019re going straight from manuscript to ebook you do at least remove the big-publishing hurdle where the ebook file is generated from the print PDF, and so the typesetting has had a chance to introduce typos. But if you want a good confidence that your ebook is clean, you\u2019ll need to do the same kind of big-publishing process. In this case - if what you want is to kill typos, and not necessarily bad grammar or flat characters etc - then you need a professional proofread from a reputable freelance proofreader. In the UK this costs about 20 quid an hour, and for a novel you could be looking at ten hours or so. If you get that done and take in the proofread correctly (amending the manuscript in line with the proofreader\u2019s markup) you should be up near a trade-published standard from that point of view.

It's very aggressive at catching all kinds of stuff.Make multiple passes, switching up the way you review your book each time, change the font and font size, print it out, review on a device, mix up the order of the chapters. etc. I catch the most non-obvious mistakes by using a text to voice utility to read my book aloud while I follow along on the screen. This is because the computer reads what is there while the human eye often sees what it thinks should be there.Get it as good as you can, thenTurn it over to a committee of nit pickers, as many different eyes as you can get. This is because different people notice different things.Now you're going to ask why you can't skip straight to #4. There is a thing I call error fatigue. Even the best proof reader will start skimming over errors if there are too many of them. They becone desensitized and stop seeing them. 5. Accept that typos are like cockroaches. They breed in the dark and it's doubtful that you'll squash all of them. Even bestselling authors from major publishing houses wind up with an error or two in their books. Thankfully, it is a simple matter to correct a self-published book \u2014 unlike trad books, where post publication revisions can't happen. Embrace those readers who point out your errors and use them to improve your books. ",

            "answer_text": "If only it was possible to do this! There are publishers with entire departments devoted to catching typographical errors and misprints, but even they can miss a \"too\" that should have been a \"to.\" The best way to guard against typos is to read, reread, and reread again, employing a fresh pair of eyes each time. If you are the only person who can read your work, try reading the text backward (i.e., start at the very last page and work your way back one sentence at a time) or change the font size or color. If you can change perspectives, errors will become more obvious. That being said, you'll be much better off getting someone else to read the text, as other readers will not skim over the parts you've read a thousand times before. They will be reading it with a fresh perspective. If possible, look for a professional proofreader or proofreading service that will provide you with both a \"tracked\" copy of your work (showing every correction made and why) along with a \"clean\" copy (showing no markup, only the finished corrected text). Then, compare your original book with the two copies so you can see how your text changed. This will give you a new perspective, too, and you'll benefit from one other thing that helps prevent typos: experience working with them. Happy revising! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for your request Hollie. I can\u2019t add much more than Emil\u2019s comprehensive reply! Unfortunately, you can never be 100% sure that your book has no typos in it. Even the biggest name publishers send books to print with what seems like glaring typos in them. And that\u2019s despite having multiple experienced proofreaders check each book. Historically, books have always had typos in them, and it used to be part of the process that readers used to submit errata. That said, of course you want to do as much as possible to reduce typos. So when the book is in its final format (i.e. has been formatted and designed), then check everything has been formatted correctly and no content is missing or has been duplicated. Then hire an experienced proofreader who has great feedback to check the book in its final format, and one who has knowledge of your particular language and type of language (such as British English, American English). If you have an editor, my advice is to hire a separate proofreader. This is because the person looking for typos and formatting errors shouldn\u2019t be familiar with the content. Ideally, have multiple pairs of eyes check the book to eliminate as many errors as possible. And ask them to check it multiple times. The more checking, the less errors. ",

Don\u2019t forget, though \u2014 the editor has to pay bills, too. Once your manuscript has been turned into a publication-ready document, you and your editor go over it again. They you release your book, and wait for your readers to tell you about the stuff you missed. If you\u2019re very lucky, there won\u2019t be anything. Don\u2019t count on being that lucky, because it\u2019s rare. Good luck! ",
