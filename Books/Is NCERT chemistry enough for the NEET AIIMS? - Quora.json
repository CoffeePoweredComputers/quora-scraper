            "answer_text": "NCERT Chemistry is too good and important for NEET and AIIMS.. But after that u need to refer some books to make it complete ! Chemistry: NCERT most important. Other than that, for reference, use OP Tandon, Himanshu Pandey, Pradeeps, Morrison and Boyd etc Practice from NEET Champion, NCERT at your fingertips for all three subjects ! Practice all these questions MANY TIMES.Become perfect in them.Solve other people\u2019s doubts. These will help you score better :). People run after so many modules and crap test series. Instead you should focus on limited material and do it more number of times !! Many questions ask only basic concepts but a good clarity in them.
