            "answer_text": "It should be pretty easy if you live in any area where there are government contractors.  If you don't, then the first step would be to move to one of those places.  The area around Washington, DC is an obvious choice.  Any city with a major military base or other federal government facility will usually have a big contractor presence: San Diego, Norfolk VA, Colorado Springs, Albuquerque, and many others. It would help if you finished your degree.  The government is more concerned about credentials than the private sector is.  The selection criteria for some jobs at a government contractor are set purely by the contractor, but in other cases the government sets some criteria, and a degree may be among them. Beyond that, just... start applying.  There are lots of government contractors, so as long as you're generally employable and aren't too picky, it should be easy enough. ",
