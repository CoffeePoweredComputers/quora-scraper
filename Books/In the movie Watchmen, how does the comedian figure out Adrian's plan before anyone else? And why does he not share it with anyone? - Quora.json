            "answer_text": "The movie does not go into explicit detail about how the Comedian figured it out, and why he didn't make that information public. This is Moloch's flashback in the movie, where Blake mentions finding a list with Moloch's and Janey's name on it: It's a joke. It's all a fucking joke. You know, I thought I knew how it was. I thought I knew how the world was. I've done some bad things. I did bad things to women. I shot kids. In 'Nam, you know. But that was fucking war. This... I never done anything like this. God, here I am spilling my guts to one of my archenemies. But the truth is, you're the closest thing to a friend I got. What the fuck does that say? Shit. And your name... your name was on the list... along with Janey, you know, whatever the fuck her name is. Manhattan's old girl. Mother, forgive me. Near the end, Adrian states that Blake found about what he was doing in Antarctica, and that led him to figure out the truth. I think the implication is that Adrian killed Blake before the latter could babble the truth to everyone, like he did to Moloch. Blake figured it out first. Nixon had him keeping tabs on us, making sure we weren't rocking the boat. Blake found out what I was doing here in Karnak and by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly. Even I couldn't predict he'd be the one to have a change of heart. So I had to kill him.  In the comics, Blake found out by accident. While returning from a mission, and investigating suspicious activity on an uncharted island, he witnessed scientists working on a creature (instead of the bomb, like in the movie) and went from there. The reason why he didn't reveal it to everyone, according to Adrian, is that he understood what was at stake, even if he couldn't digest it. These are selected panels from the conversation that Adrian has with Rorschach and Dan:  ",
