            "answer_text": "A structured book review, i am just giving a general skeleton which is most precise and apposite:- Name of the book- Name of the Author- Paragraph 1: Begin the review with a very catchy opening line, something which is the essence of the book, maybe one of the lines from the book which sums up the theme of the book. And then continue writing a medium length paragraph describing the rough idea of the book. Paragraph 2: This paragraph has to be dedicated to the author. The first line about his life and few works and then write a short to medium para about the author in close connection with the book. Para 3: This has to be a very short para, describing the setting of the story, its main character, ( cleverly write one descriptive adjective for each character ), the time period it is set in, historical allusions if any, etc. Para 4: The most important one, this has to be the main thing, you will have to describe the main themes of the book in a close knit association with the story, you have to be descriptive but not philosophical. Write as if you are criticizing as well as praising the book, also include how have the themes been brought out in the book, make allusions to some good dialogue from the book and in general give a detailed describing thematic storyline without turning as i said philosophical. Para 5: not in a very negative sense describe what's missing in the book, appreciate the sincere effort of the author but state what is left out and use words to state whether it becomes too lengthy or morose at points, etc. i.e make a very verbose critical appreciation of the book. Para 6: write something about the background of the book, the genre of the book and how successful has the author been in carrying out this genre.Write about the characters and what do they stand for In the book.make it a long one. Conclusion: Write about the impact of the book, how eloquent or insipid is it , whatoral message it gives , whether its worth reading, has the author won in his effort to weave a wordy net to entangle the reader's mind. You can obviously add or remove paragraphs, but this would suffice, it includes everything about the book. ",
