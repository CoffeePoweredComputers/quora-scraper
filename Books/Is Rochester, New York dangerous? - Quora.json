            "answer_text": "Is Rochester, New York dangerous? Not particularly. Rochester is real but small (ca. 208,000) city in an MSA of about 1,040,000 people. There are some areas of the city that are not very pleasant at certain times of the day, but most of the city proper is quite nice. Rochester has it\u2019s share of crime, but most middle class people are not directly affected by it whether they live in the city proper or not. The stability of the area is aided substantially by the presence of a number of fine colleges, including the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology There is an outstanding, vibrant and safe cultural hub anchored by the Eastman School of Music, a good repertory theater and many smaller venues and arts groups plus East side and Southern corridors with a reasonable nightlife and good, secure urban housing. Median household income in the city proper is about $31,000, and the median household income for the MSA is about $57,000 so there is substantial economic segregation. Travel is very easy and light and there is no appreciable rush hour. As a result people can easily work and live in areas with entirely different character from exciting to somnolent. Surrounding suburban neighborhoods within the MSA tend to be quiet and residential. ",
