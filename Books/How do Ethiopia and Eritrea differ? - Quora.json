They have the same cultures, the same recipe, identical traditional clothes,similar religious practices\u2026etc. The difference came as a result of Italian colonization and the then Ethiopian governmetal style. That time Ethiopia was not like this time\u2019s Ethiopia it was governed dividely by local kings who competed one another to conquer as far and wide as possible. Eritrea was the port, it was easy as a result to get to it for colonizers and be held. The territory between Ethiopia and Eritrea was made by the colonizer, Italy. ",
