            "answer_text": "I have come to believe it is a failure in working memory to relate facial expressions to actual emotional states, and to logically reason through emotional states to the level of reflexive understanding. Many people with Autism can recognize a frown, a smile, and many other facial expressions just like everyone else. I have never met someone with Autism who was completely oblivious to someone\u2019s facial expressions with the sole exception of those who are intellectually disabled who have Autism. What the difference really is, I have identified, is being able to translate that facial expression into an emotion, and from that emotion be able to process that person directly through the lens of that emotion and change the behavior of themselves in response to that. That sounds like a mouthful, but it should make more sense by an example. C = Q/(Delta)T. This is the equation for heat capacity, Q signifying heat and delta T signifying change in temperature. c = C / m. This is the equation for specific heat capacity, where C is the heat capacity and m is the mass of the object in grams. Now you can memorize those equations and regurgitate them. But, let me say solve for Q using m, (delta)t, and c. If you are a Physics major, this should be point blank and obvious. For some of you, this may be a bit tougher. So, we will use algebra to solve this. C = mc mc = Q/(delta)T mc(delta)T = Q Knowing data does not mean you can interpret it correctly, interpreting data correctly does not mean you can rearrange the data correctly, and rearranging data correctly does not mean you can manipulate it correctly. But, let me give a easier to understand example that isn\u2019t so mathematical. Take five friends who are all of equal height, equal speed, and equal motivation trying to become basketball players for their local high school team. Andrew knows all the names of the maneuvers that a basketball player would perform on the court. Billy knows all that and what those maneuvers actually entail. Cole knows all that and how to execute the maneuvers on the court and follow the plan. Dylan knows all that and how to form and execute contingencies if the original plan goes wrong. Eric knows all that and how to form and execute contingencies that work in the team\u2019s favor if the original plan goes wrong. Who could get on the team? Who could get play time? Who is the most likely to become a professional player or a coach? Everyone but Andrew could get on the team. Knowing the maneuvers\u2019 names does not mean you know what they entail. Cole, Dylan, and Eric all have shots of getting play time. Billy is highly unlikely to get play time because knowing the maneuvers and what they entail doesn\u2019t mean he can actually interpret the maneuvers into actionable things to do. Eric is the only one who can become a professional player or a coach. Cole can\u2019t because though he can complete the maneuvers, he can\u2019t switch from a maneuver when he sees problems come from the maneuvers. Dylan can\u2019t because even though he can make contingencies, he can\u2019t create good contingencies. Though he can rearrange the maneuvers, it doesn\u2019t mean he can rearrange them correctly. Eric is the only one who can become a professional player. Why? Because he knows exactly what the maneuvers are entirely, how to execute them, how to rearrange the maneuvers in the best manner possible, and how to correctly create contingencies when the maneuvers have to be rearranged into a good order. Replace that with trying to become good at reading facial expressions, and that holds almost entirely true. As to the biological reasoning as to what makes Autistic people less able to read facial expressions intrinsically than neurotypicals, that is a question for psychologists, neurologists, biologists, and chemists to solve in the future.

This was a topic of conversation once with a clever neuro-typical friend who tends towards being instantly popular. His answer was completely useless as far as giving me something to try and reproduce, but it was useful in contrast. Imagine a game where you are focused on a smallish number (3\u20135) of common objects suddenly exposed and then re-covered. You then relay the most basic version of what you saw. Ball, cat, flux capacitor, quarter, something green. Five things, pretty simple. You don\u2019t have to know the cat\u2019s breed, the year of the quarter, or even what exactly the green thing was, you were 85% there (points for at least catching the color of the last item). My friend can\u2019t describe the other person\u2019s emotional state in detail, but in that instant he understands broadly what their face is communicating. My NT friend is clearly deranged, and between us, a tad simple minded\u2026 I mean, come on: Baseball, with blue stitching, including a logo with a brown hawk, and a red one for Coca-ColaMale, short hair, gray and black tabby, polydactyl, heavily whiskered, with yellow-green eyes, and a white solar panel.And so on\u2026Mentally, the data points are recorded on a spreadsheet and I\u2019ve begun analysis\u2026 Wait? Did you just flash different items?!? What were we doing again? Would you like to see my spreadsheet? My friend was naturally focused on just the relevant & required data points. He\u2019s often not even seeing things I am, or his brain discards them as unimportant. I\u2019m getting a lot more data, but don\u2019t have a fast mechanism for zeroing in on what is important. I won\u2019t retain it long term, but I\u2019m much more likely to notice eye color, an unusual posture, body odor (gag), and hair between their eyebrows. Small facial details MIGHT be in my spreadsheet somewhere, but that body odor\u2026 Was their mother a yak? It\u2019s basically the same when walking outside with the NTs I know. I\u2019ll be able to cross streets, watch for cars, converse, notice a cat across the street, an ant swarm on the sidewalk, and a quarter. My NTs will most likely survive the trip, but miss the cat, ants, & loose change\u2026 So they have the upper hand NOW with their facial expression recognition, but if house cats, ants, & loose change ever become lethal to humans, I\u2019ll get the last laugh.

            "answer_text": "I am actually pretty good at identifying expressions if given time and context. However, this is because my therapists and internet pictures taught me what each expression means and how to contort my face to match it. For NT people, this is a skill that is hardwired into the brain since infancy to insure that the mothers stays with the child (according to some evaluation video). Lets take the alphabet for example. From an early age the alphabet is systematically drilled into our heads. We are carefully taught each letter and then how to put them into words and finally define those words. After a few years of dedicated teaching we are taught how to create meaningful and emotional phrases and works with the words we got from the alphabet. Easy, right? No. That took years to learn, and people still need to pause and re-read passages from books with complex and dual meanings just to understand what is being expressed. People don\u2019t do take classes on expressions since they are hard wired into the neuro-typical brain, while writing is an institutionalized method of communication that we must learn and carefully process even when we know it well. For me, and probably a lot of other autistic individuals, reading expressions is like reading a very complex book that has multiple meanings that must be sorted and derived through context, but there\u2019s a catch; we never were taught the alphabet behind the words that categorize different expressions. I know that a furrowed brow is either confusion, concentration, or anger/vexation. Now I need to look for clues on which emotion is being portrayed and then find where that emotion is being directed. Then I need to choose a response to carry out such as supplication or earnest clarification (depending on who I\u2019m interacting with). This process has to be used for lip contortion, eye contortion, changes in complexion, shifts in stance, and a whole conglomeration of other ques that I must interpret and act upon to hold a conversation.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I think there\u2019s a couple of reasons for me. Firstly, it\u2019s not natural or instinctive for me to look at peoples\u2019 eyes, or even their faces. If I\u2019m looking at a face it\u2019s usually because I\u2019m lip-reading to help supplement auditory processing difficulties or I\u2019m trying hard to \u201cmask\u201d (which I rarely do these days, it\u2019s too exhausting). Subsequently, I take cues more from the mouth area and the eyes are a blank void as far as expression goes. Secondly, I don\u2019t generalise. So I can learn to read one person extremely well if I apply myself, to the point that the person can never hide anything from me because my pattern recognition radar starts pinging urgently if something about them is different. It doesn\u2019t mean I know what the difference is, and I will ask until they tell me because I can\u2019t stand the dissonance. Everyone is a new and unique map of emotional markers and many people fake their outward emotions. If I don\u2019t shut people out of my attention, I end up with a confusing signal to noise ratio as my brain takes in contradictory messages and it\u2019s both exhausting and causes massive anxiety in me. Anyone I let close learns really quickly to stop doing it because it will provoke meltdowns. It\u2019s unnerving for people initially because they have to be open and vulnerable with me - I know this because a few friends have told me so. So I can learn, but it\u2019s hard and it\u2019s not intuitive and takes a lot of mental energy. It\u2019s like people reading animal body language - not intuitive and they miss subtle but important cues constantly. So many people have dogs but if everyone could read them properly, dog behaviourists would be out of a job. Instead, dogs are constantly being misinterpreted, treated poorly, discarded, put down etc because the people around them can\u2019t read their nuances and communicate clearly with them. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem is the face just does not communicate any information to the person. He looks at the person\u2019s face and simply draws no information from it, which gives him a very uneasy, anxious feeling. The brain almost always \u2018feels anxious\u2019 when it can\u2019t understand something. That\u2019s how we are all wired. This is a common problem in several different disorders including Autism and Schizophrenia. But it is by no means universal with all people with Autism. Many people with Autism have no problem looking at people. And when a person with severe Autism is really withdrawn, and starts to feel comfortable with you, very often the person will spend hours looking very carefully at your face, touching your face, touching your mouth, chin and features, often looking rather puzzled but curious, lifting and moving your hands, all with rapt attention and no unease about looking at your face. My thought on that is that once the person is familiar with your facial features and has studied them carefully, the person feels much more comfortable with you. With people with severe Autism, for many years there was a big emphasis on teaching them to look at people. The reason was that people often cited that as a source of anger and frustration at the person, so we wanted to avoid that anger bubbling up. Not looking at people was just a huge source of frustration for caregivers as well as people encountered in the community. Reactions were \u2018he doesn\u2019t love me,\u2019 \u2018he doesn\u2019t respect me,\u2019 \u2018he refuses to listen when I tell him to do something,\u2019 etc. So it helps when asking the person to do something that you know they are focused on what you\u2019re asking, plus it helps with making the person more acceptable in the community - people just really do not like it when someone doesn\u2019t look at them. As a result many severely Autistic people were trained to look at people by giving the Autistic person a reward such as a piece of cookie or candy when you said, \u2018Look at me.\u2019 I believe that helped people overcome their anxiety of looking at peoples\u2019 faces. There\u2019s nothing like munching on a cookie to help forget one\u2019s anxiety (that\u2019s probably why I\u2019m so fat\u2026..). The extremely funny result was that if the Autistic person wanted something, he would walk up to someone, reach up and put his hands on either side of the person\u2019s face, turn the person\u2019s head toward him and say, \u2018Good looking,\u2019 which created some misunderstandings\u2026. My friend with severe Autism would often do that when he was asking a person something and the person was not paying attention to him. He did not understand the concept of not interrupting a person who was having a conversation with someone else. So as a result you\u2019d be talking to someone, he would come up, gently turn your head toward him and start talking to you. I was struck by how little people understood of how my friend\u2019s brain worked. But it definitely helped him get along in the world in general, that he could look at people. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. It's hard to know. I was only diagnosed last year and only recently (like, in the last month or so) did I realise that I don't actually make eye contact if I can help it and not for very long. So, as I've only just noticed, I don't have any insight as to why. I guess I assumed everyone did that. And I have been complimented on job interviews for making eye contact with everyone in the room and making everyone feel involved. Without making significant eye contact. Also, and this was news when I was diagnosed, it turns out that most people don't spend their lives analysing the behaviour and facial expressions of other people. Most people, therefore, cannot tell when an emotion does not match the facial expression or spot the subtle signs that people are not feeling what they say they are feeling with their words or what their facial expressions are supposed to represent. Equally, most people don't get freaked out by the dissonance and often take people at 'face value' without thinking about it. Most people know the guff about 90% of communication being non-verbal but miss anything outside the face and words and, the bit that really confuses me, often take the verbal communication as the full truth when it is *obvious* something else is going on! To me, it appears as though the vast majority of people strive for 'socially acceptable' interpretations of facial expressions. Ergo, it's not that I, as someone with ASD, can't read facial expressions it's that the vast majority of people, as being PNT, don't care to match them with, well, anything. It's a double blind. Also, there's a whole pantomime that people engage in with facial expressions so that people make what they assume is one face even though it doesn't match their, well, body language. It is intensely frustrating to accurately deduce someone's expressions and body language, be told you are wrong and be reprimanded for 'not getting it' only to discover, much further down the line, that you were right. And then, blow me, be told that being right made it *worse* both at the time and afterward when other PNTs who offered no such insight and often were hurtful get praised for 'doing the right thing'. I suspect I have moved from the focus of the question... ",

It doesn\u2019t come naturally to me AT ALL. I\u2019m busy thinking about what is going on, what is being said, what my next move will be, and so on. It is a lot to take in. While I could learn (and have learned a lot in time), it is a lot to take in. It can be quite overwhelming. All that said, I have improved immensely. It was not until I was in my late 20s that I learned that people expect eye contact during conversations. I was SHOCKED. To me, that felt akin to saying that I\u2019m expected to walk about in the nude and engage in extremely intimate acts even with people I barely know. In time (I\u2019m now 42), I\u2019ve practiced eye contact enough that it now happens somewhat automatically. As others will likely point out, some autistic people study humans enough to become exceptionally good at reading facial expressions and body language, so much so that they become extremely good psychologists and the like.

It\u2019s like asking, \u201cas a normal muggle, what makes levitation difficult.\u201d It\u2019s just not within our brain structure. One theory that rings true for a lot of autistics is the \u201cintense world\u201d theory. We lack the filters that protect neurotypicals (NTs). These can include sensory filters against loud noises or smells, but also social filters like intensity or personal space or touching.  Does this look like an uncomfortable position to be in for the person on the right? If your social filters are down, you don\u2019t need a drill sergeant to put you at this level of discomfort. It could be something that most NTs find normal, even engaging. Note that the poor guy isn\u2019t making eye contact. Would you want to in this situation? If an autistic person is frequently at this level of discomfort in social situations, they\u2019re almost never going to make eye contact. Since you\u2019re autistic from birth, that means you won\u2019t get the training in reading faces during the critical parts of development that NTs get, and so you\u2019ll be bad at reading faces. That will stay true even if (like me) you figure out in your late teens that people seem to expect eye contact as part of social discourse and start forcing yourself to do it. ",

            "answer_text": "I want you to look at the two sets of marks below and tell me what\u2019s different about them. Oh yeah, and you have less than a quarter of a second to do it, and then tell me what the difference means.   If you really think about it, what separates one expression from another are tiny differences. The only reason anybody can do it is because most people are hardwired specifically for that job. Autistic people aren\u2019t wired in the same way, so they have trouble. Plus, even processing that can be difficult during social interaction. It\u2019s uncomfortable for many autistic people to look at and focus on faces. It takes a certain amount of conscious effort read a face, and that\u2019s just more things to think about while flying blind through the stormy realm of socialization. As some may put it, \u201cI can pay attention to your face or pay attention to what you\u2019re saying. Not both.\u201d As a fun excercise, horses also use facial expression to communicate. The next time you\u2019re around some horses, try to spot their different expressions. Then try to figure out what they mean. That\u2019s a bit what it\u2019s like for autistic people who haven\u2019t had specific training in reading faces. ",

Context and situational awareness are important, but so is knowing what impact words or thoughts expressed have had on others.

I maintain a fairly accurate prediction of where the objects and people around me are going to move, and I can remap my prediction onto an imaginary world with different physics. That, too, is a computationally difficult task solved with a dedicated system rather than by repurposing a general system. If you\u2019re trying to analyze facial expressions in software, as it were, it\u2019s a computationally difficult problem. If you\u2019re trying to do it in real time, of course you\u2019ll make some mistakes, like you would if you were trying to convert every color you saw into RGB values. Further, faces are sort of intense, so if the situation is intense too or I\u2019m tired, my default response is often to look away from people\u2019s faces in order to decrease the amount of intensity I experience to a manageable level. Good luck interpreting the details of something you\u2019re looking away from. ",
