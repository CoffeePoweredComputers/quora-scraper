            "answer_text": "Shimanami Tesogare is a personal favorite of mine. It has a gay main character, a lesbian couple, an older gay couple and a trans (ftm) character. It's a short, 23 chapter story (with no plans for more), about a group of part time house renovators of various ages (the youngest is a high school student, the oldest is a 60\u201370 year old man). It's a group that is safe for everyone, and while they occasionally talk about the remodeling, the main focus is the characters themselves and their story. It's a very bittersweet, heart-warming kind of story, and it portrays being LGBT in Japan in a very realistic way which you will not find in many other places. The main character's friends are homophobic, and so is his family. He faces many challenges trying to be himself while not being out. The lesbian couple decides to finally get married (not officially, as that's still illegal), and when they go to get their parents blessing, one pair breaks down crying and saying they did not raise her like this. There are homophobic remarks and transphobic attitudes, some of which eventually change, and some don't. But it's a beautiful story about self acceptance and finding your own place. So, if you're looking for gay stories which portray being gay realistically, I heavily recommend you try it! ",

Stuck Rubber Baby is the story of how Toland Polk faces the confusion and challenges of growing up gay in the 1960's American South.  Take a look at the Goodreads page to see if it might interest you. ",
