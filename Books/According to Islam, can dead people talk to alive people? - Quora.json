            "answer_text": "When a person dies, they go to the grave, and then they go to Hayatul Barzakh, or limbo, where they wait until the day of judgement. Similarly, when we go to sleep, it is as if we are in a state of death, we know this because our souls leave our bodies when we sleep. With that being said, there are 3 things you need to know: Some scholars agree that WHILE you are asleep, the dead can communicate to you, but if you do see something like that, it COULD be Shaytan (Satan) impersonating that person.Shaytan can appear in your dreams, but he can NEVER impersonate the Prophet, for if someone sees the Prophet in their dreams, it is really him.The scholars also agree you can NOT communicate to dead people while you are awake, anyone who says this is a liar or someone who needs to go to the hospital.",
