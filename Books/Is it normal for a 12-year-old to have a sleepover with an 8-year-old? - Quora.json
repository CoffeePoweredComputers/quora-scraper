Personally, I never had a sleepover with someone younger than me let alone someone 4 years younger than me. Neither did my friends or anyone my age with whom I was associated with at the time. Now I do believe that different upbringings and social surroundings would have a different effect on a child possibly causing them to befriend someone who is 4 years younger than themselves. This may be due to what part of the world you live in, how many friends you had, how you perceived yourself and how you wanted others to see you, etc. TL;DR: in my experience, no, but don't rule it out just because it isn't very common. hope I helped :D ",

For his eleventh birthday his parents took him to a waterpark and they invited me. Not once did the age difference between us seem to come up. We just got along really well. ",
