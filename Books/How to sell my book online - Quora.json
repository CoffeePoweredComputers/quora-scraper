            "answer_text": "There are two major ways to sell books online. Each has its own pros and cons associated with it. The first method is to release it through a platform like Amazon, Kobo, or Smashwords to name a few. These platforms have a built in audience and help you distribute it far and wide. Usually, you have to take care of the initial marketing push and their algorithms will help you rise in the ranks. The major problem with these platforms is that you have to play by their rules. You may not be able to sell certain kinds of booksYou\u2019re limited in how much you can chargeThey tend to have a large commission cut on every sale.Your work can be rejected or unpublished without warningIn many cases, the pros outweigh the cons because authors are good at writing, not marketing their books. With that being said, you\u2019re leaving a lot of money on the table because these marketplaces aren\u2019t concerned with you as an individual seller. You probably won\u2019t generate enough income to pay a single one of their staff members. They\u2019re concerned with producing as many book sales as possible. The other method is to self host your book. Create a website, market your book, set up a sales funnel, and reap the rewards. This is an order of magnitude harder because, unless you\u2019ve been active online for a while, you don\u2019t have a built in audience. The reason I suggest this route is because you have control of the customer. Not like a Jedi mind trick, I mean you have their contact info (the marketplaces don\u2019t share this info with you). You also have control of the entire sales funnel right up until checkout. This is a huge opportunity to introduce them to products on the back end. Contrary to popular belief, the real money isn\u2019t made from book sales. The real money is made from everything that goes on behind the scenes. You can upsell them into coaching, a course, merchandise, or anything else that your book serves as a gateway product to. Here\u2019s what you do: Build an audienceWrite a book they want to readLaunch itCreate a product or two on the back end to maximize your revenue with a few upsells and order bumpsRinse and repeat as many times as you want",

            "answer_text": "Find valuable books that are in demand. List them on your site of choice and when a customer buys them, pack label and ship. That is the short of it. You will want to join bookselling groups on Facebook and learn from those of us who have been successful. It is not easy and requires a great deal of creativity and business sense, as well as a willingness to learn how to identify valuable books, how to grade them, how to photograph them, list them and describe them accurately so they are not returned. Valuable in-demand books are not just anywhere. Other people are looking for them as well. 95% to 99% of books have no online resale value. Even old books - 95% are worth nothing. You will need money. At least $1000 to start. You will need equipment, supplies, etc. You will need subscriptions to software services. At least $30 per month, but $45 per month would be ideal. You will need to learn how to read analytical charts of supply and demand. You will need to understand the tax implications of running a business. It took me 2 years to gain enough knowledge to really know what I was doing. And I worked full time. If I had worked part time it would have taken much longer, or not at all. Amazon FBA is an absolute money pit and a potential disaster of a service. Use it at your own risk. The golden age of eBay is over. Use that at your own risk as well. The other platforms are almost not worth selling on. So the big two are now fraught with pitfalls and knowing what they are will make or break your business. You can be sued, accused of counterfeiting, bullied and have your money held hostage by Amazon. This business is not for the weak hearted. It can stress you the hell out. Join some Facebook groups on bookselling and listen to the veterans, not the newbies. If you are looking to do this as a hobby only, and you have no prior knowledge of books, choose something else. It is too complicated and the pickings are very slim if you have no book sense. If you want to get into it for the long haul, get on Facebook and join the discussions and learn. One more thing. You can say goodbye to 50% of all profit you make because you will be paying state tax, federal taxes and you will be paying commissions to whatever platform you sell on. And subtract your overhead and cost of inventory and it is more likely you will only see 40% of the total sales price on any given book. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh man. I have a tremendous amount of experience in this particular area and I have to tell you, I almost lost my mind attempting to figure out how to do exactly what you are inquiring about.  Long story short - I had been selling textbooks on Amazon for quite some time. This is not the most innovative idea by any means. It is more of a hustle. You do not make a fortune, but if you are willing to sit on a couple of dollars for a few months you are pretty much guaranteed to make a few bucks when the next semester arrives. I scaled my operation to the point where barcode scanners were needed and utilized efficiently. It was a simple process that enabled me to obtain fair supplemental income   I then stumbled upon an estate sale. Everything in the house had to go. The gentleman who's house it was had passed away and his daughters were selling everything in the house. This man was an extremely intelligent man. He was a literature professor who had a deep passion for books. Having sold plenty of books, I knew enough to know that there was certainly some valuable books in this man's huge library of 3000+ books. The majority of them were pre-1970 - meaning no UPC to scan with my barcode scanner. What I failed to truly understand was just how difficult it would be to identify the value of each book, the listing process of each book and the inventorying of each book.  If you are not familiar with the Amazon Bulk Inventory Loader \nAmazon.com Help: Inventory File Templates, I highly recommend you get acquainted with the tool. It is your new best friend. The problem with listing books that do not have UPC's is that you can not scan them with Bluetooth barcode scanners. So, there I was with thousands of valuable books that I would need to pay to store and set aside about 353 years to type in all of the necessary information to list them. \"***What the hell am I going to do with these things?!*** \" - was the question of the day for a long time.  I am the type of person that if I believe there is a possible solution that has even the slightest chance of being reached, I will pursue it with a fiery passion. This is an asset at times, however, I almost drove myself crazy trying to figure out a feasible solution to get these valuable books identified and listed in a reasonable fashion. I finally figured it out, though. To be honest, if I still was involved in selling books, I probably would not share this information. I no longer sell books, though, so I am more than happy to provide the solution I came up with in hopes that it will save you the time and effort I had to put in.  **The Solution** Amazon's image recognition software that they provide consumers on the mobile application is one of the most powerful image recognition software solutions in the world. Unfortunately, this feature was not available through the Amazon Seller app. Though these books did not have UPC's to scan with the barcode scanners, an iPhone equipped with the free Amazon consumer application was more than capable of scanning the books and identifying them accurately. This was a step in the right direction, however, the leap from identifying them to sufficiently listing them for sale was drastic. How could one take a book that has been identified on their phone and get it listed in a timely manner? Essentially, turn your mobile device into a \"barcode scanner.\" You can do this by rapidly scanning the books utilizing the image recognition software and then adding any books of value to a \"wish list\". From there, the URL's from the wish list must be extracted. Take the link to your Amazon wish list that is filled with the valuable books you have acquired and paste it into Import IO. This is a free web-scraping solution. From there, you are able to take the scraped information that has been turned into a .csv file and import it into Excel. Every Amazon product has a 10 digit code known as an ASIN. For books, it is usually the ISBN number. In order to bulk upload books, this 10 digit number must be extracted. This number is found in every URL.   Now that we have all of the URL's extracted into excel or Google Sheets, we must separate them. To do this, the \"MID' function works great. Here is a custom formula to do so. =MID(A1,SEARCH(\"DP/\",A1)+3,SEARCH(\"/ref\",A1)-(SEARCH(\"DP/\",A1)+3))\u00a0Take this formula, and paste it into \"B1\" and then drag it down to the end of the URL list.   Take a minute and clean the list up and you will end up with this:  This is a very short list simply for examples sake. Realistically, the process would be most beneficial when extracting the ASIN from hundreds or thousands of URLS. I actually decided to build an IOS application to automate the process even more. Utilizing this method enables one person to list 1000+ books that were published pre-1970's per day. Not bad, right? ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there are any \u201csecrets\u201d to selling books (or eBooks) online. The one thing you definitely want to consider is: how will someone find your book? Are you going through a traditional publisher that will help you with the marketing?Are you going indie and selling your own book? That means you\u2019ll keep 100% of the revenue after fees but you also have 100% of the responsibility for getting the word out.I went through a publisher with my first book. They sell the book on their own site as well as through partnerships with other companies. The one thing I want to make sure clear up is that just having a book on Amazon isn\u2019t enough. There are over 5.2 million books on the Kindle store.  You will not get found unless you do the work. If you go indie there are a few ways to help people to find your book (on your own site as well as on a marketplace like Amazon). Use keywords so people can find your book with SEOMake sure you have a sample of your book availableCreate a newsletter (I strongly recommend reading Tim Grahl\u2019s email course on book marketing to understand why)And if you\u2019re writing fiction books if you have multiple books in a series you can give away the first book to get people interested and buy the rest of the series.Writing a book (and making a profit from it) is really hard. I still receive royalties from my first book but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve earned my hourly rate yet and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll get there. I really value my time so you either need to be a prolific writer and write a ton of books, or you need to do it for the love, or you need to bundle in some extras (see the link below about pricing) to get more for each book sold. Good luck!

            "answer_text": "You can sell your book to follow this step\u2026 The Best Ways to Sell Books Online To start selling your book, make sure the tome is in a suitable state for reading. While a creased cover might just be acceptable, missing and torn pages \u2013 or those that have been coloured in or scribbled \u2014 result in little return. If you\u2019re fond of making notes in the margins, these will usually not be appreciated, although if they just happen to be in the pen of the book\u2019s author they may increase the value. Any books you wish to sell should be in as good a condition as possible. If they\u2019re dusty, wipe them down with a dry cloth. If you have books with missing dust covers, check eBay for replacements . Before you start researching prices, group your books into two piles. One will include all titles with an ISBN code, the other all those without. In most cases, the pile with the ISBN codes will be the bigger. ISBN Code The International Standard Book Numbers were first introduced in 1970 to succeed the predecessor SBN codes and are used in the UK and North America. Europe relies on the EAN system, which covers all purchasable goods, and reserves a subsection of this index for books. Japan, meanwhile, uses the JAN system. In theory, these different systems are compatible with International Article Number scheme, which is used to classify items for sale and is vital to the working of electronic point of sale systems. Some online services through which you might sell your books offer speedy input and results by entering not the title but the ISBN code. For this reason, you\u2019ll need to spend more time establishing the background details and current price of books without ISBN or compatible IAN code. ",

            "answer_text": "Sounds like a really brief question. But remember marketing a book is a marathon and not a sprint. In my last answer, How do I market my book? I have mentioned different ways of doing so, now to specifically sell it online we can do the following: Know your audience: Since we already know who is the book best suited for, segment that audience as specifically as you can. This will help you understand where do they spend most of their time. And you can develop a marketing strategy to reach them.Build your \u201cplatform\u201d: Book marketing consultant Tim Grahl defines your platform as whatever plan and methods you use to connect with readers and sell books. If you have the time and resources to find a publicist that would actually respond to you as first-time author then you can go that way, or you can chose the online-only path: website, social media, Amazon author pages, and an email list.Website: Yes, it\u2019s common sense, but if you\u2019re going to self-publish a book, you need a website to spread the word and keep the conversation going. It\u2019s a place for fans to contact you and a way to build your email list. You\u2019ll start with zero traffic, but after a while (be patient!), if you\u2019ve got some engaging content and good keywords, you\u2019ll see the clicks and the email signups start to come in.Social media: I\u2019ve heard many people advise this and I\u2019ll tell you the same thing: don\u2019t overdo it, don\u2019t spread thin focus on 2 may be 3 channels and stick with it such as Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter. Try them out and see what feels right for you.Amazon author and book pages: I could get very detailed, but here\u2019s the quick rundown: If you self-publish on Amazon, use every space they give you. Don\u2019t leave things blank. Put plenty of key phrases in your book description and keywords list on your book sales page on Amazon. Hook up your author page to show your latest blog posts and tweets. I\u2019ve talked to many people who can\u2019t seem to sell copies of their books, and after looking, I find that they\u2019re simply not taking advantage of simple features that can help them get discovered.Email list: Okay, this one is an uphill battle, but worth the effort. As a new author, getting people interested enough to take the ride with you through emails is tough. But if you have ammo such as blogging, posting, tweeting and emailing, and the list will slowly grow. Use MailChimp to manage the email list and campaigns. It\u2019s an excellent tool at an excellent price: free.3. Create a sense of urgency \u2013 start a drive. If you can get all your peeps to buy your book on Amazon, say, on a certain day and between a certain set of times, then you can perhaps drive your book to #1 and bragging rights. Or you might start a giveaway of print books for those who buy Kindle versions during a set time period. And so on. Scarcity and competition add urgency to book buying, and that can help you create some momentum around your book. 4. Keep the buzz going \u2013 find new reasons and angles to promote your book. Online advertising: All the major online services offer paid advertising. if you\u2019ve got the stomach to spend money that isn\u2019t returning as high a value as the email blast promotions listed above, but want to boost your exposure temporarily, then go for it. For each of these, you can set a daily budget not to exceed, a start and end date, and live monitoring of response. For example you can set your daily budgets at between $5 and $20 per day for a week. Run Facebook/Instagram ads, Google ads, Amazon ads, Twitter ads, and more. (Constantly experimenting, with varying degrees of success is the key here).Record an audiobook: Okay, this one\u2019s a little tougher. The reason I include this as one of the main things to explore? Because audiobooks continue to be on the rise, in a big way, with 148 percent sales growth from 2010 to 2015, and audiobooks read by their authors are also on the rise. And personally, I can attest: audiobooks account for a significant percentage of book sales.To sum up! Don\u2019t focus on the finish line of the publication date \u2013 that\u2019s only the beginning of your journey to make your book count. Good luck. I hope your book finds the audience that it needs and deserves. ",

Publishing the book well is hard. Selling a significant number of copies is VERY hard. Your manuscript must deliver whatever it is that your readers most desire in books like yours. The cover image, and the design and layout of the cover and of the text in the interior must match the type of book, and not get in your own way. You must know who reads your type of book (because trying to sell to \u201call readers\u201d is a guaranteed disaster) and why they do and where they can be found. You need a marketing plan \u2014 and remember that good book marketing is almost never something that LOOKS like marketing, let alone an ad. And the list rolls on. You\u2019re entering an arena where there\u2019s a lot to learn, far more than we can address here. Before you do this, get books on all of the various parts of the process, including books on book marketing and book publicity. Read a dozen books on the business, and then go back and make notes, and a plan. Good luck. ",

Amazon allows you to sell it as an ebook or a print-on-demand book, and I think one or two of the others may do so. too. You can also sell it through a website you control, but it\u2019s harder to get it noticed by many people. To do that, you\u2019ll have to attach a payment processor like Paypal, Stripe, or a straight credit card processor service to your site, and you\u2019ll have to either fulfill the orders yourself or pay to have someone else do it. I recommend the first method over the second, at least until you\u2019re a well-known enough author to anticipate heavy traffic to your website. ",
