            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really know what you mean by \u2018value\u2019. However one of my all time favourite books is The Riddle of the Sands by Erskine Childers which I found immensely entertaining and thought provoking. Published in 1903 it is an early example of a spy novel and gives a real insight into the life and politics of the time. Childers himself is a fascinating character and reading the novel inspired me to discover more about him and the political situation in Ireland, where he was executed in 1923. I won\u2019t spoil the novel or the almost unbelievable story of Childer\u2019s life and death, but highly recommend that if you have any curiosity, you follow in my footsteps. ",
