            "answer_text": "Start with companies in your own country that have offices in Canada. Once employed and proving your value - you can ask for a transfer. Concurrently, identify the companies that you would love to work for that have offices in Canada. Research those companies and identify people working at those companies (LinkedIn is ideal resource for this). Start networking with individuals at the companies. If you have friends, former classmates etc that already made the move reach out to them. Determine your unique values and why each company should hire you. Build a presentation so that as you begin talking with hiring managers, you can convey what makes you unique and how you can solve problems for them. It is hard enough to get a job these days. Trying to secure one in another country makes the challenge even greater. Only the strong survive in this challenge. Make sure you are ready to devote long hours and extensive brain power to the process. You can also move to Canada. You'll eventually have to deal with immigration and much more.  This presents even more risk and costs. I personally moved from Canada to the US - and it was very successful for me. At the same time it could have been a huge disaster. Is your background and portfolio so unique that existing candidates already authorized to work in Canada couldn't do the job? This is an example of the kind of personal analysis needed to meet this type of challenge. I don't want to discourage you but you have an uphill battle ahead of you so be prepared for a rough voyage. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "You did not specify agency or client. I am guessing agency. Most jobs require some experience so any kind of internship will help.  Some break into advertising by doing public relations first.  Still others start in any department of an advertising agency and work themselves up and out.  Being creative and adaptive is what you need to establish with potential employers. ",
