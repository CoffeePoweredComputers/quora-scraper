            "answer_text": "You cannot avoid all legal risks when publishing a book. That\u2019s why major houses get media liability insurance. In the US, anyone can sue anyone else for anything, and no matter how ridiculous the case, even going to court and getting it dismissed on the first day is going to be a royal pain \u2014 and expensive. You can reduce your risk by: Getting written permission for every use of someone else\u2019s work, no matter where you get it, and no matter what type of work it is. Get it from the rights-holder which may not be the person who created the work.Never ever mention any real person, organization or event.Never use a lightly disguised version of any real person, organization or event.Put a disclaimer on the front that makes it clear that you have not used anything based on, connected to, or related to any real person or event.Getting a \u201clegal read\u201d from an attorney with an Intellectual Property specialization \u2014 and one whose subspecialty is books.The quotes probably aren\u2019t a problem as long as you have written permission from the person speaking and the publication in which they were quoted the first time. And then there are the issues of liability if someone gets a bad result from doing something you suggest. Seriously, if you have assets, get a media liability policy. There are very few agents in the US who know how to write one, but it\u2019s worth digging around to find one of them, and getting protection. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to get permission for anyone that you quote in your book. If you were a teacher, and you were teaching a course that was not going to make you a profit, there is a \u201cfair use\u201d rule that you\u2019re allowed to quote sources for educational purposes only. But, if you\u2019re self pubbing a book on Amazon, you\u2019re keeping profits from that book. Therefore you need permission. You can start by going to those speakers\u2019 websites and contacting someone to get legal permission. I did this for a bunch of quotes I wanted to have in my fiction book; their quotes fit perfectly as snippets before my chapters. It\u2019s a headache, but to be on the safe side and not get sued, it\u2019s worth obtaining permission. Good luck Elaine ",
