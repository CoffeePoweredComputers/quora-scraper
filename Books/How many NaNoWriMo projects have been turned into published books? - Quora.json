I don\u2019t have an exact answer for you unfortunately, I don\u2019t even know if there is a record of that, or how many writers would own up to it. I do know there is some, every year NaNo sends you little pep talks from authors, and some of them are NaNo\u2019ers themselves, and wrote their book during NaNo, or started it, or edited it. I have yet to actually finish any of my NaNo projects, which means that I can\u2019t have any of them published. (Maybe one day). I will say, that writing during NaNo is only the start of writing a book to be published. Once it's written you have to edit and revise, and edit and revise, and edit and revise, did I mention revising and editing? So the end product may not be what the writer had at the end of NaNo. Hope this answered your question kinda! ",

I use the month of November to DUMP a novel\u2019s prose out of my head into my computer, let it alone for December and start rewrite on New Years Day. My current work, ONE TOO MANY PHOTOS, is nearing its last major editing pass. I\u2019ll release it after the first of the year. ",
