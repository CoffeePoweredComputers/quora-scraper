            "answer_text": "In the earlier school days, I came to know Bangladesh when I read about Muslim Countries in the World and South Asian Map. Other than this, Bangladesh was never a topic. I came to know more about Bangladesh when I saw their Cricket Team in 1999 WC in which Bangladesh defeated in form Pakistan team (Pakistani team was the finalist of the tournament). We were taught that all Muslims are brothers and so indirectly it means every Muslim country is like our friend (which include Bangladesh aswell). If you are particularly pointing towards the 1971, I would like to answer this too. I remember a chapter \u201cFall of Dhaka\u201d in which I came to know that Bangladesh was previously East Pakistan. I also remember that the main reason which led to chaos was the language issue. We studied the reasons in details which gave me an impression that it was our (West Pakistan\u2019s) fault due to which we lost a part. Now we have moved on and accepted Bangladesh as a separate country. Apart from this, I remember that I read in one of the books that Bangladesh produces a lot of jute. In a nut shell, there is nothing negative about Bangladesh in Pakistani textbooks. Btw, someone who visited Bangladesh told me that their team supports Pakistani team in Cricket and Shahid Afridi has a huge fan following there. I am not sure it is true or not but I am just writing what I heard. Someone also told me that for historical reasons, they are rude to Pakistanis when they apply for visa to visit Bangladesh. PS: I don\u2019t hate Bangladesh or its people. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately Bangladesh is not featured in textbooks at all. Pakistanis as whole don\u2019t even know ABC of current Bangladesh. Pakistan\u2019s history books provide all events in chronological order until the creation of Pakistan from there it goes on 16X speed of a DVD. All you read is Governor Generals, Prime ministers and Generals and their contribution. No context is given they just passed those constitutions and whatever 5 years development plans. Story of Bangladesh comes under War of 1971. East Pakistan became Bangladesh and POW were released in Shimla agreement. Mukti Bahini were Indian trained and funded. This is the high school book i am talking about. Of course if you want to study more then you will have to take history as a subject thats where whole scholarly debates start. There is not much i am afraid we have forgotten all about Bangladesh and don\u2019t care. Only motivation we got out this is to take revenge from India. This approach is not right but since we still have an active conflict with India. It puts all the focus on this side. I am personally happy that Bangladesh is doing well and may you have many years of growth and prosperity. Thanks for reading ",
