            "answer_text": "Roll on the floor laughing. (Sorry, cant help it.) Seriously? What gives you that idea. What even generates that kind of question? Ebooks are BOOMING, and Amazon has 80% of that market. While it\u2019s true the trad publishers are looking at doom and gloom as they lose market share to Indies, eBooks generally are only on the up and up. The problem is, there are no statistics coming out of Amazon, so only Trad stats exist. And the trad stats show things getting worse. But as I said, the trads are losing market share, while eBook sales and subscription reads are booming. It will take some sort of major disaster for Amazon to lose its lead in 2020. Authors hope someone else will come along with the sort of platform Amazon had back in 2015 before they started KU and pay to play advertising, but so far, nada. The Kobo/Walmart deal was a big hope, but nothing came of it. So for Amazon Indie publishing to die in 2020, something major would need to happen, and there are no signs of that happening. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It\u2019s actually growing steadily. There\u2019s never been a better time to be an author as there are so many more choices available. Self-publishing is simple, but it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s growing more crowded each year and more difficult to stand out. For some, those who realize it\u2019s actually running a business and take the time to learn how to do all aspects of the business well, it can be quite lucrative. It\u2019s also nice to have control over everything\u2014though for some, that is a con\u2014they don\u2019t want to find their own editors, designers, learn marketing, spend money on ads, develop a launch strategy. For some people, going the traditional route is a better choice, if they are interested. But, these days, even traditionally published authors are expected to market their books. There is no scenario where you just write\u2014if you want your books to sell well. ",
