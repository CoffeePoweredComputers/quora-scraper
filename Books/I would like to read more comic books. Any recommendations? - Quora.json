            "answer_text": "Toxic Gumbo It's a graphic novella written by all-around artist Lydia Lunch and illustrated by the great Ted McKeever in the late 90s. It was published by DC's Vertigo imprint. It's the tale of a young woman who is literally toxic since before her birth. Voodoo is possibly involved. It explores love and loneliness, hate and kinship, and ultimately loss. I'm not sure where you can get it these days, but it's well worth picking up a copy if you can find one. ",
