            "answer_text": "Yes, but if you want to put it to the test experimentally then the problem would be to understand where to position the experimental apparatus to make measurements :-) Pls excuse me for the joke just aiming at highlighting that, for the uncertainty principle, an electron at rest could be localized anywhere in space with the same probability. That means that the probability to find it in any specific place would be zero! Therefore, the uncertainty principle entails that it cannot be put to test experimentally for particles at rest (of course, in the version of the principle involving position and momentum). Then the next question could be: can such a particle really exist? Our reasoning seems to lead us to the consequences that, if such a particle exists, then it\u2019s position is not observable at all. So, can a particle whose position cannot be found out anyhow exist? The answer coming from QM to this question seems to be yes. In fact, we can do experiments where we measure the momentum of a particle and, thus doing, sticking to conventional interpretations of QM, the outcome becomes the exact momentum of the particle after the measurement. For the Copenhagen interpretation of QM, with the measurement, the particle undergoes a wave function collapse to a pure quantum state of the momentum, which means that the uncertainty on the momentum was thus reduced to zero at expenses of the uncertainty on the position that has now become infinite, with zero probability of localizing the particle in any finite volume of space (exactly as in the case of a particle at rest).

            "answer_text": "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle does not even allow there to be such a thing as an electron at rest. The Uncertainty Principle states that \u0394x\u0394p\u2265\u210f/2\u0394x\u0394p\u2265\u210f/2. Now, if an electron could be at rest, it would have an exact value of momentum (namely, p=0p=0), which implies zero uncertainty in that value. Thus, \u0394p=0\u0394p=0. Substituting \u0394p=0\u0394p=0 in \u0394x\u0394p\u2265\u210f/2\u0394x\u0394p\u2265\u210f/2, we obtain 0\u2265\u210f/20\u2265\u210f/2, which is clearly false. Thus, the Uncertainty Principle does not allow there to be an exact value of momentum. An electron can never be at rest. This shows, more generally, that an electron can never have any exact value of momentum. And the same goes for position. Both are always \u201csmeared out\u201d with non-zero uncertainty. ",

            "answer_text": "Excellent question! A.1: Eppure si mouve = and yet it moves: As suggested out by Tom McFarlane (or at least, as I understand it), Heisenberg\u2019s indeterminacy principle \u0394x\u22c5\u0394px\u2265\u210f/2\u0394x\u22c5\u0394px\u2265\u210f/2 implies that if we knew exactly where the electron is (\u0394x=0\u0394x=0), the indeterminacy in the linear momentum would have to be infinite\u2026 and since the latter cannot possibly happen in practice (after all, there\u2019s only so much linear momentum an electron could possibly have before blowing up Life, the Universe and Everything else with it\u2014including us, who are still here to debate this issue), so that this (absolutely frivolous upper bound on \u0394px\u0394px imposes a lower bound (and if correspondingly frivolous) on \u0394x\u0394x\u2014but a lower bound nonetheless. (Actually, one can derive smarter lower bounds, such as the Planck length\u2026) A.2: Eppure \u00e8 a riposo = and yet it is at rest: Not only is every electron at rest (\u0394p\u20d7=0\u0394p\u2192=0) in its own (aptly named) rest-frame, but it is also at the origin of that frame (and so has \u0394x=0\u0394x=0). (Yes, of course is a rest-frame in itself not an observer, with respect to whom the electron would be both at perfect rest and at a perfectly well-defined position. However, theory of relativity hath no obstruction to affixing an observer to that frame; in fact, it relies on being able to affix observers to any and all reference frame, at will.) The obvious contradiction between the above two answers presents the key dichotomy between quantum physics and (general) relativity. This conceptual dichotomy is evaded in (flat-spacetime) quantum field theory by virtue of the presumed flatness of spacetime. \u201cQuantum field theory in curved spacetime\u201d then includes spacetime curvature effects approximately, without treating variations of the spacetime geometry as fundamentally quantum phenomena. Whence the need for understanding quantum gravity. ",

            "answer_text": "If we assume that electron is at rest at x=0, then it's wave function will be a Dirac delta function delta(x)=0 if x is not equal to zero and delta(x)= infinity if x=0. This means that the probability of finding such electron at all the points except x=0 is zero. On the another side the uncertainty relation (dx)(dp)>_ h/4 pi tells that when dx=0, dp tends to infinity. That means a stationary electron can have any linear momentum between +_ infinity. This in turn means that electron can be found any where. If this is true then it's wave function can not be Dirac delta function. Such contradictory results suggest that Heisenberg uncertainty can not be applied to an electro supposedly at rest. ",
