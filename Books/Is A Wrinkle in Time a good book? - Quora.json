It if you are into science fiction I definitely recommend it, but it doesn\u2019t matter that much, you don\u2019t have to be a science fiction fan to appreciate A Wrinkle In Time. It\u2019s relatively short so you won\u2019t waste much time if you don\u2019t like it, I think you should give it a go. ",
