Writing under a pseudonym or first initial has vast historical precedent, and is a lot more common than you\u2019d think. I write mostly for a general audience, predominantly fantasy, using my own name. (Natasja Rose) I write adult fiction under a Pseudonym, because I don\u2019t want the two very different types of writing associated with each other. (Other Name) You will need to give your real name and details when filling out the financial information, but the only people who will have access to the are the ones in charge of royalty distribution.

            "answer_text": "Yes, there are some states (last time I checked, Nevada was one of them) that allow you to set-up LLC (limited liability corporations) and keep the owner\u2019s name anonymous. This will cost you some money. It is possible to do it yourself but there are still filings with the state that are required. You\u2019ll probably also have to hire an agent in the state where you would be served if someone sues the company. The contract with that agent can mandate privacy of identity. Then, file with the IRS for a TIN (tax ID number). Once you have those in hand, sign-up on CreateSpace as a publishing company. Use a pen name that no one but you knows and have your royalties paid to the LLC. Unless you tell someone you wrote it no one will know. You have options for book promotion because the company can hire people to do PR, etc. I am not an attorney but I have set up a number of LLC\u2019s. My knowledge of Nevada\u2019s rules is from \u201810. Good luck. ",
