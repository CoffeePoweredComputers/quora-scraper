            "answer_text": "So, first, a bit of theory. Sleep consists of REM phases and Non-REM. We dream during REM phases. They happen every 90 minutes. As the night progresses, REM phases become longer and dreams more vivid. The reason we forget them is because of our brains. We have certain mechanisms that delete dreams as unnecessary memories. That's about theory. I mentioned that to re-frame common belief that we have or don't have dreams. I have a couple of tips regarding remembering dreams (you don't need to follow all of them, pick out some or follow all, I will bold those that are necessary): Write down every dream you remember as soon as you wake up. Every details counts. Here, you're training your brain to remember dreams.When you wake up, try not to think about your day. Just relax and try recall your dreams.Don't go to bed with a thought \u201cwhat if I don't remember my dreams\u201d. Just relax.Don't look at any screens at least an hour before bed. It reduces the amount of sleep hormones.When you wake up during the night, use voice recording app to record your dreams. In the morning, listen to it and write them down.Drink a lot of water before bed, so you wake up to pee. There will be some dreams to record.Don't masturbate. I don't have explanation for this one, just happens a lot among people. A lot of people have more dreams if they don't masturbate.Appreciate your dreams. If they are important to you, you'll rememberMeditate. It helps a lotI think that is about it. I hope this helps :-) ",

            "answer_text": "We dream all the time.What you are looking for are the memories of the dreams you had. We dream all the time when we are asleep. Mostly during the REM phase of our sleep. So what you need to do is try to recall the dreams when you wake up. It might not go easily, but you should be able to remember at least 1 dream if you recall them right after waking up.Have a dream diary.Good thing to do is to write down all the dreams you can remember after you wake up. Just take a piece of paper and write down as many details as you can. This will help your brain pay attention to what is happening in your dreams. You will remember more dreams and you might even be able to recognize when you are dreaming, which is the main key for Lucid Dreaming. (Lucid dream)Try to concentrate on the imperfections of dreams. In dreams, nothing feels wrong. It is like a math lesson. No one asks why are we on a market buying 3 tons of potatoes but only 3 kg of cucumber, no one. It is the same in dreams. Ever wondered how you happened to be talking to a penguin i a zoo full of children eating flying sandwiches? Of course not, it is absolutely normal. Lucid dreams were some of the best experience in my life. The feeling was one of the strangest things to ever occur to me. ",

            "answer_text": "To get more dreams, the best thing to do is to sleep early, maybe by 10:00 pm. Set your alarm at about 4:00 am. Then wake up, remain awake for 5-15 min depending upon your drowsiness. Then go back to sleep. Now this time when you sleep, you will get more lucid, vivid or clear dreams. You may wake up frequently. Keep a journal nearby you and record whatever you saw in dream, as much as you can remember. This will also improve your dream recall ability. As this ability improves, you will notice that you remember more dreams, even that which happened at night. Thus you get more dreams. ",

(rapid eye movement) sleep. In this phase your mind becomes more active and has a chance of experiencing a dream. Most of the dreams we have are actually forgotten so most of the time the number of dreams we think we have is actually very minuscule compared to the actual quantity. If you want to increase the number of perceived dreams, try being more conscious of your dreams by getting immersed in it and participate in it more actively. ",

Do not be distracted and think or say anything else. Have a recorder or pen and paper nearby to jot something down when you first start to wake up, whether it is the middle of the night or early in the morning. This usually works the first time you try it. If not, try each night until it does. Melatomin is an over the counter drug, that is highly effective in helping one sleep and remember their dreams.
