This\u201d pre-stage\u201coften happens to people a while before they actually make a commitment. But I would say that the reason then that you can't bring your self to read the Bible COULD be because of the unfortunate \u201creligious\u201d background you have had or something that has resulted in you being resentful against anything that smacks of religious involvement.( My own mother was extremely put off because she was forced into a religious life of ritualistic observances\u2026. \u201cChurch\u201d twice on Sundays by force! ) Others have found this kind of approach to Bible reading has spoiled every thing for them because the scriptures were read as detached from them by pompous clergymen with whom they can find no connection . But if I can encourage you\u2026. (re) reading the Bible is a LOT more than than just reading the Big Book written by a strange and scary God. It IS all about God speaking to you from the Scriptures when He and you share a deep relationship together. This concept is totally strange to \u201creligious\u201d people. They miss the relationship and substitute \u201ccontrol\u201d. The other fact that was mentioned by Jesus, is that, in order to be able to hear from God, you have to be \u201cborn of the spirit\u201d ie Born again. (first our baby body (flesh) is born\u2026 But, as far as communication with GOD, Who is spiritual, our spiritual man has to be birthed.) Someone who hasn't done this and been baptised under the water(John3) has not done what Jesus said and thus this person will struggle with the Bible\u2026because he will try to understand it with his fleshly mind. One thing I can tell you as one who has walked with God through good and hard times, life after you are born again is nothing like it was before that. It is infinitely richer. I can only encourage you to pursue this relationship. You will never be sorry and at the end you will have eternal life and all of your sins will be forgiven through Jesus, so that you can begin with a clean slate. ",

            "answer_text": "Know God\u2026with desire to know him Within all of us there exists a strong desire to be known and to know others. More importantly, all people desire to know their Creator, even if they are not professed believers in God. Today we are bombarded with advertising that promises many ways to satisfy our cravings to know more, have more, be more. However, the empty promises that come from the world will never satisfy in the way that knowing God will satisfy. Jesus said, 'Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent' (John 17:3). So, 'what is the key to truly knowing God?' First, it is imperative to understand that man, on his own, is incapable of truly knowing God because of man\u2019s sinfulness. The Scriptures reveal to us that we are all sinful (Romans 3) and that we fall well short of the standard of holiness required to commune with God. We are also told that the consequence of our sin is death (Romans 6:23) and that we will perish eternally without God unless we accept and receive the promise of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. So, in order to truly know God, we must first receive Him into our lives. 'As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name' (John 1:12). Nothing is of greater importance than understanding this truth when it comes to knowing God. Jesus makes it clear that He alone is the way to heaven and to a personal knowledge of God: 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me' (John 14:6). There is no requirement to begin this journey besides accepting and receiving the promises mentioned above. Jesus came to breathe life into us by offering Himself as a sacrifice so our sins will not prevent us from knowing God. Once we have received this truth, we can begin the journey of knowing God in a personal way. One of the key ingredients in this journey is understanding that the Bible is God's Word and is His revelation of Himself, His promises, His will. The Bible is essentially a love letter written to us from a loving God who created us to know Him intimately. What better way to learn about our Creator than to immerse ourselves in His Word, revealed to us for this very reason? And it is important to continue this process throughout the entire journey. Paul writes to Timothy, 'But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work' (2 Timothy 3:14-16). Finally, truly knowing God involves our commitment to obey what we read in the Scriptures. After all, we were created to do good works (Ephesians 2:10) in order to be part of God's plan of continuing to reveal Himself to the world. We carry the responsibility to live out the very faith that is required to know God. We are salt and light on this earth (Matthew 5:13-14), designed to bring God's flavor to the world and to serve as a shining light in the midst of darkness. Not only must we read and understand God's Word, we must apply it obediently and remain faithful (Hebrews 12:1-3). Jesus Himself placed the greatest importance on loving God with all we are and loving our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 22). This command is impossible to keep without the commitment to reading and applying His truth revealed in His Word. Studing the Bible is crucial These are the keys to truly knowing God. Of course, our lives will involve much more, such as commitment to prayer, devotion, fellowship, and worship. But those can only follow making a decision to receive Jesus and His promises into our lives and accepting that we, on our own, cannot truly know God. Then our lives can be filled with God, and we can experience knowing Him intimately and personally.Knowing how to study the Bible is important, because determining the meaning of Scripture is one of the most important tasks a believer has in this life. God does not tell us that we must simply read the Bible. We must study it and handle it correctly (2 Timothy 2:15). Studying the Scriptures is hard work. A cursory or brief scanning of Scripture can sometimes yield very wrong conclusions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand several principles for determining the correct meaning of Scripture. First, the one who would study the Bible must pray and ask the Holy Spirit to impart understanding, for that is one of His functions. \u201cBut when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come\u201d (John 16:13). Just as the Holy Spirit guided the apostles in the writing of the New Testament, He also guides us in the understanding of Scripture. The Bible is God\u2019s book, and we need to ask Him what it means. If you are a Christian, the author of Scripture\u2014the Holy Spirit\u2014dwells inside you, and He wants you to understand what He wrote. Second, to study the Bible properly, we cannot pull a verse out of the verses that surround it and try to determine the meaning of the verse outside of the context. We should always read the surrounding verses and chapters to discern the context. While all of Scripture comes from God (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21), God used men to write it down. These men had a theme in mind, a purpose for writing, and a specific issue they were addressing. To study the Bible, we should understand the background of the book we are studying: it\u2019s helpful to know who wrote the book, to whom it was written, when it was written, and why it was written. Also, we should take care to let the text speak for itself. Sometimes people will assign their own meanings to words in order to get the interpretation they desire. Third, to study the Bible properly, we should not think of ourselves as totally independent in our analysis of the text. It is arrogant to think that we cannot gain understanding through the lifelong work of others who have studied Scripture. Some people, in error, approach the Bible with the idea that they will depend on the Holy Spirit alone and they will discover all the hidden truths of Scripture. Christ, in the giving of the Holy Spirit, has given people with spiritual gifts to the body of Christ. One of these spiritual gifts is that of teaching (Ephesians 4:11\u201312; 1 Corinthians 12:28). These teachers are given by the Lord to help us to correctly understand and obey Scripture. It is always wise to study the Bible with other believers, assisting each other in understanding and applying the truth of God\u2019s Word. So, in summary, the proper way to study the Bible is to prayerfully and humbly rely on the Holy Spirit to give us understanding; study verses in their context, recognizing that the Bible explains itself; and respect the efforts of other Christians, past and present, who have also sought to properly study the Bible. Remember, God is the author of the Bible, and He wants us to understand it. ",
