            "answer_text": "Sorry, you made me laugh. If you are an unknown writer without an agent, and you get extremely lucky in a Twitter pitch fest, as I did, and let a small press publisher take it, the process will take two years. The first year will be the dance between you and the editor who picks it up for the publishing company where she\u2019ll asks for rewrites without offering a contract, then offering the contract, then putting you on the \u201cediting schedule\u201d which means you\u2019ll wait six months for the first edit, do your part, and you pass the manuscript back and forth a few times before the editor declares it ready. Then the publisher will place you in the publishing queue and give you a publishing date. A year is too short a schedule to expect your book to get traditionally published. ",

            "answer_text": "You go about it by self-publishing. There is no way any publisher will ever move that quickly, even for their A-list authors. A friend of mine wrote a manuscript in under three months. It took another two years before it was done with editing before they were ready to start the publishing process to get it into the bookstores. Unless the head editor at a publisher is a close family member or friend, it is highly unlikely that this is even possible. (Well, it is if you are a fabulously famous celebrity who is a household name and they want your biography. Then it is definitely doable.) ",
