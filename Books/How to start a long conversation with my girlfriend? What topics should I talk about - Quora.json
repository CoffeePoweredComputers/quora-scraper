You may try asking her more about her interests and hobbies, try to find similar things that you like doing or similar beliefs that you share. Maybe ask her about her opinion on popular topics, like the coronavirus, fashion, music, studies, global warming or, whatever she likes to talk about as a person. If you don't know her that well yet, simply ask her what she would like to talk about instead and let her lead your conversation. ",

And when you ask either of those questions, more will come rolling in. ",
