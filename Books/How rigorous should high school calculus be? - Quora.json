            "answer_text": "There's a lot of arguments for why calculus shouldn't be taught in high school. But, I will say the level of rigor in the typical AP Calculus BC is not as rigorous as I'd like calculus to be. When I learned Calclus in high school, either the teachers or students (guided by worksheets) would derive the formulas and theorems that we would use for the rest of the course. That's the level of rigor that I expect. I don't know if the typical high school Calculus goes in depth on the epsilon-delta definition of a limit. So I'd say that the typical college level Calculus should be the standard. With this in the mind, the argument for Calculus not being taught in high school becomes more valid. This isn't to say that no one in high school can learn Calculus with college rigor (I certainly did). I'd argue that algebra education is a better place to focus on, cause lack of algebra skills is a major detriment in later math courses. I'll say this, an Calculus class that describes things in terms of \u201cjust memorizing formulas\u201d misses the point entirely of Calculus. Conceptual understanding of what limits, derivatives, and integrals represent is key to using Calculus as a tool to model the world (i.e. Physics, economics, etc). ",

            "answer_text": "60 years ago, I had high school calculus. I thought I was well schooled \u2014 and flunked the first course. [Note: I have a PhD in math]. I don\u2019t think you can make secondary school calculus strong enough to give students a leg up in college. It\u2019s not that the teachers can\u2019t, it\u2019s that first-year (college) is not high school grade 13. In many schools, first year calculus is a five hour course: class meets every day and there are lots of practice problems. High schools can\u2019t match that. ",
