            "answer_text": "First of all, why do you want to score marks in the range of 25\u201330 when you can score a lot more? Looking at the trends of previous year papers, Current Affairs form the major chunk of the Gk Section in CLAT. At least 40 out of 50 questions are expected from Current Affairs Section.(there were 47\u201348 in CLAT 2017). Gk is the most scoring section in the entire paper and getting 40+ out of 50 marks is not a tough task, provided you follow the proper strategy. Coming to the first part of the question i.e. Is P.D. enough for current affairs? The answer is NO. P.D. is a magazine which caters to students preparing for exams like UPSC. It does not cover all the current affairs of the month, but only the most important ones, and some of them in great depth. It would be utterly disastrous to rely just on P.D. for your CLAT prep as CLAT is infamous for asking questions which are not even covered in daily newspapers. Look at the paper of CLAT 2017 and AILET 2017 and you would understand my point better. So now the question is how to cover all the Current Affairs without missing on important details? The answer is referring to various reliable sources. You cannot cover current affairs for clat from a single source. NEVER. Some good sources which you should refer are: Online websites like gktoday, jagran josh, affairscloud etc.(gktoday is the best).Give daily quizzes on these websites to retain what you have read.A good daily newspaper like The Hindu,Economic Times etc.There is an app on playstore named Current Affairs(symbol is Current affairs written in a dark blue background). This app is very useful for daily current affairs.Read a monthly compendium to revise your current affairs for the complete month(again gk today and affairs cloud are good).You could also read a magazine like Pratiyogita Darpan but it is upto your choice.You could also make your own notes to revise all the current affairs before the exam. Writing down current affairs would immensely help in retaining.This preparation seems quite exhaustive but it would be truly rewarding when you sit for the actual CLAT where other aspirants would be cursing the gk section.I hope I answered your question. Any doubts are most welcome!! All the best!!! ",
