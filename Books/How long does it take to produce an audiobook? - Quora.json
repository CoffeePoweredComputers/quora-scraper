            "answer_text": "The first thing I have to do is read the entire book before I begin any recording. This is called \"prep\". Once I start recording, it takes 1 day for every 2 hours of audio to do the initial recording. So if a book is 10 hours long, I can have the initial recording done in a week. Then a proofer goes through and listens for any mistakes, noises, and audio that doesn't match the text. I'll need a day to fix any mistakes that person finds. Then another day to master it (EQ, compression, other technical things). I can have a 10 hour book done and ready for audible in about 8 days, give or take. ",
