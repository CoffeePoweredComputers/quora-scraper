            "answer_text": "Although Pete Gannet is 100% correct in his answer, I feel as you might be asking the other way of interpreting this question, and that is if cancer can spread by blood as a bloodborne disease would, such as HIV/AIDS. You CANNOT get cancer from someone else, in any form; kissing, sexual relations, blood transfusions. Your immune system, most notably the Macrophages (effective \u201cgarbage trucks\u201d of your bloodstream), will recognize the other persons cells as a foreign body, and dispose of them properly, via the kidney and the Kupfer cells in the liver. There is however, under the right conditions, a possibility of the cancerous cells will deloping in your body (not yours, the other individuals; Notably, if the person is taking anti-biotics, and other immuno-suppressants such as Clodronate (which kills the macrophages that circulate in your body), the body\u2019s immune system will not be able to get rid of the cancer , and it may grow. Although cancer is not contagious, whether by blood or air, many diseases that cause it are, such as: HPV (human papilloma virus - cevical, vaginal, other sexual organ cancers, oral/mouth cancer via oral sex)EBV ( Epsterin-Barr Virus - nose, throat, and lymphoma)HBV/HCV (Hepatitis B and C viruses - liver infections which can lead to liver cancers",

            "answer_text": "Yes and is, in fact, how metastasis occurs. The primary tumor is where the cancer started (lung, breast, prostate, etc.). As the tumor grows, some cells will slough off and enter the blood and can be detected as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or circulating stem cells (CSCs). Many of these will not survive but some will \u2018put down roots\u2019 so to speak and a new tumor (metastasis) will start. These days, primary tumors are not so bad and can be treated with reasonable success though there are exceptions. It is when Metastasis has occurred that the trouble begins as there are often multiple metastasis sites. These days it is not the primary tumor in cancer that kills you, it is metastasis. ",

These cells capable of growing into nearby organs and tissues, as well as metastasizing to distantly located organs penetrating the blood- and lymphatic streams. The process can take years, and even decades. Malignant cells have a high growth rate, and metastases arise if these cells germinate into the vessels. After this, the process of dissemination of cancer cells throughout the body cannot be stopped\\controlled without such aggressive treatment like chemotherapy. ",
