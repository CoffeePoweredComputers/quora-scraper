            "answer_text": "Bad. I somehow managed to trudge through ten pages before my mind cried, \u201cno more\" & I was forced to pay heed & shun this feel-good repository of self-help goobledygook from my sight. Amongst books that ride on popular trends, it's equivalent to Perenium Sunning. It's again, a bullshit & hyped up nonsense borne out of this unhealthy obsession the West has with all things Orient, including philosophy. Apparently, the true meaning of life & self isn't revealed to you unless you embark on a pilgrimage to a far away land in the East & prostrate yourself in front of an old know-it-all whose \u2018deep' wisdom is only revealed in riddles & incomprehensible jargon. Indeed, this trope has not only existed since aeons & manifested itself through all kind of art forms from sub cultures to comic book movie adaptations, but has permeated & grown roots in literature, particularly the bland genre of self-help books. They've mistranslated Rumi to damaging extents, made much out of a bare leaflet called, \u201cThe Art of War\", & now they've added too much floof & air to ikigai, seemingly a secret way of life which has enriched many lives in Okinawa in particular & Japan in general. Similar advice or wiseassery can be found in many cultures, & countless philosophers have touched upon it. Infact, one's purpose in life, is an enduring question in philosophy & various art forms. Various philosophers like Victor Frankl & Nietzsche have reflected on the subject. The articulate atheist & holocaust survivor, Primo Levi too has written on it. The Indian epic, Mahabharata runs on similar themes as well, so do movies like \u201cThe Grey\" & \u201cBatman Begins\". The Japanese merely have a word for one's purpose in the world, that's all. The godforsaken venn diagram now famous on the internet isn't even an Japanese concept, but borne out of the mind of some life-coach internet has no scarcity of. In light of all this, if one is wrapping up an extremely trite & debated to death idea of \u201cone's true purpose in life\" as a Japanese secret so as to add a mystery element to it, then I call bullshit.  (Apart from the fact that this venn diagram is divorced from reality, it's something that originated on an internet blog, not Japan) Red flags existed & perhaps I wouldn't be five hundred bucks poorer if only I had taken notice. The first, & the most glaring of them all is found on the book's cover itself. The cover goes as forth, \u201cIkigai: The Japanese secret to a long & happy life\". The cover, ironically, is also an enduring criticism of the self-help floof in the book. The Japanese aren't a happy people by any measure. Their work culture is extremely toxic & has taken a toll on everything from birth rates to well being of their people. Okinawa fares better but isn't the heaven it has been made to be. If anything, Japan should stand as a case study for the benefit of the larger world. There's no secret to happiness when there's no happiness to begin with. There are other places the book speaks about, like Sardinia for example, is a haven for the rich. Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica is a paradise with laid back people who lead easy & fulfilling lives. Loma Linda is highly liberal & one of the best places to have a home in California. Apparently, ikigai only works if you're placed above the rut of the trappings of the middle class. Like all self help books, is one for the privileged who by the virtue of it have everything already figured out. This is packaged as \u201cikigai\u201d and sold to the multitude of Plebians like us, whose lives aren't theirs to begin with. Our lives are twisted, & the twist can't be undone by a simple venn diagram that's too idealistic to have any semblance of reality. Truth be told, though each man reflects on his raison d'etre, he does so, because he doesn't hold the reins of his future; well if he's affluent &/or resides in a tropical/hill paradise with few wants, then it's a different matter altogether. What about you? You, to whom the book primarily speaks to. Let's assume for a moment that the venn diagram truly reflects the concept of ikigai, now what? You could be an amazing coder & you're paid exceptionally well for your services, but your personal life is a mess & the mercy of the administration. How are you going to balance it out with the other circles? A poor man, though a talented sprinter of some repute, is forced to sell vegetables from a stall because his talent doesn't pay well, he has no other talents to speak of, he can't afford to develop one because each day is a struggle with hunger. How do you sell him this bullshit concept of ikigai? A large number of men & women in our country are condemned on the conveyor belts of Engineering & medical colleges. With huge loans, these men & women are pressed to find a job as soon as they get out from these hell holes. They have parents to look for, sisters to take care for, they will jump at anything that comes their way because they lack choice. And that's the tragedy with all of us. The agency of choice diminishes proportionally to one's standing in their society. Self-help books run on the premise that the reader has the agency, & the time to change their lives for good if only they'd follow what's written in letter & spirit. I'm privileged but I suffer from a genetic condition, what should be my ikigai? That, in itself, is a troubling & a multi-layered question. My why to live may change on a daily basis, a large part of it depends on my mental health. I'm not concerned about a mission or passion because I die in the end anyway. That's how I think, & this thought is deeply therapeutic to me. It also stands against everything the book preaches. Life is multifaceted by nature, & unpredictable. People fall as swiftly as they rise often. Ikigai has no place in my world where you often have to pinch your nose & take a dive just for that extra increment, in a job market which you already despise. When, you're unwell but you worry for your loved ones & their future, & are pushed out of the bed every single day to secure their future after you cease to exist. That's my ikigai, I guess. Not the airy, feel-good life hack, the authors preach. Few men & women excel at what they like & make money out of it. This self-help book assumes that such things are a norm, just like well to do Okinawans, & residents of Sardinia must be for all of the humanity. The world doesn't function like that. Man wouldn't start actively hunting for his why than being content with the path already charted for him by his circumstances if things were this easy. The book assumes they are, & therein lies my hatred for self-help trash peddled actively by modern day sages. The modern day world is the one in which such experiments to take control over our lives for good often fail. For the modern man, everything is a luxury, even time to reflect on his passion & dreams. He lacks agency because he's burdened by the weight of expectations, job security & love for his loved ones. Some are even happy in such a setting, some revel in mediocrity, some would risk whatever little time they have for the self for one promotion in an administration he has no love for. That's the truth. That's the life we live. The tropical paradise of Sardinia & its content folk are an anomaly but are the ideal human beings for the writers. The protagonists of this book, like the Okinawans seem to live better lives because of many circumstances. Their secret, so to speak, is birthed due to the geographical, political, economic & genetic lottery they've won. Because they've been gifted with abundance of all the good things in the world, they're content, & have the luxury to hold the reins over their lives. Truth be told, prosperity begets your ikigai, not the other way round. If they were as poor like me, such secrets to a better life would sound hollow & empty. The book, in my opinion is not worth anyone's time. Perhaps, those who have the time for exclusive book clubs & Yoga studios would gain something from it, people like me wouldn't. So, away it goes, in some forgotten corner in my bookshelf. The very sight of it irritates me to end. The authors preach contentment, mine lies in banishing their labour of love from my sight. ",

            "answer_text": "I read the book in the beginning of 2020. I felt It was a good read. Looking at the book cover, I was expecting to get some Japanese secret to long and happy life and I was intrigued to find out about ikigai. What is it and how it will help to live longer (100 years or above). As I started reading, I found lot of insights which I was not expecting. I had read bits and pieces about longevity. What studies have shown about centenarians, what do they do differently. Studies, papers, TED talks, so I had some idea on what they say about what makes one to live to 100 years or beyond. This book gave condensed information around all such aspects by studying directly in the island of Okinawa where maximum centenarians (24.55 out of every 100) are found. What do they do which we can try to do in our own life. What do they eat, drink, how do they exercise, how do they manage stress, how living in close community and social ties and relationship is having an impact on their well being and longevity. Importantly, it will also give direction to find your ikigai, which is nothing but the reason you wake up in the morning looking forward to it. It is the one that makes you flow, in full concentration and enthusiasm and lose sense of time. I personally could not figure out my ikigai yet. However, there were several insights that I got from the book, you can see here. Even if we apply some of these insights in our daily lives, which I am trying to do, we will live better and can add more years to our life. ",
