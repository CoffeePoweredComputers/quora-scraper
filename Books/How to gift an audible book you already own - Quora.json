            "answer_text": "This is my experience from in the UK. There's no sensible way of sending the file. Audible and e-books don't work the same way as physical books, where you hand over the physical object and no longer possess it. Particularly in the case of audiobooks, if you've read it, you may not want to read it again, which means that if you want to give it to another person there's two people who've made use of it, at least. If they were to avoid using DRM (Digital Rights Management) and everyone could do what they wanted with the physical files, Audible would go bankrupt as people like you who thought \"I want to give this audiobook to someone I know\" did, and the recipients sent the files to people they knew and so on. You don't own a physical object, you own the right to play it on particular devices. Audible makes some money on individual sales (paying \u00a320 upwards for a book), and some money on monthly subscriptions. Judging by the price of their monthly subscriptions, they can make a profit on full-length ebooks for about \u00a38 upwards. Therefore, buy a gift subscription of 1 credit (\u00a38) (or more expensively for several books) with a note saying that you have a particular audiobook and thought they might like it. Then you just email them that. ",
