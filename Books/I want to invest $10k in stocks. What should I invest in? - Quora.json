            "answer_text": "Here's what you should do: 1) Open a Vanguard account and deposit your money into their money market (will take a couple days to verify your bank and transfer the money).Vanguard has the lowest fees in the industry for their funds, but not the lowest trade commission. But as you'll see soon, that doesn't matter. 2) Open a Brokerage account under your Vanguard account. 3) Find some Vanguard ETFs that have been increasing in share price for the past 3-5 years. If you aren't familiar with ETFs, they are short for Exchange Traded Funds, and are essentially a way to trade shares of a mutual fund like a stock.  4) If you want to be active in your investment, track the 1 and 5 year moving averages for the ETFs your interested in. Look for the dip and rise patterns that determine when it a good time to buy and sell.  Most of the time if the share price drops below the 5 year moving average, and the ETF has historically been above that line, you should buy. This will pretty much guarantee the share price will go back above the 5 year moving average because of the momentum. Once the share price goes back above that line, sell. This way you'll almost never lose money as long as the market as a whole is going well. Don't get too greedy and try to buy at the exact bottom and sell at the exact top, you'll probably lose out on a lot of chances and lose some money. Some ETFs won't ever go to the 5 year moving average, and that's when you'll have to look at the 1 year and find some patterns. The reason this strategy is profitable is because ETFs track so many different companies at once and you aren't betting on rises and falls from a single company. If want a more passive investment, you can check the risk/reward filters on the ETF search and determine what you're comfortable leaving your money in. There's even a Total Stock Market ETF. There's many return percentages on the ETF table that'll give you a performance clue as to what your return will be. Coming back to why the commission (which is $7 for the first 25 trades and $20 there after) doesn't matter. When you trade Vanguard's ETFs through there own trading platform, the commission is Free. Unfortunately, they have a 25 per 12-month trade limit on any one single ETF, so you'll have to spread the love if you're more active than that. Anyway, I've used this strategy to get me between 25-30% annual growth on my account.  Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "10k isn't quite enough to create a diversified portfolio without transaction fees noticeably eating into your profits. A portfolio of just 1-3 stocks (especially the growth stocks that some of the collapsed answers are recommending) will expose you to a lot of volatility. I would recommend seeing what index funds your broker has available with low fees (something that tracks the S&P 500 is standard). Invest most your 10k in that. The remainder should go into some sort of bond fund with low fees as well. A general guideline is that you should own your age as a percentage in bonds (e.g. if you're 20, then 20% of your portfolios should be bonds). Then just hold on to your portfolio and just let it sit! You can't predict when the market will go down. On average it just goes up. ",
