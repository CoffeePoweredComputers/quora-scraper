Well, if you\u2019re on a relationship then I assume it happened because both of you enjoyed each other\u2019s company and talking to each other, so it shouldn\u2019t be hard to have an interesting conversation with her. Just talk about something you both are into and build it up from there. It all goes down to your interests in the end so there\u2019s not much one can say about it. ",
