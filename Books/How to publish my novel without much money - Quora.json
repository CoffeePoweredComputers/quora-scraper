            "answer_text": "Well, there are plenty of options available.If you really wish to sell books, and gain a reader base, then you will have to invest money at one stage or the other. These are the options open to you. Firstly try self-publishing. As the name says it, you will be publishing your own book. There are various platforms that are available for the same. Easiest would be Amazon KDP.( KDP select is a little tricky as it excepts exclusivity). With Amazon hosting your book, you can sell ebooks as well as paper back. ebooks works this way \u2014 you will have to write the book, get it edited and formatted then enroll into their KDP program. YOu get to set the price ( based on Ur genre) and can sell it globally. Amazon will obviously take a cut but if your book is kept at 4$ with 30% royalty you can get around 200 for ebook which is decent. Paperbacks work differently \u2014 with proper formatting, you can set up your book for print publishing in Amazon and they print it on demand and defuse the printing charges from your author royalty. If you enroll into KDP select \u2014 you can avail some benifits like \u2014 kindle countdown freebies and also you can get your book into kindle unlimited. Amazon is big giant when it comes to ebooks but you also have other retailers like Smashwords. They sell it on their own platform and also act as retail distributers to other bookstores like Apple, Barnes and Nobles, Scribd, etc..but they are very selective and picky about book formatting. In this your are not investing in getting your book setup on the their platforms but for you to sell books, you will have to advertise and promote and that will definitely need some investment but the budgest depends on how extensive you want it to be. Other option is to get it self-published via a publication house but I personally feel it's kind of pointless. they take huge sumps of money but offer very little in return. They format your book and make it available on various platforms, but that's it. No promotions, advertising or even free author copies. You will have to pay extra for it all. I won't take names of such publishing house here but you can google it and you will find plenty, but I personally don't stand by them. And lastly, you can try for getting it published 'traditionally\u2019 where you won't have to spend a single penny ( except for maybe finding a book agent? ) But all such traditonal publications are extremely picky about books they choose and if yours is chosen then they will handle everything and pay for giving them the rights on your book. If your self-publishing you will have all rights on your book. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there, Disclaimer First: I am one of the founders @ Notion Press Publishing. If you have already written your novel, you have a few options. 1. You could approach a traditional publisher and submit your manuscript for a review. A traditional publishing contract doesn't require you to invest. The cost of publishing is borne by the publisher. However, traditional publishers get bombarded with hundreds of manuscripts and take a long time to even go through them ( if at all they do ). More often than not, they also reject first time authors due to a perceived risk. 2. You could subsequently approach a guided self-publishing platform similar to Notion Press Publishing and work with a team of book experts who will take care of the entire publishing process and bring your book out to the market. In this guided publishing model, you will own 100% of the rights to the book and take home 100% of the profits from book sales. There is an initial one time investment to be made. Self-publishing platforms usually have multiple publishing packages and you can pick and choose whichever one fits your budget. Notion Press lets you customize your own publishing package according to your preferences and budget. You can pick and choose whichever publishing services you would need and pay just for that. 3. Your third option would be to publish it by yourself by using platforms like KDP or Createspace. This would essentially require you to take care of every aspect of publishing ie. cover design, interior formatting, editing etc by yourself. Such platforms are mostly free to use and take a commission from each book sale and pay out a percentage of the profits in terms of royalty. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have even a little computer savvy (or a relatively small amount to pay someone to help you with formatting), you can publish yourself on any retail site (Amazon, BN, Kobo, Smashwords, ibooks). It\u2019s free to publish ebooks at these sites and (at Amazon and BN) paperbacks. You can also try to secure a literary agent to present your work to a major publisher or work with a smaller publisher, who may not require that you have an agent. One of my web pages has a downloadable paper on things to consider when working with a publisher. It also has a link to a free class on thinking through self publishing. I publish some books myself and work with a small publisher. The most important thing is to write a top-quality book, first. Sometimes it\u2019s tempting to rush a book into publication simply because you can do it. Have people review your draft and insist they provide constructive criticism, and try to pay for a copyeditor and a cover artist. If you don\u2019t have the funds, sell some things on ebay. All of the retail websites have guidance that lets you know how to format your book. Amazon has templates for your paperback. I do paperbacks there and at BN because BN bookstores can find your books faster if a customer wants to order one. Finally, I mentioned inexpensive assistance with formatting and covers. Though I know how to format my own books, I have used people from the Smashwords list. Smashwords is what\u2019s called an aggregator \u2014 you load your book there and they place it on just about every site except Amazon. Smashwords\u2019 founder, Mark Coker, updates the resource list regularly. A wonderful resource. Keep writing, and good luck! Elaine L. Orr www.elaineorr.com ",

            "answer_text": "How do I get my short story/book published without any money? It would depend on whether or not you wanted to make any money from your short story/book. If you don\u2019t, then the process is easy. Sign up to a free blog service like Blogspot and publish your story through there. There are also other sites that I\u2019ve seen mentioned on this site that also allow you to showcase your stories for free. If you want to sell your short story/book though, that is slightly different. For one thing, the process is different for a story (find submission guidelines for magazines and approach the ones your story fits in with - you might even get paid for it, if they publish it), and a book. If you have a short book, you could self-publish it, as it is unlikely that a traditional publisher would take it on. Another idea, if you are keen for a traditional publishing contract, is to look at getting your story included in an Anthology - you can Google for submission guidelines for that sort of thing too. I should point out the Anthology idea might be difficult if you are a new author. To self-publish, you need:- An editor - every story put out for publication in any form should be edited by someone else. The way to do that for free, is ask a friend, someone studying English in college, a teacher or someone like that to do it for you - or a fellow author.A cover - If you have photoshop, or a similar graphics program, you can make one yourself. If you absolutely can\u2019t do it yourself, then find a free relevant graphic from somewhere like Pixelbay (I think that is the right name) and use the \u201cMake a cover\u201d option when you upload your book to Amazon. Another alternative (cheap but will cost money) is Fiverr, which as the name implies, you can get a cover made for $5.Your document in Word format, or PDF - hopefully you have that already.And that is pretty much it - you can open a free account with KDP on Amazon. You upload your book, and then market the link for your sales page through social media - also free, but time consuming. I really want to stress, having no money is no longer a barrier to being published, but if this is not a one time thing, and you are serious about publishing more, then your reputation as an author will be improved by paying for important things like editing and covers. Writing is like any other business, and as such, requires a time and financial investment. Over the long term, that investment can pay off, but it does take time. Good luck, and thank you for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. In all honesty, never use the words, \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cpublishing\u201d together. I know it is just semantics, but as soon as you use that word, warning bells go off in my head. So jokes and such aside, how can you publish in the most economically viable way? There is only one way to achieve the impossible, and that is to learn to do everything yourself, but you will still require the services of a capable editor. You must also know that an editor and a proofreader are not the same service even if one is \u2018cheaper\u2019 and looks good to the wallet. I only know of one author that produces brilliant novels with almost no errors, and he is the only person who edits the books. Of course, it does take him years to release his next book. You have a choice to make. Are you prepared to learn to do everything properly yourself? Trust me, it will take you quite some time to learn and to perfect your technique. There is a multitude of things to learn if you want to produce a pleasing result. There are only shortcuts once you already know what you are doing, and these are learnt by experience. If you can\u2019t do certain things for yourself, you will need to pay people that can. Many authors expect a reader to invest in their product (the book), and yet they won\u2019t contribute to it themselves. It always shows, in the quality. The route that costs you the least \u2014 at least on the outset \u2014 is to get a publisher. I mean a real publisher, and not some crook online who doesn\u2019t know an ePub from an iPotato. If you are asked to pay a publisher, immediately run away screaming, and find another one. If you cannot secure the interest of the traditional publishing world \u2014 and there is no shame in that either \u2014 you can always self-publish. The more you learn about publishing, the more you can do yourself. I learnt it all for myself, which is why I offer my services to other authors. I still have an editor, though. Edit: A good starting point in finding a quality service is to avoid cheap sites. If it sounds too good to be true ... well, need I say more? Disaster and embarrassment are never cheap. ",

Smashwords is good too, and I love their philosophy, but I phased them out of my publishing routine a few years ago. The reward wasn\u2019t worth the time spent. I might bring them back now that they don\u2019t require you to upload a Word doc. I think it is also important to mention how to prepare your novel for SUCCESS when it is published. Professional cover: Budget $300 for your cover and use Logos, Web, Graphic Design & More. | 99designs to host a contest. I\u2019ve found and used freelance designers by other means as well, but 99 Designs is the safest and most reliable. Proof/Copy Editing: Budget another $300 for editing. This kind of money won\u2019t buy you an awesome editor, but it can buy you a good one who is starting out and trying to build their portfolio. (Use a freelance site such as Home :: Bibliocrunch or Find the perfect editor, designer or marketer | Reedsy) If you are determined to go with free editing, then use several beta readers with keen eyes for detail. Solicit a dozen target audience readers who are willing to send you the mistakes they catch for free. Four or five of them will follow through in a timely manner. ",

            "answer_text": "Use Createspace.com. There is a reason Amazon is the largest online retailer in the world. It is because Amazon makes an effort to innovate and get new /refreshing products . Createspace is an Amazon company , it works in a very unique manner. You just have to upload your book on to their platform and Createspace will sell your book on their website and also Amazon sites all over the world, whenever somebody decides to buy a copy of your book it will be printed and delivered to the customer. You can decide the price of your book yourself, a basic printing cost will be fixed based on the number of pages and various other factors. The remaining amount between the list price and print cost is your take. http://Createspace.com is the perfect solution for everyday writers like you and me who don't want to waste our time with traditional publishers and their long outdated grind of sending , selecting , publishing a book. Createspace and Amazon give you a ready made marketplace and a robust market with many potential buyers. Also, now self published authors are making it really big with the growing awareness amongst people . Example - EL James , Amish Tripathi and many more. Kindle direct publishing is also a great tool if you're interested in publishing an E-book , they offer a 30\u201370% royalty. Audible is a website to publish Audiobooks if you want. I would also encourage you to sign up for the newsletters of KDP and Createspace, their articles and community of writers provide you with the required tools and motivation for starting your writing journey. All the above companies are amazon companies I mentioned these because I know these are the best. Also , there are various other options out there also you're free to check out (Google them) Check these out and let me know how your books pan out.\\U0001f600 ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026I was alerted by the post of Andrew Chapman that you already have a published book, which is being listed at nearly $32 USD for 176 pages, and has no lower-priced digital version that people can buy. That book additionally has a cover that\u2019s peculiarly shaped\u2014looks more like a Powerpoint presentation, than a proper book\u2014the book appears to be 8\u2033 wide and 6\u2033 tall. All of this is rather odd, and the LITB (look Inside the Book) is so limited that I can\u2019t reasonably infer the rationale for the decisions that led to such a short book being so expensive, nor the size and shape, etc. (I take it that\u2019s a coffee-table book, as we call them here in the States?) I assume that you\u2019re trying to republish this book, in a more-viable way, is that right? Alrighty\u2014affordable options, coming right up. You can\u2014although I wouldn\u2019t say that this is necessarily the best way to do it\u2014 create your print layout using Word or another word-processor. Some folks use OO (Open Office) or its offshoot, LO (LibreOffice). Any of those three will allow you to make a readable book. No, despite what anyone tells you, it won\u2019t look like it was laid out by Random House, but it will be readable, and you can do that for free. Or, you can buy a book \u201ctemplate\u201d from one of the many websites that have popped up, selling them, and use one of those to aid you. Alternatively, you could learn to use either MS Publisher or Adobe\u2019s InDesign, and do your own layout. Of the two, assuming you don\u2019t want to do this professionally, I\u2019d say choose Publisher, as it\u2019s less expensive and the learning curve isn\u2019t quite as steep, and you can get a perfectly acceptable print layout by using it. The downsides to using either Publisher or InDesign is that despite Adobe\u2019s advertising to the contrary, you can\u2019t just push a button and get an eBook. But if you are religious about making sure that any edits you make, in your print layout, are echoed in your word-processing file, you can stick with using Word, (maybe) for your eBook. Some folks in this thread, and others will mention Smashwords\u2019 eBook \u201cformatting,\u201d but typically, the people on that list do nothing but clean up Word files. That\u2019s not \u201ceBook formatting.\u201d It\u2019s Word-file cleaning. Sure, you can use a cleaned Word file to make a simple book, by uploading it at the KDP (or Smashwords). If your book isn\u2019t simple\u2014if you use embedded fonts, fleurons, images, charts, tables, etc., then using a Word file is not going to get you a satisfactory result. Fine for fiction. Not so fine for anything else. Your ability to build your own eBook is dependent on too many factors to easily outline here. Plus, folks\u2019 assessment of their own technical ability is frequently, well, off-kilter, let\u2019s say. (I had a woman blithely tell me how tecchie she was, the other day, how she\u2019d been involved in the early tech movement, yabbity-yabbity, and of course, when I saw her Word file, while she\u2019d used Word\u2019s built-in headings, she hadn\u2019t used Styles. So, after going on and on about how tecchie she was, she didn\u2019t bother to use Word\u2019s most fundamental and key functions\u2014the one single thing that every user of Word should know how to use. [And which most don\u2019t].) Without knowing and understanding Word\u2019s Styles and Headings, you have precisely zero chance of competently building a solid eBook from a word-processing file. (n.b.: this applies to any word-processor, not merely Word; they all function on the same principles.) You can find relatively \u201ccheap\u201d formatting help for eBooks, however. If you take some time, and don\u2019t rush it, and shop around, you can probably find someone who can do the book quite affordably. Make sure that you\u2019ve checked references, that you can see that person\u2019s work (in an environment outside of his/her website!!), that you have a decent idea of what an eBook should, and should not, look like, so that you\u2019re not taken for a ride. (I had a guy in my office recently, paid a fortune for someone to make his very-complex ePUB\u2014and while the ePUB is fine and usable, the MOBI version is utterly useless. The formatter didn\u2019t know enough about the Kindle eBook world to ensure that the [very, very] expensive work that they did would work on Amazon, of all things. More wasted money. ) Without knowing if you can write HTML, or understand the logic of it, I can\u2019t know if you could DIY your own ebook from the jump. You can always buy a program like Jutoh, which can make the job far, far easier, but, to use and deploy Jutoh, you really need to be able to use Styles and Headings (yup, back on those again!), because that\u2019s Jutoh\u2019s backbone, as well. If you can, that might be a real answer for you. I think I heard or read, someplace, that Julian, the developer of Jutoh, was considering adding a print layout module to it, in addition to the eBooks, so you might look into that. Only $45, I believe. (Not affiliated in any way). If it has print, that might be an answer to all your issues, but even if it doesn\u2019t, you could still do an affordable template for your print layout, use Word or a Word equivalent like OO/LO, and then something like Jutoh, to end up with a pair of saleable books and eBooks at a decent price. As I\u2019m sure you already know, unless you\u2019re a movie star with a tell-all autobiography, or selling a programming book, etc., $32 for 176 pages probably isn\u2019t going to fly. HTH. I realize it\u2019s not quite \u201cdo this, do that,\u201d but there are too many unknowns about your own skill set and knowledge and technical ability for that type of answer, in my opinion. All I can do is to say \u201cyou can try this or that,\u201d and hope that one of the answers works for you, or at least, points you in a viable direction. ",

            "answer_text": "Shawn has summed it up nicely for you. The only thing I would add is that if you actually want people to buy it you're going to have to light a fire and introduce yourself to the unwashed masses on FB, Goodreads and anywhere else you can. Priming the pump for reviews is the first bitch kitty you need to kill and you need to make sure it's well and truly dead before you go all KDP Select on the world. Offering your book up for review at the many book blogs who do this kind of thing has largely become a lost cause. My ten cents? Join Goodreads and make sure you represent yourself as a serious reader before you let slip that you're also a desperate and penny-less author looking for reviews. Then take a hammer to your piggy bank and order ten print copies of your book from CreateSpace and run a giveaway on Goodreads. Send the winners their copies and then friend request every other person who entered the giveaway with a message offering them an eBook copy as a consolation prize. These are the first serious readers you will come face to face with, not authors on a marketing mission like yourself, so be nice. Gently ask each for a review on Amazon or Goodreads (and ideally both). Because most of these people will also be Kindle owners (and have already expressed an interest in your book) this follow-up effort will most likely pay more dividends than the giveaway itself. Now sit back and wait for the reviews. Most will have a few other books on their \"to read\" list, so be patient. Once you've got 20+ positive organic reviews on Amazon rob a bank and request a listing on BookBub. Give them flexible dates and if they bite, join KDP Select and schedule the giveaway on the agreed date. Assuming your book is worth reading, this should get it into a few hundred (or thousand) hands and set you on your way. If BookBub turn you down, rinse, repeat and try again.  That's my advice. There's a lot more to it, of course, but you'll have to figure that out on your own.  Good luck, bro! ",

            "answer_text": "Since \u201cpublishing\u201d can include posting a PDF online or posting your story/book in blog installments, I\u2019ll assume you mean in a more \u201cofficial\u201d way. Amazon\u2019s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) doesn\u2019t cost anything. The process and interface are quite easy, they offer tools to help format your book, and then your book is on the largest seller in the world (accounting for approximately 75% of all book sales). Now, that said, while publishing is free, that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t invest in your work before the publishing process. By this, I primarily mean cover design, editing, and proofreading. Yes, it\u2019s possible to get these done as a favor from friends or family, but you\u2019ll likely get your \u201cmoney\u2019s worth.\u201d So, any time I answer a question like this, I always urge the author to save up the money needed to publish a professional-level result. How much is this? I can\u2019t say. Your writing could be in great shape, or it could be in terrible shape. But if you go to a professional platform of publishing service-providers \u2014 I highly recommend Reedsy \u2014 you can get free estimates for all you need in terms of design, editing, and proofreading. Think of it this way. Self-publishing (if you\u2019re not just doing it as a hobby or for fun) is a business. You are starting a business. So you have to expect to invest something. You wouldn\u2019t start a restaurant without any money saved up, right? Same here. But luckily, it doesn\u2019t cost anywhere near as much as many other businesses to start. Last, if you go my recommended route, I\u2019d just focus on your book being on Kindle to start: The Kindle format sells much better for fiction (typically, on average).Your investment doesn\u2019t need to be as high because a cover design and interior formatting don\u2019t require as much work as they do for a paperback book. Theoretically, you could even accomplish both using DIY tools online, but I don\u2019t recommend these unless you already have design and typography experience. The results of most authors doing their own design and typography is almost always below par and gets negative reviews from customers.Once you\u2019ve had some time with your Kindle format and get some sales, develop promotional experience, build a following, and (hopefully) enjoy the work of being an author\u2026 then you can invest some money into releasing a paperback version.Thanks for the A2A \u2014 I hope this helps!

You can also find a Kindle book cover designer on Fiverr. The freelancer I use is named Vikiana and you can get a really good book cover for as low as $10.00. I also recommend having the same designer also design you the same cover for audiobook format ($5.00) and paperback format ($25.00) for createspace should you choose to want to have multiple revenue streams.  You can record the audiobook yourself and you will need to buy a microphone and a pop filter. Both should cost around $50.00 - $60.00 on Amazon. The program I use for recording is called Audacity and is free. You can also convert your manuscript to paperback for createspace for free if you do it yourself. Look up India Drummond on YouTube for her free tutorial. At minimum, I highly recommend having both a Kindie and paperback edition of your book. You will also need to market your book once you have uploaded it to Amazon.  Marketing will run you $100.00 - $200.00 but it is a great investment and you should make your investment back in the long run. I am publishing my fourth book, Book Publishing for Beginners on Amazon this weekend and will be doing both a free and 99 cents launch later this month.

You start to pay when the book starts to sell (and the cost comes out of your book sales). If you want to self-publish, you will want to, at a minimum, publish your book in both e-book and print on demand formats. To do this at the lowest cost, you'll need to spend some time researching best practices, readability, interior book design in both formats and then create your book. Cover design. If you can afford a professional book designer to do your cover (NOT someone from Fiver or Elance), a compelling cover that attracts the eyeball at post-stamp size can make a big difference to eventual sales.  Editing. The cheap editors you'll find willing to edit your book for a $100 are typically simply running it through a software program. Errors like the one in your question \"What us the cheapest, but best way to publish a book?\" (there is a spelling and punctuation error in this short sentence) won't be caught. If you can't afford a professional editor, read through your book aloud, at a normal talking speed, and your ears will catch many of the errors. Next, start at the back of your book and read it backwards. Your eye will catch many errors this way, too. Allow about three minutes per page for each process (a page, for editorial terms, is considered 250 words). Good luck with your book. P.S. Have a good, hard look at the WriterBeware and Preditors&Editors sites before you engage ANY services, sign with ANY agent, or make an agreement with ANY publishers. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you consider \u201cwithout much money?\u201d I think it is important to not give up quality therefore you must shop around and compare prices for editors, cover design and formatting. The range varies but for example when I looked for a cover designer for my latest book (My Zany Life) I found several cover designers who would have done pretty much the same cover and their prices ranged from 150 to close to a thousand. When I checked their portfolios many of their covers were equal in quality thus I was able to go with the lower priced one. BUT for my editor; I sent out the same story to five different editors and asked for a sample edit. When the story came back a few of us compared them and everyone agreed sample #3 was the best. However the editor of this one was also the most expensive but I felt spending the extra was worth it. I have seen self published books that do not have an editor but I believe that as an author if we put out books they should be of high quality - not everyone will like each authors writing style but I don\u2019t think published books should be full of grammatical errors. In the end I don\u2019t think you can produce an 80,000 word book for under a couple of thousand. Sometimes you can find someone starting out that is good but still reasonable on a site called upwork as you can also check their credentials there. All the best with your book! ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: Work for a self-publishing platform called CompletelyNovel It really helps to get a professional designer for your cover, professional editing, and even professional typesetting (although typesetting is relatively easy to teach yourself. If you can't afford that, which you suggest you might not be able to, then read up as much as you can. Teach yourself photoshop and then look at the covers of books similar to yours in photoshop. You really don't want an amateurish cover so take your time.  On the subject of publishing itself, CreateSpace and Lulu are both free services and both have book creators that help you put your book together. They do take a commission on each book sold, Lulu's commission is lower but their book production costs are much higher.  CompletelyNovel, which is the company I work for and so I am speaking on behalf of them now, also have a free service but this only enables you to sell your book on our website. To sell through all the online retailers which Lulu and CreateSpace do for free, we charge \u00a37.99 a month. The difference is we don't take any commission on book sales so I leave it up to you to decide which is the better deal.  I would recommend looking around the all the self-publishing platforms and see which one works for you. Another one is Ingram Spark, which is Lightning Source's entry into the market. ",

Especially doing it digitally is basically free nowadays, though keep in mind that most readers are not too eager to pick up self published books - even cheap or free ones. The other option, of course, is to convince someone - a publisher, for instance - that your book is good enough that they should invest in publishing and marketing it. The convincing part is hard though - and is also the reason readers prefer books from the larger publishing houses in general - it provides a guarantee that someone other than the author thought the book was good enough to put money into it. But if you can manage to do it, there's basically no investment needed on your part.   Try approaching editors yourself - at conventions, for example, or get an agent who can handle the networking for you. ",

But its the case if your book is shortlisted by the publishing company. You can select the agent submit the manuscript to them and then wait for the slow and tedious procedures. Out of 10 times 9 times your book might get rejected and the rejections sometimes can even lead to the dream of publishing the book . To avoid time wasting , rejections from the publishers you can try some of the self book publishing platforms which are really good and they will help you in publishing your book the way you want. You can feel that jewell of flexibility and dedication they show towards your book . They even help you to market and sell your book so that you can climb that ladder of writer to an author. Traditional book publishing can be made as a second option for the upcoming book for which you have a background of already published book , sales at your back and many more plus to your profile . ",

            "answer_text": "Publishing your novel through Kindle Direct Publishing costs nothing; however, getting your manuscript ready for publication is another issue. Many fledgling writers believe they can write a manuscript, self edit, throw their own cover on it, and become an overnight success on Amazon. Although it may appear, from the outside, this is how self-publishing works, it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. A professional editor is worth far more than she costs and is absolutely essential for a book to become a commercial success. Poorly edited novels are challenging to read and leave the reader fatigued and uncomfortable. In my opinion, poor editing will cause a reader to put down a book faster than anything else. Hiring a highly-skilled editor should be the first consideration when a writer believes he/she has created a marketable manuscript. The investment is well worth the benefit. Additionally, a professional cover designer and formatter add value and marketability to that should not be ignored. Make the financial investment in a manuscript you believe in, and the readers will reward you for doing so. I wish you the greatest success, but expecting financial success without an investment in yourself is wishful thinking at best. Keep writing! ",

I\u2019ve provided links below which give a more detailed insight: Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing Getting Started | Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing Though the links are for USA, India has a dedicated KDP option as well. A key, again imho, would be to understand the pricing structure and rules. Under certain TnC, an author can get upto 70% royalty, which is more than what a traditional publishing company would offer. A more profitable, but a harder option would be to utilise online printing services, which charge you only for the printing and shipping. I\u2019m aware that such services exist, but do not have accurate inputs for the same. I would advice interested and motivated authors to check more details online. Amazon KDP in my humble opinion is the most basic professional service available to an author for the purpose of self-publishing. In addition to the KDP, an author may use FB and Twitter (other social media platforms too) to promote and market their works. Most cost effective option for self-publishing, yet again imho. ",

Use a website such as Hemmingway Editor to check for typo\u2019s; active versus passive voice, grammar, etc. Send sample chapters to beta readers. Ideally, one chapter should be sent to atleast two people. Get the feedback, change things as necessary. b. Cover Design: Canva is indeed a great resource, but don\u2019t compromise on the cover design. Consider it as your profile pic on (name your social site here). Keep around $ 100 as a ballpark figure for cover design. c. Most sites have templates for standard ebooks, or Createspace has templates for print books. USe them, then you can either use Draft 2 Digital or Smashwords (in case of Indian languages use Matrubharti or Dailyhunt) to get your manuscript converted into ebooks. ",

You\u2019ll need to maintain a web site or a blog to attract attention. If you are hoping to make money, the average self-published book earns something like $200.
