            "answer_text": "It\u2019s always a good sign when someone contacts you first. Publishing houses in the US are notorious for not giving a shit about writers when it comes to foreign rights. You need to find out what publisher that man represents. You need to check with your publisher in the US. Most contracts state First North American Rights go to the US publisher. Don't just accept the man at his word. Get more information. And inform him that he cannot just translate the book and have it published. The rights belong to you, so you or your agent can negotiate a contract with him. Do a Google search on your book for the hell of it. I was surprised at the amount of anthologies I\u2019ve been in are translated into German or French without my ever being aware. German and Spanish editors contacted me. The original US publishers claim to not make much from giving over the anthology rights, which is likely true in some cases, but all I\u2019d want was a copy of the foreign edition. Lesson to be learned is Good Publisher vs. Not So Good Publisher. If you think it is a shady deal, tell the publisher to provide him a contract that states that he has to go through them, not you. If you have an agent, which you should, get them involved first. ",

            "answer_text": "He certainly needs your publisher\u2019s permission; whether he needs the author\u2019s permission depends on the exact nature of the contract you signed with your publisher. So, you should immediately contact your publisher regarding this Chinese man\u2014and your publisher should guide you. Keep in mind that until the very point this Chinese man is about to publish your book, he is under no obligation to tell you or your publisher about his translation itself (which would remain private to him). Also, given that he has contacted you, he appears to be doing the right thing already\u2014and he probably respects your research and the book. ",
