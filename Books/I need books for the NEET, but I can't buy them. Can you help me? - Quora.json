            "answer_text": "Hey!! I would be glad if I can help you in any way.Recently I wanted to buy few NCERT books for my siblings and at that moment of time i did not have the required sum of money .I asked about getting books at a cheaper price by one friend whom I follow on a social media platform .In answer to my question I got to know about a website named mypustak that provides second-hand books. Various books on competitive exams and other genres are available at free of cost. You just have to visit the website buy whichever book you want and get them at your doorstep. All you need to pay is a small delivery and handling charge for the books. You can buy medical books at mypustak. It will be cheap and hence would be easy for you to buy them. Also, you contribute to saving the environment by buying second-hand books.  So visit the website as soon as possible and buy the books for NEET. ALL THE BEST!! ",
