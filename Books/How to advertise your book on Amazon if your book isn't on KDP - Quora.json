So when I go to KDP and want to claim the book, they require an email address and I don\u2019t have it. (Since I wasn\u2019t the one to put it on there). So I can\u2019t use the promote button on KDP.) I was wondering if there was an alternative way to use Amazon advertising. I googled, but everything seems to point to the KDP\u2019s \u201cpromote\u201d button. Thanks in advance! :) ",
