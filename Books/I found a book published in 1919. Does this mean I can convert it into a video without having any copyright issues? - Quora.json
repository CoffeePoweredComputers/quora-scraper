            "answer_text": "I found a book published in 1919. Does this mean I can convert it into a video without having any copyright issues? Not necessarily. In the case of a book, copyright expires 70 years after the author\u2019s death, not after the date of publication. Suppose the author was 29 years old in 1919 (born in 1890) and lived to the age of 90, they would have died in 1980 and the book would easily be within copyright. You have to be very careful about this if you want to stay within the law. ",

            "answer_text": "Different countries expire the copyrights after different time periods from the author\u2019s death. In some countries, if the author became particularly famous or the book the author wrote becomes a great classic, they may declare the work in question a \u201cNational Treasure\u201d and continue the copyright in perpetuity. In likelihood, the copyright may have expired. But with the above in mind, you should do a search on the author and the book\u2019s title to determine where the copyrights may have been filed and if the copyright is still active. ",
