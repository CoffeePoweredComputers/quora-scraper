            "answer_text": "Naturally it depends on the size of the picture or photograph. There is no single correct answer.  Let\u2019s take my main camera, the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II. This can shoot photos that run from about 0.2MB (1 megapixel, high compression) to 13 megapixels (full resolution JPEG), 21 megapixels (full resolution raw, high resolution JPEG), to 160MB (high resolution raw). So that\u2019s somewhere between 12,500 and ~10 million, with the most likely number being between somewhere between 90,000 and 150,000 images. This is a 20 megapixel camera; you\u2019ll get a different number if you change the resolution, shoot in JPEG, vary the level of JPEG compression, etc.  Maybe you\u2019re using a phone as a camera. Let\u2019s take the iPhone 11 Pro, which by default shoots JPEG at around 2MB, HEIC at 1.2MB. So that\u2019s between 1 million and 1.6 million.  Or you could store about 10,300 copies of the famous M87 supermassive black hole photo. However, you\u2019d need 2.25 million of those 2TB drives to store the precisely synchronized data from 8 radiotelescopes that was processed in order to deliver this image as something a human brain might comprehend.

            "answer_text": "Q: How many pictures can 2 terabytes hold? Lets consider two pictures  and  These two images were taken on digital cameras. The first has a file size of around 5 MB, while the second has a files size of just under 50 kB. A 2 TB drive can store around 0.4 million of the first file size, or 40 million of the second one. Some cameras will take much more detailed images with perhaps upto 20 MB image files or even larger. ",
