            "answer_text": "Sometimes the same old advice is the one you should avoid. I think this is one of those times... (No offense folks!) Dividing into chunks can make reading feel like you're walking through Dante's Inferno. Don't count and track the pages. Instead, read as many pages as you can before becoming totally disinterested on day 1. The next day, read the same amount as the day before +2 pages. Repeat until you've finished the book. If you have a deadline you are worried about meeting, change your daily increase amount. Why does this work?Because you are training your attention span, and you'll be surprised by how much you can get through each day. If you fall short one day you won't have to worry about catching up. Just try to beat yourself the next day by at least 2 pages. I wrote some tips here that I find essential for reading and would swear by: Val Mack's answer to What are the correct ways of reading a book? Reading strategies or techniques.TLDR: Read and take notes like you are going to write a review on it later. If you are reading a novel and writing is too much work, pretend you're just giving TMZ or Rotten Tomatoes like commentary (or \"Watch What Happens Live\" on Bravo). Criticize every underwhelming plot twist, every dry attempt at humor, and every disgustingly obvious use of foreshadowing. This makes reading MUCH easier in my experience. ",
