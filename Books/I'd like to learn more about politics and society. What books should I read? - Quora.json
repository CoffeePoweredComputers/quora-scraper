            "answer_text": "Hi, Good for you. I agree that you need to study a lot to become a good president. Other people can advise you about books you can study to become a good president of Brazil. I know very little about Brazil, so I can\u2019t help you there. But maybe I can recommend a couple of books that can help you think about politics and society. If you want to become president of Brazil, what kind of society do you want? Do you want a society which works as best as it can for everyone but which is maybe somewhat inefficient, or do you want a society that is really good at making money but which leaves some people behind? Do you want a society that prizes fairness and justice as its highest values, or do you want a society which prizes economic growth and order? Recent history suggests that these are the sort of choices you\u2019ll have to make. People have suggested that you read Machiavelli, Marx, etc. I have read these writers, but I don\u2019t know if they will be very useful to you aged 14. You can\u2019t really understand what they were trying to do without understanding the historical context they came form, and that means a lot of extra study. Go ahead if you want to, but bear in mind that no actual politician today treats these works as gospel. One book I would recommend is a work of political philosophy, Conservatism by the Canadian philosopher Ted Honderich. It analyses modern forms of conservatism (not the kind currently practised by the US Republican party, which is far more extreme, but the kind practised in other countries) and comes to some interesting conclusions. Even if you don\u2019t agree with it, it will show you ways of thinking about the problem. Above all, watch out for arguments that only confirm what you already think. Question yourself, and test your own conclusions against reality, and get out there and learn about what kind of country the people you live amongst want to live in. The most effective and admirable politicans have always been the ones who understood people, and what people wanted, and who were able to lead those people towards a solution that worked for everyone. The least effective politicians have been the ones who tried to impose a theory on a people who didn\u2019t want it. ",

            "answer_text": "Congrats again, you\u2019re mature for your age indeed :) I believe that you will need two main types of books to read: 1- Books with direct knowledge, direct value in the fields you have stated. For instance, a book like The Peace Business for instance would help you understand a lot about how states are run, when/what ethics could be compromised? And how Business may influence every other relationship in the world. A book like Economy and Society will let you understand the basis for both fields and how they\u2019re integrated in modern societies. A book like \u201cThe Prince\u201d is a must read if you already determined to become a president. Plenty of great books are available online and may let you gain the \u201cDirect Knowledge\u201d needed just like these three. Before starting to read, use google to search for a few relevant blogs, start reading a few articles, find out the topics that are most interesting for you\u2026 and finally start searching for books about these specific topics. 2- Contemporary Literature, this type of books would allow you to view political, social, economic, demo-graphical, cultural aspects of different societies trough the eyes of their authors. I would recommend that you start with these before the Direct-Knowledge type, as they would provide eye-opening value, and may help you relate to, communicate with, and understand people regardless of how mainstream or unorthodox they might be. Plus, novels are usually a good start for someone willing to be a book-worm. In respect to these books, I suggest that you read both \u201cClassics\u201d and \u201cModern\u201d ones, to even increase the potential value. If you have\u2019t already read \u201cA Tale of Two Cities\u201d, you have to check it out\u2026 For Modern Contemporary Literature, I recommend \u201cThe Bachelors of Egypt\u201d\u2026 If you\u2019ve already read both books, start searching for other novels, and make sure to review samples first :) I wish economic prosperity, and an improved human rights\u2019 status for the Brazilian State under your leadership, Mr. President :) ",
