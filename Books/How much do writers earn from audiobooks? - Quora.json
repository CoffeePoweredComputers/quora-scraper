            "answer_text": "Yes, authors do make money from audiobooks. How much will vary. It\u2019s generally a percentage of sales, and places that don\u2019t sell individual titles but instead charge a monthly fee or whatever still have to calculate \u201csales\u201d for every audiobook downloaded, even if the listeners aren\u2019t paying for them individually. That percentage will vary depending on the exact contract arrangements. Did the publisher license the audiobook, or did the author do it directly? Who paid the narrator? (Sometimes the narrator is paid a flat fee up front; other times the narrator works for a share of the royalties; sometimes it\u2019s a combination.) I\u2019ve honestly lost track of how some of my own contracts are structured, but I do know a couple offhand. In one case, as an example, I hired the narrator myself, there was no up front money involved, and we split the proceeds from ACX/Audible/Amazon evenly. It usually works out to roughly $2 to each of us for every download. (It\u2019s a long book, almost twenty hours.) If there\u2019s a publisher in there, my cut is smaller, but it\u2019s never zero. I mean, why would I allow an audiobook if I wasn\u2019t getting paid for it? ",
