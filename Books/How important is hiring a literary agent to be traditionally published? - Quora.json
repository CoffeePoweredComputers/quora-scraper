            "answer_text": "The answers here are correct, as far as they go. You don\u2019t hire an agent. And, yes, the mainstream (traditional) publishing houses only accept manuscripts from agents, for the most part. The old days of the (unread) slush pile of paper manuscripts are long gone. The digital age has come, even in the retro publishing industry. They now use\u2014gasp, choke\u2014email. What you must do first is to examine the agent database and ensure that the agent you would like to represent you is interested in your over-all work category\u2014fiction, nonfiction, YA, thriller, etc. The principal agents show their particular team and looking at each team member will show you what they are looking for. Now comes the hard, almost impossible part: attempting to interest an agent. This requires writing a succinct email that explains your book and why they should look at it. Note, this is not the book proposal itself, which is a longer document that includes a synopsis, your resume of your writing esperience, a listing of similar or competing books, how you will support the marketing effort, how well you are known in social media, introductory pages . . . in general, why you have a great book and are qualified to write it. A letter or email is one short page, at most. Each agency has different \u2018submission\u2019 criteria you must follow. You are a \u2018walk on,\u2019 a supplicant. Agents already have a \u2018book\u2019 of authors they are already representing. They get hundreds of \u2018submissions\u2019 (writers, groveling) from authors seeking representation. They respond to very few, because what they are looking for, as they scroll through those supplicants, is the Second Literary Coming\u2014the new author who will leap out, grab them by the literary and intellectual throat, and transport them into literary heaven. Busy agents cull their individual author population routinely and excise the ones whose books are not selling. The agent\u2019s question: can I sell this book and will it succeed, so that it will deliver me commissions? Just as the publisher question is whether the book can be sold, in what potential volume, to justify their investment. It\u2019s a business. Here is a summary of what happens: If you get a great, original idea for a book\u2014fiction or nonfiction; And if you have the skill, energy and dedication to write it; And if, preferably, you\u2019re young, female and of \u2018desirable\u2019 ethnicity; And if you manage to hit a cultural or sociopolitical fad window successfully; And if you have the ability and will to edit your own work meticulously; And if you know a friendly editor to straighten you out before submission; And if you can find the right professional agent to represent your offering; And if that agent reads your work, likes it and agrees to represent you; And if she or he knows by first name a publisher\u2019s editor who might want it; And if that editor likes it enough to put in on his or her work list; And if it survives the competition vs. the house\u2019s other projects; And if the book acquires production values and a publicity budget to promote the work (i.e. publisher investment based on estimated potential revenues); And if the critics, reviewing perhaps one in a hundred books, review it favorably; And if the media, handling few per hundred offerings, use the review; And if the distribution system, selling >95% by volume and taking <5% by title of all books offered (mostly from \u2018names\u2019) and doing weekly fast/slow sell analysis, accepts the book; And if enough public word-of-mouth recommendation generates worthwhile sales numbers and long-term attention for the work; Then you might perhaps have published a successful book. Maybe. Good luck with your quest. ",

            "answer_text": "In genre publishing (science fiction, fantasy, romance, western, crime, detective, men\u2019s thriller) it is still possible to get your book traditionally published without an agent, because many publishers still look at unsolicited manuscripts. In mainstream, you need an agent. But remember, you do not pay the agent up front. Anyone that asks you to do that is a crook. An agent takes his pay out of what he gets for your book, usually 15%.
