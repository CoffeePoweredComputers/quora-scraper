            "answer_text": "I am a recovered cocaine addict, 12 years in July, and used for 26 years. I was addicted both psychologically and physically. It took me six years to break the habit; I am one of the lucky few. Hardest thing I ever did in my life. Too answer your question, pure cocaine can be smoked (freebase) but snorting pure cocaine will more likely kill you. A dealer I knew, way back when, told me this because I wanted to try some before he cut it (dilute with another white powder) and even he would not touch it without cutting it. Stay away from cocaine and heroin - it will more than likely kill you. ",
