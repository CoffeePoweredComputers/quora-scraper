No it is not, but it does need to be in Kindle or Mobi format. I borrow books from the library which are free and I request them for Kindle, which directs me to Amazon to get the book, free. You only need to get your books in Kindle format if you want to read them on Kindle. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really, but I believe it is restricted to reading books ON a Kindle device or app. When I want to proofread something on my Kindle, I can send it to my Kindle device\u2019s special address and have it returned to me in a format readable on the device. You can also download a book from the Kindle platform and read it on your iPad or phone or computer, but first you need to have downloaded the free Kindle app to use on those devices. There is a world of books out there. Go looking for them. ",
