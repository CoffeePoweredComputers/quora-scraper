            "answer_text": "Goodreads doesn\u2019t provide you with books, it\u2019s just a place where you can track what books you want to read, what books you\u2019ve read, write reviews for the ones you\u2019ve read, and get recommendations for other books you would probably like to read. If you\u2019re looking for places where you can read books for free, I recommend: borrowing from your local library,overdrive, for your local library\u2019s ebook collection,OpenLibrary.org (read scanned books online),and if you enjoy the classics, look for them in amazon\u2019s Kindle store: most classics are available for free as kindle books.Oh, I just remembered, Goodreads does host giveaways! These are usually books by new authors, and there is no guarantee that you\u2019ll win the draw, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to enter if you\u2019re interested. In any case, the reading will take place elsewhere (at home with a physical book, or one of those ebook options), and you just track your reading on Goodreads. I hope that helps! ",
