            "answer_text": "Well, firstly you have to ask what class of Chinese submarine and then define noisy. The Chinese nuclear boats are relatively noisy, similar to the Soviet subs from a few decades ago. Their SSBN\u2019s when hovering would be difficult to detect if you weren\u2019t looking for them, but they still emit noise, their engineering spaces aren\u2019t as well insulated as a similar U.S or U.K. boat. Their SSN\u2019s are again, relatively noisy, but not as bad as the old Soviet attack boats. Their SSK\u2019s vary in quality, but all of them when doing what they do best, barely maintaining steering way, are as close to silent as a big tube filled with seamen and machinery can get. Like all other SSK\u2019s they suffer from a lack of sustained sub surface speed and a noisy recharge cycle, but for littoral ops, defending a choke point or threatening shallow water trade routes then they\u2019re more than quiet enough to do their job with frightening efficiency.
