            "answer_text": "First of all, congratulations on your first book. And YES, like a big yes in bold, you should definitely publish it. It doesn't matter what your age is, sharing your work with the world is the best way to keep growing as a writer. Although how should you publish it, is the real question here. A-You can try and reach publishers. There is a lot of information available on the Internet. You can easily find and approach publishers via mail. Just two things- 1- Don't send your whole draft to anybody. (Although, the real publishers don't even ask for it. They would ask for the first five chapters or so.) 2- Don't pay anybody to publish your book. B- You can self-publish your book with the help of Kindle Direct Publishing. All the information and instructions you need to follow the process, has been given on the website. It\u2019s a quick and simple process. You just need to a make an account to publish. (You don't have to be a technical expert to do so. I mean if I can do it anyone can. I am an anti-technical). For graphics like a book cover and all, if you need any help, I have a guy who is pretty reasonable and quick. Of course, if you need further assistance. ",
