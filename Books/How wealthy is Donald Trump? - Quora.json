            "answer_text": "No one really knows. Forbes says $4 billion, while other publications such as Wealth X say around $4.5. And according to the New York Times' analysis of his financial disclosure, at a bare minimum, Trump is worth at least $1.4 billion.  Now considering the fact that Mr. Trump is a private company and Forbes and other publishers numbers are predicated on information available to the public at large, it's very possible that he is telling the truth in regards to his net worth being *over* $10 billion dollars. For as we all know, speculation can vary markedly from the truth.  As an example, according to his financial disclosure filed with the Federal Elections Commissions, Donald Trump's income in 2014 was $362 million dollars (which excludes interest, capital gains, rent, and royalties). Now when you look at what the man owns, it becomes clear that he certainly has the indulgence of a multi billionaire: purchasing Microsoft co- founder Paul Allen's Boeing  757 jet for $100 million dollars and throwing even more money in for customization; also owning, what at the time, was appraised to be the most expensive home in the U.S., just a few years ago in his former Palm Beach mansion.  Still not convinced? Just ask MSNBC host, Lawrence O'Donnell, who had the temerity to question the veracity of Celebrity Appretince's annuity and was eventually forced to capitulate by issuing an apology to Trump after he bet him a year's worth of his (O'Donnell's) salary that he was telling the truth.  Unfortunately, I think many are being mislead by the tendentious writings of partisans who have a strong dislike for Mr.Trump. These folks have an avid interest in lowballing his wealth whenever possible, and as a result, anything they dessiminate should be taken with a serious grain of salt (just ask the author who got sued for claiming Trump was only worth $150 million dollars).

            "answer_text": "My take on Trump\u2019s wealth draws on a few facts and some financial constructs. I will start with some financial general statements of fact: Trump\u2019s Return on Equity can be thought of as its Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) plus its financial leverage multiplied by Spread (where spread is ROIC - Cost of Debt). That is: ROE = ROIC + (ROIC - Rd) x Debt/Equity (all book values) Looking at Rd rates (considering he has gone bankrupt several times) from Bloomberg (which itself draws from Debt rating agencies like Moodys and S&P), Trump\u2019s business is probably a CCC debt quality company, and that is around Rd=7.5% If from his pre inheritance times (when we know he was bankrupted business wise), he managed to salvage around $50M (I\u2019m exaggerating with this assumption!!!) and if his father\u2019s business was split 4-way with his family (leaving him with an additional $40M) by the close of 1998 and combined with the fact that Trump is the closest thing to God on earth (which nets him a Return on Invested Capital of 10% and using a leverage of 2.19:1 D/E ratio - a little higher than the cross-sectional average, and using data from Damodaran\u2019s data sets -), then we have: ROE = 10% + (10%-7.5%) x 2.19 = 15.48% Endowment around $90M ($50M because he is God and managed to shield his LLC\u2019s from bankrupted proceedings and another $40M from his mortal dad) Endowment x (1+ROE)^18 (18 years of compounding God-only-possible returns, never loosing a dime anymore\u2026) equals then $90M x (1+15.48%)^18 = $1.2B With this $1.2B estimate of networth in hand, one would then proceed to tinker with how feasible is it that in spite of his pre-inheritance bankruptcies he somehow had about $50M in hand. I doubt it. Say he had perhaps $30M at best. Second adjustment: no way he has returned a consistent 10% year over year on invested capital. Say it was instead 8% (being super nice here) Lastly, lets imagine he has more than 2.19:1 D/E ratio. Say it is instead 3:1 (a realistic ratio for crazy private equity funds specialized in using debt financing) With these three adjustments, we now have (ROE is now 9.53% and not 15.48%): Endowment x (1+ROE )^18 = $70M x (1+9.53%)^18 = $361M In conclusion, Trump\u2019s wealth is probably (at best), somewhere between $350M to $1.2B (and from this discussion, assume is closer to the bottom of this range). Picking the mid point of $775M and assuming he is a Price-to-Book between 1.45x, his net worth is approximately $1.1B. (see PS for justification of P-to-B number) Capish! P.S. Why this P-to-B multiple?: I don\u2019t think his businesses are trading at IBM multiples (IBM is a mature company with spectacular cash flows -Trump\u2019s businesses aren\u2019t -, and IBM trades at P-to-B of 6x as of the end of 2019). Moreover, premier residential REITS like Avalon Bay and Equity Residential trade at average 2.9 P-to-B. On the other hand, Hilton (hotels) has a negative P-to-B value, eh?). So, my best guess for P-to-B is around 1.45x ( [0+2.9]/2 ) and I\u2019m being super nice ",
