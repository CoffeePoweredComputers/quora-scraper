            "answer_text": "Here\u2026  In this situation Superman spent two months without having any sunlight. Only Cosmic Radiation. Why? Because when he threw himself and Brainiac through a Black Hole he ends up at the edge of the know universe. And he basically travels 45 billion light years back to the Earth in two months. Meaning that for those two months he had to be travelling over 5 trillion times the speed of light. Not only that he spends five straight days in a machine designed to simulate the entire mass of the Earth, basically bench pressing all of that mass. No sunlight whatsoever!   And the best part\u2026 He wasn't even tired! If anything he asks Dr Shay Veritas to amp up the machine. So yeah. Kryptonians in comics are not like the kryptonians in the Supergirl TV show. Those are pathetic weaklings in comparison to those of the comic books. ",

Superman's powers would eventually lose his powers. How long that takes depends. 1). Is he just sitting there, like some sort of self imposed exile. 2). How long has he been there? 3). Has he used his powers since being in the cave? 4). Did he use them before going or being put in the cave? 5). How about power dampeners? 6). Any sort of kryptonite? ",
