            "answer_text": "If you're only just starting to read, the best way to begin would be with The Harry Potter series. (Go Gryffindor!) (Edit: This is if you're looking for fiction. I've always been into fiction and to be honest, I've not read much in non-fiction. So here goes) Although, I do get that some people are reluctant to start off with HP because they seem to think they're 'too childish\u2019. (I do not agree with this opinion and you wouldn't either, if you read the books). But if you're really stubborn about it, you can go about this way: Pick mystery/crime novels. Agatha Christie and Arthur Canon Doyle, the two most amazing crime authors ever. And Then There Were None, by Agatha Christie is a great book to start with!Pick something from the Young-Adult section if you're a teenager. This doesn't have to be Harry Potter. There's Hunger Games, Percy Jackson. Although I would recommend that you stick to the one shots, or short series' (like hunger games) until you turn into a book dragon. Some of my recommendations in this section would be Divergent series by Veronica Roth, Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, Timeless by Alexandra Monir, Fangirl and Carry On by Rainbow Rowell. I know the mmisconceptions about YA but the plots are usually very fun and the books are fast paced with the right bit of everything. (Edit2: I DON'T KNOW HOW I FORGOT THIS! Definitely check out Looking for Alaska and The fault in our stars by John Green)Dan Brown and Sydney Sheldon. This is kind of a cliche, but again, amazing plots and really fast paced novel writers, these two are. So you'll definitely enjoy them. Angels and Demons by Dan Brown's a good startHyperbole and A Half by Allie Brosh. This is a semi-graphic memoir that's absolutely funny and not very long. You'll really enjoy reading it if you're only just starting.The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. Now, this may pass off as a children's book but don't be fooled. This book carries too much wisdom, too much even for a fully functioning adult and is so heart-wrenchingly beautiful\u2026.I have no words, really.Once you've read a book or two, I'd recommend the following to keep the wagon going so you don't lose interest quickly. The Book Thief by Markus Zusack. I'd recommend that you read it after two-three books but I recommend you to definitely read it because, trust me, it will make you fall in love with reading and change your life forever.Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Now, it's a classic and does not seem as fast paced the first time you read it but if you're patient enough, it would be a great way to start your reading life with. Again, read this book first if you're okay with a bit of slow movement in the story. Also, the writing style is classic and elegant but it will definitely add to the feel and not to mention, it will improve your vocabulary tremendously.Neil Gaiman is a genius at writing and his books will take you to faraway lands and dip you in beautiful adventures. I'd recommend Neverwhere, a nice adventure novel and Good Omens, which is another masterpiece. You'll have a lot of fun.The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S.Lewis. There's seven of these bad boys, not three like the movies. And they're all very beautifully written. The plot is also pretty exciting. The only thing is that it's a fairly long series when you take the pace into account, unlike Harry Potter. So i suggest you go for it after you've read two-three books.Okay, that's pretty much all I can think of right now. But once you've read all this, you'll start exploring and I'm sure you'll find things you'll love a lot. Reading is one of the best experiences in the world. The world of stories is huge and so comforting that once you're in, you'll start looking at everything so differently. I really hope this helps and I hope you find books you love. Happy Reading! ",

            "answer_text": "There is no fix path that one must follow, there are no fixed set of books that you must read. What do you like to do? What are your interests? Is there something you want to know more about? Are you crazy about any particular TV series or movie which was based on a book? Start with things like that. Don\u2019t just start with well known classics that other habitual readers would recommend. Start with a book which is based on your interests. It can be a particular time period in history, a country, food, sport, your role model, things you want to do, things you have done, anything that piques your interest. There are hundreds of good books written on almost any topic conceivable by human mind. Google about the topic you are interested in, read two or three reviews of the top suggestions (Goodreads is generally a good place to read up about a book) and start it. If you are not able to think about anything or not finding anything good to read. Read short stories. They will introduce you to an author\u2019s writing style and you can read more of his work if you liked it. Deepak Mehta (\u0926\u0940\u092a\u0915 \u092e\u0947\u0939\u0924\u093e) has catalogued a good collection. Deepak Mehta (\u0926\u0940\u092a\u0915 \u092e\u0947\u0939\u0924\u093e)'s post in Reader's Paradise After you have read say 10 or so books like that, turn back to the classics, they are considered classics for a reason. They have survived turning of time, have fascinated generations of readers and the things they say are still valid in today\u2019s world in one way or the other. If nothing else they will give you a new way to look about things in general. These are some of them which I have liked To Kill a Mockingbird: about human morality and racismThe Great Gatsby: about pangs of love, The Jazz Age and the great American Dream.The Hobbit & The Lord of the Rings (The Lord of the Rings, #1-3): The series which is still considered as the benchmark against which all High Fantasy is measured today.Great Expectations: About an orphan boy's dream to become a \u201cgentleman\u201d set in Victorian England.In conclusion, just start! There are too many books to read and too little time! ",
