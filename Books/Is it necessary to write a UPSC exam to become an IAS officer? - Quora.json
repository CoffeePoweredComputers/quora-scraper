            "answer_text": "There are 2 ways of becoming IAS Officer without even attempting UPSC Civil Service examination. There are as follows : State Civil Service : All states in India have their State PCS exam. Whichever state you belong to, try to score single digit rank in PCS and you can easily secure Deputy Collector post. In a span of 15\u201320 years, depending upon the State and your performance (plus some luck), you would be promoted to IAS Cadre. Do you know that 33% of All India IAS posts are reserved for State PCS Officers.Sports Quota : As we all know there is a Sports Quota in Government Jobs. Do you know this man ? Joginder Sharma. Indian Cricketer who helped India win 2007 T20 Word Cup. He is now DSP in Haryana Police. Try to win international medal like in Asian Games, Commonwealth Games etc. [ Olympics is out of India's syllabus]. You surely going to get a Grade A post in Indian Civil Service. P.S : Something I wanted to share with you Quorans, what is happening nowadays, that my answers have stopped getting views. Even though I have 1600+ followers and 2.3 M views by writing just 178 answers which I earned in a span of 3 years of rigorous writing but my last 5 answers have failed to cross even 200 views mark. And there is huge number of views and upvotes on Answers like ' What are some interesting Twitter tweets ?\u2019 Or \u2018What are some best Screenshots in your phone ? \u2018 And I won't stoop so low to post screenshots to garner views or upvotes. I never joined Quora for that. But these things are really demotivating. Quora has really changed. And I really don't feel like writing nowadays if my answers are not reaching to viewers and genuine people. What is purpose of writing detailed answers if you won't get enough support or audience. I do not have a single friend/mentor on this platform whom I can ask and share about all this and none of the college friends use Quora on daily basis. Therefore, writing my heart out here. And it's not a rant, it is something bothering me from last few months. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "YES. It is possible. FIRST WAY One has to crack some state commission,join as an administrative services and you stand a chance to get elevated to IAS cadre by means of promotion. It has a drawback that you may not be able to make it to senior most rank in administration i.e Secretary. By the time you reach there through time bound promotion your retirement age will come knocking at your door. SECOND WAY Recently introduced \u201clateral entry\u201d. In lateral entry experts from private organisation are offered posts in various administrative departments. Though while process Is looked upon by UPSC i.e there work experience, achievement, performance capability etc etc bhut they don't have to write exams which aspirants write i.e P.T and MAINS. Few days ago 9 candidates have been shortlisted for the post of Joint Secretary via lateral entry in various ministries on contract.These people will enjoy the perks and pays of Joint Secretary equal to those Joint Secretaries who came in administration by qualifying UPSC exams. I don't remember them all but few of them are :- Sujit Kumar Bajpayee (brother of Manoj Bajpayee) in the Ministry of Environment Forest and climate change. Arun Goel -Commerce Amber Dubey - Civil Aviation ( He is IIT Bombay graduate and has master degree from IIM Ahemdabad and holds 26 yrs of experience. Saurabh Mishra- Financial services. Govt\u2019s think tank NITI AYOG experimented this concept. Well this has attracted lots of controversies like saffronisation of bureaucracy by BJP , privatisation of bureaucracy,nepotism but NITI AYOG said it will bring fresh and innovative ideas.
