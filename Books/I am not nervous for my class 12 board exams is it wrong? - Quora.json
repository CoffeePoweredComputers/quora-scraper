            "answer_text": "I don't think there is anything wrong in it.We go through stress during exams mainly under two situations- -When we are completely under prepared  -When we are completely prepared before time In the former situation,we are stressed because of the fact that there is  a lot left to do and the time is limited. In the latter because we  get this feeling that we might have left something or we may forget everything by the time we give our exams or we might have not  prepared well,that's why we are done so early. You are probably in a state where you are somewhere in between,you know that you'll be done with the preparation in time for the exam. Moreover,exams are just a test of what we have learnt so far but under the Indian education system our brains have been fashioned in a way that we regard exams as a burden,there is negative connotation related to them,which is quite scary.From the very beginning we are told to take the board exams very seriously as they play a huge role in giving a right direction to our lives, and that marks matter a lot,this encourages competition but not towards knowledge but towards marks and i think that should be changed.A single board exam cannot define a person's capabilities. One should have faith in oneself,the rest follows.Don't get scared,not getting anxious is a positive sign,keep your calm and do well. ALL THE BEST! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are well prepared for the exams then there is no reason to be nervous. It is a good thing that you aren't nervous (as long as you are prepared). To be honest, don't be nervous even if you are unprepared- it does nothing. Just stay calm and prepare. People feel nervous if they aren't prepared and they know it. Sometimes people are prepared and still feel nervous- that's not right and becomes a problem. Then there are some people who aren't prepared and still don't feel nervous. This can be because they don't care about the exam or whatever, or want to be unsuccessful at the task on purpose. Or that is just the kind of person they are.  Or they have some mental disorder that renders them uninterested in many things. Did my answer make you nervous? ",
