The things like mind map are good , overall the book has a variety of things but needs a little to be enhanced to emerge as a perfect ALL IN ONE ",

            "answer_text": "'All in one' is considered as a reference guide. It is a nice guide because I also read it once but the thing is that it digs deep into a topic and covers a vast of info which is not required at the level of class 12 chemistry. Sorry, I don't have any intention to criticise the quality of the book. As a former student of class 12 who scored 87 in chemistry feel that it is better to follow NCERT because 90% CBSE question are only from ncert, rest 10% is based on your ability and thinking skills.This answer is based on my point of viewIf you feel to read that book then there is nothing wrong in it. HOPE THIS ANSWER HELPS You. ",
