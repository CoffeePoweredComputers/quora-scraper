            "answer_text": "Start by redefining the question because this is a really vague one. I suppose you mean learning as learning in school. The way I study is to learn chapter by chapter and work in layers. Start with chapter one and learn the table of contents if that\u2019s useful. Then, I would learn the big lines and work my way to the details. However, don\u2019t get lost in them.When you finish learning a chapter, reflect on what you just learned and try to say it to yourself (and I mean out loud).I would also recommend answering a few questions on that chapter if there are any available. Last but not least; repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat\u2026.!!!!! ",
