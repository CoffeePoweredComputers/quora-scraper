            "answer_text": "It is more than enough. His textbook series is what you would call a 'blessing'. For years, the market was riddled with problem books that masqueraded as textbooks. Though once you actually started to invest your time and efforts into one, you realised what the problem was. The theory was mediocre at best ( B.M. Sharma was an exception to this ) & the number of problems was ridiculously large ( B.M. Sharma was not an exception to this ). Then I came across this series that offered cohesively written theory along with a limited stock of well-selected problems. It was the perfect book series for self-study students. On a side note, for students who have good theory resources at their disposal ( like reputable coaching classes ), I would say follow D.C. Pandey for problems. For students who follow online lectures, they can use his books ( irrespective of the degree to which they think understand the concepts ) as reading the theory yourself is an essential aspect of learning science. Watching video lectures is, mostly, a passive process while reading is an active one which contributes to one's understanding of the material. The two problem books are written for those people whose primary target is JEE Advanced or the Physics olympiad and wish to indulge themselves in a more abstract problem solving process than what is usually required ( in JEE atleast ), just for the sake of it.
