            "answer_text": "The $60 million opening-weekend domestic box office return forJason Bourne suggests that the fifth film in the franchise gave people what they wanted. It also might suggest that Suicide Squadisn\u2019t out yet. Beyond the box office, though, Jason Bourne says a lot about how its two main filmmakers\u200a\u2014\u200aproducer/director/cowriter Paul Greengrass and star/producer Matt Damon\u200a\u2014\u200afeel about Jason Bourne. The promo-tour origin myth for Jason Bourne is that Damon, while shootingElysium in Vancouver in 2011, saw the neighboring production offices of The Bourne Legacy, the Damon-less attempt at rebooting the franchise and expanding the Bourne universe beyond its namesake. This stirred something in Damon, who recently told The New York Times, \u201cI thought I was completely at peace with the three movies [2002\u2019s The Bourne Identity, 2004\u2019s The Bourne Supremacy, and 2007\u2019s The Bourne Ultimatum] and I was so happy with how good they were and what the whole franchise had done for my career and my life. \u2026 But when I saw their production offices, it hurt me in a way that surprised me.\u201d A tug of the heartstrings. And maybe a tug of the purse strings. Damon toldGQ in 2011 that Bourne was his safety blanket\u200a\u2014\u200athe franchise that allowed him to experiment and ride out box office failures, because at the end of the day he could always go back. In 2011, Damon was still some years away from delighting millions by seasoning his potatoes with Vicodin on Mars. Nobody was seeing his good movies (Behind the Candelabra, Margaret), and nobody liked his big movies (The Adjustment Bureau, We Bought a Zoo). He was making Elysium. HE KNEW. It should come as no surprise that he got the itch. Matt Damon and the Middle-Aged Action Hero\nHow (and how not) to age gracefully as a movie startheringer.com In that same 2011 GQ feature, Damon infamously went \u201cHit \u2019Em Up\u201d on regular Bourne screenwriter Tony Gilroy. He knocked Gilroy for agitating for a shared screenwriting credit on the first film, and he accused Gilroy of turning in an \u201cunreadable\u201d script for the third installment, claiming it was \u201ca career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s really embarrassing.\u201d Damon\u2019s return to the series was conditional. To resume his role in front of the camera, Paul Greengrass, director of Ultimatum and Supremacy, would have to return to his spot behind it. The cowriter and director of that Bournefilm shooting next door in Vancouver was Tony Gilroy. The story at the time was that Universal and Greengrass couldn\u2019t unlock a fourth Bourne movie, Greengrass walked, and Gilroy swooped in with an idea that worked for the studio and the estate of Robert Ludlum, the author of the novels on which the series is based. So there you have the Bourne church schism. Assigning credit for the success or failure of a movie is tricky because it\u2019s so hard to know what really goes on in writers\u2019 bungalows, editing suites, actors\u2019 trailers, and studio boardrooms. It\u2019s sort of a miracle when things actually work. And that\u2019s exactly how I would describe the first two films of this series. Miracles. The Bourne Identity is basically Before Sunrise with hand-to-hand combat. In a wonderful New Yorker profile, Gilroy explained his vision for the first film as \u201caction with intimacy,\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what you see on screen: car chases through Paris mixed with real human moments in small hotel rooms. The sequel, The Bourne Supremacy, is the best film of the series. The filmmakers knew the character and the world (even if the character still didn\u2019t totally know himself), and Greengrass brought a distinctive, fresh look\u200a\u2014\u200ahandheld, cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9, placing characters in real-world locations, and giving action a real-world feel. It led to a highly stylized realism rarely seen in Hollywood blockbusters. In a 2002 interview after the release of Identity, Matt Damon said, \u201cBy and large the average movie is just derivative. And sure, derivative action movies are something that\u2019s successful\u200a\u2014\u200abecause if people are going to buy widgets then people are going to try and sell them widgets\u200a\u2014\u200abut I think that it\u2019s a lot more fun for audiences and for filmmakers to make something other than a widget.\u201d After The Bourne Supremacy, Jason Bourne became a widget. Ultimatum, unreadable script aside, picks up right after Supremacy ends and kicks the can down the road, re-creating scenes (Jason Bourne calls someone while looking at them through a telescope, reveals that he is watching them, boom, roasted), and abandoning human moments\u200a\u2014\u200aeven gestural ones\u200a\u2014\u200aamong its characters. There is no Karl Urban, no Franka Potente, no farmhouse, no running on the beach in Goa, no fixing a bullet wound with items found in a Moscow supermarket. If you wanted to know how many movies you can make about an assassin with amnesia on the trail of his past, the answer is two. You can make two movies. No one seemed to mind, though. The film grossed $227 million domestically, made more than $400 million globally, and gave Matt Damon the kind of fuck-you money that allowed him to make The Informant! without having to worry about the consequences. Jason Bourne Can Stop Running Now\nLooking at the franchise in the Snowden eratheringer.com The tagline for The Bourne Legacy was, \u201cJason Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d It was cowritten and directed by a man who once said, \u201cIn my fantasy, my life would be, I\u2019ll write for dough and I\u2019ll try to make Crimes and Misdemeanors every year-and-a-half or two years,\u201d and it absolutely feels like someone making a Crimes and Misdemeanors that cost a lot of money. The Bourne Legacy made a profit, but was seen as a commercial failure. People look at me like I have something on my face when I talk about this movie, but I think it\u2019s a minor masterpiece (the first two acts, at least) that is best understood as a series of vignettes about the world around the Bourne character. So: vaguely erotic scenes of nu-Bourne Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner, eating dinner in a snow-bound cabin with his maybe-assassin, played by Oscar Isaac; a harrowing workplace shooting; a flashback foray to the Iraq War; an unexpected immersion into pharmaceutical production in the Philippines; jargon-heavy, witty, and perfectly acted ensemble moments of various intelligence brass verbally jousting with one another (this is from the guy who directed Michael Clayton, after all). Even if these vignettes never quite coalesce, they still act as an exhibit of what Gilroy liked about this world: the office politics, the minor social interactions between coworkers, the subtle power plays that happen before and after control shifts from one character to another. Jason Bourne has none of that. It is two chase scenes with a movie stapled onto it. There is nothing in The Bourne Legacy that even approaches the kinetic brilliance of Jason Bourne\u2019s opening chase\u200a\u2014\u200aa nighttime motorcycle ride through an Athens in turmoil, with flaming couches flying off of roofs. But only days after seeing it, I can\u2019t remember a single conversation or non-set-piece moment from the entire film. Instead, we get a hammer-headed plot about Bourne\u2019s father, and a totally separate movie about the CIA strong-arming a Facebook stand-in company. When the film opens, Jason Bourne is bare-knuckle fighting in Greece. It looks like it sucks. This is the movie Greengrass and Damon wanted to make. Matt Damon recently told USA Today, \u201cIf the movie starts and it looks like I\u2019ve been living well, we don\u2019t have a movie. But if the first image looks like I\u2019ve suffered, it\u2019s a statement of intent to our audience\u200a\u2014\u200athat we\u2019re coming with everything we have.\u201d What a strange thing to think. Who watches a new Jason Bourne movie and thinks, \u201cMan, I hope he has been suffering\u201d? Sequels reveal taste. What interests some people about a movie may not interest others. The tricky part is when \u201cothers\u201d includes the filmmakers. In the 16 years between Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace, no one was spending their time thinking, \u201cGalactic tariffs? Senate procedure? I NEED TO KNOW.\u201d No one except George Lucas, that is. His taste was bland and inscrutable, but at least it was his. We got the movie he wanted to see. In the age of extreme fan service [puts a gloved hand on Darth Vader\u2019s melted helmet], that kind of stubborn adherence to one\u2019s own vision is respectable. There is a brief moment in Jason Bourne, early on, when Damon has an interaction with Julia Stiles\u2019s long-suffering Nicky Parsons character. Parsons has gone from being a CIA logistics expert to a leak, working with a Julian Assange\u2013type crusader named Christian Dassault. There is some vague allusion to Bourne helping Parsons in the past with these leaks, but then it is dropped. Right there. That\u2019s Tony Gilroy\u2019s movie: What if Jason Bourne became Edward Snowden? He hinted at it with The Bourne Legacy. What if he were part of a larger world? What an interesting idea. Instead, we get Jason Bourne searching for the truth about his dad? And he is being chased by very patriotic American assassin Vincent Cassel, who is French as shit? And Alicia Vikander\u2019s and Riz Ahmed\u2019s characters know each other from Stanford, but fuck it, shouldn\u2019t we drive a car through a casino? Greengrass and Damon have a punishing, chaotic, almost entirely physical vision of Bourne. The dialogue in Jason Bourne is so bad it feels like a subliminal dis of Gilroy and his vision of the Bourne-verse as a place where smart, witty people get utterly corrupted by their own sense of purpose. The three of them might not always get along, but they definitely need one another. Together, they made The Bourne Supremacy. Their taste was perfect. ",
