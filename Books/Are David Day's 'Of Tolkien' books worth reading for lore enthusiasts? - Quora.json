            "answer_text": "I own all of these books and will still say that I would not recommend them for lore enthusiasts. Why would I buy them then? Well, I have a ridiculous obsession with buying anything that has the Tolkien name on it. I like the look of these books, how it is organised inside, the images used, and the overall feel of the books. I think they are well put together, and I like having a collection of them on my shelf as you can see below.   My \u201cOf Tolkien\u201d Collection  Why wouldn\u2019t I recommend them then for people interested in the \u201clore\u201d of The Lord of the Rings/Tolkien? Well, there are some writers on Quora who write about Tolkien who have a \u201cfill the gaps\u201d attitude towards what we know and don\u2019t know. I am certainly one who enjoys speculating about certain things. For example, I often explain the nature of Dragons as an extension of Morgoth\u2019s will, or how any great object such as a Ring of Power requires a part of the will of the creator to be placed inside it. I speculate about many things, but I usually explain that what I am saying is my own opinion or is one of many theories. Thomas Snerdley knows this and I have debated with him on many occasions about our views on certain things. One of our biggest disagreements is the nature of Gandalf the White[1]. I enjoy reading Tom\u2019s work as much as the next person, probably more than most, but if he claimed for a fact that The Mouth of Sauron was Earnur[2]or stated that Beorn had to be the child of Radagast[3], then I\u2019d probably pounce like a jungle cat to say that those are interesting ideas. Tom is free to believe these things, but he has the respect for the material to usually say that he has an idea about something, or a theory, or something that may not have been considered before. This is where David Day differs\u2026 When something is not explained properly or in enough detail, Mr Day has the habit of filling the gap. Furthermore, when you disagree with him, he comes out with terms like the \u201cTolkien Taliban\u201d. I get plenty of this on here when someone says I am a gatekeeper etc. For his references, he sticks almost exclusively to The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, and The Lord of the Rings. Even Tom (sorry, I keep referencing you here Thomas*), acknowledges the likes of Unfinished Tales, even if he avoids the source I often quote, The History of Middle-earth. So, what has he [Day] made up? He is one of those people who states for a fact that Tom Bombadil is a Maia. Why? Well because he has \u201cruled out\u201d other possibilities, so he must be one. That\u2019s not really how it works. Remember when Eowyn called the Witch-king a dwimmerlaik? Well, that\u2019s a nice word, but David Day tells us that Dwimmerlaik was used in the land of Rohan in the time of the Riders of the Mark, with haunting spirits named Dwimmerlaik. This is because the Rohirrim were superstitious and believed that the Elves of Lothlorien and the Ents of Fangorn were evil spirits, this called Dwimmerlaik. This is nonsense, and he has made this up himself. He is tying little details in the books together when Tolkien said no such thing. He has done similar things with descriptions of Giants, and the \u201cTelecontari\u201d. This is something I personally can\u2019t stand if we are talking about gathering the lore and having it all in an easy place to look up information. The tying together of actual real information from Tolkien and what the author has interpreted or thought of on his or her own. If David Day released these books and stated openly that it was his own interpretation of the material, then i would have a very different reaction. Don\u2019t just make stuff up so the Legendarium seems complete. We don\u2019t know what Tom Bombadil is, we don\u2019t really know where Orcs actually came from, we don\u2019t know the Witch-king\u2019s real name, we don\u2019t know for sure what went on with the Blue Wizards. We can write answers, fan fiction, and debate it for all time, but we just don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t write it like you do. I would recommend these books if you are obsessed with the word Tolkien on books like I am, or if you like the look of them and the artwork inside. I would not recommend them if you are attempting to expand your knowledge of the Legendarium. For that, I would recommend a few things\u2026 The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Fall of Gondolin, Beren & Luthien, The History of Middle-earth, The Children of Hurin. Read all of this stuff and just enjoy reading the official works written by Tolkien and even edited by his son Christopher. It\u2019s not all equal by any means, but your knowledge will be far greater reading The Children of Hurin than it would be reading the Heroes of Tolkien.The Lord of the Rings : A Reader\u2019s Companion by Hammond and Scull. Essential companion book for The Lord of the Rings. All annotated and they discuss what is actually there on the page without wishing something happened a certain way.Quora. What better place to find out more than Quora itself? If you want to know something about anything in the Legendarium, then just ask it here. Some may be inaccurate, but there are some great writers here who will give you far more information than you\u2019d get in one of the Day books. I think a 200 page book could be written about something like Balrogs just based on answers from this site\u2026 *Quora wouldn\u2019t be the same without what I call the wacky theories of Thomas. Don\u2019t take my words as criticism!

Some of the books go into etymology (which I LOVE), and some just kind of sum up the world, like the Atlas of Tolkien. I generally don\u2019t like analysing pieces of literature, I think it strips them of their beauty, but David Day does a good job of keeping Middle-earth intact while dissecting it. ",

Despite the errors, the books are a handy way to look up something of which you\u2019d like to know more without wading through the various histories of Middle-earth. You can dip in at any point and most likely learn something you didn\u2019t know. And Susanna Viljanen is right. The illustrations are worth the price of the books. ",

            "answer_text": "No, he passes his own speculation as facts. His books contains lovely artwork though. I would say buy the books and read them only when you have read the books by Tolkien first. Also if you want trustworthy reference for Tolkien buy the complete reference by Robert Frost, that one is used by Christopher Tolkien himself, then there's Complete companion by JEA Tyler, that ones good too, then there the Hammond and Scull Companion to Lord of the rings. For art related volumes you can get the art of the Hobbit and the art of the Lord of the rings by Tolkien himself. Then there is the excellent Maker of Middle Earth by the bodelian library. And a couple of art books by Alan Lee and John Howe are very good too. ",

Although they contain several errors and the maps are completely fictious, they are a nice introduction to the Tolkien\u2019s world - and the illustrations are simply astonishing. They are not authoritative, but reading them won\u2019t certainly hurt, and I personally loved them. For someone who has just read Lord of the Rings and wants to delve deeper in Tolkien\u2019s world, they are a painless introduction. ",
