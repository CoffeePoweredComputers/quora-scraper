            "answer_text": "Without fail, I am always reading at least 4 books at a time.  Morning Book: I read a non-fiction book for about 20 minutes every morning; most of the time, these are inspirational books for my own personal or professional development. Work Day Book: I read in between pomodoro units at work for about 5 minutes between each half hour. This is always a current book (or article) in something that I am interested in my field or hobbies, although it is often fluid and I read in chunks, rarely reading through a book cover-to-cover. Evening Book: I read a really good classical fiction book for one chapter in the evening; these are from my book bucket list. Bedtime Story: Right before bed, I read for about an hour or two in my \"seasonal book,\" which is the popular book/series that I enjoy reading again every year: Harry Potter in the summer, Lord of the Rings in the fall, young adult of kinds in the winter (ie Hunger Games, Percy Jackson), and Hitchhiker's Guide in the spring, with Shakespeare, Twain, and Vonnegut in between each series.Fluff: Sometimes, I am not disciplined and my brain craves a break. At that point, I put all other reading aside for a week or two and dive into the guilty-pleasure books (such as historical romance novels). I have never, ever had a problem juggling multiple books. If you have found a book (books?) that excite you and motivate you, keep going! My one thought is, though, that I would hesitate to read anything too close in genre for the first time, because you can mix up story elements. For example, I would not want to read two historical romances, or Percy Jackson and Harry Potter, at the same time. ",

            "answer_text": "I am currently reading three books. I have found that it is advantageous for me to read what inspires me in the moment. Remember when you were going to school? Maybe you had literature in your first period? Then math in your second period? Then science in your third period? As as an adult, we go through different periods throughout our day when were thinking of different things. For instance, if I'm riding a bus, or on a plane or waiting in an office, then I want to read fiction. Mainly because it doesn't require as much concentration, as other books I read.  When I'm at home, and it's quiet, then I like to read my spiritual and metaphysical books. Contemplation requires quiet. And often this material inspires me to write. I really can't do that on the bus, but sometimes if I get inspired I try! Lol  If I need to learn a new skill, then I might want to go to a library to read that book. Or I need to be by my computer to read that book. You probably have many interests, so don't restrict yourself to just reading one book at a time. Read what you need, when you need it or when you want it and enjoy!  But I have to confess, that every time I picked up a Harry Potter book, I could not put it down. And I really didn't want to read anything else \u2014 even though I had to! Lol Inward and Onward! Always be a walking question mark. Explore! Experiment! Experience! #InwardandOnward! #TogetherWeGrow A2A Francesca C. Simon hosts \"Charting Your Course\" sessions on Facebook Live! on Sunday nights at 10 p.m. to 12 midnight, exploring mysticism, creative visualization, metaphysics, numerology, astrology, qabalah and tarot.
