            "answer_text": "I think the two are related, but not necessarily the same challenge.  There's no doubt that ebook sales are ramping up, (though I think it's worth pointing out that the Amazon announcement was about volume, not revenue. They have made hundreds, if not thousands, of books available for pennies), and the wonderful thing for us as publishers, is that the (comparatively) low cost of bringing an ebook to market allows us to publish even niche-ier (?) books than we would normally be able to justify given the high costs of paper, storage, shipping, etc. We can stop swinging for the fences with every book, and publish specialized books for passionate audiences. It also frees up (some) more money to market the book. The time and energy cost is no lower, but the bar for declaring a book a win has completely moved.  I heard Seth Godin speak about a month ago, and he posed the question - why do publishers care about making Barnes & Noble happy? Booksellers don't walk people over to a book and put it in buyers' hands. Other readers do it - they write reviews and buy gifts and tell people when they love a book. Publishers should stop worrying about the middleman and worry about the readers.  Coming from a publisher who spends enormous energy and time on those reseller relationships, I find that concept freeing.  Coincidentally,I also heard Gary Vaynerchuk speak this week, and he warned us that the technology is putting middlemen at risk - producers can go directly to audiences, cheap. We have to bring value to what we do, not just mark-up. And that's why I think ebooks are a huge boon, and self-publishing is not a huge threat: where publishers should prove their worth is as curators. The reading public will eventually get tired of getting burned on self-published ebooks that really needed the strong hand of an editor cleaning them up. I think the publishing industry will have to move faster, put out more books more cheaply and reinforce their value that a well-edited ebook is simply better. ",

            "answer_text": "Publishers aren\u2019t dumb \u2013 they know the threat is real, and it\u2019s attrition on both fronts.  Readers are defecting and talent are both not coming onboard.  We\u2019re already seeing blockbuster sellers coming from the indy world (Hugh Howey, for example) and the trickle is going to increase to a flood very quickly. The threat is that there is not longer a gate between creator and consumer \u2013 the same thing that happened to the music industry, but this time we\u2019ve got the tools to maximize on the ability to address audiences directly.  Book audiences also behave differently than music consumers \u2013 books are 100% attention objects, and there aren\u2019t that many casual readers, compared to casual music listeners.   Some of the tactics used by indie publishers are being aped by the big houses already \u2013 things like pricing pumping on Amazon, giving away the start of a series, perma-free titles.   All that is fine \u2013 it means everyone is on equal ground.   On the front of audience building \u2013 there\u2019s nothing that the industry can do to out-flank the indies.  Giving away all the content obviously won\u2019t work.  Organic audience growth is just that \u2013 organic.  You can spend money to seed it, but without the outsize returns from blockbuster books, there won\u2019t long  be warchests to run PR teams and buy placements.   I can go out there and build an end-to-end flow to get eyeballs on my products through all of the advanced ad solutions around now, and thanks to the integration of books and the web, have a customer lifecycle to work through, especially if I have a ton of back catalog to work from.   I have the same access to tools as the marketing dept does. It\u2019s hard to compete with an individual in a lot of ways:  limited overhead, limited costs, and the ability to leverage those advantages to bring book price down and keep a margin.    Scale doesn\u2019t help the big houses when there are almost no physical costs.    The question the publishers have to answer is \u201cHow can we bring enough value to our content producers and their audience?\u201d   Being guides is not enough \u2013 that\u2019s what reviews and GoodReads are for.Providing an audience is not enough \u2013 focused audiences are much more valuable than broad audiences. Providing editing / proofing support isn\u2019t enough \u2013 most indys are finding those themselves. I can\u2019t see a long-term answer other than specialty publishing houses that deal in art books or cookbooks (although I just bought my first e-cookbook and I\u2019m never going back).   If there\u2019s no value to add, and there\u2019s no margin to take, there\u2019s no business there. ",
