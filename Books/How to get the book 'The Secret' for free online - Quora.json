            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t bother, this type of thinking is mentally harmful and dangerous. We live in a physical world with physical things, mind is not prime over matter, you can\u2019t simply wish things into your life or visualise them into your existence by the actions of thought alone. Believe me I\u2019ve tried! The only thing that has ever worked for me is work, the harder I\u2019ve worked and the more cleverly I\u2019ve worked the better the results I\u2019ve got. If you want something, set your intention, draw up a plan with some measurable steps in it and then get to work! Hard work isn\u2019t always bad for you, it\u2019s often good. There is no shame in working for your stuff. Self help books such as The Secret only add to the burden of mental health difficulties faced by modern people today that still indulge magical thinking despite the fact that modern science has firmly and logically knocked any validity in magic on the head! After all if you visualise something that you want, follow the steps in the book and find that your desired object or outcome doesn\u2019t come, then it must be your fault, you\u2019re not doing it right, or there\u2019s something wrong with your mind! Hence needless mental health issues are the result. Furthermore I\u2019d also like to point out that stoics and buddhists both tell us that being consumed by a desire is not actually that nice. The richest man is not the one with the most stuff but the one with the fewest wants! Peace of mind should be your goal and this is far easier to achieve when subtracting desires from your consciousness than adding to them. ",

The author got in big trouble running one of those inspirational weekends . This one had a sweatlodge . Enduring the misery at close quarters was to increase your belief you could accomplish anything through the force of sheer will. Guess what? They died. There was a big lawsuit. Don't fall for this. If you want the book go to used bookstores offstage sales. You'll find plenty of copies discarded by people who discovered it was Crap. ",
