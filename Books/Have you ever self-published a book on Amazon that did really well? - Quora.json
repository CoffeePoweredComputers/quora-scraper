            "answer_text": "Yes. Many years ago, I self-published some erotic novels on Amazon under the pen name William Vitelli that did extremely well: Elicitation, Evocation, and The Webcam Chronicles. I was, for a time, making about $2,000 a month from sales. Then the so called \u201cpornapocalypse\u201d happened. Bowing to pressure from religious groups, Amazon began limiting the way self-published erotica appears in searches. In some cases, even if you search for the exact title and author of a self-published erotic novel, you\u2019ll find no results; you have to know the book\u2019s ASIN to find it. Overnight, my income from self-published erotica dropped from $2,000 a month to $400 a month, then to $200 a month, and it\u2019s currently holding steady at $25-$40 a month. I\u2019m actually making slightly more from Smashwords with self-published erotica these days; averaging about $38-$55 a month. Last month was pretty good. Here\u2019s my income from self-published erotica on Amazon last month:  Pretty far call from $2k+/month, eh? ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A on this one. Yes. These three. In 2018.  Releasing a book is a funny thing, since you never know how well it\u2019s going to do. So when this book, which I wasn\u2019t even sure anyone would like, made it to #1 in all it\u2019s sub-categories, and #132 in the paid Kindle store, I was totally blown away.  Everyone hated the end of of the first book and demanded a sequel, and it did even better, getting to #97 in the paid Kindle store.  The third in the now trilogy reached #218 in the paid Kindle store. All three books were released around 6 weeks apart. So the momentum was maintained for the whole trilogy. Originally planned as a stand alone, by the end of the trilogy I\u2019d merged them into my existing universe as series 3, setting up a lot of possibilities for series 4. It\u2019s an interesting observation that in totally sucking at writing a stand alone book, it was my second best performing book to date. The sequel was the best. ",
