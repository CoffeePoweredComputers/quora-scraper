            "answer_text": "Absolutely yes\u2026. Reading NCERT books is one of the most important part of the preparation. Even if you are a scholar of a particular subject,still you should read NCERT book at least for once because if you go through the previous years questions you will find atleast 10 questions that comes directly from NCERTs. Moreover the books are written in simple language that everyone can easily understand. It also helps us to build a basic understanding on various topics which will be beneficial for solving questions. Q. How to read NCERT books? Answer: First of all let me clear the difference between the most confusing topic i.e old and new NCERT. Both are same but the old NCERT are more analytical and new NCERT are more factual in nature. Lets take the example of history. We all know history is broadly divided into four parts.Ancient, Medieval,Modern and world. NCERT covers all the topics nicely.For ancient history find out the NCERT book which covers ancient history only.Like old NCERT by RS Sarmah . You might find some NCErt books of junior level class like class 5 or 6. No need to read or follow junior class NCERT.They are very basic.Just chose the higher class.After that read chapter wise.If unable to understand then watch some videos on YouTube to clear your doubts.After that make short notes on every chapter. This will help you in revision. Hope it helps\u2026. ",

For economy , ICSE board Saraswati publication 11th and 12 th std book is very useful ( it was better than ncert). NCERT books are to be used for covering your static basic material\u2026 supplement it with the current affairs and daily newspaper reading\u2026 Join a test series and they will provide what ncert to read and current affairs accordingly.
