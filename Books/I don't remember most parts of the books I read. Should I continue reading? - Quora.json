            "answer_text": "Well, I think you are not supposed to remember most parts of the books you read. It\u2019s natural to forget. You\u2019re expected to get some key ideas out of the read. I can suggest few things which can help you if you\u2019re interested in techniques to retain some core parts after you read books: Write book reviews: After you finish you can try writing the review for the book. It\u2019s ok to flip over the book again and write something verbatim from the book. Note that it is not meant as a test for your memory retention. Instead, writing enforces you to do some rethinking and while you do so it will help you retain those things you write longer.Read discussions on book networking sites: I suggest you to register on networking sites like goodreads[1] where lot of book lovers hangout and discuss about books. This helps you engage more with the books read.Try to talk to others about the book over a period of time: Repeating some of the ideas especially after gaps (e.g. after few days of reading a book, then again after week or so with someone else and so on) will help you retain concepts longer.I will also suggest you a brilliant book on the subject - Make it stick: The Science of Successful Learning which discusses lot of concepts useful for life in learning overall (not just reading).
