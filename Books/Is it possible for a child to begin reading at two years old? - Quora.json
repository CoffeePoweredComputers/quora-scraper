            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s definitely possible. My son was reading simple books at two. He was later diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s. He is now six years old and doing maths at a grade 5 level, knows all the elements of the periodic table and is fascinated with space, the weather, music and all things related to numbers. That being said, I didn\u2019t teach him to read, and I wouldn\u2019t recommend trying to do so at such a young age. As many other people have commented, there is absolutely no benefit to having a child who reads early (except for bragging rights), and, at that age, they are far better off exploring their world through play than sitting down for formal education. If you intentionally teach your child to read before school, then they might have an advantage for the first year or two (or they might just end up bored in class), but the advantage plateaus by the second grade, and is more than out weighed by the potential disengagement. I was reading an article just the other day, about the damage it is doing to children, by bringing in formal curriculum at preschool age, or younger. Kid\u2019s need to time experiment and explore the world around them, to make towers and watch them fall, to learn about sharing, and what happens if you snatch someone\u2019s toys, or the sound that the leaves make when they crunch under feet in the autumn. They need time to get dirty, and play in the rain, and build sandcastles, and paint pictures with their fingers. I would suggest just sit and read to your child. I used to read to my son for hours every day. We would get through a pile of at least twenty books every day, from birth. He picked it up on his own, because he was interested. I read to my daughter - maybe not quite as much - and she has not yet learned to read, but she has learned valuable pre-literacy skills, such as enjoyment in reading, the fact that the pictures in the book (usually) match the words, how to turn pages without tearing the book, that we read left to right, top to bottom, front to back, as well as developing an understanding of rhyme and rhythm and repetition, and an increased vocabulary. If you are interested in making reading fun for your young child, and teaching pre-reading skills in a fun way, I suggest Mem Fox\u2019s book, \u2018Reading Magic\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I started reading at age 2. Nobody worked with me or taught me. I was always asking my mother \u201cWhat is this word?\u201d My sisters were 7 and 8 years older than me, and they went to school! I wanted to go to school too, so bad! When I was age 3 a neighbor gave my parents a piano. I did the same thing with the piano that I did with reading\u2026.I played around with it while my sisters were in school and taught myself to play songs I knew. When I was 4 years old the local newspaper did an article on this little girl who could read at 2nd grade level and play songs with both hands on the piano. When I was halfway through first grade I was skipped into second grade. Ultimately I slowed down and did well in school but was not the best in my class by any means\u2026.I graduated from high school at age 16 and ranked 7/155. When my second son was having problems in school and I took him to a child psychologist, it turned out he had moderate ADHD. The psychologist took my childhood history, and informed me that I had been a hyperlexic child. I had a childhood disorder of sorts\u2026..compulsive decoding. Quite honestly, I would have had a happier childhood if I had learned to read when everyone else did and stayed with my age group throughout school. ",
