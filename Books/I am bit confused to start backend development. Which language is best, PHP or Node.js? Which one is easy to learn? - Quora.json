            "answer_text": "Backend is not about the language being used to write it. Its about framework, design patterns, data structures, algorithms, integrations, error handling, persistence and security. Having said that, backend is a difficult job and you need a whole of other concepts apart from the language. Language is a just a medium to build backend using all of the aforementioned concepts. Now comaing to choosing a choice of language, Java or .NET is the best possible technology when it comes to building enterprise grade backend services due to their type safety, OOP paradigm, great support of libraries and their proven track records over the years. This is what big companies want from their engineers, whom they are ready to pay big bucks. PHP and Node.js is mostly used for website development which is a simple job and doesn\u2019t require much concepts to start with. The market is saturated with such \u201cbackend\u201d developers who mostly focus on building the backend of simple websites. It will prepare you quickly for a job but you will never be able to make it to the cream layer of the industry where the big projects are there, paying big bucks. ",
