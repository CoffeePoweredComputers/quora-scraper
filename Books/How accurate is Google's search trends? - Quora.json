            "answer_text": "Somewhat accurate I\u2019d say. For the orientation in past trends and guidance, it\u2019s useful to see if the particular trend has the potential to grow or decline based on the past performance in the market. But one also has to use the brain and take into an account that some of the trends that had stable growth until now may not be trending anymore due to a few factors such as being \u201cout of fashion or design\u201d, or it\u2019s been simply replaced by something else, and Google Trends graph doesn\u2019t show this kind of data yet because it\u2019s too early to fully evaluate and include in the graph. My conclusion is that Google Trends is a useful tool, along with other tools like some of the topic research and keyword research tools, but all should be used with common sense, out of the box thinking, brain, and intelligence to get most out of them.
