You can just go on Amazon and download the Kindle versions all day this Friday 7/24/2020 from 12:00 am to 11:59 pm Pacific Standard Time. (For the sake of clarity this does not apply to the paperback versions of the books.) Once you read them, pass them on. Books hate being left alone on shelves - even e-shelves. A kind reader posted an article on how to share a kindle book so I am adding it here so you can share my books once you read them: How to Share Books on a Kindle With Family and Friends | Digital Trends Happy reading with all my love.

            "answer_text": "For now my 99c ebook is not free. I only have one book and I\u2019m still trying to break even. One day, in a few years, when I have 5 or 6 books on the street, Connor\u2019s Gambit will be free. FYI if you purchase my book via Amazon, I\u2019m only making 35cents, Jeff Bezos who doesn\u2019t need anymore money gets the rest. If you are interested in reading my book for free, now, ask your local library to carry the book. Its inexpensive, well rated, and available through a number of digital platforms. If you ask enough, they may put it on their purchase list. Personally I would rather have 5 copies in a library than 20 copies sold. ",
