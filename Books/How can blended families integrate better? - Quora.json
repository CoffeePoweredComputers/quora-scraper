            "answer_text": "Leadership comes from the top. It's a big change for everyone so adjustments have to be made. I think a good way that everyone can be included and have a say is to have a meal together everyday or at least 4 nights a week. No cell phones or Tv and each person can discuss what ever they like. Then one night a week or more it can be an informal family meeting where challenges and solutions are discussed. The idea is to pull together as a unit. ",
