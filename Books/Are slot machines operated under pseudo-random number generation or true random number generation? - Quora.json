            "answer_text": "At least the vast majority of current machines use pseudo-random generators. This is done so the operator can adjust the \u201cyield\u201d from the machine (i.e., how much is paid out vs. how much is kept by the operator) to a level that ensures the game makes money, but still gives players the \u201cfeeling\u201d that they stand a chance of winning. For example, here\u2019s what Bally (one of the larger slot machine manufacturers) says in the introductory part of one of their patents: A significant technical challenge is to improve the operation of gaming apparatus and games played thereon, including the manner in which they leverage the underlying random element generator, by making them yield a negative return on investment in the long run (via a high quantity and/or frequency of player/apparatus interactions) and yet random and volatile enough to make players feel they can get lucky and win in the short run. Striking the right balance between yield versus randomness and volatility to create a feeling of luck involves addressing many technical problems, some of which can be at odds with one another. This luck factor is what appeals to core players and encourages prolonged and frequent player participation. Traditionally, an operator of a gaming machine, such as a casino or other gaming establishment, is provided the opportunity to adjust the yield of the game provided by the gaming machine either by installing a different software variation or by selecting one of a predefined set of yields provided by the manufacturer of the gaming machine. Greater flexibility to fine-tune such adjustments is desirable and, as the industry matures, the creativity and ingenuity required to improve such operation of gaming apparatus and games grows accordingly. So, in slot machine terms, this is saying that traditionally the machine had a single pseudo-random generator that gave a specific yield, and to adjust the yield the operator would have to install different software. This patent covers a method of letting the operator adjust the yield to a specific level by having two generators, one of which gives a low yield, and other a higher yield, and for each play \u201crandomly\u201d choosing from a weighted table to decide which one to use. So, you can choose from a range of levels of payout, and it\u2019ll produce that level. Reference Single Document ",

            "answer_text": "While some of the answers previously posted are partially correct, I haven\u2019t seen one that is totally correct. I am a retired senior software engineer with years of software development experience for a gaming company. You can take my word for it, or go on your merry way and ignore everything I am about to write. Note that my gaming credentials and experience are relative to Nevada, and I retired a few years ago, so it is possible (although unlikely) that things have changed. Since nearly all the gaming regulators in the USA is follow what is legal in Nevada, this is how they work. There is one and only one pseudo random number generator in all slot machines. It is a software algorithm that runs at blazingly fast speeds, generating thousands upon thousands of pseudo random numbers every second. There are only two pseudo random number generators authenticated and permitted under the regulations of the Nevada Gaming License Control Board (GLCB). The pseudo random number generators cannot be altered, nor can they be \u201ctuned\u201d to alter game outcome. The pseudo random number generator, and all the code for any game, is authenticated by the GLCB, and any game in any casino in Nevada is subject to examination and authentication at any time. It must match exactly to the code image in the GLCB records, or the casino is immediately shut down and investigated. When a player presses the \u201cPLAY\u201d button, or whatever button triggers game action, the most recently generated pseudo random number is read from memory, and mapped into an event table. The game then displays the result that event calls for. For a reel type slot machine, there may be only one pseudo random number in a million, or more, that maps to the grand prize. There will be several more numbers that map to the next highest prize, and so on, down to a lot of numbers that map to the smallest prize. Then there will be all the other numbers that map to losing combinations. The casino, in Nevada, cannot change the pseudo random number generator, nor its output, nor the pay table maps. The game on the floor must always be exactly as shipped by the manufacturer, which in turn must always be exactly what was approved by the GLCB. Should the casino want anything changed, they must contact the manufacturer, request the changes, and the manufacturer must then pull the appropriate program out of their GLCB approved library, and install that program on the machine.

            "answer_text": "There is one thing all fair slot games have in common: the outcome of each round is based exclusively on a random number provided by a Random Number Generator (RNG). The random number generated by the RNG \"tells\" the reels when to stop and therefore decides the outcome of the game. That means that the same game with the same random number must always give the same outcome. This reminds me that I should explain how RNGs work. Modern RNGs used in online casinos are dedicated hardware devices that generate random numbers out of electromagnetic noise. It\u2019s like an old television without signal \u2013 a lot of black and white dots. Black pixel is 0, white pixel is 1. Take a photo of a small part of a TV screen, convert the pixels into 1s and 0s, write them into a text file and you have a random number. RNG hardware generates thousands of random numbers every second. So on one hand, you will change the outcome of the next round if you press the start button one second later. However, on the other hand, you have no chance to predict whether the outcome will be bette r for you or not. So the fair randomness remains. The true RNG uses electromagnetic noise to generate completely random and completely unpredictable values. The PRNG works in a different way. It starts with a predefined value and then mashes it with some other inputs to generate an infinite series of values. The output values of PRNG seem completely random and impossible to predict at first glance. However, if the PRNG uses a weak algorithm and you know exactly which one, then you may be able to predict the next random number. If the PRNG uses a weak algorithm and you know exactly which one, you may be able to predict the next random number. Guy named Alex, a russian hacker hired by casino, found the glitch in system and made millions out of that. Read more here. Also - here\u2019s a video summing up slots machines, myths and how they really work. ",

            "answer_text": "Newer Slots use adjustable pseudo random number generators. Said another way, they are NOT random. The house can adjust the payout if/when desired. The rules in Vegas for example are that the slot must be taken out of service for 30 minutes when the payout yield is changed to stop casino\u2019s from killing off a winning streak of a lucky gambler just by electronically changing the odds on the fly. All newer machines are \u201con-line\u201d all the time to a master control center. The house knows real time what its take is and can adjust it accordingly. The machines are also RF shielded so technically adept gamblers cannot \u201ceavesdrop\u201d on the machines, or send it false commands. Also remember if you use a casino loyalty card, the casino knows where you are and how well or not well you are doing. start winning, and the drink girls will show up with your favorite cocktail and make sure you have a full glass.

A random number generator is a black box in your casino, which is certified with independent companies by law, and we watch the generated numbers for patterns to prevent a mistake in algorithms. Another question is how we use generated numbers in our algorithms. You have to certify the algorithms by law, because some operations are not allowed in some countries. A general rule is that the algorithm cannot use any information about player to calculate win or lose. ",

The bottom line is and I still cannot fathom why folks get all upset, is that every machine has an RTP figure. That is Return To Player. The bottom line is that it is always going to be less than 100 so you are always going to lose playing the slots.
