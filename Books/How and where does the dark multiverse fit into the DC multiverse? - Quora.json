            "answer_text": "How and where does the dark multiverse fit into the DC multiverse? Okay let me use some visual aid for this one.  This is the upper layer of the DC Multiverse.  While this is lower layer of the DC Multiverse.  So first things first. Those of the 4th dimension (Godly Sphere) and above are aware of all the universes in the upper and lower layers of the Multiverse. The Godly Sphere and Monitor Sphere encompass all the universes of the DC Multiverse. Those from the upper and lower layers. That is how Darkseid has conquered and consumed an unknowable amount of universes, all to raise his power. Because the main universes are mainly off limits to even the gods, where there are strict laws even the gods have to follow. In the lower layer of the Multiverse things do not work that exactly way. As you can see in this image\u2026  All those corpses were parallel timeline versions of Superman. Or in other words\u2026 Supermen from other universes in Hypertime.  In the lower layer of the DC Multiverse, Alpheus (World Forger) was tasked by his mother Perpetua, the actual first creator of the DC Multiverse, to build upon the possibilities that each new life offered. This means that it was Alpheus job to explore every possible timeline. Every possibility was explored by Alpheus in the form of a universe. Those universes Alpheus deemed good enough they would be placed in Hypertime. Hypertime being a place of near infinite time and space. That was created by Alpheus himself.  Those universes that failed were fed to his pet Barbatos, and thus destroyed.  Thus it was Alpheus job to prepare possible universes that might one day rise to become main universes.  The one that rises a potential main universe, into an actual main universe, is Mar Novu (Monitor). It was/is Mar Novu job to maintain the 52 Universes of the upper layer of the DC Multiverse. And to cleanse any universe that deviates from its designated path. Or simply replace a universe in the case of some event destroying it or some god like Darkseid managing to conquer it.  The DC Multiverse is just one. It simply has two layers. Upper and lower. Main and Dark Multiverse. For example, those timelines/universes that were erased with each reboot of the DC Comics, the Elseworlds timelines, even those timelines that were never part of the main Canon like All Star Superman, still exist in Hypertime.  Those that once were part of the main Multiverse, are now no longer part of the Main Multiverse. But they still exist in the Dark Multiverse.  That is why the DC Multiverse is actually bigger than the Marvel Multiverse. Really because through Franklin Richards and Owen Reece, we saw that the Marvel Multiverse is quite finite. Once they reached a certain number of universes they could no longer make new ones. While in DC\u2026 Every possibility, anything that is possible to have happened, or that will happen gives rise to a new universe in the lower layer of the Multiverse. Which means that if the life of just one person on the Earth can give rise to an almost incomprehensible number of possibilities and thus new universes. Now imagine the possibilities brought forth by all the lifeforms in all the 52 universes. We are talking about a number so big that we can only call it nigh-infinite. If I said the DC Multiverse has 10^1000 universes it would still be a low-ball number. There is no point putting a number on the actual unknowable and basically unquantifiable number of universes in the DC Multiverse. Its lower layer (Dark Multiverse) contributing in large part to that. ",

Conclusion: With the dark multiverse acting as the realm/location of nightmare, and as the shadowlands while STILL tying into the world forger and the 6th dimension implies it ties in REALLY WELL If they made a map it would look exactly like this (re iteracting for conclusion): White = Dream false form = 6th dimension = observable cosmic creation forger Black = Nightmare = Shadowlands = Dark multiverse = nightmare false form First border = Dream to reality transition = Wave/Particle duality Second Border = True Form Dream (which is merged dream nightmare) = Cosmic hand of creation storyline form (non observed by krona and others basically only the reader) = Paper aka space to store stuff in = Leviathens heart < (beyond this is explained in Is Marvel larger than DC? ) Final Heaven< Leviathen creation universe < Overshere < Crack = Oversphere True form < Leviathen of stories (leviathen true form)  Image foundation credit: Rui Silva Want me to go further and make a whole cosmology reconstruction post showing the TRUE scale of everything from smallest to largest, showing visuals like this calling it the multiversity updated reconstruction map outline/bases project???? I wanna know wether this is a yes or no, wether to go at the project or not. ",
