            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to reproduce an answer I gave to an earlier question: Short version, with a lot of the details left out. There were two different versions of the Old Testament at the time of Christ. The Septuagint version and the Masoretic version. The Septuagint version, which was written in Greek, had several additional books, originally written in Greek, and several additions to the Books of Daniel and Esther, also originally written in Greek. The rest of the Old Testament books both versions had in common. The Septuagint version was the more common version among non-Hebrew speaking Jews living in the Diaspora. People who weren\u2019t Jewish, but who worshiped Yahweh, the God described in the Jewish Scriptures, (and there were a fair number of those in the Roman Empire) were also more familiar with the Septuagint version. When Paul became the apostle to the Gentiles, he referred to the Septuagint version frequently in his letters because it was the one Gentiles were likely to be more familiar with. As Christianity, partly due to the activism of Paul, became less and less of a sub-sect of Judaism, and more and more of a separate faith, the Septuagint version became the version adopted by the Christian church. And, for the same reason, Jews, whether Hebrew-speaking or not, came to regard the Masoretic version as their official Scripture, regarding the Septuagint version as tainted, for the non-Hebrew texts, and for its having been adopted by the Christians. About a thousand years later, the Eastern Churches and the Western Church split in the \u201cGreat Schism,\u201d and one of the bones of contention is what books of the Old Testament should be regarded as Divinely Inspired. The Bible of the Eastern Orthodox churches includes four books from the Septuagint Old Testament books not accepted by the Western Church. A number of Eastern Christians remain in union with the Western Church, but continue practicing their own rites. Others eventually reunite with the Western Church, also continuing their own rites. Eastern rites, whether Othodox or Catholic, are regarded as valid and holy by the Catholic Church. Eastern Rite Catholics use the accepted Catholic Bible. Five hundred years after that comes the Protestant Reformation, which has many causes, but breaking it down to absolute basics, hinges on two things. First is whether we are justified by faith alone, or by faith combined with a good and virtuous life (i.e. \u201cgood works\u201d). Protestants believe the former. Catholics the latter. The second is whether there is any teaching authority beyond Sacred Scripture. Protestants believe in the concept of Sola Skriptura, or \u201cScripture alone.\u201d Catholics believe in Scripture combined with the teaching authority of the Apostolic church. One of the consequences of the Reformation is that protestants end up adopting the Masoretic Old Testament, mainly, as far as I can see (and there might be disagreement on this) to distance themselves from Catholics who had largely adopted the Septuagint. I think their justification (though I could be wrong) was that, since this was the version of the Old Testament widely accepted as the authoritative text by Jews, it must be the correct one. Ironically, one reason Jews rejected the Septuagint version was that it has become the preferred version for Christians. [NOTE: There is also the fact the the two Books of Maccabees contain verses that speak of the efficacy of praying for the souls of the Dead, which is something most protestant churches do not accept.] What can I tell you? What goes around comes around. So, the Catholic Old Testament has everything the Protestant and Jewish Old Testament does, with the addition of the Books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, 1st Maccabees, and 2nd Maccabees, as well as extra chapters in Daniel, and 103 extra verses in Esther. The Eastern Orthodox Bible includes everything in the Catholic Old Testament, plus First Esdras (i.e. Ezra; they call what are referred to the Book of Ezra in the Jewish, protestant, and Catholic Scriptures Second Esdras), 3rd Esdras, and 3rd & 4th Maccabees. Jews and Protestants think of those extra books as \u201capocryphal.\u201d Catholics and Orthodox think of them as Sacred Scripture. ",

            "answer_text": "Protestant Bible has 66 Books. Catholic Bible has 73 Books (7 more than the Protestant Bible). There are 7 Additional Books in the Catholic Bible are: Tobit, Judith, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch. Protestant have rejected these because there is a sequence in Maccabees 2 in which Jewish soldiers are depicted as praying for the souls of their dead, an act that supported the Catholic doctrine of Purgatory. Protestants reject some part of Catholic Bible which supports catholic doctrines. New Testament consists of 27 books in Protestants and Catholics Bible. Jesus told people will worship him uselessly In Mattthew 15:9 King James Version. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. God will never disgrace Jesus the innocent and good man chosen by him to speak the word of truth to the Jews. The Jews claimed him to be false prophet. According to bible a false prophet must be to death on tree or cross. (Deuteronomy 13:5). And that prophet, or thatdreamerof dreams, shall be put to death...\"; (Deuteronomy 2l:22-23): \"And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: His body shali not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (forhe that is hanged is accursed ofGod;) that thy land be not defiled, which the I.ord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance\u201d. Jesus was not a false prophet. God will never let the Jews put Jesus to death. He will never disgrace Jesus. In Quran Surah nisa 157-158. And [for] their(jews) saying, \"Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah .\" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but (another person) was made to resemble him(jesus) to them(jews). And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. In this God says the face of jew who chased jesus was made to resemble jesus face . All people took the jew to be Jesus. God turned jews evil plan onto them. The jew who thought that chasing a false prophet was good deed couldn't understand why God didn't support him .The jew became confused when he was put on to cross and he cried . Bible Matthew: Chapter 27 verse 46. About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\" (which means \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"). In matthew 26 : 39 Jesus prayed to God that O God if it is possible for you to let this cup(death) pass from me then let it pass. In above verse he asks God to save him from Crucifixion. Matthew 7:7-8 Ask and it will be given to you ;seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. Matthew 12:40 states. When the Pharisees asked Jesus for a sign of his true mission he answered: \"For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\" Disregard now the time factor, which was also not three days and three nights but one day (Sanrday, daytime only) and two nights (Friday night and Saturday night). Was Jonas alive in the belly of the whale? Yes. Then Jesus was still alive as he prophesied' When Jesus appeared in front of his disciples after the event of crucifixion disciples thought him to be a spirit not a man. Spirit comes out of ones body after death. But Jesus told that he was not crucified but he was alive. Jesus himself stated that he didn't die on the cross' Early Sunday morning Mary Magdalene went to the sepulchre, which was empty. She saw somebody who looked like a gardener' She recognized him after conversation to be Jesus and wanted to touch him. Jesus said (John 20:1 7): \"Touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my Father...\" \"Touch me not,\" perhaps because the fresh wound would hurt him. \"I am not yet ascended to my Father,\" means that he was still alive' not dead yet, because if somebody dies, then he goes back to the Creator' This was the strongest proof admitted by Jesus himself' Muslim Christian Dialogue by Hasan M Baagil proves Christian Beliefs are not at all based on Bible.
