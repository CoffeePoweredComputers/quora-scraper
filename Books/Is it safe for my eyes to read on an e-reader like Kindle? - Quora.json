            "answer_text": "For me reading on an eReader such as the Kindle is easier on my eyes that reading on any other device, including phone, tablet, and laptop, especially in ambient light. Whether these devices are safe for the eyes or not is the subject of continual research. If you search online, you\u2019ll find a lot of articles that suggest that too much blue-light is damaging to the eye [1], [2]. As always, moderation is key. Footnotes[1] Research progress about the effect and prevention of blue light on eyes[2] How Blue Light Could Damage Cells In Your Eyes",
