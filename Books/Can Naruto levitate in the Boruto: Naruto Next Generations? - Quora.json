            "answer_text": "If he wanted to, could Naruto levitate in the present time (Boruto)? Boruto is inconsistent garbage that ignores everything that came before it, so it wouldn\u2019t matter if they said he could. It\u2019s 99% filler, so the overwhelming majority of it isn\u2019t even canon to the Boruto manga. Boruto is the equivalent of Dragon Ball GT/Dragon Ball Super. Ill-conceived, poorly-handled, horribly written, with shallow, unsympathetic pastiches of the characters we actually cared about, only stuck in some lame school dayz anime instead of the actual ninja warfare that gave the Naruto series any sense of tension or plot. Sarada is the only good thing to come out of it. Logically, Naruto should not have the ability to fly anymore, because he does not have Hagoromo\u2019s Chakra, which is what gave him that power. In multiple instances where it would have been useful, he has not used it. If they then contradict themselves by having him do it anyway at some point, then it\u2019s because the writers for Boruto are trash. ",

            "answer_text": "Many do not understand that Hagoromo offered them his chakra and that he chose them both as heriters to bring peace, which Ashura had failed after inheriting the Hagormo chakra, he also gave them a seal each to sealed Kaguya, after sealing Kaguya the seals are back over Hagoromo's hand and he disappeared, but Naruto and Sasuke continued to fight for hours in Six Paths Sage Mode, they still had the Hagoromo chakra, then from Naruto The last who is canon and writes by Kishimoto Naruto and Toneri fly, and in Boruto Naruto fly a can in the movie against Momoshiki and in the series to stop the train! Against Kaguya, Naruto fly because she always stay high above the dimensions, so to launch him attacks Naruto had to fly too, against Toneri its exactly the same, against Momoshiki it's different, he could not attack him so it was a Taijutsu fight, so it makes sense that he stays on the ground, especially since he needed Sasuke.
