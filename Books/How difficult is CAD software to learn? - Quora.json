            "answer_text": "Computer Aided Design (or Drafting) softwares in general are no more or less difficult to learn to use than any other technical software. They are not a simple one action GUI where you just tap the candy you want to explode with your finger, they\u2019re a complex set of tools that can do a LOT of different things, and you need to learn at least those processes that are useful to your personal workflow. It\u2019s reasonably straightforward to get to a rudimentary function in most CAD software with a day or two\u2019s study, even without any related background. That does not include time to learn the particulars of the type of drafting and/or design that you are working on. Knowing how to make a line and dimension in AutoCAD is very different from knowing drafting standards used to communicate in Architecture which are different from steel fabrication. If you\u2019re drafting for yourself, then that may not matter. For users who already knew the drafting/design standards/processes they were working with*, I\u2019ve not come across a CAD software that a new user (starting from zero in a new software workflow) couldn\u2019t be reasonably useful after 8 hours of quality training or study, and not a hindrance to a project after 20\u201340 hours of training, and the same in production. Getting really up to speed is usually somewhere between 80\u2013300 hours of production work/experience. Some CAD software takes a LOT more training, and some are particularly obtuse due to constraints or needs of the work it is designed to aid in. That\u2019s generally more niche products. Some users just aren\u2019t good students of CAD processes, just as some folks aren\u2019t good basketball players. Sometimes practice or a good coach helps, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. *This doesn\u2019t mean they necessarily knew how to draft or model, but they were familiar with the terms and outputs. e.g. A journeyman framing carpenter who is used to reading blueprints to assemble a wall is familiar with the nomenclature of blueprints and how buildings go together, and understands what the output of an AutoCAD or Revit file is going to be. An auto mechanic being jumped into architectural CAD software can learn the software, but won\u2019t necessarily have the context to be familiar with architectural blueprints, drafting standards or how a building goes together.

            "answer_text": "Most of the CAD software are fairly easy to get started. They all have pretty and intuitive interfaces thanks to years of evolution and modernization of software. As far as learning a CAD software is concerned, there are plenty great tutorials available everywhere. YouTube and the official tutorials are a great start. However, getting better at it happens only with amount of time you put into it. Practicing whenever you get a chance will improve your skill a lot. If you are looking for a timeline, here\u2019s how long I think it might take: Beginner (getting acquainted with most of the available features, and able to create easy designs): 10\u201315 hrs Intermediate (able to design and create 3D models of easy to medium difficulty models): 50+ hrs Advanced (able to design anything you can think off, sky is the limit): 300+ hrs So you can become a pretty advanced CAD user in about an year if you spend about an hour a day. This is a limit less skill and the more time you spend more better you get. According to me, project-based learning approach is the best approach. Watching tutorials only gets you so far. Design whatever you see. I started with a 3D model of a \u201ckey\u201d, because that\u2019s what was lying on my desk when I wanted to learn SolidWorks. ",
