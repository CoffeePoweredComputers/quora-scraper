I\u2019m guessing by your question you mean an autobiography, not a work of fiction. When writing fiction, authors should be character focused, and then timeline, and finally work on plot last. I will assume the same is true for an autobiography. List all of the significant people in your life who will be major characters in your autobiography, and write a page or so establishing who they are, their relationship to you, and how they influenced you. These character sheets will not be used word for word in the book, they are just reference. After you have the characters, work on the timeline. List all of the decades of your life. 1960\u2019s, 1970\u2019s, 1980\u2019s, etc. Make each one into a temporary chapter header, and then write a paragraph or two for each, not in polished prose, just describing the major events of that decade in your life. Now, you go to the plotline. Decide how the book will be structured. Will it be linear, or jump around? Do you start the book with the day you were born, the day you got married, the day your father died? Do you devote an entire chapter to your mother\u2019s childhood and back story? Once you have that plot line figured out, you can start a brand new document file- the one with the actual contents of the book! Break the plot into chapters, and give each chapter a title. Using the other document as reference, start filling in each chapter. You do not have to write the first chapter first and go step by step, you can jump around. You can even rearrange paragraphs and chapters later, be glad you have a word processor not a typewriter! ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t call my life to be particularly interesting either, and yet I managed to (privately) publish 5 books. I can technically publish a sixth book, and I have the funds to do so, but I choose not to, because the embodiment of 5 physical books is currently sufficient for my taste. You don\u2019t have to write about your own life. Some people write because their writing serves for them as an outlet to actualize their fantasies that are not likely to exist in their lives. Some people indeed write to escape an uninteresting life, and create a literal portal to exciting and vivid adventures in fictional worlds and universes. Unless you\u2019re not writing a completely realistic autobiography, much of your writing content can be about imaginary things and beings. Much of your writing does not have to be based on your life, too. You can use your writing as a way to experience states of existence you are likely not to reach in your own lifetime, like taking over the world, or exploring an alien planet or finding yourself in another dimension. The possibilities are indeed endless if you have the determination to workout and to extend the horizons of your imagination. Remember - writing is largely a solitary activity, and a solitary life is usually a very uninteresting one by its own, unless you are, for instance, an adventurer that travels the world on your own. But if you spend most of your free time in your home, like I do in this case, your life might not be getting anymore interesting in the near future. Think about most of today\u2019s most popular movies. Most of them are likely to be complete fantasies than based on the life of those who wrote the script. Was the infinity war movie based on the writer\u2019s life? Probably not. ",
