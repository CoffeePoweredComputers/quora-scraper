I have a female cat that I always say is the reincarnation of my mother, because she reminds me so much of my mother sometimes. She has a similar character and sometimes looks at me with a certain look or does things that are so much like my mother. Recently I was doing something and thinking that, if my mother were alive and saw me doing that, she\u2019d start yelling that it was time to eat and to drop already what I was doing. (My mother always used food as a way to pull herself and others from situations that were emotionally uncomfortable for her). What I was doing was something my mother would\u2019ve felt uncomfortable with. In that same moment, my cat suddenly came up to me and, with great annoyance, started meowing loudly demanding to be fed right now. (If anyone is curious, what I was doing was going deep into information I had found about my mother\u2019s ancestors and finding certain patterns, as part of my family tree project) ",

Any books that I keep in hardcopy on my shelf are likely ones that I like, so he could pull any of them down and I could construct a message from them. What he might be trying to tell me would be something like \u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d or perhaps \u201cI think there\u2019s a mouse hiding behind the books.\u201d ",
