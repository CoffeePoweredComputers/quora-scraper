            "answer_text": "Entropy does not always increases. Entropy increases in very specific conditions. For example, you take two systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, then you join them, let them interact with each other\u2014and possibly with the environment\u2014until the combined system reaches a new thermodynamic equilibrium. The resulting system has an entropy that is equal or larger than the sum of the entropies of the original two systems. Once you study statistical mechanics and Shannon information theory, you realize that entropy is a measure of the ignorance you have about which is the actual microscopic state of a system, given that you know about that it corresponds to a known thermodynamic state. The typical example is a box with gas. To know the actual microscopic state of the system requires you to know the position and momentum of all the atoms within the gas. That is a lot of information. But, if the only thing you know about the gas is that it is in thermodynamic equilibrium at a certain temperature and volume, then you know much less information than if you know the microscopic state of it. The difference between the former and the later quantities is the amount of information that you ignore about the microscopic state of the system, a quantity that we call entropy. Now, why entropy increases? It increases because by letting a system interact with the environment\u2014to let it reach a (possibly new) thermodynamic equilibrium\u2014somehow we let the system erase information that we may have learned about its microscopic state. For example, imagine that you start with a box of gas with all its atoms completely quiet, not moving at all and arranged in a sort of perfect array. Then, we may say that we know exactly the microscopic state of the gas. But then, we let the box of gas interchange energy with a hot source and, as a consequence, the temperature of the gas increases and the atoms of it begins to move. Eventually, if the source of heat is held at constant temperature, the gas will reach a thermodynamic equilibrium. At that point, you just have lost track of the position and momentum of the atom of the gas. The huge amount of information you had about the microscopic state of the box of gas at the beginning of the experiment just went away. The only thing you know about the gas in its new thermodynamic state is its temperature and volume (plus the density, which haven\u2019t changed since we didn\u2019t let any gas go in or out of the box). That is far less information than the one we originally had. How much information we have lost? That quantified by the entropy. In summary\u2026 Qualitatively speaking, entropy increases in the sense that we are constantly loosing information that we may have about the state of systems once we let them interact with the environment. Quantitatively speaking, entropy is well defined between thermodynamic states, only. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming that you mean thermodynamic entropy, one statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamicsis: Unconstrained energy will spread from higher to lower concentrations, become more dispersed in space. As entropy is simply the measure of this always increasing energy dispersal, in units of energy and temperature (joule per kelvin), this is also known as the Law of Increasing Entropy, expressed as: In a closed system, entropy tends to increase (in a reversible process, remain constant) over time. As an analogy: A system\u2019s internal energy is like toothpaste in a tube, you can never make use of it all (\u201cusable\u201d energy = exergy), some always remains unusable (i.e., entropy):  Image autolinked from Thermodynamics, the Laws, Exergy, Entropy and Energy(Folke G\u00fcnther, 2013) The entropy of a system (e.g., a steam engine) is the measure of the amount of \u201cunusable\u201d (or \u201clow grade\u201d) energy in the system, the heat that \u201cleaks out\u201d and is radiated into the environment. This is just another way to say the same thing: unconstrained energy always dissipates (goes from more concentrated forms to less concentrated forms; from \u201chotter\u201d to \u201ccolder\u201d (never the other way around). This is clearly demonstrated as the steam in a compound steam enginecools off (increasing entropy), where each successive stage requires a larger volume in order to extract more exergy (useful energy) from the increasingly cooler steam:  Anim gif autolinked from Wikimedia Commons.

High-pressure steam (red) enters from the boiler and passes through the engine, exhausting as low-pressure steam (blue) to the condenser.\u201d A body\u2019s entropy S is its heat content Q divided by its temperature T (i.e., S = Q/T, in units J/K(source: Entropy Is Not Disorder(Steve Donaldson, 2012) So one simplistic (but correct) answer to the question \u201chow does the entropy of a system increase?\u201d is that \u201csome of the system\u2019s internal energy is dissipating\u201d (i.e., the system cools down). The important thing to keep in mind is that Entropy is Not \u201cDisorder\"(Professor Frank Lambert, 2005). See also his article Disorder - A Cracked Crutch for Supporting Entropy Discussions (F. Lambert, 2002). ",
