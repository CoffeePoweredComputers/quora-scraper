            "answer_text": "Dear friend, According to me, it is not necessary that if a person is american then only he will be able to do things that have never been done before. In today\u2019s world extraordinary things happen. Even those people succeed about whom we cannot even think. And they do more than we expect from them. So, its better not to think people belonging to a certain nation do new successful things. Cause success never comes by seeing someone\u2019s nationality, it comes to those who work hard for it. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do I feel like Crowly is just passing on his homework to me? since you asked me to answer, here is my take on it World is increasingly globalized and nations are not uni-cultural anymore. So any attitudes that people perceive of any nations may not apply currently. In Mark Twain\u2019s times America was a new country and they needed to be resourceful and inventive as compared to England. Today things are vastly different- demography has changed, people from US and uK are not predominantly white anymore, economics and the sphere of influence has changed. In conclusion- Generalizations dont apply. ",
