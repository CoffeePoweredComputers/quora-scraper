            "answer_text": "See if this helps. It\u2019s my standard answer to anyone who asks me how to plot out a book. Maybe it will get your muse going. PLOTTING OUT YOUR BOOK So you've got a good idea for a novel. You've got characters bouncing around your head, you've chosen a setting, and you've got an idea about what is going to happen first and how it will end. The middle? Well, that's not always as clear. So now what? Most people just sit down and start writing. Let it be known that those people almost never get published. You've got to have a structure, a plan to get from point A to point B, and keep your reader interested. There are numerous books written on how to do this. You could try to follow any one of them, or take notes from several, but soon you will likely find the whole thing gets horribly complicated and too hard to manage. The following system is better than most and more simple to boot. Lay out your story as though it were being made into a 3-act movie, which is plotted out in six stages. The following is based on a 260-page book. If yours is longer, then just adjust accordingly. Stage 1: The opening act & setting up the premise. Introduce your characters and the inciting incident, or the reason why this whole story is being told. We'll work with three examples: A car crash, a woman left at the altar, and a terrorist taping a bomb to his chest and studying the layout of the local elementary school building. Setting up your story should take about 25 pages. That's not to say it will all be in one chapter. Break it down into as many chapters as you need to tell your story. The 1st turning point comes in at around page 26. Make something happen to change the character's life. (If the car crash victim just died, the book would be over, right?) The car crash victim is in a hospital far from his home state and starts to have feelings for his nurse but he's a married man and keeps his feelings to himself. The jilted bride cleans out her apartment, gets in her car, and heads to Alaska to make a fresh start. The terrorist discovers his wife is pregnant.  Stage 2: The new situation. Give your characters a terrible time, make them suffer. Make awful things happen to them. One of my instructors used to say give them two choices, sucky and suckier. Have the nurse for the car crash victim not only turn out to be married but be pregnant. Have the jilted bride's car break down in a remote area and she gets robbed while she's walking into town. Let the terrorist's whole family move in with him, all his cute little brothers, and his sweet grandma too. This should take you up to page 65.  Turning point #2: A change of plans. The car crash victim gets a terrible infection and has to have 24-hour care by this nurse. They begin to get close. The jilted bride gets herself and her car to a little backward town and has to stay and work while the car gets fixed. She hates it there. The terrorist has to postpone killing himself, but tries to recruit one of his little cousins. Make the cousin adorable.  Stage 3: Making progress. Everyone's plans are moving along. The car crash victim gets a little better and he and the nurse can't deny their attraction. The jilted bride adjusts to the little town and starts to make friends. The bomber's family still doesn't know what he's up to and he is making progress with teaching his cousin terrorist ways. You should be at about page 130.  Turning point #3 is a point of no return so to speak. Some kind of commitment is made. The patient professes his love to the nurse and asks her to run away with him. The jilted bride falls in love with the mechanic who is working on her car. The bomber sets a date when he will have the little cousin blow up the school.  Stage 4 is where complications come in and the stakes get higher. The nurse's husband shows up at the hospital, confronts the car crash victim, and tells him to stay away from this wife. The jilted bride finds out her new love has a record and he is a wanted man. The bomber's plans are found out by his sister and she tells the whole family.  Turning point #4, at about page 195, have a major setback. The car crash victim refuses to stop his adoration of the nurse and her husband comes back and beats him near to death. Also have the crash victim's wife and his two baby girls show up at the hospital. (Double whammy.) The jilted bride finds out her new love is wanted for murdering his wife. The bomber's family calls the cops and he flees.  Stage 5 is the final attempt. The car crash victim tells his wife it is over between them, that he is in love with someone new. Broken hearted, the jilted bride turns her man into the police and gets in her now-repaired car to continue her trek to Alaska. The bomber shows up at the school playground and sneaks into the school to plant his bomb. This should take you up to about page 235.  Turning point #5 is the climax. The nurse leaves her abusive husband and commits to the car crash victim. We find out that his wife was quite the witch, she wasn't all that unhappy about him leaving her, and she goes back home. The jilted bride gets a call from the police that her new love has been cleared and she turns the car back around to head back to him. The bomber sets off his bomb and only succeeds in killing himself.   Stage 6: The aftermath; the happily ever after ending that all readers want. The car crash victim and the nurse start a wonderful new life together, and he gets custody of his little girls. In the last scene the jilted bride is at the altar but this time the groom shows up. The bomber's family gets to stay in the USA and the little cousin gets to go back to being a normal happy little kid. The end - page 260.  See how easy that is? Okay, not so easy. But do-able. Get started plotting out your novel. ",

            "answer_text": "Get yourself a number of boxes. In one box throw in slips of paper with names of genres. The two types of books can be further divided into many different sub-types, called \"genres.\" Here are some of the different genres of books which are available today. After we list all of them, we will discuss some of the more popular genres. Science fiction\u2014satire\u2014Drama\u2014Action and Adventure\u2014Romance\u2014Mystery\u2014Horror\u2014Children's\u2014Religion, Spirituality & New Age\u2014Science\u2014History\u2014Comics\u2014Diaries\u2014Journals\u2014Prayer books\u2014Series\u2014Trilogy\u2014Fantasy In another box place slips with the names of locations: actual and made up. Paris, Rome, London, Washington DC, Berlin etc etc - Umbraforam, Telfani, Musko (fantasy examples). In another book place slips with character names both first and last names. In the last box place slips with every conceivable crisis point: killing, death, birth, a robbery, a discovery, a confession etc. Now this is the simplest method by which to come up with a plot randomly. I prefer to actually design books I write and try to have them become literary, but that will come with experience. For now this is the best way to begin writing, From each box draw five slips. Don\u2019t looks at the slips. Set one on the tops of another until you have five equal piles. Take one pile and from that one only choose the location that is list. From another the genre, and so on. When you are finished with the first separation all that information will concern your main character. Do the same with all the others. You now have the basic foundations of a story. From the slips you have drawn write a thumb nail synopisis of the information. Then you can begin to outline the interactions between people and places from the various piles. At this point get 3x5 recipe cards and on each one, write only one action or scene which you imagine to be in the book. Don\u2019t worry about sequence. Then you lay out your filled cards on the floor and begin to manipulate the scenes in some coherent order. When you have a an order you like, then write one page for each card, expanding what you are envisioning within your story. Next you go back to the beginning and begin to think of specific action and dialogue. Write as much as comes to your for for each card. You should have 25 (or more) elements towards your story. You will try to elucidate your story with five to seven pages of description, action and dialogue for each element. Before you know it, you will have a novella of 125 pages. The final step in the process is to flesh out the story somewhat but don\u2019t push it. A book should only be as long as it needs to be. What you do with this process will show you your skill as a writer. Like I already said, this is not the way I write, but it has been known to work. I forgot to mention - online you can find programs that are random plot generators that work much the same as the above but are a bit more confining if you decide to try to stick closely to their suggestions.
