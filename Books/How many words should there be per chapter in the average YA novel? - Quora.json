            "answer_text": "Go to the library and look at the top (you define top) YA books similar to what you are writing.  Count the pages in each chapter and divide by 250 to get an answer for what is the average number of words per chapter.  Note the number of pages in the book as well, which varies considerably between genres. Remember to look at books similar to what you want to write.  Write your scenes as long as they need to be to express the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist in the setting that causes the twist that changes everything (summarized from Holly's Writing Classes).  When that is accmplished, start on the the next scene.  Then decide where your chapter breaks need to be based on how the scenes play out.  Thanks for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some good answers here. However, it's also worth thinking about your readers and what they prefer too in terms of chapter length. One thing that has changed radically in the last decade is tech and reading. People are reading on smartphones, Kindles and various other tablets and apps. On this basis, research shows they are beginning to prefer shorter chapters. For example in crime/mystery, readers often favour 5 MINUTE chapters, which translates roughly to one thousand to fifteen hundred words. Hope this helps.
