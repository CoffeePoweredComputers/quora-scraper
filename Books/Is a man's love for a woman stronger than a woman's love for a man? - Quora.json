            "answer_text": "I fear you are correct in feeling that way because in a sense its true. People think of love like some ethereal thing yet most questions of life can be awnsered in biology. Love is a real thing a chemical programing designed for life's ultimate purpose. To successfully procreate and to continue the survival of the species. Whilst males and females both experience this programming we have very different biological prerogatives and so it is with our love programming. We experience it very differently. In a short awnser yes a mans love for a woman once bonded is stronger than that of a females to her man. It has to be. A mans biological role aside from sireing children then falls to the overall protection, Providence, and overall outcome of the entire family units success. The female has similar drivers but mostly centred on the children's direct nurturing. It is why men will generally risk more and take matter\u2019s to further extremes. This is one of the often unspoken truths about why the rate of youth males suicide is exponentially higher than females. The chemical reaction is strong and hits hard with the onset of testosterone. And it takes a long time to fade. Men are more biologically expendable than females. (Sucks I know but no less true) there is a difference in sexual economy between the sexes. This is why as much as feminists clammer for equality there can be none because it cannot exist. Biologically speaking they have always had and always will have a much higher biological value than men (unless nature somehow flips on its head) it is something a lot of woman are unaware of consciously and a lot of men. But most of us are aware of it in on a subconscious level. Ask yourself how many woman where sent to war? Or why woman and children are to board life boats first? Its not chivalry. Its because women and children have to survive for the population to continue. Think about it biologically. Technically only one man needs to survive amongst many woman to ensure the continuation of our species and full biodiversity but if only one woman was left amongst men it would be a whole lot more problematic. This is also why our desire to mate is so much higher. Our biological prerogatives are very different. Woman weather they are conscious of it or not have a whole raft of factors to consider when choosing a mate. Most of it coming down to factors that will affect the potential future of potential children as that is a females ultimate biological prerogative. Where as men are primeraly concerned only with genetics. It is why we value bueaty so much where woman do as well they also value money, power and social standing. Its why woman are generally traditionally so much more concerned with their appearance than men while men are generally more concerned about earning potential and respect. Just look at the make up industry if you have any doubts. So to make the male willing to sacrifice so much even themselves when it comes down to it the chemical release of love once bonded in men is much higher towards there partner than it is for females but they get a much stronger chemical release of love toward their children. Its not a mystery its all their when you look at nature. But feelings are hard to pin down and rationalise. ",

            "answer_text": "The man\u2019s love, apparently is stronger. I once conducted a survey in my class. My question was, there is a fire, and you can save only one: either your spouse, or you child. Whom would you choose? Most of the boys said they would rescue their wives. Their consolidated explanation was something like this: \u201cI would definitely feel horrible about not being able to save my child, but I can have children again, if I manage to save my wife. Also, raising a child without the mother is going to be most difficult. Remarriage is a worse option, what if the stepmother doesn't accept him/her? That is going to be even more complicated. Horrible as it may sound, it's better to avoid all that and just save the woman I love. It's more practicable. Later, we can have children again.\u201d However, all the girls unanimously answered, \u201cMy child. There can be no second thoughts about it.\u201d The reasons are highly biological. To propagate their genes, males need maximal chances at mating, where are females need maximal survival of their offspring. This is why we see an apparently stronger desire on the man's side than on the woman's. Like somebody pointed out before, women need a mate who will be able to protect, provide for, and help raise the child. So their love is much more conditional. It's all encoded by nature, one can't do much about it. ",
