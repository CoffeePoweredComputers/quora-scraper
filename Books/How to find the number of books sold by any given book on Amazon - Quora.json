            "answer_text": "As far as I know, you can't.  HOWEVER, from observations I've made over the past few years, you can get a wild estimate of how well a book has sold and is selling from the ranking although it's a bit complicated.  If a book is ranked at over 4 million it's unlikely it's sold more than a single copy or so in the last six months, and probably no more than a few dozen in the last six years.  If it's ranked around 1 to 2 million it's probably sold several hundred to a couple of thousand, but no more than a few dozen in the last six months. BUT... if you buy one of those books you'll see the ranking pop up in the next few hours to about 75,000 or 100,000 and then see, over the next week or so as it slides up toward the one million mark again. Remember that Azon isn't the only outlet out there however.  Some books have audiences that attract more in the way of orders from authors' websites or from bookstores or other online sellers. - MJM ",
