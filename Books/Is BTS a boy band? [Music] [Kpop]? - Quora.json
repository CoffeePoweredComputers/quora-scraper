            "answer_text": "Well Technically a Boy Group since with don't play Instruments as a band. They're made up of 7 humble and Kinds men We have RM, the amazing leader who's real name is Kim Namjoon. He is smart ASF. No joke. Main rapper, producer of music. The best as leaders can get. Manages to keep Korea's National pride under control. Yeah you heard me right BTS is Korea's national pride, it's a huge part to play. This is the man who's given a speech at the UN about self love and pursuing ones dreams no matter what age you are. He is full of surprises  Then we have the eldest of the group Jin, real name is Kim SeokJin he is a main vocalist and visual of the group . He is absolutely the funniest and the cringest yet the most relatable. If his visuals aren't enough to impress you it's for sure his dad jokes XD his overly confident personality makes him such a strong figure for anyone to look up to. He can cook and is pretty much the father of the group, scolds them when they do something wrong (yes plain out yells or flips out at them) , cooks for them and I don't know he's just like that one big brother you always wanted. One last thing his shoulders\u2026.. those are some BROAD SHOULDERS. like actually his shoulds are Wide. And le\u2019jin'day ps one tiny last point His fans , he himself, BTS calls him WorldWide Handsome.. ^^  Then we have SUGA, his real Name is Min Yoongi He is a major K-pop Producer, plays the piano and plays a big hand in producing his groups songs alongsude the leader Namjoon. He is one of the three main rappers of the group. He's soo cool and badass savage asf. Don't get me wrong he is cold and serious lots of the time but there are just such sweet moments when he can't help but be cute and just act like a crackhead.. but then again it's BTS we're talking about they're all crazy XDDD  Next we Got J-Hope, who's real name is Jung Hoseok. The group's dance machine, he is the main Dancer and is amazing! Honestly I suggest you look him and his dance moves up he's dope ASF and so many people sleep on him which is so odd and unfair. He is golden so good at many things. He's also one of the groups main rappers. He can has such a beautiful voice and can sing but decided to be a rapper instead there were so many times he proved to be golden XDD  We got Jimin up next his full name is Park Jimin. One of the Maknaes of BTS. Maknae line is the youngsters of the group. He's also a main Dancer, vocalist and his visuals are very well known. FAM the Kardashians COULDNT relate look at those gorgeous natural lips like XDD His voice is so unique and soft, he can really hit those high notes beautifully, but like any other person he's human and has had his bad days, it's completely normal ^^ one last point HE IS SUCH A SWEETHEART. He cares for every single member you'd mistake them all for brothers because of how much they look out for each other.  Now we got V, yeah I know his stage name is V but his full name is Kim Taehyung. He has a strong passion for fashion and is a complete cutie pie. So generous and adorable. He is a main Vocalist and dancer. He's also one of the groups main visuals. Part of the Maknae line. His voice deep and raspy voice really really stand out from your average K-pop idol. Honestly if you tried to get to know him I wouldn't be surprised if you fell in love with his beautiful personality  And last But not least, CERTAINLY not least. We have the KPOP industry's Golden Maknae. Jungkook, his full name Jeon Jungkook. This man is great at everything. Sure he's the youngest but that doesn't stop him from being the most competitive. There are many times he proves to be BTSs baby and then there are times he looks to be BTSs leader he really is marvelous. He is one of the main Vocalists , main dancer. Full of all kinds of tricks.  Now as a whole. This group have always focused on Lyrics. Before they didn't even care about Choreographies which is crazy because one of the coolest things about BTS is their overly complex choreos but even so The Music was always a big part to this group. When they first debuted they focused on a rebel, and hip hop image. No More Dream their first MV and song released was about young people and their dreams, that was their main concept young people and the minds of youngsters and our struggles which adults Always generalized and called illusions as the years went by their music changed and so did their personalities and concepts NATURALLY they would change. To this day their music holds of important images and their music videos contain complex stories and mysterious ALWAYs having their fans thinking, their music has been about self love, they've talked about depression, and focusing on what was really important. They aren't like your ordinary boy group. They've struggled so much to get where they are people always assume this fame came easy but it was horrible. Their debut was taken horribly people downgraded them when they barely had nothing, they were signed to a company who was originally bankrupt and couldn't afford to even support them, years were spent like this, their fans started getting attacked themselves to this day they still are but now they're global superstars . I would explain more but it's already long enough, if you are an open person I suggest you give their music a chance, TURN ON the caps. They aren't your average boy group singing about girls and partying. They get real through their music . They use their fame for greater causes they're probably the least problematic idols you'll ever get to hear of. Anyways enjoy the rest of your life person \u201cLove yourself\u201d -BTS  ",
