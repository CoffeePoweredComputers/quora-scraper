I've heard of pristine condition prints selling for as much as $5,000.00. It's really a LOT like The Holy Bible. To another recovering alcoholic, who is \u201cdevout\u201d in their recovery program and the 12-Steps, it's worth far more than it would be to a non-alcoholic\u2026just as a very old 1st edition print of The Holy Bible would be worth thousands to tens of thousands to another Christian, but an atheist would pay more for a copy of Rolling Stone magazine. Lol. Everything's relative. ",
