            "answer_text": "They are worth reading if you are willing to learn from them. Each book mirrors a certain philosopher, but in a modern way that anyone can understand, if they choose to. 48 Laws of Power is very Machiavellian (although a much easier read than The Prince), The Art of Seduction uses ideas from Kierkegaard (though I\u2019ve never read any Kierkegaard so I can\u2019t speak too much on that one) 33 Strategies of War takes cues from Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War (which is quite the short and easy read, actually) and Mastery takes a lot of ideas from Nietzsche (who\u2019s books are brilliant but take a long time to get through). Robert Greene\u2019s books aren\u2019t a complete substitute for all of these philosophers, but all of the ideas are there, in a way that people can easily read and understand. Focus on the ideas he is trying to convey and how they relate to how the world works, not simply the words on the page. ",

            "answer_text": "That would be a very subjective assessment. I really enjoyed 48 Laws of Power and 33 Strategies of War, mostly for the highly interesting anecdotes. I learnt of new thinkers, artists, generals, businessmen through the countless anecdotes. In my opinion, 48 Laws is a superficial interpretation of Machiavelli so I wouldn't take the Laws too seriously but it is worth reading and making up your own mind. The printed versions are very well laid out, I loved the design of both books. The \"superior alternative\", in some cases and depending on your interest, would be to refer to the supplied bibliography and read it book by book. This is what I did... but read the above mentioned books first. The most interesting people I gained an admiration of: Col. John Boyd, Napoleon, Hannibal, Musashi. There were definitely more that I can't recall right now. ",
