            "answer_text": "Given the times that we are living in right now, locked down inside our homes, but with a lot more to deal with in terms of work and also home, getting me time is probably the toughest for most of us. I am in the same boat \u2013 I have to manage all the household work, meet all my office deadlines, tackle my daughter\u2019s online classes and homework and then of course, the fact that I can\u2019t step out for some retail therapy or a movie session at my favourite multiplex! At times, it just gets a little too much to handle! However, I realised that relaxing and recharging myself for the next day is actually easy \u2013 one thing that I really like doing is soaking in a nice warm bath \u2013 I light up a few scented candles or add a few drops of my favourite bergamot essential oil in the water and just let the entire day wash away. Another easy way to relax and more importantly, get a really good night\u2019s sleep is by adding a few drop of a mood elevator, that I picked up from an online store called The Maeva Store, to my fragrance diffuser.

            "answer_text": "After a long hard day, I immediately get changed into comfortable pajamas. Depending on where I decide to crash, I\u2019ll either chill on my couch or my own room. The year-round Christmas lights will be turned on, and I\u2019ll either light a candle or melt some wax cubes. I\u2019ll usually choose a sweet scent because they get me relaxed the best. Once I\u2019m all cozied up, I\u2019ll grab the blanket my mom made me, snuggle up with it and one of my cats or dogs, and pull up some Kitchen Nightmares on my TV. For some reason, Kitchen Nightmares knows how to wind me down. It\u2019s just a really relaxing atmosphere that makes me content with life no matter what is going on. :) ",
