            "answer_text": "Selling health care products will require focus on building trust and earning confidence of the prospective customer. The following may help, and is mostly true for selling any product a. Be genuine b. dont try to sell - this is counter-intuitive - what it means is that you should approach it with a view to fill a need that the customer has or a need that you help discover. Almost nobody likes to be sold something. c. always carry testimonials, and give them references of customers who have used the product and were immensely satisfied. d. don\u2019t share technical details of the product except some key features. Focus on what it can do for the customer. In my opinion, women are wired differently and take decisions at an emotional level ( like the sales person, or has an attractive appeal etc) e. to the extent possible, give them samples to try. this may not always work; but perhaps an effective way to build confidence in the product.

            "answer_text": "How do you sell products or how do you make money? Realize those are two completely different areas of discussion. Also realize that MLMs are all comprised of 50% hype and 50% damage control. Also realize that by joining them, you have become the client. You will buy product, marketing and training materials, monthly subscriptions of various kinds, seminars, and will probably even have to pay to enter their annual convention. Also realize that the potential incomes used to flaunt the opportunity weren\u2019t earned by selling product, but by selling you the above mentioned list. Product sales typically only cover their overheads. ",
