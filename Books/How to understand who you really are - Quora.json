            "answer_text": "You are your actions.  You are not something deep, deep down that needs to be discovered, coddled, and loved into existence.  Everything that makes you you is right there on the surface for other people to see.  You're the sum of your actions, plain and simple.   Why do I say this?  Don't thoughts / feelings / etc. matter?  Well, sure they do, insofar as they drive you to do anything.  You can take a thought back, but it's impossible to recapture an action after it's been taken.   I really do mean anything can be an action (in this context, an action is anything you do that's voluntary (talking is an action, breathing normally isn't)).  Every word that comes out of your mouth is a choice.  So is every step you take, every single day.  You're making millions of these tiny choices each day, usually without realizing it, and you're making them in a massive network of other people who are also influencing you. There are a lot of tricks you can use to force yourself to be more mindful of your actions, and the other posters have detailed several.  Most of them don't work for me.  What worked for me (and got me to the point where I was capable of being introspective and thinking through my decisions) was trying to find my limit for doing (as you call them) 'dumb impulsive things.'  I needed to know how far I could push myself before something went really wrong (ending up in the hospital many more times than a normal person does, thankfully never with anything life-threatening).  Trying to find my limit gave me the ability to think, because it let me see how much I was capable of.  Once you see that you're capable of a lot in one arena, you'll realize how capable you are in all of the other ones, and how easy it can be to control most of your daily actions.  Well, at least, that's how it worked for me.  There were also plenty of times that I thought I was super-capable of something, and it turned out that I sucked at it.  I learned a lot from those experiences.  The important part was that I kept pushing myself until I found the wall.  This did a lot of things for me: It showed my my limits;It gave me relative measurements against my peers; andIt made me very conscious of how I was spending my time.A couple last words of advice:  When you're trying to find that limit, though, please do it in something that you're already moderately talented in.  Lots of people do this with drugs and alcohol, and I don't recommend that at all -- I'm telling you to see how far you can push yourself, not how far something external can push you.   You're likely to screw this up many, many times before you start finding a rhythm that works.Have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "One of the simplest ways to know yourself is to, first, realize there is a base nature you share with all other humans, and that nature is\u2014in a word\u2014flawed.  The two biggest flaws of human nature are deceitfulness and selfishness\u2014which means we are less prone to see our own flaws than those of others. Resolve to be honest about what reality presents to you, at all times, and you're ready to begin understanding who you really are. Here's How - A Simple Method Water is water, no matter where you find it. And, while water in one place can be either clean or polluted, salty or fresh, or full of life or dead, what makes it water never changes. Human nature, I think, is the same. It's human nature wherever you find it. One thing we all seem adept at doing is seeing flaws in others. Criticism and complaints flow from our lips with little effort. But, of our own behavior and reasoning, we think we are right. And, by \"right,\" I don't mean just morally right, but also materially, logically, and factually right. A quick example: I can proofread other people's writing and typically spot every typo, misspelling, and grammatical or punctuation error, even in large documents. But, with my own writing\u2014even though I reread it multiple times and it's no bigger than this answer\u2014I often miss my own errors. This ability to see what the other guy has done wrong seems common to all humanity. Armed with this understanding, I have come to know myself more and more through a simple method: Every time I catch myself being critical of someone else, or being angry with someone else, or displeased with someone else\u2014assuming I have the presence of mind at that moment\u2014I search my memory for a time when I did the exact same thing. That is, I identify the behavior in kind\u2014much in the way people have given names to logical fallacies. And, very quickly, my memory delivers an occasion where I have committed said infraction. Sometimes it delivers more than I asked it for. Multiple occasions come to mind. Ok, brain, I only asked for one\u2014you can shut up now. Of course, the catch here is presence of mind. The more angry or otherwise upset I am in the heat of the moment, the less likely I am to perform this little analysis. So, it sometimes occurs after the fact, after things have calmed down and emotions have subsided. The thing is, once you make yourself aware that the human nature you hate when you see it is the same base nature you have, and then begin to consciously look for human nature in its various forms, you will begin to see every human phenomenon, action, and interaction in terms of human nature. And you will begin to see recurring patterns of thought and behavior\u2014first, in others, but over time, in yourself. This will teach you who you are\u2014IF you are honest! That is the hardest part. But, again, awareness is the key. Just my having raised the suggestion that human nature\u2014which you* also have\u2014is at its base, deceitful, to the point of being able to deceive itself\u2014and suggesting (as I do now) that you have the power to choose to be honest\u2014plants a seed that will grow unless you decide (consciously or unconsciously) to kill it. Summary It is my contention that human nature without deliberate improvement is\u2014like water\u2014the same wherever it exists. And knowing what it is basically \"made of\" enables one to not only predict how other humans will behave under certain conditions, but also to know themselves and, where desired, to change themselves. As a programmer, I understand you can't fix flaws you can't identify. But then, neither will you even look to identify flaws if your ego leads you to think your code is already perfect, or \"good enough.\" And, while not most are bold enough to think (or, at least, to say out loud) they are perfect, certainly most of us think we are \"good enough.\"** Not that we should be miserable by being down on ourselves. But surely there is benefit to knowing ourselves and a reason one might question it. This answer is given for the benefit of any reader who is still discovering who they are and could use a little advice.  * The rhetorical you, throughout; as applicable. ** Because someone will get the wrong idea, I am not advocating self-loathing, perpetual guilt, or trying to live up to others' expectations here. So, please, don't anyone start down that avenue. If you're happy with yourself, I'm happy for you. But then that means you have a pretty good handle on who you really are. ",
