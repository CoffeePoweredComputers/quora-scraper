            "answer_text": "Of course - simply download the Kindle app from Amazon (a google search will find it immediately). This can work on pretty much any device, but for me is most comfortable reading on a tablet, but a phone is almost as good and more portable. Any Kindle books bought automatically appear on your registered app. Even better if you are reading at home on a tablet and then open the same book on the train to work the app will take you to where you left off on the other device.
