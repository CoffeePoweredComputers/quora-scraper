            "answer_text": "Hi. Reading does improve vocabulary. If your are a beginner, you can start reading some short stories and proses. As you gradually increase your interest in reading, you can try reading books of different categories such as fiction, non fiction, biographies, tech etc. In my opinion, as you come across a new word, try understanding the meaning of the word through the sentence context. Mark the word with a pen or a pencil if you like. Then you can easily look up the word in a dictionary. I generally use a dictionary app to find meanings of words which I don't know. You can also read newspapers and magazines to improve your reading habits and vocabulary. Hope it helps :) ",
