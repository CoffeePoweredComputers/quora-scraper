            "answer_text": "Yes almost it's enough to prepare geography with NCERT it helps you but with that, I suggest please refer any other reference books as well it helps you to understand concepts and topics clearly. Regarding geography in UPSC, it is mostly a static subject. But it needs to be understood that this static information should be clubbed with dynamic portion of the study i.e. current affairs. So, I recommend you to complete the NCERT book study in initial stage of your preparation. Then as and when you study and read current affairs, relate them to the static geography you studied. This will help you a lot in both preliminary and mains exam. Now, wether just NCERT suffice or not? See no-one knows what questions will be set in UPSC exam. Trend is to club static with dynamic study. So, complete NCERT then club with the dynamic study of UPSC. Do read the standard prescribed book i.e. G.C.LEONG for geography to on a safe side. Watch videos on an online platform like Toppr: the better learning App if you visit Toppr website you will get different videos for UPSC preparation and it's totally free and useful for students. I hope my answer helps you. Thank you \ud83d\udc4d ",

            "answer_text": "For Geography prelims NCERTs are sufficient and if you enough time go for following books : G.C Leong part 1 and 2 (highly recommended).Khullar for Indian Geography.The above 2 are good books to refer but if you have time constraint don't worry NCERTs are more than enough but be thorough with them revise more especially these two books : Physical Geography of 11th standard.India : Physical Geography 11th standard.Instead of reading more books for same subject revise more times with limited books. All the best :) ",
