            "answer_text": "Don't purchase books without reading books you have with you, you can't even complete one book. So let's say you chose one book and decides to read it, but after reading ten pages or something you'll find it boring. You'll choose another book and you won't enjoy that book. It's goes on and on like a cycle. So here's my advice- don't purchase a book without reading previous books. But you can read, select a book you like. Start reading that book, you'll find it boring and you'lll get tempted to read other books but don't. Even if you find the book boring just don't stop reading it. That's it. ",
