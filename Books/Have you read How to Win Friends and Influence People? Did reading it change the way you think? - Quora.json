The book dates back to the 1930\u2019s so the language and some of the concepts are definitely getting a bit dated. But, I think that book, like any book, has some useful messages for the reader. I read it quite recently and I still think it is a useful book. Is it the best book ever? certainly not, but there is good stuff in there if you are willing to be open minded. ",
