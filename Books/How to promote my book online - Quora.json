            "answer_text": "Here are the few steps you can use to promote your book online: 1. Prioritize Your Goals You won\u2019t be able to do everything on your own. Think about what you really want to accomplish by promoting your work and focus your efforts there. Increasing sales is a common objective, there can be any other goal also, Write down your goals so you can hold yourself accountable to them and track your progress. 2. Define Your Audience Now that you\u2019ve figured out your goal, you\u2019ll need to decide who you are interested in speaking to. This will help you focus your plan of action even further. Oftentimes, quality matters more than quantity, and it\u2019s better to reach 5 people who are already interested instead of 500 who will find it irrelevant. Once you\u2019ve determined who you want to advertise to, think about where these people are most active. What tools and platforms are they already using? 3. Pick Your Channel Once you decide who you want to reach, start thinking about how you are going to reach them. Is it through long-form blog posts on your own site where people can leave comments and questions? A short and quippy email newsletter that directs people to your site? A curated Instagram feed that offers a unique peek into your creative process and builds your reputation as a maker? Are there any online forums that are widely used and respected by your target audience that you can contribute to? Remember to keep in mind the objectives you\u2019ve set for yourself in Step 1. 4. Create a Steady Flow of Content Using your online presence to make announcements and advertise discounts and sales to your loyal audience can be a great way to boost sales and increase traffic. Make sure to share plenty of engaging content that is genuinely interesting to your audience. It builds goodwill for your personal brand and can help establish you as a thought leader in your industry. Additionally, if you do offer a special promotion or discount, it will stand out even more. 5. Start a Conversation No matter your objectives and priorities, finding like-minded people who you have common interests with, will help you build relationships that will help you promote yourself online. Are there any groups or forums that are relevant to your work? When possible, make sure you\u2019re commenting and giving feedback on other people\u2019s work, and not just waiting around for people to reach out to you. Conversations are a two way street, and people may be more inclined to respond than initiate a conversation with you out of the blue. As you can see, there are many different ways to approach promoting yourself online. It doesn\u2019t all have to be about popularity contests and data analytics. If you fell doing all this tasks by yourself will be difficult for you, in that case you can reach out to any of the leading self publishing house like BecomeShakespeare and avail their services. ",

            "answer_text": "When you take the time to write, edit, and design a book, it\u2019s easy to get wrapped up in the to-do list and never stop to think about marketing until a few weeks before your publication date. This is a big mistake for self-published authors! While this is one of the last steps in our self-publishing process, we highly suggest that you begin thinking about your marketing strategy during the writing process. Building an author platform doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Consider the following tactics to market your book: Author Website It\u2019s important to have your own website when you publish a book. This lends credibility to your name as an author and is a great place for readers to go to learn more about you, your book, your events, and more. If you hope to create an engaged audience over time, a website is the first step. Social Media If you aren\u2019t already on social media, then it\u2019s time to look at creating some social accounts. You don\u2019t have to be active on all social channels. Pick two or three that you enjoy\u2014but make sure you ask yourself, where are my readers? If you wrote a young adult novel, you won\u2019t have success promoting it on LinkedIn. Consider the demographics of each channel before devoting your time and energy to it. Author Events Whether it\u2019s your book launch party or an author reading, events are a great way to connect with readers in your community. Bookstores and libraries are great options, but you should also think outside the box. What other venues might want to feature your book? If you wrote a cookbook, perhaps there\u2019s a local winery or brewery where you can pair some of your tasty food with some local beverages. Marketing your book can be fun when you take the time and effort to understand your audience but at the same time it is very difficult for an author to do this activities, so if you are also facing this issues then you can take professional help from any leading publishing house like Becomeshakespeare and avail their service ",

            "answer_text": "Promoting your book before its published will help you to ensure that there are readers ready to buy the book during its launch and beyond. If you are in the process of writing your book, you should have already started thinking about the promotion of your book. Book marketing is crucial to a book's success. Ideally, you should start promoting your book when you begin writing. While it can take up to two months for your book to be published, that's how much time you'll need to find and attract readers who will buy the book when it's released. Below are the few things you can do to promote your book: 1. Establish Your Online Expert Presence The first step to setting up your base as an author should be your website that showcases you as the subject matter expert or fiction writer that you are. When appropriate, it should also showcase your book. Having a blog on your website helps to engage readers and keep them posted on your work. You should always keep in mind that your goal is to attract readers to your book, so you want to create content related to your book's topic 2. Tend to Your Author Platform You should use several ways to find and reach your readers. Your major Ideas should be to expand your author platform include social media; speaking or guest appearances on TV, radio, or podcasts; and events such as book fairs or conferences on the topic of your book. You should have a plan, to reach readers, and regularly engage in it. A blog that hasn't had a post in six months or a Twitter feed with only a few Tweets won't help you grow your platform. 3. Cultivate Fans for Viral Marketing Readers are more likely to believe a book is great if they hear it from a trusted source over the author. You don't just want to find and attract readers; you want to build fans who will promote your book and make it go viral. 4. Find Professional Help If you are new to the book writing industry, you might want to consider looking for the professional help from any leading self-publishing house like BecomeShakespeare to help promote your book.

The time to think about promoting your book is before it comes out. Here\u2019s how to do it, with book promotion lessons learned from bestselling authors who\u2019ve taken matters into their own hands. 1. The Old Guards are Gone. Here\u2019s What to Do Instead Steven Pressfield, acclaimed author of The Legend of Bagger Vance (among many others), also wrote a book for first-time authors looking to hit it big. The title? Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t.  I\u2019m sure your book is fantastic. But I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say it\u2019s not going to get the Oprah\u2019s Book Club sticker. But that\u2019s ok. You don\u2019t need her. You don\u2019t need Oprah. (I know you\u2019re reading this Oprah, so just go with me on this). What used to be the norm for book promotion isn\u2019t anymore. Instead, a targeted, niche approach will see more results than a traditional \u201cthrow it at the wall and see what sticks\u201d campaign. Michael Ellsberg learned this firsthand after trying out the old ways first: Radio interviewsNational mediaAnd an email blast to a miniscule listEven after all this, his book didn\u2019t break the 1,000 rank marker on Amazon. But then his 4-Hour Work Week buddy, Tim Ferriss, came along. Tim wrote up a blog post featuring Ellsberg and recommending it highly. Within an hour, the book reached 45 on Amazon. It even hit #1 in the Job Hunting and Career Guides section on the site. In the weeks to follow, Ellsberg tried to capitalize on the increased attention, continuing to do traditional press. Nothing, though, was ever able to give him another boost like Ferriss\u2019s post. So why did one simple blog post perform better than weeks of tireless promotion? Ready for the next 7 tips?

            "answer_text": "Selling a book to an existing fan base is easy. While selling a book all together with no existing audience is difficult. So first gathering an audience should be your target. If you have already released the book then too you have to attract audience with other pieces of work or from existing platforms. I'd suggest wattpad for that. Now, to get the numbers rolling you have to start with your friends and family and personally ask them to read and promote your work. I'd suggest you to make a blog and constantly update it with small works on a regular basis. Get that blog to more and more fans. It's time taking but will give you a good and personal platform to promote your books along side your other smaller works. Now, you can also invest in some ads online. They are much cheaper in the advertisement market. These are some basic advices that should get the numbers rolling. Once you get a favourable number of readers, you won't get much difficulty in publishing more works as reader fans are pretty loyal. Best of luck! ",
