            "answer_text": "See first of all , there is nothing to worry about if you are unable to understand HCV . Infact , it is quite normal . If you ask for that one single book which will clear all your concepts , then sorry , even I failed to find one such for myself . Supposing , you are facing the concepts for the first time with no idea of basics , I would suggest you to start with nootan . That book is good only for school level and would in no way help you build the concepts . But , definitely when you start solving the basic questions , you will gain confidence. That is the reason , why many go for Universal self scorer also. In the next step , go for D C Pandey . One of the best books one can afford ! If you have some teacher to guide , then do take his help to understand the basic idea behind every question ( instead of just applying formulae) .Clear all ur doubts. Only then , jump on to HCV. In that too , you may find the theory to be a bit complex . But then again , NO NEED TO WORRY . You actually don't need theory for physics. Consult the questions only . Think and imagine . HOPE THAT HELPS . CHEERS! ",

But to solve the questions you have to be good in theory and for that youcan start from SL Arora, Pradeep, coaching notes. hope you can make it ",
