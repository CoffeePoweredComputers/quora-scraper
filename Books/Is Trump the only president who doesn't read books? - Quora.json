            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Unfortunately, President Trump is representative of a \u201cnew normal\u201d. I am a huge reader (B&N celebrates when I walk in as well, Jane Seno!)\u2014I read to my son while he was in the womb and well into his tweens\u2014he just never learned a love of books. My husband went to parochial school from 1st thru 12th and he gripes that students were required to complete a reading list every summer with the number of books increasing each year\u2014between senior and junior year, they had 100 books they had to read and write a report on. He claims this is why he doesn\u2019t enjoy reading. Yet both the men in my life can intelligently discourse and debate on any number of subjects thanks to the magic of the internet. My husband visits at least five information sites each morning as he gulps down his coffee. My son will, as he complains, fall down the rabbit hole of Google when he\u2019ll look up one fact, then be led to the next, and the next, and the next. So, painful as it is to me that they don\u2019t love to join me curling up on the sofa in front of a roaring fire with the both of us looking up to share a witty moment or especially well-written sentence from our respective books (my long-ago fantasy of my future marriage), I certainly don\u2019t consider them less intelligent or thoughtful than myself. (In fact, I have to boast: my son just completely rebuilt a 1970 Camaro, from installing a rebuilt engine to completely re-painting it just from watching Youtube videos!) If you think about it, today\u2019s technology probably places more information at a person\u2019s fingertips than if you had access to every book in the Library of Congress. Still, it makes me sad for people who don\u2019t have that moment of joy when they open a brand-new book. ",

            "answer_text": "Supposedly George Washington wasn\u2019t a good reader, but read he surely did as that was pretty much the only way to get information back then. But otherwise, all presidents up to Trump not only could and did read, many of them had favorite authors, favorite books, or were otherwise strong readers. So, yes, Trump is not \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d He is the first non reader. ",
