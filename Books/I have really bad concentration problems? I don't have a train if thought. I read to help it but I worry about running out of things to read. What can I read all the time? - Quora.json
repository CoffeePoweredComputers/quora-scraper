            "answer_text": "If I'm understanding correctly, reading is a way to help you build up concentration skills - that is an awesome way to train your mind and build a framework! The great angle is here is you can never run out of interesting finds to keep you busy. Perhaps, the concern of \u201crunning out of things to read,\u201d is more a manifestation of anxiety and another thing you are finding distraction in. A good goal would be to strategize your interests and goals; I just ordered a book on fossil and rock identification as I love digging around creeks and the woods. I am engaged as the interest is there and excitement of possibilities is there. It's also an endless field to read about. I have a hard time focusing, as well. You can also find many free books online; openlibrary.org, manybooks.net, Project Gutenberg - just do a quick google search. Some do charge a monthly or x amount fee. I fell in love with a series by Piers Anthony - the magic of Xanth. It was my father's collection. I would sometimes spend a whole day reading and there are a lot in the series. Definitely suggest if you enjoy magic and fantasy! Mostly, just follow what you love and build an awareness while reading - feel how it feels to be engaged. Is there a spot you read better in? Does it need to be quiet? Etc. When you feel less focused/engaged, note the environment. Try to recreate what works and eliminate those negative impacts. You can also create rewards for reading material less engaging; if I read x amount, I can do y. This way you can read more things, even if less interesting to you, which will open opportunities and help train your mind to focus. Good luck and keep exploring! ",

Try science fiction, fantasy, thrillers, mysteries etc. You will have no problem concentrating on what you\u2019re reading if you\u2019re actually interested in it (i would know as I have had ADHD since i was little and used to be terrible at reading\u2014until I started reading stuff I actually enjoyed). If you want to read \u201call the time\u201d try audiobooks. You can listen to them pretty much all the time. They can help you build better skills just like reading, but in different ways. ",
