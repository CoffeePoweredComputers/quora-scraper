It is also highly addictive\u2026. behold the seductive power of that image\u2026\u2026. No wonder those cops are always shooting\u2026.. But good fats like grass fed butter, without the carbs and sugar is absolutely health food (and darn yummy), and salt is also healthy without the carbs & sugar. Both my mood and anxiety improved a lot when I started with a keto lifestyle (well, after the carb addiction withdrawal was over). I am eating mostly fatty meat, eggs, fish, avocados, butter and green veggies now washed down with coffee of course :) ",
