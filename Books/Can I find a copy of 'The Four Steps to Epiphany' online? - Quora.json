Some takeaways: * In the early stages of start-up, focusing on 'execution' will put you out of business. Instead, you need a 'learning and discovery' process so you can get the company to the point where you know what to execute. * Before you can build and sell a a product, you have to answer some very basic questions: 1. What are the problems our product solves? 2. Do customers perceive these problems as important? 3. How many customers do we need to be profitable? 4. What's the average order size? * The ability to learn from missteps in the early days is what distinguishes a successful start-up from those whose names are forgotten. * Don't set-out to prove your product is viable. Set-out to discover if there is a need for your product. * The Four Building Blocks of Customer Creation: 1. Year-one objectives. 2. Positioning: both company and product. 3. Launch: both company and product. 4. Create demand for the product. ",
