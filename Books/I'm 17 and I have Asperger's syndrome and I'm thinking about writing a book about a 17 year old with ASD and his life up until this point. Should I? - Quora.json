            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t matter if you have a certain condition or not. You can write anything you want as long as you want to write it. If you feel as if writing the story is something that you want to do, don\u2019t hesitate to do so. No one will judge you or your story just because you are 17 years old and have Asperger\u2019s syndrome. It is about the quality and the unfolding of how you structure and create your story or book. That is what makes a work of art beautiful. Everyone has a different style and way of constructing their stories or books. What matters is your own unique style and that you express it, not how you have this and this condition. Your condition doesn\u2019t matter when writing books. Even Stephen Hawking wrote a book even though he had ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Don\u2019t let your condition get in the way of writing the things you want to write. You can write anything you want to write. ",

An opportunity to deal with stuff that bothers you , you will feel better after writing about hard stuff for you, if it helps other people, why wouldn\u2019t it help you? Perseverance, just start with 1 page everyday and stick to it. Maybe that will become a well-known book? Don\u2019t take under consideration only the chance to get money. Think about influence on the people that struggle with the same problem as you. ",
