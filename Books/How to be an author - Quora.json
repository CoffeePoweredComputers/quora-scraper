            "answer_text": "Oh, dear. If you write, you are an author, but it appears that you\u2019re talking about becoming a published or professional (or at least semi-professional) author. So here\u2019s what you need to do: First, second, last, and always, work on your technical skills, the mechanics of grammar, punctuation, and all that sort of thing. A lot. Three out of the four sentences you\u2019ve written above contain grievous errors in spelling, punctuation, and/or grammar. Once you\u2019re at the point of writing things what won\u2019t be summarily rejected, consider how you\u2019d like to proceed. Electronic self-publishing is an easy route to take, but not necessarily the best. Places like Smashwords or Amazon will let you put up pieces you want to sell, giving you a chunk of revenues for them in royalties. However, they don\u2019t do anything for you in the way of editorial services or publicity; they\u2019re purely a storefront. You\u2019ll have to hire your own editor (and you will hire an editor; no matter how good you become, only an idiot edits his own material), do your own page layout and cover design, and most importantly do your own marketing, publicizing your work and convincing people to buy it. If you\u2019re not good at marketing, this is probably not a good way to go. The other way is working through traditional publishers. Here, you\u2019ll need to identify publishers who put out the kinds of stuff you\u2019re writing. Someone who publishes self-help books won\u2019t be interested in your mystery novel, and a sci-fi publisher is unlikely to be interested in your articles providing fashion tips. Once you\u2019ve identified potential markets, find their writers\u2019 guidelines. That\u2019s the publisher telling you how to interact with them: what they\u2019re looking for, what they want when you pitch them a book or article, and so on. Basically everyone has those on line these days. Find them, read them carefully, and follow them to the letter. Awards and distinctions you may have won are essentially irrelevant. They\u2019re not buying the fact that you got a Golden Plume Award from the Sioux Falls Literary Society; they\u2019re buying the piece that you wrote. In the interim, search around the web for sites where writers talk about writing both as a craft and as a business. There are any number of places for all levels of skill, interest, and experience (say, Toasted Cheese). And once you get closer to making the move into professional work, Writer Beware is a very useful resource. But that\u2019s quite a way off. First, work on writing. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you become anything in life? You apply yourself and study your craft. Winning writing competitions helps establish your credibility and might give you an edge. Sending your work out willy-nilly and hope, is not the proper way to get things done. Your work will end up in the shredder before the first page is read. The man on top of the mountain didn\u2019t just fall there. He got there one step at a time. Things take time. If you wanted to fly a plane, what would you do? You'd find a ground school and take lessons. If you wanted to play the piano, what would you do? You'd find a piano teacher and take classes. What makes writing any different? Writing is an art, but it\u2019s a learned art. To ask someone how to write a story is like asking \u201cHow do I climb a mountain?\u201d You don\u2019t, unless you\u2019ve had the training. And no, it\u2019s not rocket science, but writing is something that needs to be studied and practiced. Anybody can sit down and write crap. You see it all the time in self pubbed books. Most people will tell you to just start writing, and keep writing, but I don't agree. It's not enough to just write every day if you don't know what you're doing or how to improve something. That just means days and weeks and months of useless writing. It's like not knowing how to knit so you just keep making loops with the yarn. You can't get better, you can't turn that into a scarf ... you have the desire, but you don't know how. I'm going to give you my stock answer that I give everyone who asks me this question. I'm going to give you some good advice on how to learn the craft, and give you a place to send in some of your work when you're ready. In order to write stories that people want to read you will need to understand how to put one together. There is a definite pattern and rhythm to it. And there are certain expectations from the editors and publishing houses as to how your story is laid out. You will need a good imagination, one that can look at a situation and picture all sorts of different scenarios. You need to be able to ask 'what if' and come up with twists and lines that are new and fresh. You will need to be able to research things. For example I wrote a story set in Iran where there was a wedding. I had to research how the wedding would take place, the food, the customs, common Iranian names, clothing, etc. in order to write an interesting yet correct story. Take classes in writing; grammar and punctuation (very important... lots of self published books are swimming in glaring errors and typos), character building, dialogue, plotting, pacing, point of view (POV), inner and outer conflicts, subplots, scenes and sequels, genres, story boards, twists, chapter hooks, suspense, killer opening lines, and satisfying endings. If you're going to write sci-fi you will need to take classes in world building. Each genre of book has its own set of expectations from the reader that you will need to fulfill. For example a murder mystery must have clues for the reader to try and solve. A romance needs a happen ever after ending, known to writers as an HEA. A thriller needs fast pacing and danger. There are classes in short story writing. Where to find these classes? Local community colleges often offer writing classes. My local library has classes seasonally. Best of all there are hundreds of classes you can take on-line. They run about $25-$35 each and range from 2 to 4 weeks. Google on-line writing classes and you will get lots of sites. Try www.oirwa.com or www.savvyauthors.com. They have classes year round. You don\u2019t have to join either one but if you do you get a discount on their classes. Just because a class might be about writing romances, writing is writing; many of the same principles apply to other genres. So don\u2019t hesitate to take a course on character building or writing scenes just because the site caters to romance. There are sites that offer expensive classes, so be careful. I\u2019d recommend starting with a few less expensive ones to see if you really like writing and want to continue. IMO it is not necessary to have a degree or to take an expensive course to write well. Read a lot. Get a feel for how a story is told; how it starts, how it progresses through the story to a satisfying end. See how your favorite author keeps you interested. I don't know your age, but when you are able join some writing groups, even online groups are helpful. Oftentimes these groups offer lectures and classes in writing. They share their work and critique each other. Once you start taking classes and get a good feel for how to put a story together, write some short stories (800 - 1500 words). The more you write, the better you will become. You will make new writer mistakes, we all did. But that's how you learn. I say start with short stories because they are, well short, and don't take years to complete like a novel does. You can share your stories with others and get feedback. Take the feedback and use what you feel is constructive for you and ignore the others. Some people don't give good feedback, or there is a motive behind their negative comments. You have to learn which ones to take and learn from and which ones to disregard. And when you are reading and critiquing other's stories, be kind, give good feedback, and find something positive to say to them. It's hard to hear harsh things about your writing. It's tough love. But it works when you get it and understand why the comment was made and you go and make your piece better because of it. Submitting to contests is another way to get good feedback because the judges are usually editors and agents who have their finger on the pulse of good writing that sells. Once you feel you have written a great short story, be brave and submit it to a magazine that publishes fiction in the genre you wrote. Don't worry about rejections. They will come. Oftentimes it's not because your story is not good, it's because the story doesn't fit their needs. They are running a business after all, and they pick the stories that they feel will best entertain their readers. All authors get rejections. It's part of the 'hunt'. Here\u2019s a place to start submitting. Check out their guidelines carefully. FLASH FICTION ONLINE http://flashfictiononline.com/main/submission-guidelines/ We publish stories from 500 to 1,000 words in length. They\u2019re very short, but they are still stories. That means the best ones have strong, interesting characters, plots, and (to some extent, at least) settings. We\u2019re not that concerned about genre. Many of us have a fondness for science fiction and fantasy, but we also like literary fiction; and in any case, great flash stories aren\u2019t always easily classified. If you wrote it, and you love it, then submit it. No erotica, porn, graphic sex, or violence. Pays $60 per story. Buys reprints at two cents/word. Once you are good enough to sell a few short stories, then you will have the skills to think about plotting out a whole book. ",

Indie publishing, as on Amazon with KDP, is rapidly taking more market share away from traditional publishers. In general, if your writing is good enough to get picked up by a traditional publisher, it\u2019s good enough for people to buy it on Kindle and enjoy it. Find some interviews with Hugh Howey on YouTube. Also look at the reports on AuthorEarnings.com. Five or ten years ago, it was much harder to be successful as an indie published writer, but the industry is changing, and the need to sign a restrictive and low paying contract with a traditional publisher is much smaller now. Plus, if you indie publish online, you can always go the traditional route with a future book if you want. Try publishing your first few books online and seeing what readers say about them. Take that feedback and improve your craft. ",
