            "answer_text": "I was labeled \u201cparanoid schizophrenic\u201d during my first hospitalization. I\u2019ve come to see that this term is subjective, not scientific, and is used to control people, usually with neurotoxins (meds), and often against their will. We need to be careful of words we chose. Labels are harmful. I prefer to hear a person\u2019s experiences. In an 8 year period (1969\u20131977), I was hospitalized 7 times. My last time \u201cin\u201d I made a firm commitment to do whatever it would take to never come back. I stuck with my intention, listening to my inner voice for guidance, not what others told me to do. Persistence paid off. It took a year out of the hospital for me to stay off of meds and another few years of therapy off and on, but since those times, I am thriving. I published a memoir about these experiences, gave some speaking presentations and workshops, and I write a blog and am beginning to do personal coaching. Not sure what you mean by \u201cmanage.\u201d I transformed from hospitalizations to thriving in life, thus going beyond mastery of my negative experiences to actually helping others with problems.

            "answer_text": "Fortunately, I have grown beyond the schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder into sanity. It is a matter of being totally honest with yourself. My ex-husband could not become honest enough to face his childhood abuse. Fortunately, I have been able to resolve my past with forgiveness, gratitude, compassion, and unconditional love and move into maturity and grow up. I have been off all prescriptions for 16 years for a rational mind and sanity. When drugged, I stayed stuck in the past, stopped my emotional growth and I had no feelings. I replaced the medications with the love of the universe and opened my heart to living in love instead of the past fears and abuse. You can not have faith and fear at the same time. There is no illness in the sunlight of the spirit of God. I changed my beliefs, thinking and behaviors to respond in love and that is my reality today. ",
