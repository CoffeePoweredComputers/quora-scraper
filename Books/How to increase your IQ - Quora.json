            "answer_text": "Well, I can give you some anecdotal evidence. My IQ used to not be measurable. For example, on the GRE, I scored 800 on the Verbal (a perfect score) and 790 on the Math (missed one question.) People aren\u2019t supposed to score that high, and I was head-hunted by universities all over the U.S. I flew out to San Francisco, courtesy UCSF, all expenses paid, for several days. It was a lot like a free vacation. I could have gone just about anywhere I wanted, because just about every U.S. university sent me invitations. I went with Vanderbilt\u2019s offer: total free ride, plus $22K/year. No teaching duties, lots of lab (which I wanted). UCSF has great teachers, but they\u2019re all overloaded on mentoring. They also lack lab and office space. Vanderbilt offered higher quality of life. On IQ tests, I would score 180 and above. In that region, the numbers don\u2019t really mean anything any more. Then I got hit by a truck. (Not my fault.) Now I\u2019m just a \u201cregular\u201d genius, with an IQ of about 150 or so. Still score weirdly high on verbal tests. So, those are some credentials. Why was I a genius? Here\u2019s my best bet: When I was very small\u2014about 2 or 3 years old\u2014my mother taught me to read. It was a wonderful childhood imprinting experience. I was on my mother\u2019s lap, she was paying attention to me in all the good ways, and I was very happy. Every lesson was very enjoyable. I believe any average child could be taught to read early this way. Because of the way I was taught reading, and how early I learned to read, a love of reading was instilled in me. Plus, I soon could read about 1,000 words per minute. When I was 5 years old, I would sit on the kitchen table reading the NY Times. That freaked out my uncle\u2014he still tells that story as if it\u2019s remarkable. All my life I\u2019ve always read far more than the average person. I enjoy it. This may possibly be due to early imprinting, but who cares? So, I know more stuff and have a higher vocabulary than most people. I still always win at games like Trivial Pursuit, even though I never play them on my own. Early enrichment is key, I think. Tiny children are little sponges, wanting to soak up as much information as possible. We know by experimenting with mammals, the more you enrich their early environment (starting from birth) , the smarter AND more able to deal with stress they become. So that\u2019s my answer. ",

            "answer_text": "In theory IQ tests measure your speed of learning. You can change this somewhat: In the short term as much as 50% of the difference in IQ between you and another person is environmental and therefore changeable. However, some of this will disappear when you quit doing whatever you did to increase it.In the long term only about 22.5% of the increase remains permanent.Previously I said \u201cA useful thing most people do not think of is to cultivate friends with higher IQ. It will rub off. But only slightly higher, otherwise it will be too difficult to understand their thinking and learn anything from them.\u201d Based on my research, I\u2019d modify that to say you must place yourself in stimulating environments similar to the ones experienced by people with higher IQ. They will probably have higher IQ people in them. There are some issues: You may not spontaneously enjoy these environments, e.g. working puzzles instead of shooting hoops. How badly do you want to increase your IQ?It comes with a cost. Drinking and partying time will have to give way to IQ stimulation. I\u2019m not talking about a small cost either. You know it takes a lot of time in the gym to increase muscle mass. Well, IQ is more difficult by at least 3 or 4 times.You can only absorb efficiently from environments about 20 to 30 IQ points above your own. At 40 points different you won\u2019t understand what is going on.But you can stage it. You can use a first environment to increase your IQ 10 or 15 points, and then move to a higher environment.This means you will be continually outgrowing old friends and needing to make new ones. The number of people who will follow you on your journey is, sadly, zero. You must decide that there are other values in these old friends. But you will not have as much time for them as before, and they will begin to seem parochial and narrow-minded to you, maybe even naive or slow. You will find yourself alienated from all political parties, and unable to participate in committees because they seem intolerably stupid. You will become unable to tolerate your boss or to manage your subordinates effectively. I suggest you become financially independent before embarking on a serious IQ boost.I also suggest you have children first, because IQ is negatively correlated with having children. However, if you do it while your children are young, they will, unlike your friends, come with you. Your spouse may not understand.You will not be able to get a new spouse or girlfriend/boyfriend, so keep the old one. Above 130, there are simply too few people to choose from, most will not share your interests, and the good ones are already taken. It is a whole different world than bouncing around near 100 where you can relate to nearly everyone.Learn to guess other people\u2019s IQ. Just observe the vocabulary they use, what kinds of things they \u201cfigure out,\u201d and ask them if they have ever had an IQ test. Most people will tell you their score, or hint at it. If you are asking people with IQs over 120, they will be happy someone noticed and happy to tell you. After a while you will be able to guess. This helps you accumulate the required friends. It is also an exercise in thinking and learning.Read everything about IQ. Study population genetics. Study the debate on environmental vs. genetic influence in IQ. Read research papers instead of news articles. Learn to guess what an article will say by reading the abstract. Learn short cut simple techniques to guess at the solutions to mathematical descriptions of problems, especially statistics, without getting bogged down in lengthy computations and lengthy texts.If you start from 100, and place yourself in a 130 environment, you can expect to capture half the difference in a couple of years, up to about 115. 130 people are leaders in ordinary life, excellent at professions such as lawyer, or doctor, but not necessarily college professors or researchers. If you then remove yourself from that environment, you\u2019ll drop back to about 107. Instead, while you are still a fresh 115, find a 145 environment, which is productive researchers (college professors who do more than teach, or people at your company who are consistently able to get R&D funding and produce results, or old-timers who have done these things in the past, or managed large facilities, but now have time to talk and reminisce, but be careful you don\u2019t get stuck just talking and not doing). Look for a variety of people with different styles and opinions, not just people who agree with you. Some of these people will be hard to get along with and eventually get annoyed with you and break contact one or more times. Be polite, but not obsequious. After about 5 years you should again cut the difference in half, and your IQ will now be about 130. But if you relax, it will drop back to maybe 110 or less. If you really want to do it, start a third phase. Locate people with IQ 160 or more. This will almost certainly have to be on the internet. You will by now have written a few research papers yourself, and maybe you can join ResearchGate. It has a few members with high IQ, maybe 5%, more than random people on the street. However, I cannot fully report on this phase as I have not [yet] been able to get very far. If you succeed, you should have a temporary IQ of about 145. If you can keep at it, you will keep this IQ until you run out of energy and can no longer remain in the environment. But it\u2019s also possible you may find yourself hooked, unable to quit opening back doors to the universe and figuring out how things work. Here is a test. If the things you figure out are different than you imagined previously, then they are not the low-to-medium IQ ideas. If they are different than the groups you have passed through, they are not the ordinary 120\u2013140 ideas. Keep an open mind and always look for new angles. If you stay stuck on one idea for a long time, you have probably relapsed. One thing about IQ is no matter how well you understand something, you\u2019ll wake up tomorrow with a new understanding and the feeling that you were stupid yesterday. Then you know you are on your way. Good luck! The world needs you, even if they don\u2019t know it. P.S. You may also enjoy Robert Shuler's answer to If the IQ of everyone on earth was suddenly raised by 15 points, would there be a substantial effect on the quality of life; alternatively, what would be the effect if all IQs were lowered by 15 points? or Robert Shuler's answer to What does an IQ of 145 mean?
