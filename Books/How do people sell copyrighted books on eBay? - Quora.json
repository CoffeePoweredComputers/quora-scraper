Not every country has this. In France a fee must be collected for every book sale, even person-to-person. Those fees go to a government fund that pays authors when their works are resold. By the First Sale doctrine exists in the U.S. where eBay is located. ",

            "answer_text": "Copyright means the control of the right to control the making of copies. If you\u2019re selling a copy of a printed book that you bought legally, then you have the right to re-sell that copy, and you are not infringing copyright. If you have an ebook, then the move of that ebook from you to the buyer would involve the creation of a new copy. THAT would infringe copyright. This might not be so, if there were a way to ensure that your own copy were destroyed. There is no such way. ",
