            "answer_text": "No, because there are no \u201chouses\u201d in Vatican City, or to put it more properly, there is no housing market. All of the property of Vatican City is the possession of the Holy See, of the monarchy. Those who live there do so as part of their jobs and are provided with housing, whether it\u2019s the Commandant of the Swiss Guard or those who work in the various curia. Most of those who work in Vatican City, in fact, live in Rome or its suburbs. Vatican City is not a typical city, but a self-contained nation that acts primarily as the headquarters of the worldwide Catholic Church. ",
