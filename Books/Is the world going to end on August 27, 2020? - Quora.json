            "answer_text": "As I have written to others the answer to your question is that the world will end on August 27th, or any other given day for some individuals on this Earth so the answer to the question, for some people, will always be affirmative (or yes). Each of our world, our experiencing the world and life, is tied to our being alive and alert and knowing what\u2019s around us. Everyone, however, dies at some point and on some day therefore for that individual, who dies, their world, their physical existence does end on the day that they experience physical death so for that individual their world did end on the day they died. Your question however seems one tied to some global catastrophe and while, yes, that could always happen the chances that one will experience physical death, thus ending their own life, is far greater than some global catastrophe that would end most all life, if not all life, at one time. So what should we do? LIVE as though we only had a limited time to enjoy this physical life, because we each do have a limited time. Natural death comes one day either from illness or accidents or any other of many causes and most cannot control that happening but at times our lifestyles and life choices can affect that time period that we have to experience human life on earth. Our diet or ways we live our life, the way we drive and chances we take all can contribute to either shortening or extending our lives. Lastly don\u2019t go around worried that the sky will fall or some asteroid will hit and consume the earth for if that was destined to happen there would be nothing (zero) that you could do about it and for people that are affected by such an event the lucky ones would be the ones that would die immediately and die first and not destined to survive and contend with a much slower and agonizing death. Are there things we can do to put off death? NO, death is certain for all humans but there are things we can do to lengthen our lives and add more days to our lives and there are things we can do to add more quality days of living to our lives. One thing we can do is not live in fear but embrace life and make the most of the short time we have. ",

            "answer_text": "All of the prophesies in the Bible have not completely finished. But most of them are past, so we know it is very close. But God set this up so that nobody knows the time, or day, but Jehovah God is the only one who knows. Jesus is not God, so he does not know either. Mark 13:32 \u201cConcerning that day or the hour nobody knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father. Matthew 24:36 \u201cConcerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father. It is clear from the Bible that if people knew they would not be vigilant and not keep with God\u2019s program or put it off. \u201cI can wait until 2020 to repent and be saved\u201d or whatever. The only ones who survive are those doing the will of Jehovah God. And we must be vigilant to the end to preserve our life in God\u2019s new Kingdom. Matthew 7:21 \u201cNot everyone saying to me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.\u201d\u2014 Jesus Christ said that.
