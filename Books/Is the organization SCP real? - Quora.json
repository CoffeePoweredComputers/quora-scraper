            "answer_text": "Surprisingly, the answer is yes. Back in the early \u201960s when ideas about the Cold War were in the forefront of everyone's mind, both the USSR and United States sought game-changing advantages. In America, the solution evolved into increasing the nuclear arsenal and making it cutting-edge. The Russians, however, had a different approach. Through mystical Siberian shaman stories, the leaders at the Kremlin learned of unnatural beings and occurrences that had been taking place all around the world for quite some time. It was their immediate decision to try and harness these things to use as their own secret weapon. Unfortunately for them, these creatures and objects turned out to be almost completely useless to their goal, with some being downright counterintuitive due to their extremely difficult nature to control. When this plan lost its promise, Russian executives decided to send a huge amount of spies into the USA to try and basically piggyback off of any idea or weapon we were already developing. This led to their development of their own nuclear arsenal. But here\u2019s where it gets more interesting. The United States was able to capture at least 4 of the Russian spies, and questioned them brutally. While three of them took their secrets to the grave, the fourth spy ended up giving the Americans everything they wanted. Through this man, they learned of the Russians\u2019 attempt to use unnatural and dangerous creatures to their advantage, and without notifying Congress, the president, John F. Kennedy, ordered the CIA to do whatever it would take to destroy the Russsian mystery program and secure it for his country\u2019s own benefit. After almost 3 years of careful planning, the operation was finally carried out in 1964 under the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson, who was never notified about the actions that would take place because of an order from JFK, who knew that after he was killed, LBJ would want to scrap the program. CIA assets had located the Russian facility, taken out its communication abilities, and with overwhelming force, the facility was stormed and brought under CIA control. Since it was only a matter of time before the Russians sent an army brigade to reclaim the building, the Americans had to act fast. They loaded everything of value or interest to them onto a fleet of cargo planes which took off and brought the materials to an unknown location in South Asia. From there, they were taken to a black site on the western United States, and from there, to the new facility on U.S. soil that would house the new project. The remaining Americans at the Russian facility rigged the place with explosives, destroyed it, and then dispersed into Russia to act as sleeper agents. Back home, the CIA\u2019s unknown board of executives ordered the Director to create a new sub-branch of their agency, with an official name to be determined. The new branch was eventually dubbed TSC for Top Secret Containment, and it quickly disappeared from CIA chatter, all without ever having reached the public\u2019s eyes or ears. Eventually, in the mid \u201890s, somebody got too close to the top-secret facility and was shot on sight, sparking a small community uproar and local news story, which was fed false information, yet still led to a scrubbing of the facility and immediate relocation to multiple new sites throughout the United States and its territories. Some images of the freshly-abandoned facility were spread around by the locals, and with a little amazement and an extreme amount of speculation, over many years the tall tale grew and eventually, the SCP website was born. Here, people from all over the place could expand on this nearly-forgotten story from the recent past and have a bit of creative fun in the process. Nobody is remotely aware of how close they are to the truth. The Top Secret Containment program still exists, albeit under a multitude of new names, and is so discreet that the President, Vice President, Cabinet, and Congress are all blissfully unaware of the struggles and breakthroughs that TSC had made over the years. The work they do is unparalleled in scientific importance, and could hold the key to understanding everything from the Big Bang to the existence of God and religion. You\u2019ll never get to see the things they do, and you'll never see the results of their research, but know deep down that it's all for the greater good. It\u2019s all for the greater good.

            "answer_text": "Yes, but the truth isn\u2019t as interesting as you may think. Created around the middle of the Civil War, The SCP Foundation was originally created to capture members of the Confederacy and torture them in brutal ways to get information out of them, it was shut down after the North won and stayed dormant for about four years until later being used for extra military force. The Foundation hadn\u2019t started actually containing anomalies until the early 1900s when mediums and psychics were all the rage. They lasted for about fifty years until finally being shut down during the Cold War due to a lack of funding and volunteers. Over the fifty years it was active, the Foundation managed to capture a total of seven thousand anomalies, none as cool or as dangerous as the ones we read about today. Some hardcore theorists, however, think that the Foundation is still running today, and is twice as large and secretive as ever. Whether this is true or not, we may never know\u2026 ",
