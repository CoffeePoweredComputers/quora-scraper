            "answer_text": "Any books or Tv series that you see on organised crime is full of people filling bits in or fabrications of some kind. If you are organised crime and you talk about the business interested you are involved in: you die. Unlike big time drug dealers now (who are mainly all snitches or help to get the other heads arrested to take control of their business), the organised crime groups will cut you up for even an insinuation you have snitched. Obviously you have the people in witness protection who have snaked on their once brothers. You can\u2019t do that in LA Eme though, you will get your skin taken off of your bones- literally, you will be flayed (simply to remove the tattoos that you must get to be a member). Now, you might say \u201cwell why don\u2019t these people kill the people on the shows?\u201d Why would they? You have some has-been motor cycle biker who was once a big don of the gang, saying about how they did this, did that, how you don\u2019t fuck with them etc, this guy rolls on his boys for whatever reason, he is still giving them massive notoriety. you have some Mexican gang banger who gets 3 consecutive life sentences and is in solitary confinement because he killed a lot of people for a certain group - notoriety. ~It all says \u201cdon\u2019t fuck with us\u201d Alot of it is bullshit, the truthful one are most likely dead or should be because they are snakes and snitches.

It was useful when it was the only book on La Eme, but now there are several works that are much better, but unfortunately most of them are pricey. ",
