            "answer_text": "How can someone understand what the Bible says if they can't understand the King James version? Actually, the only thing that the Bible says is the teaching of the Catholic Church. The Bible, the New Testament, was written by Catholics in the first century, and then put together from the readings which were used at Mass at the end of the fourth century by Pope St. Damasus I at the Council of Rome (A.D. 380) and Carthage (A.D. 397). He then gave it, along with the Septuagint (the Old Testament) to translate from Greek into Latin as the people no longer spoke and understood Greek. Thus the ONLY way anyone can \u201cunderstand\u201d the Bible is to study the beliefs of the Catholic Church and read the Bible in light of those - as they came first, and the Catholic Church is the ONLY thing which was guaranteed by Jesus until the end of the world. As for the King James Version of the Bible, do not worry about that, it is a pretty bad translation, and is missing seven entire books of the Old Testament, but portions of two others - and those books are the ones that God was using to teach the Jews how to worship without the Temple in Jerusalem. Thus it is those books which Our Blessed Lord uses to explain Christianity in the New Testament, and they are entirely missing in the King James Version. Plus the King James version is based on the anti-Christian Canon the 6th century Jews made up based on the Masoretic text. Nearly all of the quotes in the New Testament are taken from the Septuagint, NOT the Masoretic text, so the KJV is not going to make any sense, even if you could read 15th century English. If you want a complete Bible based on the one that the Catholic Church wrote and guaranteed in the first through the fourth centuries, pick up the Knox Bible - that is a translation of the Vulgate into 20th century English.

            "answer_text": "Tim- There are two parts to your question. The first part is more challenging than the second. The first part is \u201dhow can I understand?\u201d The second part is \u201dare there other Bible translations than the KJV?\u201d I\u2019ll respond to the second first. I\u2019ll assume you are an English-speaking American; if not there are probably similar options in your country or language to what I describe just not the specific recommendations. There are two main types of Bible translations on the market- literal, word-for-word translations, and paraphrases. A translation gives you an English Bible that is very close to what the original Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic manuscripts said. There are many different translations, including the KJV, that do a pretty good job. Each has it's own particular viewpoint; while all will translate the majority of passages using very similar words, they may handle some passages differently. My personal choices are the English Standard Version, New American Standard Bible, and the NET Bible. Paraphrases approach the translation process by capturing the ideas and thoughts in the original text and putting them into current (early or late 20th century American, depending on when the paraphrase was published) American English. This can be an effective way to read the Bible especially for those who struggle with reading. I recommend The Message. As to how to understand what you read in the Bible, the first and most important step is to start with prayer. The Bible is God\u2019s Word, literally. It is His message to humanity. In it He reveals Himself as well as our nature. He shows us our creation, our past, and our future. So each time we read the Bible we ask God to show us what He wants us to see and learn. The Holy Spirit will speak to our spirit to enlighten us. Second, the Bible was written thousands of years ago by multiple authors living in cultures wildly different than 21st century America. As readers we need to put in the effort to understand the historical, cultural, geographic, and spiritual environment in which these 66 books were written. There are numerous apps, books, and websites to help us learn this background info. Third, the original languages of the Bible don't always translate well into English. As just one example among many, there are five separate Greek words to express love. But in our English Bibles we see only one word- love. So when we see \u201dlove,\u201d which of the five Greek words was it? Was it phileo (brotherly love), agape (selfless, sacrificial love), or eros (sexual love)? Just this one example shows that we need to learn a bit of Hebrew and Greek to fully understand the Biblical rest. But don't despair! There are tools to help us!. I recommend the free app and website Blue Letter Bible, where you can find for any verse and any translation, the English words in that verse, the equivalent Greek or Hebrew word for each, a definition of each word, other verses that use that word, and, usually, a short essay on the usage of that word. Fourth, in all reading of any kind, including the Bible, context is critical. Don't read just one verse. Read the whole passage, the whole section which may include a chapter or two. That way you\u2019ll understand the author\u2019s entire train of thought, or you\u2019ll read the whole story. A common problem in reading the Bible is to take verses out of context and misapply them. Avoid that. Fifth, be an active reader. Ask questions of the text. Write down words or names you don't know so you can look them up. Biblical authors didn't have word processors with bold and underline so when they wanted to really make a point they repeated words or phrases or ideas. Two repeats is important (think Jesus in the KJV saying \u201dverily, verily\u201d it in modern translations \u201dtruly, truly.\u201d He is telling His audience to \u201dpay attention, what I'm about to say is important \u201d). Three repeats, which is rare, is hugely important. So look for patterns in the text- repeated words, names, places, ideas. Write those down, too, because they give you clues to the point(s) the author is making.. Sixth, the Bible is made up of many different literary styles- historical narrative, prophesy, figurative, poetry, hymns, theology, and more. Each style needs to be read according to its own rules. Think about a newspaper with different sections- front page news, sports, want ads, entertainment, the comics, the opinion pages, etc. You would not read the front page the same way you would the sports page or the entertainment section or the comics. The Bible is the same in that each style has rules different from the others. In Hebrew poetry, for example, the emphasis is in the middle. The OT book of Lamentations is a poetic lament over the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. It's a painful book to read. But smack in the middle of the book, the very center, is the most wonderful passage, full of glory to God even in the midst of ruin. When you learn the rules the Bible makes more sense. This probably seems like a lot. So start slow. Take it easy. Trust that God will guide and inform you. Find a friend to read with you. Join a Bible study at your church. And have fun! Blessings! ",
