            "answer_text": "3 Ways to Tell If a Diamond is Fake In the diamond industry, there is a number of companies and diamond jewelers who are trying to get a quick buck. And for the untrained eye, it can be quite difficult for one to tell which is which. In this case it is easy for con artists to sell diamonds that aren\u2019t real to unsuspecting consumers. But how does one tell whether or not a diamond is actually fake? The worst thing can happen when dealing with jewelry is buying a piece, pay full value and it being fake. There are ways to combat this with some quick easy tips you can take advantage of at home. these tips will include every day around the house items. Check out three ways one can tell whether or not a diamond is fake: The Heat Versus Cool Test True diamonds are some of the strongest and hardest minerals on the planet. Real diamonds are nearly impossible and are very hard to scratch. That being said, diamonds also won\u2019t crack under intense pressure. For this test, you will need a lighter or some sort of flame and an ice cold glass of water. Simply put a stone over a flame for about 30 seconds when removed from the flame, immediately drop the stone in the glass of cold water. the The swift contraction and expansion of the stone will cause weaker substances such as topaz or quartz to crack from the inside.  If the stone cracks, it is a fake stone. The Sink Test True stones are extremely dense and naturally a heavy material. As opposed to other stones like cubic zirconia, topaz, or the like, diamonds will have a much heavier feel. For this test, your will a glass of room temperature water. If you are dealing with an unmounted stone, simply drop the stone into the glass of water and watch what happens. If the stone drops straight to the bottom it is most likely a diamond. The high density of the stone will cause it to sink. As for other stones, they will most likely float at the top of the glass or sink much slower, floating more towards the middle of the glass. The Fog Test Due to characteristics of a true diamond, heat disperses quickly from a diamond. This test can be done on a mounted stone or a loose stone. For this test, all you will need is your breath. Easy right? Take the stone and place it in front of your mouth. Gently fog the stone like you would do a mirror or a window. If the the stone clears quickly or barely fogs, it is most likely a real stone. Stones that aren\u2019t real will remained fogged for a while and condensation will build up. With a true diamond, even if you fog it rapidly right after each other, a real diamond will not fog up. Those are a few easy ways to tell if a diamond is true or fake. Additionally, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for a certificate of approval! With a certificate of approval it is almost always a true diamond. Proved by the experts themselves! ",

            "answer_text": "Diamond testers aside, there are several ways to spot a fake. All hinge on diamonds' physical properties and the nature of their creation. For me the easiest way to spot a fake is to look at the edges of the facets. Diamonds being the hardest substance will almost always have sharp edges with no dulling (unless tumbled with other diamonds). If the edges of a stone are dull, worn smooth or have excessive chipping then it's not a diamond. Similarly, looking at the girdle will also help distinguish a genuine stone from a fake. A thin girdle with frosted edges is a good indicator of a real diamond. Being inherently valuable, a diamond cutter/polisher will spend time ensuring the stone is properly proportioned to maximize its sale value. Mass produced synthetics have no inherent value so the manufacturer has to churn out as many stones as they can to make the most profit. This usually leads to poorly proportioned rocks with thick girdles and off-shape facets. Inclusions are another way to spot a natural diamond. Having been formed deep in the Earth and surrounded by all sorts of minerals, natural diamonds tend to form with impurities in them. There are all sorts of inclusions ranging from dark spots of foreign minerals and debris, to cloudy veins and microscopic \u201cspiderwebs,\u201d to tiny air pockets - and unless it's internally flawless - all diamonds will have them which gives every stone a unique \u201cfingerprint.\u201d If a gemstone has no inclusions, or only one type consistently, then it's likely a fake. Flawless diamonds are incredibly rare and valuable so they will almost certainly be certified. There's something about the way a diamond sparkles that is \u201cjust right.\u201d It cuts light into ribbons of color and projects it in a dazzling array that is easy to imitate, but difficult to duplicate. CZs are too perky, moissanites are too murky, white sapphires are too muted and crystal is too lifeless. Spend enough time around diamonds and you can tell by the way a gemstone shines if it's genuine or not. Finally, if you happen to have a stone that's chipped or broken you can tell if it's diamond by the way it fractured. Diamonds are crystals with a regular repeating pattern so when they break the surface will be straight and edges will be angular. If it looks like broken glass with a wavy surface then it's not diamond. Now, all my advice here only works on simulants - that is, non-carbon crystals that are intended to imitate a real diamond. It all falls apart when you encounter a synthetic diamond as it\u2019s essentially the same crystal, but its creation is in a lab and not out in nature. Thankfully, most synthetics follow the same rules as lab created simulants in that they tend to be conspicuously free of inclusions or have one type consistently, so if they're not already marked as man-made they'll be found out as such when sent to the lab for certification. Diamonds are extraordinary gemstones. To me, they always used to be just sparkly rocks with interesting properties - which they are - but as I've worked with them and other gemstones I've grown to appreciate just how exceptional and uniquely beautiful diamonds are. Whether it's a cascading ribbon of pave' set stones or a big rock blasting beacons of color, diamonds breathe life into jewelry like none other! ",
