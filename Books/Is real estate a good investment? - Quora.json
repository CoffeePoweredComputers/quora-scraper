            "answer_text": "Is real estate a bad investment? My experience described here are related to residential real estate. I have tried my best to never sell a house (once I need to move, I try to rent it out). I\u2019ve owned real estate since \u201988 and have three rentals. Only in the past couple (maybe three) years have I actually broken even on a monthly basis and actually see a little income. Pros, Cons, other items of interest: I have equity building up for two general reasons:  1) Property values go up over time \u2013 generally speaking, you can count on real estate increasing value with inflation rates (to make it fair, you have to consider at least a decade to alleviate transient ups and downs). Markets do expand and contract, so if you are lucky and buy when low, you can do really well when the market adjusts to its norm. 2) I have tenants that make my payments for me (though in the beginning the rent didn\u2019t cover the entire mortgage and I had to come up with extra out of my pocket, and my first experience, that happened for well over a decade). So, the tenants are paying down my principal balance for me. If you buy when the market is high, and it crashes, you can end upside down. Now, in the long game, no big deal. The only time one would be concerned with something that\u2019s upside down is when it\u2019s time to sell. Otherwise, just keep making the payments as usual. I\u2019ve got three rentals plus the home I live in (so we\u2019ll talk four properties) and I\u2019ve experienced two times when I bought low and two times when I bought high. Buying high is painful, when the market dies down, rents go down and it\u2019s tough to cover the mortgage. Risks \u2013 there are plenty and you have to budget for them. The downstairs neighbor on my first property enjoyed a period of five months when my unit was vacant (that was painful) and started spreading rumors to prospective tenants (like someone committed suicide in my unit). When I finally did find a tenant, they tried to break the lease within weeks because of this rumor. The downstairs neighbor also filed a bunch of bogus complaints (noise, etc.) against my tenant to chase them out. A nicely written letter from a lawyer resolved those issues, and I was ready to take her to court. Still, repairs pop up unexpectedly (fence needs replaced, toilet bowl broke, laundry machine broke and needs replaced, hot water tank needs replaced, list goes on and on and on). Eventually things need remodeled, carpet replaced, update kitchen cabinets, etc. I said earlier that I\u2019m actually making money for the first time in decades, but that\u2019s also because nothing major has happened recently. Tax breaks \u2013 One of the early benefits I realized was I could write everything off (even the lawsuit on the first real estate purchase that I won\u2019t go into details in this post, just say it was long and very expensive). Plus, you get to depreciate the property for extra savings. HOA fees, deductible when renting, but not if you are occupying. This was what pretty much saved me for the first several years of renting a unit out, I was living pretty thin at that time. Now \u2013 well, with all the tax rules and such, I can\u2019t claim much of any breaks because of my income. I am collecting deductions that carry over from year to year, so when I retire and my income goes down a lot, then I can start claiming these deductions. Point is, tax breaks (based on rentals) basically don\u2019t work for people that established decent incomes. Vacancy \u2013 I touched on this one already. Vacant units hurt, as there\u2019s no income but I still have to pay expenses (mortgage, HOA fees if applicable, some utilities as you can\u2019t turn off electricity if showing to prospective tenants). My unit in California is often tough to fill (some due to the neighbor downstairs) so I offer first off half month\u2019s rent to get it occupied quickly. I also try to stay a little bit under market rent to keep the places vacant. Expenses \u2013 I\u2019ve already touched on this, but damn, property taxes just keep going up every year. What little profit I may be seeing now would have been wiped out with this year\u2019s round of property tax increases. Luckily, the rental market price has also increased so I bumped my rents to compensate for the tax increase. Resort properties \u2013 If you are looking into rentals as an investment, stay the hell away from resort properties. I have a unit at Snowshoe WV (ski resort). Through some maneuvering (because the mortgage company seemed very incompetent), I moved the principal balance to another rental of mine and got the deed free and clear of any loans. Now, without any mortgage payment, you\u2019d think I\u2019d be making money hand over fist with this unit (well, at least during winter). I\u2019m lucky if I break even, last year (2015/2016 season) I took a bath, there was no snow for the busiest part of the season, my income was halved. The HOA dues just increased to over $600 a month because the county figured making us pay for their sewer system is better for everyone than maintaining our own septic tank. Also, I get soaked for Mountain Top Assessments (I actually get to pay for plowing and other community services to Intrawest). I let Intrawest rent my unit for me and they take 25% of any rental income. I also have to pay for housekeeping (changing the sheets, etc. between guests) and that generally sucks up about 10% of my rental income. Though not 100% related to resort property risks, I do have to mention that I bought it at $139k and it\u2019s now worth $80k. When the financing market crashed, they installed a rule that any \u201ccondotel\u201d (half condo, half hotel, these units have to have someone occupying the front desk to deal with guest requests so it\u2019s classified as a \u201ccondotel\u201d) can no longer be financed. When no one can get a loan to buy a condo, guess what happens to the prices? So, why in the hell do I have this unit? Because I like to ski and I use the unit a lot. I have taken a bath on it (mostly due to the market crash there) but maybe in another decade, it\u2019ll pay off for me. Want a better investment? Stay away from resort properties. I\u2019m within 10 years of retirement, my assets are about $1.5M for retirement. Almost $1M is stocks (retirement fund), the rest actual equity I have in real estate. 10 years from now, I figure the property equity will be significantly more (even assuming no market increase, principal still being paid off by tenants). TLDR: Real estate can work out, but generally speaking, it\u2019s going to take at least a decade (on average) before you realize much in value of owning/renting real estate. You could get lucky and end up buying low and see the market go up, but you just don\u2019t know what the future will hold. Is it better to take your money and invest in stocks? Maybe, depends on your risk appetite. ",

            "answer_text": "I run a quantitative investment advisory firm, so I make money when my clients do NOT invest in real estate and put their money with my firm (and my firm as has done well: our large-cap strategy has almost doubled the returns of the S&P 500 over the past 12 years net of fees). That said, I am also a fiduciary, which means that by law, I must put my clients\u2019 need first (ahead of my own best interests), which is often not the case for many advisers. Simple, back of the envelope calculations would suggest real estate is an excellent investment. Let\u2019s say you put 20% down on a $10MM property ($2MM). If your investment appreciates at the rate of inflation (as real estate tends to do over the long term), which we might suggest is around 3% (long-term average\u2026recent low inflationary environment not withstanding), your $10MM investment would be worth $10.3 MM after a year. That\u2019s no big deal, but you\u2019ve only invested $2MM in this property, so your returns are leveraged 5:1 (10MM/2MM). Said another way, your 3% magically becomes 15% due to leverage. {The math is this: your original mortgage is still in place\u2026$10MM less the $2MM down. However, your property appreciated 3% to $10.3MM, so your new equity is now $2.3MM \u2014 $10.3 - $8MM mortgage. Your ROE is 15%: ($2.3MM - $2MM)/$2MM). The downside is just as leveraged, which is why the mortgage crisis happened. However, real estate tends not to be as volatile as the stock market and if we are talking about long-term trends, leverage tends to work in your favor. If anybody in the stock and bond investing world suggests that they can return 15% annually long-term, I\u2019d run (even Bernie Madoff only promised 9\u201310%.) That said, there are costs associated with this investment. 30-year mortgage rates are roughly around 3.5% and real estate taxes are often another 2%, so there is over 5% off the returns right off the top without any maintenance considerations, etc. On the other hand, one could leverage the property more than 20% down, which would amplify the returns all the more. The bottom line that I often ask my clients is, \u201cDo you want to be in the real estate management business that is illiquid and can be time consuming?\u201d, as opposed to investing, which is extremely liquid and requires little time with the right adviser.
