They accept, adjust and get on in their new normal. You are unlikely to be a highly popular person but the opinion of others and affirmation from people who matter little to you doesn't add much to your quality of life. Some people don't even need others. They are just bonded to their dog or cat and enjoy superficial interaction when it comes. It is normal to want friends but don't let others define your self esteem. Accept your condition will weed some people out but that does not make you any less valuable. We can't be all things to all people and everyone else's opinion is not all that important. Enjoy the people you do have in your life \ud83d\ude42 ",
