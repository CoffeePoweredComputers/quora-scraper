            "answer_text": "During most of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry is seventeen years old. Unlike Ron and Hermione, he doesn\u2019t turn eighteen because the final battle occurs on 2 May 1998 while his birthday is on 31 July. The epilogue takes place nineteen years later on 1 September, making the year 2017. At this point, Harry already had his birthday that year so he is thirty-seven years old. ",
