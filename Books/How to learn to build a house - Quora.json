            "answer_text": "Well, I built my own house. Here\u2019s how I learned: Start by thinking you know more than you actually do and wait until you\u2019re in way too far over your head before you realize it. That way there is no backing out. You\u2019re either going to learn or go bankrupt. It\u2019s great motivation!!Don\u2019t keep close track of your costs and be wildly optimistic about how much the whole thing is going to cost. You\u2019ll quickly find out how much your relatives love you when you hit them up for thousands of dollars.Hire people solely based on cost to save money. Learn valuable skills as you re-do the work of incompetent people. That whole quality thing is totally overrated!!And finally, learn from all your horrible mistakes. In the end you will have your home and you will have gained some valuable expertise in the process. Hey, it worked for me! ",

Those of us who could have spent a lot of time learning about the process and could not have done so (at least not well) when we were first starting out. The only way is to to learn a whole lot about it as well as what parts you don't want to learn and will job out to experts (such as plumbing and wiring). Keep in mind that building a house well requires experts in numerous trades each of which takes a long time to learn and years to master. ",

I got into good shape and I no reason to watch TV or go to the movies because my life was exciting every single day! It took me 5 years until we were finished. ",

Learn what you can live with and what you can live without. The costs add up quickly. Plan for delays, changes, and extras.
