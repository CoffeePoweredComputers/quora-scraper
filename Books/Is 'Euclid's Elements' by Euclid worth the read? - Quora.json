            "answer_text": "Yes definitely, if you have the slightest interest in how we came to know what we know about mathematics, or want to be challenged in the ways of mathematics. The first \u201cbook\u201d is a stone classic, for here is proved Pythagorean Theorem (and its converse). Where is there a more elegant progress of statement built on top of statement until at last one can prove the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is indeed the sum of the squares of the two sides. And non-Euclidian geometry merely enhances this work, for it is Euclid\u2019s Fifth Postulate that is required for the Pythagorean Theorem. But much of the work in Book 1 avoids that Parallel Postulate, so until that postulate is invoked, the results would apply to a non-Euclidian geometry, for example the surface of a sphere. And of course the Elements includes another twelve books. Here are proved (among many other things) that there is no largest prime number, a masterpiece of simplicity and elegance. Green Lion Press recently published a 1 volume edition of Euclid\u2019s Elements, as translated into English. They retained the original Heath translation, which (to me) includes a lot of very odd English. But the editors make a strong case for retaining the original wording. And even when the statement of the proposition can be obscure, the presentation of a concrete example usually clarifies everything. And after a while one just gets use to this odd use of English. Euclid\u2019s Element pretty much contained everything relating to mathematics that was known into the Renaissance. Individuals - Archimedes, Apollonius, Diophantine did go beyond Euclid, but only in the 16th century did mathematics really begin to transcend Euclid\u2019s work. It\u2019s no surprise that the Elements have been \u201cin print\u201d for some 2300 years. Thanks for reading. ",
