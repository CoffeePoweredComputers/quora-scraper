            "answer_text": "My mother bought the first book when I was 9 years old. I tried reading it but I felt that it was too tough and boring and a fat book. I tried again next year. Same problem. But while I was in my sixth grade, I saw the Chamber of Secrets movie in television. And I found it to be very interesting! So, I started reading Philosopher's Stone and it was very interesting too. I then became a Potter fan. In that year I read the first four books in one go.  And slowly I finished the series. I also saw all the movies. Even my parents were astonished to see a drastic change in my behaviour . Thank you and don't forget to upvote! \ud83d\ude09 ",

But I think that Harry Potter for the ages of 7/8 till any age living but it depends that the person's vocabulary should be well enough.  I love it \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d ",
