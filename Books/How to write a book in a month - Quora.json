            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. You\u2019ve already gotten some really good answers, but I\u2019ll see if I can add anything of value. Writing is different for everyone. Some people already write a book a month. It comes naturally to them. Some flat out can\u2019t write more than one a year or so. They just don\u2019t have it in them. For not being physical labor, writing books can be taxing and difficult. The main thing is to actually write. Not stare at the screen, not listen to the song on the radio, not play solitaire or minesweeper (did I just date myself with that?), but actually write. The more you know what you are going to write, the faster it will go. This is why some people love outlines. Besides, if you are doing \u201cexploratory writing\u201d, or making it up as you go, you can write yourself into a corner (with fiction) or lose focus on your topic, and then you will have to spend a lot more time fixing it. If you really want to get done quickly, do your research in advance, make an outline, and make sure you know what you want as a final result. Once those things are done, you can sit down and write it quickly without constantly stopping to figure out what you need to do next. And you need to not binge watch on Netflix instead of writing. Really. It seems that our brains only have so much creative energy in a day, and if you use it up on other things, like video games, you probably won\u2019t go back to writing for the day. Save all the \u201cother\u201d things you want to do for when you have finished writing for the day. I hope that helps, and I wish you luck. A book in a month is achievable, but not easy. ",

One of the best, to-the-point books I\u2019ve read on writing a book fast and also building a business is Hustle. Get it n Kindle. It\u2019ll help you get started, I promise you. One key thing you\u2019ll have to do to write a book in one month, given you\u2019ve already decided what it is going to be on, is to set aside time every day to write. Do nothing else, but write.
