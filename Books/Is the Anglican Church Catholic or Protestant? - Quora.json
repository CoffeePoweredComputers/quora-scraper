            "answer_text": "It is both. In that it was formed in protest at Papal authority in the 16th century, its is still a church which recognises the two major and five lesser sacraments, is highly liturgical,and is governed by bishops. The creeds, or articles of belief, of the Anglican Communion, which includes the Episcopalian church in the US and numbers about 100 million active members worldwide, includes the words \u201cAnd I believe in One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.\u201d However, the Anglicans are a much broader or diverse church than most. We have some individual churches or even provinces where the services are quite evangelical in nature, with greater emphasis on preaching and corporate prayer. This tends to be the case where the Roman Church is stronger. At the other end of the spectrum there are churches (often called High Anglican) which adhere more to the latter Oxford Movement, which emphasise the sacraments, the regular receiving of the Eucharist, where vestments are regularly worn, there is Reserved Sacrament in a tabernacle, and there is greater ceremony involved in the daily liturgy. Anglicans differ with Romans over issues such as Transubstantiation, Mary's assumption or her perpetual virginity or her immaculate conception. We differ from Protestants in holding that our priests are of the Apostolic Succession, as are Roman priests, in that there is a physical hand-to-hand continuation in ordination of priests going back to St Peter. On balance, the Anglicans are a hybrid communion, strictly speaking being Protestant, but retaining most of its Roman traditions and doctrine. Only Anglicans are recognised by Rome, since the decree of Pope Paul VI, to be able to receive the sacrament of Communion in Roman churches when no Anglican churches are available. On the other hand, via the Parvo Agreement, Anglicans are in full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran churches, with the Old Catholic Church, and with a couple of smaller liturgical protestant churches. So, take your choice. Are we Protestant, yes, but we don't protest too much. Are we Catholic, certainly, but we accept no opinion of any human on any issue as being infallible. As the English saying goes, \u201cYou takes your money and you makes your choice\". Personally, I don't think it matters how we are labelled, only how we behave. ",

            "answer_text": "The Anglican Communion tries to be both Protestant and Catholic at the same time. From the very beginning the 39 Articles left room for doctrinal dissent. Formulae were devised somewhat ambiguously to leave room for disagreement within the one umbrella organisation, with the Sovereign sat on top. Let me give an example. At the epiclesis, the calling down of the Holy Spirit upon the bread and wine, in the Anglican Eucharist, the minister says: \u201cLet this bread and wine be for us the body and blood of your Son Jesus Christ.\u201d The equivalent Catholic Eucharistic Prayers say \u201cbecome\u201d rather than \u201cbe\u201d. The Catholic prayers ask for an objective transformation of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ. The Anglican prayers leave it open. They could mean the same as the Catholic prayers, or they could mean merely \u201cLet this bread and wine be considered/represent for us the Body and Blood of Christ.\u201d In other words, the Eucharistic species are a symbol of Christ\u2019s Body and Blood, but not the reality. The Oxford Movement tried to interpret the 39 Articles in as Catholic a way as possible, but John Henry Newman\u2019s Tract 90 was censured by the bishops. This provoked his eventual move into the Roman Communion, because it brought home to him more strongly the innate Protestantism of Anglicanism. Another example: ask an Anglican Vicar how many Sacraments there are. You could get the answer 2, 3, 5 or 7, moving from Low Church Protestant to High Church Anglo-Catholic. A Catholic priest friend of mine did this at an ecumenical meeting with several Anglican clergy. None of them wanted to answer, because inevitably several of their colleagues would immediately have disagreed with them. The national Anglican Communion Churches also vary considerably. Those in Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda keep much more tightly to Biblical morality, and are on the whole more evangelical. Canada and the USA Episcopalian Churches are uber-liberal, with blessings of gay marriages and gay bishops etc. The Archbishop of Canterbury is expected to preside over the whole Communion, and can only do this by adding massive quantities of fudge to the mixture. This is not working fully. The African Churches and others have joined GAFCON and redefined Anglicanism as remaining faithful to the historic Anglican formulations of doctrine and practice, rather than as being in communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go through Canterbury to get to Jesus,\u201d as one Nigerian Archbishop put it. Historically the Anglican Communion has produced excellent scholars, writers and poets: C.S.Lewis, Eric Mascall. T.S.Eliot, and the many High Church vicars who did sterling work in poor areas of the English cities and built superb Victorian churches. The Catholic Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham has made it easier for many of them to move into full communion with Rome, while retaining some of their Anglican heritage. ",
