            "answer_text": "To write anything\u200a\u2014\u200aa story, a report, or a book\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have to know why you are writing it. As a novelist, you have to hone in on the event that brings the story into being and why your reader should care. That why is the question at the heart of every novel. The Heart of Your NovelThe why is one of the first things readers look for when we pick up a story. We look for the why in those first pages and generally find it in the inciting incident of the story. No inciting incident, no clear reason for why we should keep reading, and agents, editors, and readers will simply stop reading. Why read Your First Fifteen Pages? Because you want to develop a solid foundation for your novel and move beyond the agent\u2019s slush pile. Why read The Firm? Because we\u2019ve all had the experience of something sounding too good to be true and we want to know if this is one of those times. Why read The Husband\u2019s Secret? Because we all know someone who\u2019s had a secret, they didn\u2019t want revealed. Why read The Hunger Games? Because we\u2019re curious about what it would be like to fight to the death and if we would have the wear-with-all to survive. Why read Harry Potter? Because we want to believe magic exists, and see good triumph over evil. Why read The Invention of Wings? Because we are still trying to wrap our heads around slavery, why it lasted for as long as it did, and what finally brought about its demise. There are a million other reasons why we read fiction. Here are just a few more\u200a\u2014\u200abecause we want to know what it is like to be a spy, fight for someone\u2019s freedom, discover a treasure, change identities, fail and finally succeed, find true love, come back to life\u2026the list goes on and on. The WHY of The Husband\u2019s SecretFor many writers, the why of a story comes from a place of natural curiosity. Before Liane Moriarty wrote The Husband\u2019s Secret, she stumbled upon an article about deathbed confessions ranging from a man who faked a picture of the Loch Ness monster, to a famous songwriter who plagiarized a hit song and lied about it for years. But the confession that \u201cgot me thinking\u201d Moriarty writes, was the man who, after having a stroke, confessed to murdering his neighbor. The man didn\u2019t die, but the secret he almost carried to the grave was out. That article planted the seed of an idea for her novel The Husband\u2019s Secret, which is about \u201ca deathbed confession, except he\u2019s not dead. Years later, after his wife finds the letter, she faces an interesting ethical dilemma.\u201d  Knowing the why of you story helps you decide where your story begins. In The Husband\u2019s Secret, author Lianne Moriarty wanted to explore the idea of someone intending to keep a secret until they died, only to have it revealed sooner. The idea came from an article she read about deathbed secrets. Look at the WHY in the chart and you will see the word SECRET and REVEAL are repeated. That is where her story begins, with the revelation of a secret. HOW the secret is revealed is the inciting incident. Finding this explanation for the genesis of Moriarty\u2019s story on the Kindle version of The Husband\u2019s Secret was an unexpected gift. Unless we attend author readings or conferences or come across an article by someone savvy enough to ask \u201cWhere did you come up with the idea for your novel,\u201d we aren\u2019t often privy to the ways writers get their ideas. We seldom know where the germ of a novel comes from and how it goes from idea to fully formed book. Fortunately, in the case of Moriarty, we do. We know that she read an article on deathbed confessions and that ideas wriggled around in her subconscious until she began to layer characters, place, and complications on top of the original premise.  Photo by D\u01b0\u01a1ng Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c on Unsplash In The Husband\u2019s Secret, the inciting incident is the discovery of the letter with \u201cFor my wife, Cecilia Fitzpatrick. To be opened only in the event of my death\u201d written on it. From that point on, everything in the novel supports the finding of the envelope. The decision to open it or not open it. The decision to tell her husband, John Paul, she\u2019d found the envelope. The opening of the envelope by Cecilia. The consequences that follow. Each character and that character\u2019s actions, everything they do, all the complications, dilemmas, and decisions they face and make, tie directly back to finding the envelope. Or, they move the reader towards the final resolution\u200a\u2014\u200awhy John Paul wrote the letter in the first place. Strong plots build from the inciting incident to the ultimate resolution of the story. A great story takes us from a question\u200a\u2014\u200awhy did Cecilia\u2019s husband write a letter to be opened only after his death? To the inciting incident\u200a\u2014\u200aCecilia finding the letter. To a stunning revelation at the end of the novel\u200a\u2014\u200awhich I won\u2019t spoil for you! Every scene, character, action, complication, and plot twist in The Husband\u2019s Secret leads us, like Hansel and Gretel\u2019s breadcrumbs from the inciting incident to that revelation. Keeping Your Story on TrackKnowing your WHY and having a fully formed inciting incident at the beginning of your book also helps you keep the story on track as you write. If you find yourself writing a scene in chapter 12 of your book and you suddenly have no idea where you are going, go back to the inciting incident of the book and ask yourself, \u201cDoes this scene support the why?\u201d If not, retrace your steps back until you see where the story diverged from your why or the inciting event. This is so important I will repeat it yet again. Every scene, every complication, every character, and every action ultimately needs to tie back to your why and the inciting incident. If you haven\u2019t defined the why of your story and your inciting incident by the first fifteen pages, you\u2019ll be stuck, wandering around in a writing desert and dragging your reader along with you. After a few disconnected scenes that move us further and further from the inciting incident, we start to wonder where the story is going and, we stop reading. Let\u2019s run through a few more examples before you tackle the why and the inciting incident for your story. How the Pros Do ItThe Firm opens with a young lawyer, Mitch McDeere interviewing for his first job out of law school. The inciting incident comes on page 13. After hearing everything that Bendini, Lambert, & Locke, a small firm in Memphis, Tennessee is offering, Mitch\u2019s wife Abby says, \u201cI don\u2019t understand Mitch. Why are they so generous?\u201d And off the story goes! The theme is, if something is too good to be true it probably is. Everything in The Firm points to that theme and back to the question \u201cWhy is this small firm in Memphis (few people have heard of ) being so generous?\u201d By the time Mitch figures out why, we are hooked! We keep reading to see how he will extricate himself and his career from the firm. The Martian opens with Mark Watley injured and left for dead on Mars. He must figure out a way to survive until the next team arrives on the planet in four years. He has enough food to last one year if he rations it. He can either give up and die or find a way to grow food and survive. After Watley explains his dilemma to us, and we see him moving from analysis to survival mode, we are on board. From that point on, everything in the novel is about Watley surviving until he is rescued. The Invention of Wings begins on Sarah Grimke\u2019s eleventh birthday. For her birthday, Sarah\u2019s mother presents her with the gift of a young slave girl Handful. Everything in Sarah rebels against accepting another human being as a gift and everything in the Invention of Wings points back to the internal struggle against slavery, and of being enslaved, lived through the characters of Sarah and Handful. The Hunger Games\u200a\u2014\u200aKatniss prepares for the Reaping, a ceremony during which a representative from each district chooses two tributes to participate in an annual fight to the death called the Hunger Games. When the representative selects her sister Prim, Katniss steps in to take Prim\u2019s place. Each action, decision, and complication is tied to Katniss\u2019 promise to stay alive and return to her family. Now it\u2019s your turn.

            "answer_text": "Well you have the essentials already. If you are stuck on how to get into the writing it may be due to the large quantity of words that you have to go through. I would suggest doing a little more planning. Here is the first page in my Excel planning document:  You will have enough information to fill in the first parts here. Some of the boxes are linked to formulae on other pages so I can keep track of several bits at once. So a working title, a basic premise and a setting. From what you have said you have these. The next bit is to choose a word count and rough amount of chapters. I usually go for 80,000 words for a novel and 40 chapters. When you stick that into this you will see the words per chapter go to 2000. Now this is a bit that helps out. I have another page that totals my writing and fills in the words written. The formula tells me the words left so I can see where I am. It is the chapters bit that helps. If you have 40 chapters you can divide your outline over the 40 sections. i start with the beginning one and the last one. I then stick in the ends of the acts about chapters 10, 20 and 30. I carry on doing this until I have small plans for each chapter. Often a sentence or two. I can then keep focused on that one chapter. if I follow my plan I know it will fit into the wider novel and I also won\u2019t get overwhelmed. I can easily write 2000 words in an evening after work so it\u2019s a good solid target. When you have the plan and have decided you are going to write X words for a chapter (these aren't set in stone, I have chapters hitting near 4000 and others barely 1000) you can then start writing that particular chapter. Well to write straight out you just grab the idea for that section and start writing what comes to mind. If it is your first time writing a novel or indeed fiction you may want to try free writing. (Free writing). This will often give you far more than you need and most of that will have to be set aside as irrelevant but it breaks you into the actual writing. Once you start typing or physically writing try and either hit a word count or a time limit. this will help you get enough words out that you can edit later. Often the first draft will be almost utter nonsense when you are starting out. After a while they get more coherent. What you are trying to do is get words down that you can edit later. Physically typing a novel can take a fair amount of time just for the mechanical process. Once you have the words of a story there you can edit them. Think of it this way. If you watch a film you can easily be critical of this or that in a film. You will know that a certain character shouldn't have done that at all. Now try and write the thing yourself with nothing to compare it to. It is a lot harder. So get that first draft written. When I'm in the flow of writing I will smash through near 5000 words. often I don\u2019t even correct typos or basic spelling errors. Once I hit a block I will run a basic spell check. That means I read bits of the chapter. By the time that is done I have ideas for the next section. As your first draft will receive a heavy edit don\u2019t worry too much about the first line or indeed any line or sentence. Stick to your plan so you hit all of the main plot points. I have a chapter or two that will have to be completely rewritten to make them interesting but I hit all of the main points in the plot. There is just too much exposition. I do have words there though. I know I have written something that isn't quite right. I have built up how I want the world to look as well. Most of that bit wont make it to the final draft but I will save it in a folder with background. What you eventually have is a lot of material to draw from in your edit. the trick here is that your writing isn't useless. As Jody Lebel has commented just writing for the sake of it doesn't mean anything will improve but your ability to physically type, and to some extent, the accuracy of your spelling and grammar. You need to have an idea what you are doing to form the story. To expand on my above point about chapters you need to know how scenes work to be able to make those self contained chapters. I mentioned splitting the book into 10 chapter acts. These acts can be split into scenes. What you are looking at is hitting the important points as you write even if you are going to do a heavy edit. The basic challenge and failure, or success, method can be of use here. When you write each chapter you want the characters to be doing things that advance the story. Personally I find listening to http://www.writingexcuses.com/ podcast helps me get these concepts in my head as I go about my day job. I have a better understanding of how to form a story. It has meant that even when I write something I know I will cut later I know it will have a use as background or a seed for another story. So to sum up. Break down your story into chapters. Have a vague idea what you want to achieve in that chapter. Then just write something that fills the word count while hitting the main points (these are the bits that form the story, plot hooks, challenges, failures and successes). As you go along you will get better at it and will require less editing at the end. If you still struggle try free writing. If those red lines are annoying you turn off spell check until you need it.

            "answer_text": "Things take time. If you wanted to fly a plane, what would you do? You'd find a ground school and take lessons. If you wanted to play the piano, what would you do? You'd find a piano teacher and take classes. What makes writing any different? The man on top of the mountain didn\u2019t just fall there. I'm going to give you my stock answer that I give everyone who asks me this question. Most people will tell you to just start writing, and keep writing, but I don't agree. I'm going to tell you why, give you some good advice on how to learn the craft, and give you a place to send in some of your work when you're ready. It's not enough to just write every day if you don't know what you're doing. That just means days and weeks and months of useless writing. It's like not knowing how to knit so you just keep making loops with the yarn. You can't get better, you can't turn that into a scarf ... you have the desire, but you don't know how. In order to write stories that people want to read you will need to understand how to put one together. There is a definite pattern and rhythm to it. And there are certain expectations from the editors and publishing houses as to how your story is laid out. You will need a good imagination, one that can look at a situation and picture all sorts of different scenarios. You need to be able to ask 'what if' and come up with twists and lines that are new and fresh. You will need to be able to research things. For example I wrote a story set in Iran where there was a wedding. I had to research how the wedding would take place, the food, the customs, common Iranian names, clothing, etc. in order to write an interesting yet correct story. Take classes in writing; grammar and punctuation (very important... lots of self published books are swimming in glaring errors and typos), character building, dialogue, plotting, pacing, point of view (POV), inner and outer conflicts, subplots, scenes and sequels, genres, story boards, twists, chapter hooks, suspense, killer opening lines, and satisfying endings. If you're going to write sci-fi you will need to take classes in world building. Each genre of book has its own set of expectations from the reader that you will need to fulfill. For example a murder mystery must have clues for the reader to try and solve. A romance needs a happen ever after ending, known to writers as an HEA. A thriller needs fast pacing and danger. Where to find these classes? Local community colleges often offer writing classes. My local library has classes seasonally. Best of all there are hundreds of classes you can take on-line. They run about $25-$35 each and range from 2 to 4 weeks. Google on-line writing classes and you will get lots of sites. There are sites that offer expensive classes, so be careful. I\u2019d recommend starting with a few less expensive ones to see if you really like writing and want to continue. IMO it is not necessary to have a degree or to take an expensive course to write well. Try SavvyAuthors. They have classes year round. You can join their site for free and get a discount on their classes. Read a lot. Get a feel for how a story is told; how it starts, how it progresses through the story to a satisfying end. See how your favorite author keeps you interested. I don't know your age, but when you can join some writing groups, even ones online. Oftentimes these groups offer lectures and classes in writing. They share their work and critique each other. Writing is an art, but it's a learned art. It is very satisfying to see your name on a story. It's doubly satisfying to hear people talk well about your work. It's even nicer to receive a check :). Write short stories (800 - 1500 words). The more you write, the better you will become. You will make new writer mistakes, we all did. But that's how you learn. I say start with short stories because they are, well short, and don't take years to complete like a novel does. You can share your stories with others and get feedback. Take the feedback and use what you feel is constructive for you and ignore the others. Some people don't give good feedback, or there is a motive behind their negative comments. You have to learn which ones to take and learn from and which ones to disregard. And when you are reading and critiquing other's stories, be kind, give good feedback, and find something positive to say to them. It's hard to hear harsh things about your writing. It's tough love. But it works when you get it and understand why the comment was made and you go and make your piece better because of it. Submitting to contests is another way to get good feedback because the judges are usually editors and agents who have their finger on the pulse of good writing that sells. Once you feel you have written a great short story, be brave and submit it to a magazine that publishes fiction in the genre you wrote. Don't worry about rejections. They will come. Oftentimes it's not because your story is not good, it's because the story doesn't fit their needs. They are running a business after all, and they pick the stories that they feel will best entertain their readers. All authors get rejections. It's part of the 'hunt'. Here\u2019s a place to start submitting. Check out their guidelines carefully. FLASH FICTION ONLINEhttp://flashfictiononline.com/main/submission-guidelines/We publish stories from 500 to 1,000 words in length. They\u2019re very short, but they are still stories. That means the best ones have strong, interesting characters, plots, and (to some extent, at least) settings. We\u2019re not that concerned about genre. Many of us have a fondness for science fiction and fantasy, but we also like literary fiction; and in any case, great flash stories aren\u2019t always easily classified. If you wrote it, and you love it, then submit it. No erotica, porn, graphic sex, or violence. Pays $60 per story. ",

            "answer_text": "Getting started. There are probably as many ways to get started as there are authors. But let me note a few ways. I almost always start with a scene or a chapter or some idea that I desperately want to write. I start building my ideas and plot structure from that base. I find writing that first scene gives me a chance to possibly get some of my main characters introduced, give them substance and description and allows me to feel like they are alive so I can freely start imagining them. I can imagine where they live, what they look like, how they act and what they do for a living. The scene I write might not find its way into the novel, but it is the time when I light my imagination on fire, fall in love with my characters and imagine ways to rip them asunder.Plotting, outline and story structure. While writing that burning itch scene might be useful, at some point you have to do an A, to B, to C, outline to give the story an overall story structure. A basic outline can be as simple as introduction, initial character interactions, subsequent character interactions, conflict, conflict resolution and conclusion.One plotting outline technique that is helpful is to start with an overall outline. Maybe a page or less. Then move into each major outline point and create smaller less significant outline points that expand the outline for potentially 10, 20 or 30 pages depending on complexity. Further, you need to start outlining the major and minor characters, adding details and potentially bit of back story or history for writing those characters. Its helpful to make a list with names, faces, body details, tics or peculiar actions. From that you can design conversations and interactions that give the story more life.Once the story is structured, the first editing process should begin. Is my plot wondering around on a tangent? Is my minor character contributing meaningfully to the story. Does my plot make sense? There are thousands of decisions to be made, and at this point none of them are wrong so longs as you are contributing to the overall story.Once the plot is finalized, then start the first draft by inserting prose into the outline. Write the story between the lines of the outline. The discipline of writing from A to B in your outline helps it follow your structure. In the imagination and first draft process you might learn more about your characters give them additional descriptions and breathe more life into your characters. You might change an interaction because it doesn\u2019t work, but you need the discipline to keep notes of the changes and update the blown out \u2014 outline so you continue to keep the continuity in your story.Finish your first draft. It\u2019s harder than it sounds. You might not like parts of what you wrote, but you can\u2019t let this distract you from the overall task. Vomit on the page if needed, but bring your story to the end. I have a bad habit of wanting to edit what\u2019s written while I\u2019m still in drafting mode. Some editing is good, especially if you are not in love with what you are currently drafting, but the goal of the first draft is to complete the first draft. Good, bad or indifferent, you have a long way to go before the story is completely started.Once the first draft is finished, only redraft those parts that are burning a hole in your soul. Maybe you have a continuity issue and that\u2019s bugging you, sort out and resolve what\u2019s bothering while it\u2019s fresh in your mind.First drafts are garbage. Let it sit for a while. Maybe work on another project, but get the first draft out of your mind and let it freshen up. A few months from now, you can re-read what was written (as opposed to what you think you have written) and you can see what you wrote with a fresh perspective. Once you can read what was actually written you are in a position to do a heavy edit.Heavy editing is hard but is necessary. If in doubt, cut, trim and phrase things more elegantly. Get rid of passive voice and insert clean and clear active verbs. Examine each scene or chapter and character. Examine each conversation, each description and ask yourself a series of hard questions. Does the scene make sense as written? Does the scene further the plot? Have I given the reader enough detail without bogging them down in unnecessary detail? Do the conversations flow smoothly? Do I know who is speaking and do I know why that character said what was said? What are the characters thinking? Is what they are thinking evident through what was written or does the thought deserve a short explanation? Does the thought further the plot. The heavy edit is the author\u2019s time to tighten up the plot and the characters, trim away the fat and passive voices. A heavy edit done with love and care, should take twice as long as it took to write the first draft. One thought to keep in mind. \u201cA scene or a story should be like a woman\u2019s skirt. Long enough to cover what\u2019s necessary, but short enough to grab and keep my attention.\u201dAfter a heavy edit has been done to the best of your ability, I\u2019d consider your novel to be started. There are several additional steps that are needed to take your novel from its infancy to publishable material. I won\u2019t belabor those points in detail except to say finishing your story is harder than anything I\u2019ve described above. Line editing, copy editing, scene re-examination, plot re-examination, are topics that remain, and should be handled by someone with editing experience and expertise.",

            "answer_text": "First off, do you have an idea? If not, write down all the little ideas you have that interest you. Possible plot points, premises, titles, things you care about, hypotheticals, dreams, genres, moral questions, whatever bugs you. Eventually, you\u2019ll think of some ideas. Now try to think about a story that could happen with some of them. Thinking about an idea, do you start playing out possible plot points in your head, or do you get writer\u2019s block? A good premise should be easy to turn into a story. Take the premise of Harry Potter: an orphan boy learns he\u2019s a wizard and goes to wizard school. Even if you know nothing about Harry Potter, it\u2019s easy to start imagining how the story goes. Your first thoughts might be too cliche, but you know you can make the plot work. On the other hand, you might think of a cool idea, like a boy with a lightning scar, but you have no idea what else happens in the story. It\u2019s a good idea, and you should save it for later, but it\u2019s not the premise. Eventually, you\u2019ll find a story in one of your ideas, or you\u2019ll think of a story by combining a few of them together. You can always bounce ideas off a friend if you get frustrated. Now you have an idea. Spend an hour thinking about it in your head, a few possible approaches and random scenes or characters. Now write - but don\u2019t immediately write the novel. Write down information about the novel. This is how you get the first words on a page. Write down what\u2019s going to happen, who the characters will be, what the themes will be. This doesn\u2019t need to be extensive. You can have big gaps. But make sure you get at least a page or two. Every writer\u2019s different, but I\u2019d recommend figuring out these details in particular: 1) The names of all the most important characters, because saying \u201cmain character guy\u201d gets tedious. If you get stuck, remember that Word and its equivalents will let you easily find and replace the name, so you can change it at any point in the writing process. 2) A one-line description of the premise, so you know exactly what you\u2019re writing about. You can also have other, longer descriptions, but the more concise you can make this, the more coherent your story\u2019s vision will probably be. You don\u2019t have to work in every subplot and detail, just the overall elevator pitch you\u2019ll need to think of later anyway. 3) The beginning, middle, and ending of your story, so you know the general structure of the plot. Also, make sure particularly interesting things happen around all three points. 4) Each of the main characters\u2019 single greatest desire, single greatest belief, single greatest flaw, and single greatest need. Desire: the specific thing they want (to catch the killer, to become a movie star, the Iron Throne\u2026) Belief: Their innermost value system (At his core, s/he\u2019s a wo/man who believes in truth/honor/justice/love\u2026) Flaw: their single greatest weakness, which they will either overcome or be destroyed by (Cowardice, arrogance, greed, toxic love, naivete, cynicism\u2026) Need: What they need to become to overcome their flaw and either get the thing they desire or realize that it was never worth getting all along (Bravery, humility, generosity, the ability to let go, realism, hope\u2026) These are all connected, which means they have to make sense together, but also that you can figure them out pretty much all at once. You don\u2019t have to write these down as a checklist or anything, just make sure you understand what makes the character work on the inside. 5) The general arcs of the main characters, along with a few moral choices along the way. These need to be consistent. If, in the novel\u2019s first half, the detective is so obsessed with solving a woman\u2019s murder that he forgets to love his wife, it will be hard, if not impossible, to make the story\u2019s second half be about the detective running for public office but having to overcome his racism. Those are two different stories, two different character arcs, and you\u2019d be better off making that the sequel. Which doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have your characters change drastically, or end up in very different circumstances, but there does need to be some kind of thread connecting them. Try and think of a few related moral choices that your character will face and make sure there\u2019s some variety in what s/he chooses. By moral choice, I basically mean any time a character could pick between two or more options and what they choose says something about them. For major characters, they\u2019ll ideally all make a few choices, but you only need two or three to build your story around at this point. In Casablanca, Rick used to be an idealist who helped people, now he\u2019s refusing to help Ilsa, then he decides to help her but only to be with her, then he selflessly lets her go and embraces idealism once again. He makes contrasting, related moral choices, and those define his arc, and, ultimately, who he is as a person. That sounds like a lot, but it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. You can rewrite this all later, just get stuff on the page as quickly as possible. And you don\u2019t have to do all of this, just do whatever is needed to understand the story you want to tell. Some people want to write long backstories for their characters, or samples of their dialogue. I don\u2019t find that personally necessary, but this all to make you feel comfortable. But no matter what you do, if this is your first time writing a novel, write quickly. Like in tech, move fast and break things. I know a lot of aspiring writers. I have a degree in screenwriting, so the whole class was invested in this. Most of them still haven\u2019t written any kind of long-form story outside what was done for the program. They all know the theory by heart, and they all outline, but they never stop outlining. You can\u2019t get stuck coming up with ideas, constantly telling yourself you need to do more work on them. That\u2019s not planning, that\u2019s fear. My advice, give yourself three days for this step, then move on to the next stage. If it\u2019s not perfect, you can still go back to it. And I don\u2019t mean three eight-hour shifts. Eight hours total should be fine. Now write an outline. You might want to write a one-page outline or a five-page outline or something of that sort. I did that for some unpublished screenplays and it was fine, but I think redundant, and you might accidentally make your story too small or large for the space you want to fill. What I\u2019ve found most useful is writing a scene-by-scene outline. A few lines\u2019 summary of every scene in your novel, or even a one-line summary. Go to a new scene every time your story moves to a new place, time, or changes the characters involved, unless you know it\u2019s going to be a lot of quick snippets (think a movie montage.) For reference, my novel ended up being about five pages per scene in the outline, so think about what length you want your book to be while you do this. (My scenes were pretty short, though, so keep that in mind.) Not all the scenes will be the same length, but they average out remarkably well, so after you write this, it\u2019s easy to see if the emphasis in your story is different than you were expecting. This is the best time to make changes to your story, because it doesn\u2019t take a lot of work. While you\u2019re doing this, keep an eye on all the notes you wrote down. You want to make sure you stay on the story you want to tell, but also change it if you like a different idea more. Outline, but be flexible. And again, move fast and break things. Don\u2019t take more than a week to write an outline, two if you\u2019re busy. Then review the outline and make changes. You might want to show it to a friend for more objective feedback. Your friends aren\u2019t necessarily correct and might just have different tastes than you, so don\u2019t toss it out anything you really believe in, but take their words seriously and don\u2019t take offense. Write new drafts of the outline, but only to fix your story\u2019s flaws, not for the sake of it. I\u2019d cap these revisions at a month. And once you like your story and don\u2019t know what else to change, start writing. And if you\u2019re still sorting a few details out, but the vast majority of it works, also start writing. If you\u2019re not sure or not, also start writing. Seriously, start writing. You\u2019re going to change your outline a lot, and that\u2019s healthy. Stay flexible. I\u2019d start at the beginning and write all the way through your novel, to maximize your flexibility, with one exception: I usually write my last page first, so that I know exactly where my story is going. I always change the last page when I finally get there, but it keeps the story focused. One caution about changing your story: Every time you introduce an element into your story, make sure you know its resolution. If you want to write with a lot of improvisation, that\u2019s fantastic, and I do the same. But then immediately figure out where this new development is going after you\u2019ve finished improvising, before you write past this point. Update your outline if it\u2019s a big change, write down some notes if it\u2019s a smaller one. This way, you don\u2019t run into dead ends or introduce concepts or characters you can\u2019t pay off later. If you get stuck, consult your outline. If that doesn\u2019t help, write down more notes and details about the scenes you\u2019re heading into, until you have a clear idea of what needs to happen. If, after writing it, you still think the scene is a little awkward, keep writing. You can revise later. If you get stuck on the little details, write out an an increasingly detailed outline of the scene you\u2019re stuck on. (\u201cJoe says he hates Nazis because of his dad\u2019s death. The recruitment officer says he came to the right place. Joe signs up to fight.\u201d) If a scene feels overwhelming, just write the dialogue and outlines of the physical actions. Then do another pass where you incorporate the dialogue into your prose. That way, you do both elements separately and can focus on one and then the other. I figured this out from screenwriting, where you\u2019re only writing dialogue and the physical action. Another bonus of writing this way: It forces your conflict out of your character\u2019s inner thoughts and into their words and actions. Essentially, it makes your book more cinematic. Just keep writing as often as you can. Don\u2019t make an exact commitment, because if you say you\u2019ll write five pages every day, you\u2019ll just become dispirited the first time you only write four. But make sure you keep writing. It is more important to write often than to write a lot. If you only write a page a day, you\u2019ll still finish a normal-sized novel in a year. If you can write ten pages in one day, that\u2019s great, but if you only write three paragraphs every other day, that\u2019s still progress, and you are now closer to your endgame than you were before. Do make sure you write consistently, and make sure writing is a priority, even if that seems a little selfish or irrational, or it will never get done. After you\u2019ve reached the end of the book, save it for the millionth time in multiple places. Then go back through the book and fix up typos and clarify anything that\u2019s really unclear. For your first revision, only fix the typos. Don\u2019t make substantial changes. You will be emotional and might change something that\u2019s better than you think, or which becomes important later and you\u2019re forgetting right now. Take this time to think about your story and how it reads. Then beg your friends to read it. This is the single most dispiriting part of writing a novel. Not the feedback, just trying to get it. You only need two or three people to give you honest, considerate advice, but you\u2019ll probably need to ask a dozen or more people to get this. It might not be the people you think, either. It might be that random friend from college. If your closest friends aren\u2019t getting around to it, keep casting the net wider. Having someone you don\u2019t know well give feedback can even be an advantage, because they experience the novel without too much information about you coloring their perceptions. Essentially, they\u2019re closer to the normal person who\u2019ll be reading your book after it\u2019s released. After you get feedback, think about it for a week and then make revisions. See if you can change small stuff before you change big stuff. Sometimes, just adding or removing a line can completely change how a scene feels to the reader, even when they\u2019d seemingly hated the whole sequence. If a character is unlikable, first try seeing if you can clarify the character a bit or add in a sympathetic moment before tossing everything out. If you wrote a strong outline, you probably won\u2019t need to change major structural elements to the story, and if you really knew who your characters are, both on the surface and in their soul, you shouldn\u2019t need to rewrite their conflicts too much That\u2019s why both those elements are so important to plan ahead of time, because plot and character are the hardest elements of your story to change after your first draft. They\u2019re too fundamental to every page. You may need a lot of revisions. Make sure you save every change. This is the point when you should be most cautious about moving fast, because your book will be very emotional to you and you might easily underestimate or overestimate your work\u2019s quality. I can\u2019t tell you how long this will take or when it\u2019s time to stop, but you do need to make sure you stop eventually. If people start reacting to your novel like it\u2019s a finished work instead of suggesting improvements, that\u2019s a good sign it\u2019s finished. They will probably still suggest a few things, because that\u2019s what you asked them to do, but they\u2019ll become smaller, something they add after thinking about it. Throughout the entire writing process, keep taking notes every time you think of an idea related to the novel, no matter how minor. A line, a concern, a character name that seems cool even though you don\u2019t know who it\u2019s for. Make sure these notes are immediately accessible on both your phone and whatever computer you use to write. I make an email chain for every story, so that I can write down ideas as soon as they occur to me, and then I can quickly find them on my computer while writing. Also, at any time, if you come up with a scene in extended detail, just write the scene. Even if you don\u2019t know the rest of the story, just write it. You\u2019ll probably have to change it, and it might not fit at all, but you\u2019ll thank yourself later for writing it down, because you will forget the details later. On that note, save everything. If you make major changes to the text you\u2019ve already written, be it your notes, outline, or manuscript, save it as a new file so you still have the old one. (I just write \u201cD1,\u201d \u201cD2,\u201d etc. for each successive draft.) Eventually, you\u2019ll change your mind and need something you would have otherwise deleted. Hopefully, that helps. There\u2019s a lot of good books out there on story structure and character development by people like John Truby, Laurie Hutzler, and Dara Marks. None of them need to be taken as gospel, but they\u2019re all helpful if you feel unprepared. Finally, I learned all this through my own writing, and I recently published a novel for the first time, And One Day My Stars Will Burn. Please do check it out if you have the chance\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": " Don't start writing until you've got your idea nice and tight in one sentence - packing a mean ironic punch. No really, I wouldn't if I were you. I have, but when you start flabby, it's like loosely packed clay on the potter's wheel. You press the pedal and you've got shit flying in all directions. I won't let my writers at Kritikme start writing until we know we have a solid, hard-working, great - and yes - that means commercially viable idea for a story. You leave The Classic Course with wonderment and irony locked and locked into your story idea. You start The Ninety Day Novel course with seven days to get this tight. Honestly, a great idea can take years, so this is the hardest work you'll do on the course. Delivering the content of a novel is easy, once you've got an idea you can't wait to write and then you can allow yourself this Peter Pan moment: \u201cHow clever I am!\u201d he crowed rapturously, \u201coh, the cleverness of me!\u201d It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness, there never was a cockier boy. (JM Barrie: Peter Pan and Wendy 1911) What do I mean by irony? Well, it's not 'rain on your wedding day'. That's just bad luck. What's ironic about Alanis Morrissette's song is that it's not ironic. the expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often wryly amusing as a result.a literary technique, originally used in Greek tragedy, by which the full significance of a character's words or actions is clear to the audience or reader although unknown to the character.One notion in conflict with another SPRINGLOADS the idea and traps the reader inside the confection of your fiction, rattling between point and counterpoint immediately. The result is the reader goes - WHAT! And that's how we want to keep them from start to finish of their reading experience. Policeman turns to crimeTeacher learns lesson from students.Man who doesn't like women, becomes a woman,for the love of a woman.If you can load your title with irony too, you're ahead of the game and can leave the elevator without a pitch. I like 'Judge on Trial' by Ivan Klima, and 'Beware of Pity' by Stefan Zweig. 'The Good Soldier' is good when you know the context. Titles that defy our expectations like 'Love In the Time of Cholera' work well. After two limp novels, I worked hard to make sure my third hit the mark and loaded my title with irony 'Becoming Strangers' with the idea being that a dying man found new life. The irony is stowed in the FLAW which sets up the novel (you can find out more about the big story structure on the course - see the Kritikme Five F's) and in a children's classic this is a COSMIC FLAW which delivers 'cosmic irony' the disparity between what humans desire and what the world actually serves them. Mostly, in the classics, this is the chosen kid who's an orphan. This is an irony of fate. No one's fault. The big funny not so haha from on high. Beethoven - a great composer - loses his hearing. Ouch. Because a novel is a moral journey, as well as all kinds of other adventures, a cosmic flaw, a twist of fate, locks in sympathy and hope and at the end of the day a reader reads on hope. So, it's pretty simple. Your idea should ring clear as a bell. Make sure you're packing irony at the outset. In my bluffer's visual above, the balloon of the idea rises, with the pin that pricks it underneath - poised to make you and your comfortable ideas, dear reader, go POP! Good luck, and if you want to make sure you\u2019re on track, come find me and I\u2019ll help you at Kritikme. ",

            "answer_text": "There are as many ways to begin writing a novel as there are authors, what works for me, more than likely won\u2019t work for you. If this is your first, then here is some solid advice. I am sure you have a rough outline of what you want to write inside your head. Don\u2019t try and write the hook straight from the start, it is far easier to do once you have finished your first novel. Trying to write that hook can be a bit of a challenge, especially if you aren't a professional writer. So wait until you have built up your skills; it will come easier. Keep a note of your characters as you create them and their relationships to each other. Do it in a separate notebook. Do it on a pc or electronic notebook of some kind, ie laptop, netbook, notebook. I use a netbook, it makes it easier to research something at the drop of a hat. Everything these days is submitted electronically, this makes it easier in the long run. At this point I would go to Createspace and create an account; download one of their formatted templates, this will save you so much grief later on. Once you start, DO NOT go back over each chapter as you create them. Once you start, do not stop. I will let you into a little secret. Unless you are a professional write, most of what you first write will be a load of crap. If you go back and start playing with stuff, you will quickly realise how bad it is, and become disheartened. I have talked to so many people who have simply given up after a half dozen chapters. What they did not realise is that it is a process. As you write you begin to create pathways in your mind that did not exist before. How do you write this, how do you describe that etc. each time you solve a problem you create a new pathway that you can revisit at any time. As you progress through the novel, and create these pathways, your writing will become tighter and tighter. When you have finished the novel, sit it down for a couple of weeks, then sit down and read it as you would any other book. Send it to your kindle if you have one. Just send it to your kindle email address and write convert in the subject line. This will send a kindle converted copy straight to yourself. If you prefer paperback, you have a number of options. You can upload it to Amazon or Createspace. If you create an Amazon author account and create a paperback version, you can have one sent to you before you publish it. I prefer Createspace. If you order from Amazon, then it will be there in a few days. You have to pay extra for that with Createspace, or you will wait for a few weeks before you get a copy. The hardest part of writing your first novel is reaching the end. The hard work begins once you write the end. You will have to be honest with your self at this stage, and may well have to rewrite large chunks, I know I had to. Once you have done all that, write some kind of descriptive hook, it should be quite easy by that stage. A couple of things to note. As your skills develop, you may well find the novel turning in a different direction to what you first imagined it. Holding to hard onto an outline, or beginning, middle, end, will result in failure. It is taking a different direction, because you are developing your skills. Some can do it, but not that many. You may start out like that, but may well find yourself flying by the seat of your pants towards the end. If you find yourself in this situation, then ease up on your hard stance, let it become fluid in your mind. Well that is quite a bit to be getting on with. If you start and get stuck, give me a shout. ",

            "answer_text": "Sit. Write. Maybe it will look good and you will keep going. Maybe it will suck and you will come up with another approach. Maybe (most likely) you will not be happy with it, but will see the seeds of something you can edit and/or rewrite later, It is possible to overthink this process. It is possible to get so obsessed with preparation that it kills your creativity and confidence. Is your outline good enough? Is your third act sixth phase reverse rising tension ironic undertone done right? Have you got every beat of your first chapter brokem down into perfect triads of action/reaction/(I don\u2019t even remember what the third one is supposed to be)? You will never learn to write until you put words on paper, Mind you, that may not be *enough*. You may write 50 pages and then decide you really need to study up on dialogue. Or get ideas for plot structure, or whatever. But for now just friggin\u2019 WRITE. Pick a scene you are dying to put on paper and don\u2019t worry about what comes before or after it. Feel what it is like to bring that scene to life. Experience your characters, See what your strengths and weaknesses\u2014and needs\u2014are. Then research the things you feel you need to research. Maybe you\u2019ll need lots of books to help you, Maybe you won\u2019t, I\u2019ve made my living as a novelist for 30 years and I never read a book about how to write before I started. I suspect that if I had been encouraged to do as much prep before writing as you are being advised here, my first novel would still not be written. Seriously. Sometimes I think we need a new verb in the English language , \u201dto quora\u201d, meaning \u201cto prepare for an action so thoroughly that you never actually do it\u201d. I do agree with one piece of advice given here. You should not start with a novel, but with short stories, Why? Because a first novel is an investment of months of effort, probably years, with an infinitesmally small chance of success. The sheer magnitude of the task can get overwhelming. Even a professional author needs major discipline to approach a project that large, and laser keen focus to make it successful. So write a short story first. Submit it somewhere. If it fails, get feedback and learn to write better. Work on a project where if you don\u2019t have perfect discipline, you can still succeed. Make your mistakes in a format that you have not invested years of hope and energy in, so you learn from your mistakes without your spirit being crushed, and can grow as a writer. Then, when you are ready artistically and emotionally, go for the big one. (As a side note, you get paid for any stories you sell, so there\u2019s an immediate benefit to this plan) Stop asking how to write, and write. ",

            "answer_text": "Before you begin writing a novel, you should have a decent vocabulary and be able to use the words you learn and be able to say them in as many different ways as possible so as to not feel as though you are repeating yourself and bore your readers. A thesaurus is one good resource to have, as it lists synonyms you can memorise for when you want to enrich the volume of vocabulary found in your novel. Do not worry about making grammar mistakes or typos. When learning new words, try to apply them in daily conversations so that each new word that you learn becomes second nature. Chances are that you will misapply some words when they are new to you, or if you rarely use them. Either way, do not let that discourage you from using them. Leaving your comfort zone and expanding on your vocabulary by allowing some mistakes to be made is better than not using these words at all. If you are new to creative writing, I suggest writing some fan fiction first, in order to know how characters interact and develop. Look for shows or movies you are familiar with and write your own stories about the characters. I spent a good ten years of my life writing plenty of fan fiction in different genres before I even seriously considered writing my own original stories with actual character development. In the same way that drawers will tell you that they cannot learn to draw their own original drawings until they have acquired the knowledge to do so from drawing characters from other creators, a writer is going to have a lot of difficulty writing a new story with original characters if they don\u2019t even know what makes a story/character good or bad and how a story should be structured. Once you have a lot of experience writing creatively, start to write down characters you come up with by listing everything you know about them. Write down what their age is; what their physical appearance is; what their beliefs are; what their strengths and weaknesses are; what their purpose and goals are; who they know and like/dislike; what types of food they like to eat; what is their employment; what is their dress style; what activities are they known for doing; what their background story is etc.. Even if such information won\u2019t be mentioned specifically in the novel you are writing, it gives you a good reference point to know what your characters would be doing in a certain situation and how they would react to that. It is impossible to write about a character in your story when you know literally nothing about them. In addition, your potential readers may want to know more about your characters in order to relate to them more. Having a detailed profile about your characters (including your secondary characters) is going to receive far more positive feedback than a wooden dialogue and performance. Write as much as you can all day, every day. Even if there is a day when you might decide that you\u2019re not in the mood to be writing your creative writing project, jot down some notes about random things or even type on your e-mail. It is better to be writing something, even if the quality is poor and unrelated to your work, than nothing at all. If you are only planning on writing one novel, then this next piece of advice does not apply to you; but if you aspire to write as many novels as possible, you should switch back and forth from one novel to the next on a regular basis, as you won\u2019t get bored so easily when you have another writing option if the first one starts to wear you down. Even if you can\u2019t think of anything good to describe a scene or dialogue in your story, write it down anyway and move on until you either think of something, or you complete the first draft. Spending too much time trying to think of the perfect sentence on your first draft is likely to create a tedious process more unbearable than you would be able to handle, and you are that much more likely to just quit altogether. There is no point in making your first draft perfect, because odds are that by the time your first draft is completed, something else will come to mind which would make the story that much better, and that would require you to effectively rewrite your entire first draft, anyway. Most serious novelists will rewrite their entire story three or four (or more) times before they find a concept to their story which they attach themselves to. Even the first draft of Empire Strikes Back had a very different story line and outcome compared to the finalised version that was eventually released. Having perfect grammar skills as a writer is inconsequential, as there are professional editors available if it matters that much to you to be a perfectionist (note, even so-called professional editors make mistakes). Besides, if you go with the traditional publishing route, your writing is going to be getting proofread by others, anyway. On the other hand, since this is creative writing, you can probably even get away with certain grammar typos and mistakes which wouldn\u2019t be the case if you were writing a non-fiction research textbook by claiming that your character has a unique way of speaking, or that something in the book cannot be properly explained with real world vocabulary (such as J.R. Tolkien using Elvish instead of Elfish). Charles Dickens and even Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss) were known for their grammar errors and mistakes, even though they were often times deliberate. Jane Austen and a few others also had difficulty with grammar, so it is not the end of the world if you have some mistakes here and there. Remember: writing is a lot like music in that the average reader is very unlikely to pick up on mistakes that tend to be noticed by an experienced reader/writer. If your creative writing is based on real-world events, educating yourself in geography, politics, history, languages and science can help you be able to include required facts and information needed to advance your story into the book without feeling foolish if a reader calls you out later on your mistake. Learning about different topics can also help inspire you to write about events based on real life events and/or personal experiences that you might otherwise not have thought about and have something to write down and avoid writer\u2019s block. In the end, most readers actually like \u201cfictional\u201d stories that could be true, no matter how implausible the story might be. Indicating that some of your ideas come from events that happened in our world has a far better chance to intrigue your readers than something made up out of thin air which the reader cannot relate to. Before you make a video game, you should know some coding and other software. Before playing music, you should know how an instrument works. If you want to be a culinary chef, you need to know how to handle kitchen utensils and how to operate an oven, stove and microwave. The same is true for writing novels. How can you write a novel if you don\u2019t truly know what a novel looks like or how it functions? Just knowing that a novel has paragraphs, words and grammar is not good enough. You need to also know how to present those paragraphs, words and grammar; and to be quite frank: there is no magic formula for that. Each novelist has their own style of writing in the same way that each drawer, programmer, musician or chef has their own style of drawing, programming, performing and cooking. If you have not read up on the works of other novelists, you should do so. Even comparing books of random authors whose names you may or may not know is just as efficient. In fact, it is highly recommended that you not limit your readings to just mere classics and/or famous authors. If you really want to get a wide range of approaches to writing a novel, reading the works of less known writers might give you ideas that you otherwise may not have thought of. Keep in mind as well, that every famous author today was an unknown at some point, and if the unknown authors you read about while they are unknown become famous one day, then you can brag about how you knew about this author before everybody else did. How famous they are does not suddenly mean that they are unworthy of your time. Something to keep in note: do not limit yourself to just reading good books that receive high reviews. In fact, you should probably even read some bad books as well. When you read these \u201cbad\u201d books, you should ask yourself why this book is bad, and what could have been done to improve it. In the event that you either don\u2019t have the time or money to write a book, you could always hire a ghostwriter to write the actual book, after you\u2019ve given them the ideas. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this route, as a ghostwriter is very unlikely to come back with a style and approach that you find truly satisfying (since only you really know what your book is about) and this may cause far more frustration compared to just writing the book yourself. Besides, how can you really say that YOU wrote the book, when at best the only thing you did was give somebody else the ideas? When figuring out a plot to your story, you should write down every scene you can think of off the top of your head and write them down on a list. Even if the idea is not great and is unlikely to make it into the final draft, you should do it anyway. When brainstorming for scenes, there are no bad ideas, only plausible one. After you have your characters and story fleshed out, you need to figure out a way to have your characters go from one scene to the next. Connecting the dots gives you a literary pathway to know how to overcome any and all obstacles that may be encountered on the way. If a scene becomes impossible to add without ruining the rest of the story, you are better off to modify it or delete it outright. It is better to have one lost scene than an entire story\u2019s quality deteriorating as a result. When I write creative writing stories, I tend to develop each story in six different drafts: The Sketch DraftThe Rough DraftThe Filler DraftThe Dialogue DraftThe Grammar DraftThe Polished DraftThe Sketch Draft The first step of the physical writing process of any story, in my opinion, is called the Sketch Draft. This is the draft where you know the fundamentals of your story. You know what the beginning, middle and end are (even if this may change later), as well as your main characters. In the same way a drawer does light sketches before creating a more detailed drawing, a writer should have an idea as to where their story is heading and how it will end. At this stage, the writer should have several questions and answers already figured out. Some of these include, but are not necessarily limited to: Who are the characters in the story? Why are they in the story? What is their purpose? What are their goals? Why do they have such goals? What are their characteristics? What are their strengths and weaknesses? The author must also know how the story will end and be able to answer questions, such as: What is the solution to the story? What type of message am I trying to convey? How do I want my readers to feel? What genre is this? What type of people would be interested in this story? What are my reasons for writing this book? What kind of effect (if any) would it have on the lives of those reading my work? If you cannot even answer these questions, then it is going to be impossible to do the other stages and expect your work to be of the quality that would entail bragging rights. This would be like wanting to draw a cartoon character, but not knowing what the age, physical appearance and dress-style of your character is, or even knowing what kind of style you want, for that matter (Realistic, Manga, Simpsons, Disney?). The Rough Draft The Rough Draft, in my experience, has been the longest and most frustrating stage of writing a story for the simple fact that when writing the rough draft, you are still uncertain as to how you will approach the story and how your characters will interact and solve any problems they may face along their journey. It is also long, because it is the only stage that requires you (at least in theory) to write the book from beginning to end before proceeding to the next stage. How many words you write at this stage can vary from as few as 20,000 to as many as a million (or more) words. On the other hand, there is one positive aspect to the rough draft: the quality of your writing is not that important at this stage. While this does not imply that you should neglect your work altogether, it does mean that it is not the end of the world if you can\u2019t think of a masterpiece description or dialogue right away. Rather, you ought to continue churning more words and advancing your story and leave such problems for later. Your morale will likely be sapped if you fret too much about such obscurities, as you won\u2019t feel that you are progressing sufficiently enough. The Filler Draft Any scenes that you skipped, forgot or only thought about later can now be added into your rough draft at the Filler Draft stage of development. See this as more of a patch-up for rough drafts. Perhaps you later realised that there was a scene you wanted to add and forgot. It is also quite probable that a good scene or interaction that could improve your story was only thought about later in the Rough Draft stage. Or if might be a simple matter of you choosing to skip a scene because you did not have a solution at the time for how to solve that scene and move on to the next. Regardless of the reason why certain scenes are missing from the rough draft: the Filler Draft is the best time to fix any plot holes you may have discovered or know about and wish to repair. While doing the Filler Draft, you should still start out reading from the beginning and reading until the end. Along the way, correct any spelling mistakes or grammar errors that you may have missed the first time around. Reading a story from beginning to end on the Filler Draft also makes it more likely that you will notice some inconsistencies with your story than if you only focus on new scenes that you want to include. Starting from the beginning and working your way back to the end also means that you may be inspired to add some new scenes which you otherwise may not have thought about. While the Filler Draft is also where you have the chance to correct the more obvious spelling/grammar errors, its purpose is ultimately to ensure that the story itself makes sense and that the development of both the plot and characters are as strong as can be. The Dialogue Draft The Dialogue Draft is similar to the Filler Draft, except that now, your primary focus is to either add or improve upon the dialogue and interactions of your characters. If a dialogue turned out cheesy, but you added it in there anyway because it was either the best you could muster, or it turns out to not be as great as you initially thought: you now have the opportunity to upgrade the dialogue aspects of your characters. How your characters interact is even more important than the actual description of your story for the simple reason being that speaking is more natural than describing things in words. While describing an event or place is good when it cannot reasonably be said by a character in your story, an author should also avoid relying too much on descriptions when it can be just as easily said by a character. There is a saying by many authors that goes along the lines of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d What this means is that you need to be able to tell a reader what is going on in the least direct way possible. For instance, if a character is scared, don\u2019t bluntly say \u201cthe character was scared\u201d as that does not leave much room for a reader to interpret what is happening, and it makes the reader feel as though you are telling them how they should be thinking. Not to mention, it feels cheap and wooden to be that direct. It would be like telling a joke to someone, and then you explain the joke while actually saying it. Below is a good example of what I mean:  It is also just as true if you are describing someone\u2019s relationship. If you claim that somebody secretly hates/loves somebody, you don\u2019t put it in a description by saying \u201cshe secretly loved her so-called nemesis, but she would not admit to it.\u201d While this may be more forgivable in the rough draft stages when you are still trying to get everything sorted out, it needs to be cut out by this point of the writing process, and instead you need to have this shown in the actions/dialogues of your characters. This does not mean you have a character bluntly tell another character what they are thinking (unless this is their real personality) as this also cheapens the effect. Don\u2019t go writing \u201cI am jealous of this person because he is smarter than me.\u201d Rather, you should make that same point by having the character say things which would be perceived as a form of jealousy in the real world without directly saying it. Having the character go behind their backs and possibly gossip about them or put their faces on a punching bag etc. all make for a far better message as to what a certain character thinks and feels. If anyone has ever heard/written down a court transcript, they would know that people in the real world don\u2019t talk like they do in the creative world. In the real world, even so-called educated people are going to repeat words like \u201cif,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d etc. several times over in quick succession when they stutter or fail to think of something constructive to say. Words such as \u201cuhhh\u201d appear hundreds of times in an average court case, even though most people wouldn\u2019t know how frequently they are actually saying it. Saying the grammatically wrong word in open dialogue is also a common occurrence, regardless of your education, setting or intelligence. On the other hand, if you were to have stuttering and/or poor grammar appear in dialogue in your creative writing stories, you are more likely to bore your readers, and the overall message and story might suffer as a result. The only times it should be permissible to have stuttering and dialogue errors in your story is if your character is nervous, uneducated or they simply don\u2019t know how to express a certain situation or event. Even when such exceptions arise, the amount of times this type of dialogue should be used in a novel should be kept at a minimal, even if this is being done by a main character. The dialogue you add needs to be both interesting and believable. Does what is being said sound like something this particular character would say? If not, then you have to either give that line to another character whom would be a perfect match, or the dialogue needs to be modified to be compatible with that specific character. The Grammar Draft The fifth stage is the Grammar Draft. This is when your scenes, characters and dialogue have been mostly worked out and you just want to ensure that any typos or grammar mistakes you may have missed are finally corrected. Essentially, your goal at this point is to scavenge around your novel to find the less obvious errors. Needless to say, this should be a fairly straightforward process. If you are worried about grammar mistakes, find a proofreader/editor to help you out. Don\u2019t lose too much sleep if some mistakes do occur. Chances are that if you had been looking for the obvious ones throughout the previous three stages (Rough, Filler and Dialogue Drafts) the mistakes are not that likely to be picked up by a casual reader, as they are going to be too busy immersing themselves in your story (assuming it is worthwhile for them to do so). I can\u2019t even think of a book that isn\u2019t without some sort of grammar/spelling mistake. If you later find yourself in a precarious situation of having published your book, only to later discover the mistakes when it is too late to correct them: You are in very good company and your mistakes are not as likely to stand out compared to that time when an entire edition of the Bible was publicly burned over a single typo. Wicked Bible - Wikipedia The Polished Draft The Polished Draft is the last stage of writing. At this point, you should just take a break that is long enough that the developmental process up until this sixth and final draft is not going to be fresh in your mind. After taking a break, ranging anywhere from mere days to over a year, you should read your story all over again from beginning to end. This time, however, you are now reading this book as if you were just a regular reader, as opposed to the author. When reading the book, you have to ask yourself whether the questions you had offered at the start of your writing journey have been satisfactorily fulfilled. For example: Do my characters resolve their goals? Does the story end in a way that it would give positive closure to the reader? Are all the answers brought up in the story answered? Are the characters likeable? Is the dialogue and description of the story interesting and original? Will the story influence readers in the way I intended? (emotional, political, spiritual etc.) Is there anything else I could have added to improve this story? When you are coming back after a prolonged period of time, you are more likely to be able to answer such questions honestly, as you are far less likely to become sentimentally attached to your work. Furthermore, it can be hard to know what your readers will see in your story when you are the writer, since the reader does not have your mindset. It is YOUR job to help translate your mindset to them. You can talk about a character as much as you want, but how is the reader supposed to appreciate that character if they don\u2019t even know what they look like or what kind of personality they have? If you had answered \u2018yes\u2019 to the last question answered two paragraphs above, you may want to figure out what those improvements are and go back to fixing them. This may mean repeating the previous stages all over again. Nevertheless, with the possible exceptions that you are dying or someone is physically preventing you from continuing with your story, there is no reason you should choose to let your story\u2019s potential be tarnished because you don\u2019t have the motivation to honestly know when an improvement can be made and spend the time writing down these improvements. Later on, you might choose to take another break and read the story all over again. You might even do this several times over until you decide that it is good enough to finally show to the world. And once that happens, you can probably even go out and celebrate by eating out for a special occasion. CONCLUSION In conclusion, I should also add that another thing you have to do is to continue motivating yourself to write. Rather than seeing the process of writing as an obligation, you should see it as an opportunity. Even if the latter feeling does not do it for you, you should find other ways to motivate yourself. One solution is to tell yourself that if you write a certain number of words per day, you will reward yourself with a beverage or snack. Once you complete a chapter or a certain amount of overall words, you will take a day off writing and go eat at a restaurant etc.. The hardest part about writing is not the writing itself, it is the creativity that goes into writing. The former is just an inconvenience in comparison. ",

            "answer_text": "Forget all about attending courses and paying money to be a better writer. Everyone who has something to sell, to boost their own coffers, not yours, will tell you that the only way to be a better writer is to go on course X, or Y. They're richer, you're poorer and the rewards are variable. Ask yourself if Shakespeare, arguably the greatest writer in the English language, ever went on a 'How to Write Killer Plots' course. Without question, he learned his craft by reading, by having an imagination (his mother would read fantasy stories to him and his siblings every day) and by having the willpower to make something happen for himself. Your question, however, talks about how to start writing. Here's a list that is not the only way to do it, but it helped me. 1. Start writing your idea down. It will be rubbish and it's supposed to be at this stage.2. Circle any names that appear regularly - you just got some main characters.3. Circle the places in your story - you just got the landscape of your story.4. Underline who does what to whom - you just got some action.5. If you've written why they do it, you also just got some plot.6. Leave your story alone and make bread.7. Whilst making bread, you'll realise that although you have the ingredients, your bread will taste like cr** if you don't knead the dough. Now you're thinking like a writer. Grab a separate piece of paper for each of your characters, your places and your actions. Add some detail from your growing imagination. If some detail crosses over, grab that other piece of paper and add it to that. Whether it's two people meeting at the same event, or sharing the same mother, or sharing the same secret, add it to their sheet.8. Start to write your book - you don't have to start at the beginning, but here's an idea. Write your first sentence. This is your bread in a shop window. How it looks before tasting is how well it goes down. Don't pay anyone to learn this; go onto Amazon and find quality novels recently published. Click the link above the book's image and select 'Look inside' button. You just got access to the best authors' first lines (even first chapters) - how they chose to really nail their reader from the beginning. Once you have written this first sentence(and it can change) you have gone from being a researcher to a writer.9. Your most important job as a writer is not to write, but to not give up on writing.10. Don't give up on writing - just because it takes time.11. Don't give up on writing - just because it's hard, infuriating and has caused some writers to commit suicide.12. Your book will take at least a year to write - seriously. Don't think you can drum it out over the Summer break. Your bread won't bake in 6 minutes. You need to keep looking in the oven and making sure it's nicely browned. But if you stand around staring at it, you'll get bored. Walk away from it every now and then - do something else - come back to it and make sure it's getting along OK. Similarly, don't leave it too long, or it will burn.0. Zero, not because thirteen is supposed to be unlucky, but because you should have been doing this from day 0...work out who your audience is and write for them. Market your book before it's written. This, above all other things, will determine whether you book takes on a life of its own and can be tasted, and liked, by others. 14. Read. For pleasure, not for 'research', but you'll soon discover that the dynamics of others' writing bleeds into your own (whether good or bad - so choose wisely).15. Don't give up on writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Practice your story-telling. Start with a short tale you think is funny or interesting or surprising in some way. Imagine how you would tell that story to a friend at a party. How do you grab the listener's interest? How do you introduce the characters without getting bogged down in back-story? How do you pace it and make it more dramatic (dialogue? action?), so they don't try to wander off to get a drink? How do you hint at what may be revealed without giving away the ending? Then do your best to write that down. Then, imagine the same story in your head as a television show or a movie. Start with something suspenseful or particularly interesting to grab attention and propel the reader/viewer to the next sentence or keep them from changing channels at the commercial break. Stay with one character's point-of-view to make things easy to follow and describe what that person sees, hears, feels, and thinks. Revise what you've written already to give it this more cinematic feel. Novels are big and can be complex, so start with a simpler story or maybe a scene from what you imagine as your larger work. Once you've written it. Set it aside for at least a few days, then reread it. If anything seems clunky or confusing, change it. Repeat until you are satisfied, then ask a friend (one who is honest and willing to be candid) or a writers' group to critique it and give you comments. Listen to those and incorporate the comments which seem to make sense to you. Repeat for the next scene. Short stories make sense as a start for most writers not because selling short stories is the gateway to becoming a novelist that it used to be, but because if you can't tell a simple story well, you will likely have difficulty telling a longer story with more characters, a more confusing timeline, more plots and subplots, and a greater need for compelling narrative and pacing to keep the reader engaged.

            "answer_text": "Looking through the answers others have given, I see some conflicting advice. Some say, \u201cJust start writing,\u201d while others say, \u201cTake some instruction, read some how-to books.\u201d You have to know your \u201cbig idea\u201d or you have to know how your story ends. You should work your way forward by writing short stories. Or not. The fact is, there are all different ways to write a novel. Some outline the bejeezus out of it before writing the first sentence. Others start with a character and a conflict and see where it goes from there. Some know what their story\u2019s about from the beginning; for others, the meaning of the tale emerges as it develops. For some, it\u2019s all about the \u201cnarrative voice.\u201d For others, it\u2019s \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d Which kind of writer are you? You\u2019ll find out as you try various strategies and approaches and decide which ones fit your way of working. It\u2019s learn-by-doing . What\u2019s the right advice? Whatever works for you. Me, I\u2019m self-taught, although I did read some how-to books at first and found them often contradictory. I sold several novels before I turned to short story writing. It turned out I could do both, although many writers are better at the one than the other. I almost never know how a novel will end, or what it\u2019s about, when I start. (I\u2019ve just completed one that turned out to be a tale of two characters wounded by life who find healing and completion in their unusual relationship; when I started to write it, I thought it would be a broad farce about a burglar haunted by a ghost). So, be prepared to learn as you go. Listen to all the advice you can get, including what\u2019s offered on Quora, then follow the recommendations that feel right to you and ignore the rest. There is no \u201cone right way.\u201d There are many different paths into the forest \u2014 and out again \u2014 and you have to explore and find the one that\u2019s right for you. My one piece of practical advice: finish your first draft. Don\u2019t keep rewriting the opening chapters, trying to make them perfect. The purpose of the first draft is not to get it right, but to get it written. Once it\u2019s done, you can see the shape of the thing and can start to work on making it better. ",

            "answer_text": "Start by taking a hundred sheets of plain paper. Stack them neatly. Now put them aside and start reading lots of novels. Not just those that you admire, but those that you think were terrible. But instead of being drawn in to the story, think of the determination it took to consider each and every word on the page. To write them, cross them out, agonize over the right words, the image you\u2019re creating for the reader. Think of how many different scenes, how many different characters, how vivid they are in your mind. When you\u2019re tired of reading, look at that stack of blank paper again. Consider that the authors of all those novels started with nothing but that, and they kept on writing, and even the writers of the terrible novels though they were writing something good. And remember that you\u2019ll probably need a lot more than one hundred sheets. If you truly believe you can do fill up all those sheets with words that tell a story, and a few more stacks just like it, and keep on going until you finish, then you\u2019re ready to start mapping out the novel you want to write. It\u2019s probably a good idea to have the end in sight at all times, although you can always change the novel\u2019s direction at any time. If you\u2019re not sure, then you\u2019re not ready yet and starting now would probably just give you a membership in the club of wannabe authors who all have a bunch of unfinished novels lying around somewhere. No shame in it, it\u2019s part of the writer\u2019s life. Most successful authors have a bunch of those, too. Once you know you\u2019re ready, and you start mapping it out, you can reach out to other writers for encouragement. There are writers groups on facebook, there may be a writers association or two in your area. Writers are generally interested in helping each other, because while we all know what the world\u2019s oldest profession is, writing is probably one of the loneliest, and only another writer understands.

            "answer_text": "At some point, you will have an idea and it will occur to you that it might make a fine novel. Your first step is to respect the idea. You do that by not thinking of the idea as just something that passing through your head and letting it bounce around. Take notes and flesh the idea out. Keep the notes with you and add to them whenever you find time. In time, you will decide you have enough notes. You will then want to make an outline. This is when you break your notes down into a distinct order and lay the groundwork for the chapters that will be in your novel. Some lessons in structure will come in handy \u2014 especially knowledge of plot, sub-plots, climaxes, and conclusions. You might even play with prologues and epilogues. Go read up. Then comes the first draft. This is a marathon race. You have your outline and now you have to do the actual writing. In my experience, this is the most fun part of writing a novel. It\u2019s not essential, but many writers find a routine \u2014 a certain place where they spend a certain part of the day writing a certain number of words every day. The idea is to get the entire story out of you in one go. Don\u2019t worry about quality at this stage as you will come back to the first draft in the near future. After you are done, you may want to put some distance between your draft and yourself. Take a break. Do something else. Travel a little. This helps you see your work from another person\u2019s perspective when you read it again. When you are ready, return to your draft. You will find you don\u2019t feel as strongly for the characters you created. Don\u2019t worry, this is a good thing. You will kill some of them, wipe some of them from existence, and even create new ones to occupy the newly empty spaces. This is all good. This is what second drafts are for. The first draft was you telling the story to yourself. The second draft is you hammering it into a shape that may be better appreciated by others. This is how you start anyhow. Later stages will take you to editors and readers, but all that comes later. ",

            "answer_text": "Start writing. Seriously. Okay\u2026there are more books than I care to think about out there that can give you all sorts of methods to write your own novel. So, my advice is my advice-take it as you will. First thing, start from the ending and work backwards. Especially if you\u2019re working on anything that requires you to have a specific ending. You want the two main characters to fall in love at the end of your book and have babies. So, how did we get there? Nobody wakes up one morning, walks outside, finds the first person of compatible sexuality that they can find, walks to the local county clerk/parson/priest/priestess, gets married, does the thing, and has kids. (Okay, maybe, but you better have a really good explanation as to why.) Once you have that done, figure out your waypoints along the way. Two people getting married. Before that, they have to decide why and how they\u2019re getting married. Before that, they have to decide that they like each other enough to get married. Before that, they have to get to know each other. Before that\u2026 So, figure out your waypoints. How you want to get from the first words to the end of your story. Then, write. Your goal is three fold. You want to- Work for about an hour a day, and at least five hundred words a dayGet it down nowWorry about everything else laterJust\u2026write. Even if it\u2019s just \u201cthis suck\u201d two hundred and fifty times. Even if you\u2019re going off on a tangent you\u2019re going to have to toss. Even if you think \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go back and add more meat to these bones,\u201d don\u2019t worry about that right at that point. WRITE. If you miss a day or two because life has been driving you mad, that\u2019s fine. Just, don\u2019t use it as an excuse to stop writing. Once you get to a point where you\u2019re nearing completion, say about half-way, find people to test-read it. Don\u2019t be around when they do-you want them to read it as \u201ccold\u201d as possible, so they can tell you where there are problems. When you reach the point where it\u2019s done, go through it a few times. Have people try reading it. DON\u2019T get discouraged, but figure out what you did right and wrong. Publishing. There are more books on how to do traditional publishing, independent publishing through Amazon, and the other options. Find those, make notes. Then, once you\u2019ve gotten it published-start on the next novel. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t want to be massively discouraging, but if you even feel the need to ask this kind of question, no you shouldn\u2019t. Lots of people think that they could write a novel. But apart from matters of craft, storytelling, etc., writing a novel requires immense stamina. You\u2019ve really got to get to the end, otherwise you haven\u2019t written a novel, you\u2019ve only started one. If you think you\u2019d quite like to write a novel and are hoping that someone will give you a few tips on how to get started, that\u2019s not how writers think. It\u2019s like asking a musician How can I start writing a song?, except that it\u2019s possible to write a song in a couple of hours; it\u2019s not possible to write a novel in a couple of hours. People who can write songs are able to think of a line, and another line, and then turn that into a verse, and end up with something worth singing. I can\u2019t write songs. Not memorable ones. But I can write fiction, and I\u2019ve finished drafts of more than one novel. (None of which I have yet made any serious attempt to bring to a publisher. But at least I\u2019ve written them.) You should only try writing a novel if you have, in your head, an image of the novel that you want to write\u2014and I don\u2019t mean a vague desire to write that novel, or an idea for a couple of characters, but an actual idea of what the novel is going to be about and how it will start, go on and end. Kind of like the idea that you have in your head of a novel that you\u2019ve already read: you know what it was about, you remember some good bits and good lines, you remember what gripped you and how it worked, more or less, but you can\u2019t recite the whole thing from memory. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like, in my experience, to start out writing a novel. You know what you have to do: it\u2019s a matter of turning that blurry vision into specific words, and you already know some of the things that you\u2019re going to do, in that respect. And you know that it\u2019s a matter of sitting down and working hard until you\u2019ve done it. What it\u2019s not like is: Hmm, maybe I should write a novel. Anyone got any ideas? ",

But I have good news! the first step I mentioned above is the real first step. The bad news? That step can be the hardest. Before you can start writing you need to be able to answer these questions: What genre is my book?You don\u2019t want to write a realistic fiction book that turns into a fantasy book halfway through, it\u2019s confusing and will just waste your timeWho is the main character(s)?And if you have multiple main characters: how am I going to divide their screen time? Am I going to write about character A chapter 1, and character B chapter 2?What is the main character(s) goal?Is it a short term or long term goal? How will they accomplish this? What obstacles will they face?What is the main character(s) personality?How am I going to portray this? What are the main aspects of their personality? Think if you\u2019re introducing your character(s) to people at a party what do these people need to know about said character(s).What about background characters?You can\u2019t write a book with just one character (well you probably could, but it might get boring) . Background characters don\u2019t need to be as in-def, but don\u2019t make them zombies, give them some personality.Once you have all these questions answered you have to think about the beginning, middle, and end of the book. Think about scenes your heart is bursting to create; these are your puzzle pieces, arrange them in our mind and try to think of scenes to fill the gaps. After you\u2019ve done all of that you need to plan when to write, and do it. Try to set deadlines if you struggle with this. ",

Any tips/ tricks?]\u201d Draft. If you check out my answers on writing, you\u2019ll find this advice returning all the time: \u201cDon\u2019t write a novel.\u201d Instead, start writing the draft of a novel. The draft is \u2018for your eyes only\u2019, so you can write it any way you want and in any order you want. I favour a typewriter, like this beauty:  The instrument doesn\u2019t really matter, as long as it gets you to bang out the words in more or less coherent sentences. Don\u2019t think too much about structure yet \u2014 many writers kill any impetus by spending too much time writing the \u2018perfect opening\u2019. Just start writing the scenes you\u2019re enthusiastic about, don\u2019t think about chapters yet, because that is for the later editing stage. You need to write the whole draft first, all of it. You\u2019ll find that when you have the whole story, it\u2019s much easier to find the right opening for your story and you can write it more easily, foreshadowing the events that happen later in the story. If you get stuck, put the scene aside and start writing another scene. You\u2019ll find that a solution for the other scene will present itself when you\u2019re not focused on it, but writing other scenes. When you have a collection of scenes, you can put them in whatever order you like best, then read them through to see if you need to write any transitions between scenes. You\u2019ll find, often, that transitions are not necessary anymore, as they were in the past. Nowadays, with people watching television and movies, the story can jump around without losing the reader, as long as you set the stage at the beginning of each scene. So sit your ass down behind your paper, typewriter, laptop or computer, and start writing a scene. And another. And another. ",

            "answer_text": "If this is the first time you are gonna start writing then it's gonna be an uphill task. You'll have to work too hard to get desired results. Sometimes it's easy to start writing a novel (when you're excited) it works for few people but not for many (if people start writing just like that because they were excited and wanted to write, they end up writing not more than a few pages) and then they drop it when excitment is gone. So Don't just start writing immediately when you're excited.Make a Plan, a check list and Track daily. Start reading simple books. See the way writers write. Start writing small pieces about random things (You have to be too good with descrptive writing and imagination). When you write about random things, write a page or two. Once you feel sure about writing a book.Choose the topic what you want to write about. (Read about that topic for a day or two).Divide everything in portions. Make sections (of the book you wanna write) 5/6 sections. Set the number of pages you wanna write on a daily basis (if you wanna write a book of 200 page, set a goal to write 5/10 pages (or how many you want, as per your daily schedule). Take breaks on a few days if required. But track it and work on it. Once you're done with writing. Reread and if you find any mistakes then do edits (chances are there that pages will get added or subtracted; depending on edits). You can add pages if you come up with better ideas (to improve some parts of the book).Show someone your work (maybe your partner, teacher, friend or any of your loved one) tell them to let you know if there are any flaws, if they mark any (and if you feel that person is right then reedit those parts) but do it only if you feel so or if it is really required because everyone has their own perception and your writing/book shouldn't be anyone elses perception.Few more things to Note-1.You must do it daily (breaks are okay)2.Work on your imagination and descriptive writings (to connect with readers)3.Know your subject/topic (personal experiences or learning makes it the best).4.Don't give up (even if takes more than the days you've planned).Hard work and proper plan makes everything possible.

            "answer_text": "Okay, buddy, as a fellow mentally-ill writer who can\u2019t get their shit together, I recommend any of the following: Literally just write. It won\u2019t be great, you might never finish it, but it\u2019s a start from which you might actually figure out things about how you function when it comes to writing. Option two is do some planning. Ask yourself what you want to write about. Any novel, even fantasy ones, talks about real world issues. Harry Potter, and I\u2019ll keep using it because everyone has at least heard of it, was not about wizards, but about prejudice, discrimination, courage, trauma, abuse and other stuff like that. Not saying it did it perfectly, but you can see it. When you figure out your message, you can go on to deciding what kind of character best tells your story (I wouldn\u2019t talk about LGBT+ issues using a straight dude as an MC, for example, because of obvious reasons). You also need to know what kind of world best tells your story. My WIP short story is set in a room above the sky with a glass floor. That\u2019s all. Because I\u2019m talking about how god is man made and can only see as much as man can see, hence the isolation and the window no bigger than that floor, and that\u2019s literally all I need. Then you decide the conflict that best tells your story. Apocalypse? War? High school crush? Murder? Always has been printing pentagrams on pads and your period summoned Satan? And then see option one, which is, literally just write. Another thing you can do, not as definitive work but to understand how you deal with the process, is try to improve or work off of stuff you\u2019ve read and liked, or read and didn\u2019t like. Yeah, I\u2019m talking fan fiction. No, you won\u2019t publish it unless it\u2019s public domain now, like Sherlock, but it\u2019s really, really useful, trust me. Creative writing workshops and classes probably won\u2019t hurt you, and they might help, but if you can\u2019t join one, don\u2019t beat yourself up or let that stop you. You don\u2019t need it. I hope you end up finding that happiness. c: ",

            "answer_text": "As a joke answer, I recommend you use Microsoft Word on a computer, not paper. Nothing beats a computer for writing books. As a serious answer, whether it\u2019s a blank paper page or a blank computer screen in MS Word, I know it can be intimidating. Here\u2019s my big tip. Don\u2019t try to just start writing your novel immediately. If you want to write one I assume you have some ideas about the genre at least. Maybe you even have a vague notion of a plot. Whatever ideas you have, jot them down as notes and compile these notes in a folder on your computer. If all you have is the genre and perhaps a subject within the genre, that\u2019s okay. Do some reading \u2014 research in the area of your subject matter. See what others have written in this area. Google it. Look at sources such as Wikipedia. Go into the Goodreads site and join a group where members read stuff you want to write about and join in the conversations. Keep taking notes. I think you\u2019ll find that eventually a more concrete plot will emerge out of these notes. When you start writing the actual novel, remember the story arc of most good novels. You need to begin with some action, begin with a bang, not a whimper. Set up a conflict that needs to be resolved. You need to have a main character (protagonist) whom readers can identify with. This person is at the center of the conflict. In many good novels there is also the chief villain, or Big Bad Boss. I actually like to model my villains after bad bosses I used to have before I started writing full time. I\u2019m thinking in a future novel I might model my villain after Donald Trump \u2014 changing the name to protect the guilty of course. Evolve the conflict to the point of a crisis where it seems the situation might be hopeless. Then think of a way for your hero (protagonist) to succeed against all odds, while not making it unrealistic for him or her to do so. Keep it real. On the other hand if your muse wants you to write a tragedy, you need your character to have a tragic flaw or flaws. S/he still needs to be someone your readers can identify with and cheer for so it will be gut-renching when s/he fails. But it will be understandable because of those tragic flaws. These are personality traits which are the root cause of failure to resolve the conflict with a happy ending. I recommend and other writers do too that you spend half of your writing time reading and taking notes on what you read. Good research will help you overcome writer\u2019s block and fear of the blank page. ",

            "answer_text": "Step one: have an idea. This could be \u2018I want to write a story about guilt and redemption\u2019 or it could be \u2018I want to write a story about people piloting giant mechs against equally giant dinosaurs\u2019. The former is called a \u2018theme\u2019. Pretty much everything that happens in the story comes back to guilt and redemption and the novel overall says something about it. Literary fiction loves this approach to writing a novel but a good theme is recommended in any novel. The latter, let\u2019s call it the story\u2019s \u2018premise\u2019, is also perfectly fine and is the kind of attitude that leads to franchise fiction, or generic romance novels (though usually with fewer dinosaurs and mechs), or hard-bitten action thrillers. This is the more fun and mass market end of commercial fiction. But, as mentioned above, a good theme is recommended, even if that\u2019s only a justification for the giant fighting robots. (The theme of the film Pacific Rim, for example, could be said to be \u2018unity as strength\u2019 or, less poncily, \u2018teamwork is good\u2019: the Jaegers require two pilots to work in harmony, the Jaeger project itself is a multi-national endeavour that is being threatened by individual nations cutting funding in order to protect themselves, and even the patriotically-themed star Jaeger crews only succeed when they coordinate their duels with their opposite numbers from other countries, and the protagonist\u2019s arc over the story is learning to work as part of a new team after his brother\u2019s death, while the two scientists learn to stop being rivals and combine their efforts against the kaiju. All of this is a justification for giant robots hitting giant monsters.) I often start with an idea for a cool (to my mind) story, only fleshing out the thematic elements later as the characters and plot develop. My first (unpublished, and probably in need of another polish before I send it to any other agents) novel started out as an investigation into a war crime in a fantasy setting. After the first draft, it became clear that the story was about conscience, the things that people do when they don\u2019t have one, and the sense of duty conscience instills into those that do. (I won\u2019t say it\u2019s an excellent analysis of those themes, but it\u2019s a good excuse for a story featuring demons and psychopaths and politicians, and it does tie things together a bit.) Step two: flesh out the idea. You\u2019ve got your theme and/or premise. You can either just start writing, or you can plan the plot out first. The advantage to the former is that you\u2019ve harnessed the energy and excitement you\u2019re feeling for a new project and are putting words on the page. Words on the page are important if you\u2019re writing a novel; whether they\u2019re good words can be judged later, when it comes to redrafting. The downside is that you don\u2019t necessarily know where you\u2019re going and you may eventually write yourself into a corner, or face-first into a wall. It\u2019s probably better overall to plan the novel before you write it, so that each scene leads onto the next, while you can also lay seeds in earlier scenes that foreshadow later events or character reveals. This can be painstaking, but it gives a good framework to lay your words onto. Think of your plan for the novel as being the poles of a tent, while the words are the canvas. Now picture that tent without the poles to hold it up. You can still sleep inside it, but it\u2019s going to be a rough night. A quick aside: JK Rowling knew how book seven ended even before Harry Potter got his first owl from Hogwarts. Meanwhile, George MacDonald Fraser wrote the first Flashman novel with no plan at all, merely inserting Flashman from Tom Brown\u2019s Schooldays into historical events and seeing how he avoided dying. My personal approach, as a writer without pretensions towards entering the literary canon, is to use that initial burst of enthusiasm to get words onto the page, regardless of where they might lead. I don\u2019t necessarily know how the story\u2019s going to end, or if I do have an idea for the end-point, I don\u2019t know what happens in the middle that takes us from here to there. My current project started with the basic idea \u2018a dwarf accidentally destroyed the world by digging too deep\u2019. What followed was a bit of post-apocalyptic grumpiness from a guilt-ridden dwarf with anger management issues. After about 10\u201315,000 words, or sometimes less, I get a feel for the world I\u2019m trying to write, and the plot of the story becomes clear. At this point, I stop writing and instead start planning the future events of the story, scene by scene, until I reach the end. Who the characters are, why they\u2019re doing what they do, and where they\u2019re going next becomes a lot more clear during this process. Step Three: Keep on writing. ",

            "answer_text": "It was 2014. National November Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) had just happened (thousands of people write a 50k word novel during the month of November), and my sister had done it: she\u2019d written a book. Everyone was so proud of her. I am incredibly competitive. I had vowed never to write. Perfection had owned me at seven, when I tried to write a story and couldn\u2019t get past the second chapter\u2013I thought it wasn\u2019t good enough, so I wrote it again and again and again. I never finished it. But I thought, if she could do it, why couldn\u2019t I? I had an idea. And it wouldn\u2019t let me go. So, on the night of December 23rd, 2014, I sat down and wrote that idea out. About three hours later, it was early morning, and I checked my word count. I had written ten thousand words. I was going to write a novel.  Since that night four years ago, I\u2019ve written nearly 500,000 words toward this novel. I\u2019ve loved it. It\u2019s a giant project that forces me to think, to explore ideas, to empathize with stories that will never be mine in order to write realistically. A lot of people might tell you to plot, a lot of people might tell you to \u201cpants\u201d it. I do both. I started with an idea. It burned on my mind until I got it onto the page, and then it grew, so I knew I had to write more about it. Over the four years of working on this thing, I\u2019ve realized a few things I wish I would\u2019ve done at the beginning: You need a character you\u2019re willing to spend a lot of time with. It took about eight months for me to name my character, and I stole his voice from another character whom I loved, who talked in such a specific way I knew I had to use it (I just couldn\u2019t let that character be the protagonist. He\u2019s pretty mad at me now). But you need a character. This character can be anyone.Choose their goal. What do they want most? That\u2019s their goal. It\u2019s something they want above all else, something they\u2019ll do anything to achieve. Their goal is even better if it\u2019s story-centric (sometimes if you dream up a bit of the story before choosing a goal, you\u2019ll get a more story-centric goal for your character). The goal is the most important thing about a story. It becomes the point of the story itself.You need a plot. But don\u2019t overthink it\u2013the plot is simply, How does this character think they\u2019ll get to their goal? This is the plot. This is their plan.Add stakes. Every excellent story has stakes. Stakes are the \u201cbefore something happens to stop the character from reaching their goal\u201d part. They should have a timeline (the \u201cbefore something happens\u201d). What will stop them from reaching their goal? Not just could, but what will stop them? Answering this question will help you create high stakes\u2013the best kind of stakes.Make the story. How do they actually get to their goal? This is the story. This is what you read.However, in all honesty, to write a novel, you really only need to do one important thing: write. ",

When I first started writing, I posted my stories in an email group, (this was back in the 90s) and I was fortunate in that another writer liked my ideas enough to offer to beta read my next story. See, my grammar was atrocious. I was in my 30s and it had been years since 7th grade English class and all of the grammar homework. I\u2019d actually been good at grammar back then, but 20 years of not using it left me so rusty, my writing practically creaked! My career is in healthcare and so the only writing I ever did was in patient charts and fiction is frowned upon. ;) The beta reader patiently pointed out my errors, showed me how to correct them, and even more importantly, showed what my strengths were as well. That gave me the confidence to continue writing. I sought out books on writing, found websites, and continued to practice. As others have suggested, short stories are a good vehicle to get your writing polished and find your voice. Some people over-write, where they add a ton of extra details, but my biggest problem was writing too sparsely. I had to learn to flesh out the stories. I used to have a hard time making a chapter longer than a thousand words\u2014now I have the opposite problem. However, I\u2019d much rather cut words because I have a lot more to work with and can hone the story, keeping what works and tossing what doesn\u2019t. I imagine sculptor would probably like to have a big chunk of marble to work with rather than the bare minimum necessary to chisel out his vision. What I love about writing is when a character takes the reins and takes the story to places I didn\u2019t expect. Write short storiesGet feedback (online or real life writing groups.

            "answer_text": "\u201cOnce upon time\u2026\u201d But seriously, you need to find your own technique. There are plenty of cheap books that you can buy that tell you this, how to plan chapters, flesh out characters, all that sort of thing. You can even get ideas for topics. My first novel I wrote the chapter that was most vivid and structured as a short story, then it evolved backwards to lead up the that chapter and forwards as the story progressed, it ended up as chapter 6! I suppose I did plan it out, but in my head, I used to take the scenic route to work, turn the radio off and just run through in my head, gradually honing and tweaking until I had something to start writing. I don\u2019t agree with starting with the end or the beginning, just start - the hardest thing is starting, once you have started writing you can then start worrying about what and where. I find it useful to have a list of points of reference, mine was the date the two leads met, I then calculated birthdays and other significant events from that.(This is all for my personal reference, not to go in the book, just helps me keep it realistic and consistent, so for instance a character doesn\u2019t have two birthdays in one year!). I also make notes of chapter headings to help plan how the story evolves and If I have ideas for later I write them now, even though it may be three or four chapters on before I get to them, just don\u2019t want to lose the idea. So you get a rough plan of where your story starts, who is in it, how it ends, and a rough idea of the journey between. It all depends what works for you, some I believe write the ending first and work back. The best thing in my experience is to write what is on your mind now, the fist page is the hardest, once you have started it will just go as it will, it is just that \u201cbreaking the ice\u201d as it were and starting. Word processors are great though, I do most on that, I only really use a pen for editing. When I was at school, and I hated writing by hand, I can\u2019t even read my handwriting, and then I would end up with most of the page crossed out and endless re-writes. With a word processor you can cut and paste, park and save bits to one side if you love the passage but it doesn\u2019t fit the story just yet, or at all but may make a good different story. I am a sort of hybrid though, I need to see it printed out to properly edit so I tend to write a chapter, print it and proof read and edit and mark-up changes. ",

            "answer_text": "If writing a novel is your dream, then you need to get started right away my friend because it is a big and challenging task, with many problems that await you. But if you are really up for it, then I am happy to extended my help ( being in the process of writing one myself.) CASE 1: NEW TO WRITING. If you are quite new to writing and haven\u2019t written a lot of stuff before then the path is as follows. Start writing short stories and poems. And do this for about an hour everyday. Ruskin Bond Once said in an interview \u201c Writing requires army discipline\u201d. And boy yes it does. Write a page every day. No matter how crappy it seems but keep writing. This is the first step to writing your novel. Once you have the discipline down, start writing longer and more structured stories and poems, and get them reviewed from DIFFERENT people. If they criticize, don't let it get to you, take it positively and Just keep writing. This will give you an idea of how you write. And mind it, these people should not necessarily be your family (as all they usually have is praise, even for shitty stuff :P) Now if you successfully get this done, then you really are interested in writing and you become a Case 2 writer. (as follows) CASE 2: HAVE BEEN WRITING FOR A WHILE. If this is the case then, follow these steps:- Get the central idea ready. You need to have a clear picture of what your story is, who it is about, in which world it is based, what happens at various points in the time line. WRITE THIS ALL DOWN. Changes in the story will happen but don't worry about it at this point of time. Just let the ideas flow naturally and organically.2. This step is about actually writing. There are many methods you can Follow, like the snowball method, it is basically what works for you. Google a list of different methods or just follow your own strategy. The only thing to be kept in mind is regularity and ORGANIC flow of ideas. These two steps are the essence of writing any novel and the rest of the journey becomes clearer as we progress. PS: Organic flow of ideas means that you don't need to force any instance in your story. If your initial story and your \u201cstory world\u201d is clear then instances will automatically start making sense on paper and your ideas will flow more naturally. Just be clear about what you are writing. Also, don't block and bias your thoughts to suit your story, you never know the gem of an idea you reject. Just harness the natural flow. ",

            "answer_text": "Choose your genre Every genre has separate set of readers. So, first choose your genre. Research on your target audience Before you pick a paper and pen, first know your target audience. Know how your target audience has reacted to the recent novels in your genre. Study your target audience. Know exactly what they are looking for nowadays. Convince a unique story Your story must be unique in all aspects. Every story you read is similar, yet different. That \u2018difference\u2019 is the uniqueness of the story. If your story is not unique, then it will be just like a raindrop in an ocean. Even though there will be millions of books in the genre you write, your book has to stand alone. Example: The Hobbit, A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones), and Harry Potter Series. These three belong to the same genre \u2013 fantasy, but the content of the story is unique. That is why these books are considered great by critics and audience. Prepare story outline It is absolutely necessary to prepare the story outline. You must know the flow of your story, where it is starting, how it proceeds, how it concludes. A well-drafted outline clearly reflects the essence of a story. Create compelling characters Characters are the blood and spine for every story. Your characters must be interesting, unique, and attractive. Always concentrate on each character\u2019s story arc. They must be realistic and connect easily to the readers. Don\u2019t add some characters because you like them, your readers must like them, your readers must fall in love in them, your readers must be inspired and idolize them. A strong character has a strong background. Don\u2019t create single line characters. Example: Even if a character is pure evil, there must be different shades of evil. Don\u2019t just show that character as only evil. A realistic character is not always evil. Your characters must sound realistic, move realistic, and talk realistic. When the story proceeds, the character must also move forward. A character must not be same in the end, as it was in the beginning. Structure your story with checkpoints Checkpoints are mandatory. While writing your novel always keep check points in the story, so that you can navigate easily. Even keep checkpoints in the chapters, so you will not get deviated. Keeping checkpoints will help you to measure the length of your novel, and how long or how short you are about to finish your work. Set a goal \u2013 Daily, weekly, monthly. Writing without a goal is like running with eyes closed. Set a goal clearly. Set a realistic one. No one can finish an entire novel in a week. Setting realistic goals and achieving them will boost your confidence. Finish the first draft Your first priority while writing a novel is to finish the first draft. First draft is the rough idea of what you have in your mind about your novel. Don\u2019t refine the first draft without finishing it completely. If your novel has 18 chapters, finish all those chapters in the first draft and then start to refine it. Don\u2019t look back or modify the content while writing a first draft. If you do, you must understand you got yourselves in a quicksand. You will be stagnated in the same place, it will become difficult to move forward. Revise! Revise! Revise! A first draft is not the final material. After finishing the first draft, refine it, write a second draft. Write many and many drafts until you are satisfied with your story. Revise! Revise until your eyes ache. Revise until you are confident enough to say \u2018I don\u2019t need to change a single letter.\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, do a lot of reading of good novels. Nobody teaches us how to write. You can go to a workshop, take a seminar, get a few pointers, but no one really teaches us how to construct a novel, make exciting characters, etc. You can only learn through reading how other writers have done it successfully and by starting to copy them then letting your imagination flow into your own ideas, thoughts, and emotions. My favorite writers are Mikhail Bulgakov, Salman Rushdie, Gabriel Garcia-Marquez, Annie Dillard, Victor Hugo, and Shakespeare. Shakespeare was not a novelist, but I think he is the go-to man for learning the full potential of the English language. This is how I approached my first novel (which I threw out because I didn\u2019t like it and the premise was eventually unworkable) as well as the one I am working on currently. 1. I get ideas for some characters, then I make notes on them, think about them a lot, do some psychological research and research on the location they are in, maybe some history, and make lots of notes. 2. Then I imagine the characters in situations with the other characters and what kinds of stories might come out of that; then my plot comes out of that. I get a lot of ideas away from my desk or computer. I carry a notebook and a pen wherever I go, because it seems a lot of ideas come to me whilst I am on a walk. 3) I copy all my ideas into my computer and rearrange them to make a plot which is chronological and which has every event being caused by the prior events. 4) When all the events and thoughts are in chronological order, that is my outline. I then work on each event in the outline, fleshing them out with description, dialogue and action. I do a lot of rewriting on the spot before I move to the next section, making sure that I am making each section ripe with tension and meaning. After I have finished the entire book, I reread and rewrite many times, thinking about what themes I have written unconsciously and how I might be able to add a line or symbol here and there to bring that theme out. I do a lot of wild writing that Natalie Goldberg talks about in her books. There is so much information and so many ideas that are in our subconscious that are waiting to come out if we only pay attention to them. Especially if I am stuck on a scene, I do a lot of wild writing on it to get to the heart of the matter. The Art Of Fiction by John Gardner has been very helpful to me. It is the best book on writing stories and novels that I have ever come across. Don\u2019t write to sell, don\u2019t write to become famous or rich. Find ideas and emotions that grab you in your gut, which put a taste in your mouth, and write about those. Write only with the mind to bring to light the full potential of your thoughts and ideas. That is how you will become a good writer. If your book is meant to sell, then it will. All the best!

            "answer_text": "Open a Word document right now. Type down every idea you have and include every detail that comes to mind. Give the file some appropriate name (like Novel Draft), and add to it continuously. Think about the story and what you\u2019ve already written as much as you can throughout the day and night, and constantly update and revise what you have. Novels have a lot of dialogue, so constantly be on the hunt for witty, clever, or entertaining things to say\u2014even if they aren\u2019t directly related to the plot or the themes of the novel. As a first-time fiction author, you want to shoot for anywhere between 70k-90k words (to increase your chances of getting a deal), so you will likely find some way to work most of these ideas in eventually. I cannot stress the importance of actually typing these things out, because doing so will help the ideas take better shape in your mind. Also, humans are very forgetful creatures, so don\u2019t expect to remember the brilliant idea you had yesterday if you didn\u2019t write it down. When the file has gotten sufficiently full with content, start organizing the ideas into sections, and start to build an outline from that. As the file gets bigger, you will need to create new documents to best keep track of everything (Novel Ch. 1 draft, Novel outline, Novel Dialogue Ideas, Novel Characters, etc.) Little by little, you\u2019ll start to see the vision of the book more clearly. And guess what? You\u2019ll already have tons of ideas and lines of dialogue to work with. It is exactly like doing a puzzle: at first there are tons of pieces and they all have cool shapes and colors but you have no idea where any of them go. But as you begin to place things where they belong it becomes easier and easier, and the image you are trying to create comes better into focus. Oh, and one more thing. Be obsessive. This is your chance to make your masterpiece. Give it all you have. And know that it won\u2019t be easy or happen overnight. Great works of art take time. But when it\u2019s all done, you\u2019ll feel a deep sense of pride and accomplishment, and you\u2019ll deserve it. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A 2 A, A novel is a piece of art. It is a story that embodies its own truth, just like a masterpiece painting or sculpture. The difference is that your medium is words rather than paint or stone. Just like the painter, your style and approach needs to be yours alone. Sure, anybody can buy a paint by number set and create a painting, but that is not art, it is merely an exercise in the skill of painting.Some painters will sketch in pencil, or use a photograph as a starting point. You can do the same thing to create a novel. Many professional writers will draft a plot line, story arcs, outlines, character sketches, backstories etc. tons of work before they get to the storytelling, which is really just filling in the details and connecting the dots.I have been a storyteller for a long time. One of my favorite past times is to sit in a public place, say a food court at the mall, a public park, a library or maybe a train station and watch people. Then I will pick someone, maybe they seem sad, or distracted or are just really attractive, whatever. I then start creating a story around them. Why are they there, at that time, dressed that way. Where are they going, what is happening in their life? I create my own back story for them. It's like starting from a photograph.Tell the story behind a real life event. Imagine how and why it came to be.Sometimes I will start from a story someone tells me. I could just narrate it as creative nonfiction, or I can use it as a jump off for something completely fresh. My last novel was created in that manner. A woman told me her story. It was absolutely horrific, involving years of violent sexual and domestic abuse. I could have written her story as an essay or journalistic piece, but instead I decided to use it as the underpinning of a novel about courage and redemption.At some point, the painter has to put brush to canvas and start painting; same thing goes for writing. If you are going to write a novel, you have to write that first word, then the second, and so on. I know that before I wrote my first novel, I had no idea if it was something I could do. Did I have the stamina to write something over 60,000 words? I remembered struggling to write a ten page short story back in school. I just had to try. And you know what? I discovered that I really love writing! I love the whole process, the thinking, the research, the writing and the revision process, all of it. I'm not so crazy about the getting it published aspect, but I accept that as part of the process. Maybe I'll get a new agent who makes it easier.But I must say, that even if I never published another book, I would still write, just because I love writing.Tell a story. It might start off as a short story, maybe even stay as that. Or it might grow into something more. Many award winning novels start as one thing and kind of morph into something else. Tell the story that makes you feel something. If you tell a story that makes you laugh, chances are others will laugh too. If you tell a story that makes you weep, others will be moved as well. Draw your reader into your story so that they see it and feel it. That is the difference between reporting and novel writing.One more thing, be more careful with your writing. I mean this as a kindness rather than a criticism. In your question, you made two grammar errors and a spelling mistake. If you are going to be a writer, that kind of laziness will not serve you.Good luck. Work hard and create art every day. ",

            "answer_text": " Steps: Write down your plot. I use an Excel spreadsheet, characters across the top, chapters down the left hand side.Do some research to fill in anything you might need. I set my novels/novellas in foreign countries. I love to learn about new places. My current WIP starts in Kyrgyzstan SILK ROAD. I\u2019d never heard of the country before 3 weeks ago.I plot, it makes the writing go smoothly. I learned that from a very prolific author Russell Blake of the JET series. I actually started my fiction publishing career with XPOSED in conjunction originally with Kindle Worlds. I\u2019ve since moved into my entire series called Code Raven and spent today on an airplane from Puerto Vallarta Mexico to Miami, Florida plotting the 7th in the series. Russell taught me this technique. You can download the any of the stories and dissect them. I\u2019ve used this formula (even though I didn\u2019t realize it at the time) for all my novellas and now my fiction novels. But not everyone plots\u2014Stephen King says he NEVER plots.Start writing.If you can\u2019t do the part above, start writing your thoughts down. Visualize where you want to go.I listened to an interview with an author the other day\u2014I can\u2019t remember which one, but famous\u2014who says he does one thing when writing. He writes the ending first. How cool is that?!Good luck Faye and whatever you do, start writing. It will take you places you will never have imagined. ",

            "answer_text": "This is quite the popular question. Every writer has a different method to begin their project. You may have to experiment with a couple before you find one that works for you. first, you have to have an idea or concept of the story you want to write. Once you do that, you should lay out some form of an outline as to how the story will progress. You can certainly modify this while you are writing. What I find works best for me, however, you will need to find what works best for you, is I lay out all my chapters and I name them. The reason I do this is because it helps to keep the storyline on track and flow smoothly. With that said,, as your story progresses, you are going to write subplants and add additional characters, But they keep you on track and not get too far out in left field, I find that name in my chapters helps me to keep my story flowing. Good luck and all the best. As a point of interest, because I received so many emails through my website and questions through this forum, I created a set of tutorials on a learning platform called you to mebut they keep you on track and not get too far out in left field, I find that name in my chapters helps me to keep my story flowing. Good luck and all the best. As a point of interest, because I receive so many emails through my website and questions through this forum, I created a set of tutorials on a learning platform called Udemy.com. There are different modules and they are all quite inexpensive. But it brings the new and inspiring writer through the whole complete book writing process which includes concepts, character development, story development etc. It also goes on to speak about marketing and advertising your book. The preview the modules is completely free. So if you want to preview them you could choose to purchase just the modules that you are interested in. If you go to that site just take my name, Caesar Rondina, in the search bar, and all my tutorials will come up. This is not a statement to try and sell or advertise my courses since I answered your question. However, to embellish deeper on it, would take pages in an email response. Thank you for your question. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "To quote Mary Poppins: \u201cWell begun is half done.\u201d It sounds like you are overthinking it. The process of writing a novel is indeed daunting, but if the story you have in mind is fully formed or compelling enough, it will not be as difficult to follow through once you\u2019ve begun. While many people start novels they never finish, the fact that you are going through the trouble to ask this question on Quora suggests to me that you are taking a methodical and well-planned approach to your novel and are not, as some say, \u201cpantsing it.\u201d If you are truly this personality type, the hardest part will be beginning. Once something is on the page, your main struggle will be to not get caught up in editing as you go. While that works for some writers, a meticulous personality will be more likely to finish the project if he/she punches out a rough draft without looking back, which they then can treat as the rough rock from whence their novel is carved. The carving process is actually very enjoyable for those of us who are perfectionists, so you can look forward to that part:) To sum up, my advice is start already! Write a scene from the middle first if you can't decide where in the story timeline your novel should begin. Or you can even write a backstory scene that won't appear in the book as a way to familiarize yourself with your characters and further develop your voice. Don't worry too much about the rough draft, though. They're supposed to be rough! Just write SOMETHING. That will get you rolling. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I love all the advice you've been given and, it's really good advice to take. I just thought I would add a little to it. Since you have an outline of sorts, in assuming you know all your characters? If so, write a poem describing each one. I say poem because, in my opinion, they are easier to edit. Plus, again in my opinion, they are great writing practices. And it helps character development which is crucial in a great story. I say poems also because they are great for developing writing tools. You have to learn meter, rhythm, and rhymes (if you choose to use them). They are great grammar exercises, believe it or not. Learning how to break up lines, where to put commas, puncutation, and where to put metaphors, analogies, and descriptive words all build your grammar usage. You can also research the different types of poetry. You can write an Acrostic (first letter of every line spells a word) using the letters of the characters name. Or an Epic poem about your hero/heroine. Free verse would be easy to get you comfortable with writing poetry. Haikus and Tankas will teach you to stay focused and cut the needless words with their tight syllable counts. Great teacher of editing too. Once you are comfortable you can try one of the many more difficult types just to keep up your practice. Trust me. There are some even the best poets won't date to attempt lol. In my opinion, writing poetry is a good place to start. It's one of the easiest, in word building, to get you off on the joys of writing. There are so many ways to write poetry. And there are so many rules. But, like with anything creative, it is up to the creator where to take the piece. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you have an idea / plot? Your dreams of writing a novel will go much smoother if you do. Do you have a beginning, middle, and end? All three parts are crucial. Do you have an outline of the story so you know where the \"beats\" / plot points fall during the course of the novel? This might help. Some people write \"by the seat of their pants,\" make it up as they go along, and then go back to polish the story later. Some outline all the major (and sometimes even the minor) details. Some, like me, do a combination of both. Do you have characters to overcome and provide the conflict in your plot? Again, these are crucial to you having any hope of writing a novel? Do have a lot of time? Writing a novel takes a considerable amount of time. Weeks at minimum, but possibly years. Do you have an understanding spouse / family / boss / group of friends? Be prepared to not have much time to socialize or do your best work at your non-writing job if you're committed to writing a novel? Do you have a good amount of savings and a well-kept home? Be prepared to live off your savings if you don't have another job. Also, home repairs and chores will often fall by the wayside while writing your novel, so I hope you don't need to repair a roof, install a sink, or even mow the lawn anytime soon. Do you enjoy spending nice days outside, going to parties, seeing movies, or binge watching TV? Get ready to stop doing all three because you're going to be too busy writing your novel. It's that easy! ",

            "answer_text": "Most writers know enough to put in sensations beyond sight and sound. It\u2019s always great to read about a character who takes note of the hot metal-and-oil aroma that lingers over the rails after a fast train has passed, or the weight of a new tweed coat on his shoulders. Agents and editors love the five senses, but they want and expect more. They want physical business that deepens not just your setting, but your characterizations. Here\u2019s the key: The best authors use body language in their narratives. Odd thing is, I have never once heard an agent or editor comment on my (or any author\u2019s) use of body language, and I think that\u2019s because it goes by so smoothly it\u2019s almost unnoticed. Yet it absolutely gives texture and depth to your work. When it\u2019s missing, fiction feels flat. Begin by reading up on body language. You\u2019ll find that two things are at the root of all of it: anxiety (or lack thereof) and hidden desires. Dwell inside your characters and sense how they feel in any given situation. Take an hour and write a one-sentence summary of your novel. Something like this: \u201cA rogue physicist travels back in time to kill the apostle Paul.\u201d (This is the summary for my first novel, Transgression.) The sentence will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This is the big picture, the analog of that big starting triangle in the snowflake picture.When you later write your book proposal, this sentence should appear very early in the proposal. It\u2019s the hook that will sell your book to your editor, to your committee, to the sales force, to bookstore owners, and ultimately to readers. So make the best one you can! ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone has a different approach to writing a novel. Judy Gill\u2019s approach is very different to mine. I need to know where I\u2019m going. So I first sketch out the story idea. Then I expand on the growing plot, explaining who the characters are, their relationship to each other and their motivation. Then I expand on that, adding more detail. Pretty soon, I\u2019ve got a scenario taking place that I can divide into three acts. I begin to get a feeling for the flow of the story, its peaks and troughs, pacing and intrigue. At that point, if I\u2019ve really got a feel for the whole story, I might write the opening chapter. But it won\u2019t be a honed chapter. It will be a taste of it, the hint of blue touch paper, what\u2019s really at its heart. After that, I would recommend getting into the opening three chapters. They won\u2019t be perfect, but you will have opened up a path for yourself. From then on in, I can\u2019t advise you, because it totally depends on the nature of your story. All I can say is, don\u2019t rush it. And be prepared to re-craft the entire novel when you get to the end. Because by then, you\u2019ll understand far more than you did in the beginning. Many novelists write seven or eight drafts. You won\u2019t need to change the basic plot; you just make it better and better, with moments of inspiration, until it\u2019s as good as you can get it. Go at it. You\u2019re probably going to starve before it\u2019s published, but hey, nothing\u2019s easy. ",

            "answer_text": "You should just write first. I remember when I wanted to write a novel. Mostly, it is just the passion that drives me, and believe me, there are lots of things that would challenging this passion. The words which you feel just right at the mouth but you can not write it down, the struggle that you sit before a computer for an hour and you could not write three hundred words, and those frustrations you get when you think about this long journey which can not be seen to the end, all those same things would keep challenging what you do consistently. But the story is just lying in your heart, you know you will write it down despite everything. When most people who start writing finish their first novel, they would get a little cocky, feeling that they are the best writer in the world. If you do feel that, please enjoy it, it is okay and it will not last long. Onc you finish it, believe me, it is not going to look good unless you are a genius. At least that is what I get for the comments.Back the time then, I did not feel good about the bad comments, but this would not stop me, because I already love the journey to write. Besides the frustration, I get a huge satisfaction during this, and this urge of being good drives me to keep writing. Writing the story out to the world, that is really a fantastic feeling. I hope you won't miss it, just start writing. All those grammar mistakes or whatsoever, it is kind of important, but you don't need to worry about these before there is absolutely no words. So just write, you will love it. I am not some famous writer, and I wonder that maybe I make some grammar mistakes here (English is not my first language). But what I said is the true experience of mine, I hope it can help you. This is my first answer in Quora, and believe me, for me, it is really the moment that I should and want to keep in mind. Thanks for asking this question, my interest of writing just drives me to answer it. And if I don't, it is not feeling right. Oh, and wish both of us would be real famous writers:) ",

I then realized that I had a story to tell which was much more interesting and entertaining than a lot of novels that were out there. When I decided that I wanted to write a novel, I had a basic idea about the story I wanted to tell. I was traveling on work and away from family for about a month. I formed a routine for that month and after coming back from work, I just sat at a desk in my hotel and typed out the story which I wanted to tell. About 60% of the novel was complete before I came back home. Establishing a routine to write is very important to complete what you started. It is also very important - especially for first timers - that you find a story you really want to tell. That was the only thing which enabled me to start and even complete my novel when all the glamour associated with writing had gone away and I was staring at this white sheet which I had to fill. If you write a story you don\u2019t feel strongly enough about, why would people even want to read your story. If you don't have a story worth telling, then you might as well stop wasting your time right now. If you have a story worth telling and you combine it with love for writing, you will succeed The story I wanted to tell needed to be told differently - first person accounts of events and emails. The format emerged from the story I had to tell. I tried different narration styles, but they weren\u2019t telling the story the way it needed to be told. It had to be how it ended up being \u2013emails and first person accounts of events by different characters in every alternate chapter. When I was struggling to get the narration style and structure right, I joined a three week in residence \u2018Just Write\u2019 fiction writing workshop back in 2011 in Bangalore, where I got a chance to learn the nuances of and hone my story telling skills from authors Anil Menon, Anjum Hasan and Rimi Chatterjee. I did not worry too much about editing at every opportunity - it would have prevented me from telling my story. I finished up on the story I wanted to tell and then worried about editing. I did not worry either about having that immaculate grammar or language skills when writing. They developed as I wrote. I read and re-read books and novels which I loved which went a long way in helping me improving my writing and language skills. I asked myself these questions when I was writing my novel: What is the the special story I want to tell?Am I happy with what I have written?Is this how I want to tell the story?What is different about the story I want to tell?And why should people read my story?Writing a book has been an experience which I would cherish for the rest of my life and I am glad I went through the process. I will leave you with a quote from Maya Angelou which I feel is apt here - \u2018There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\u2019  ",

            "answer_text": "Spend as much time as you can improving your writing skills. To do this, you have to read and write a lot. You should be spending time everyday reading and writing. Be sure to vary up what you read; don\u2019t just read in the genre you are interested in writing. Try to absorb good writing from everywhere you can. Take note of what makes for good writing and for a good story. Study writing and always strive to learn and improve. Write everyday. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is necessarily. It can be a short story, novel, poem, journal entry, or even a Quora answer. Just be sure to write everyday. If you don\u2019t know what to write about, write about not knowing what to write. Having someone read and critique your work may help you, so consider reaching out to other writers. Look for people more and less experienced than you. Look for someone you can teach, and for someone that can teach you. These connections will allow you to learn more. You could also just have a friend or family member read your work. Remember you want them to critique your work. Remind them that you don\u2019t want generic compliments - you want real advice that will help you improve. This means you can\u2019t take their criticism personally. Rather, you must appreciate and evaluate it. And know that it\u2019s okay to reject their advice. You have to determine for yourself what you need to change to improve the piece. But regardless of how useful their criticism was, be sure to thank them for their time. Other things that may help, yet are not necessary, include pursuing a creative writing or English degree and attending writer workshops. Yet if you want to hone your craft, there are two things that are necessary: reading and writing. And you will have to put the time into it everyday. Do this, and you will certainly improve. Remember to stay patient; writing can be a fun and adventurous, yet it can also be exhausting. There may be days where you find it extremely difficult to write. You may become frustrated and disappointed. You may begin to doubt your ability to write, and you may grow to hate everything you\u2019ve written. You may simply not feel like writing. Push through those feelings, and keep writing - it\u2019s the only way to improve. Remember that you write because you love it and that being good isn\u2019t a requirement. And go back into the piece with a clear mind, and an objective: improving it. And if you want to be happy: take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating healthily, exercising, being around people you love, taking time to relax, and by doing what you love. ",

            "answer_text": "Just start writing from any of the worst or best experience you have had in your life. For example, if you had a good love story in school. Write from the time you met. Or if you faced worst years in your college. Say Engineering. Write from the day you entered into that college. And just keep writing. Write all your experiences. All the lessons that you have learnt and all the things that you feel should be known by other people. Write about everything that you think isn't proper and needs to be in some other way. When you will write something which isn't right, your mind will try to struggle with the replacement of something better with it. And for that, you will automatically start researching. Not just in case of engineering college, I am talking about any other issue. Religion and mythology. Political sciences. Policies, laws and bills. Government and economics. Everywhere this same principle applies. So write. Write all you feel, and all you think should be known by other people. And Look, you never know what will turn into a novel. And what will turn into a mere garbage. And even if you create a novel, you never know what will publishers like. Many a times publishers reject a manuscript even when it is beautifully written or extensively researched. They reject because they fail to find such pieces making well in the market. To them, writing is a pure business. But you create such a masterpiece that could flourish even without shooting by a mainstream media. A traditional publisher. Give your best. For example: Amish Tripathi was rejected by almost every traditional publisher of our country. Because they didn't feel that mythology will survive in the market. But then, Amish believed in his work, and he finally self-published it. Today, the same book has sold over 2 million copies! So you just write. Don't think whether it will turn into a novel. Or whether your dream publisher will accept it or reject it. Just start writing. And by the time you will finish one page, you will get a story of another 5 pages. By the time you will finish writing 5 pages, your mind will produce ideas for the next 10 pages. And this cycle continues till a beautiful novel is born. I hope that will be enough for kick-starting your work. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Ernest Hemingway was once asked by a college student, \u201cDo you make an outline of your novels before you start writing?\u201d Hemingway said \u201cNo, I just start.\u201d I have a draft of a novel on my desk. I had an idea in my head of what this book would be about, who the characters would be\u2026..all based on events I\u2019d experienced and people I knew. An idea came to me of a conversation that very well could have happened. Using the inflections and attitude of real guys I knew, knowing what they\u2019d say and do in such a dialogue, I just started with \u201cI\u2019m not driving for you guys.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what you do,\u201d Dan said, looking at me sideways. Don\u2019t be afraid to begin by jumping right into the midst of talk or action, or even stream of consciousness, interior monologue. This is something that Hemingway bared to the world for the first incredible time in literature. Thoughts that flow constantly through EVERYONE\u2019S mind. For a great example of interior monologue, read Salinger\u2019s \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye.\u201d Fantastic! A mind\u2019s conversation with itself should be natural and easy; never stilted! By the way, small writing tips. Never begin a sentence with \u201cThe.\u201d Instead of\u2026.\u201dThe cat jumped off the table and ran out the door\u2014\u201d Write\u2026\u2026 \u201cLeaping off the table, the cat fled out the door\u2014-\u201d Avoid like death the word \u201cThat.\u201d Write realistic dialogue, not contrived. Listen to the way people talk. I\u2019ve done it since childhood. Even today, in the grocery store, I listen to random people yakking with each other. It fascinates me. Don\u2019t use profanity gratuitously. Use it as a part of real language and/or dialogue. Metaphor and imagery, when used correctly, can be powerful! A turning-word or phrase will be \u201cLike a\u2026\u201d or \u201cAs.\u201d\u2026\u2026.. \u201cHe came through the door like an angry gorilla!\u201d Ending and starting paragraphs is WAY more important than you realize. As soon as your prose shifts gears, hit return/enter and begin a new paragraph. On Quora I see people\u2019s answers with long blocks of uninterrupted narrative. Paragraphs give the reader a split-second chance to rest their brain. Hemingway wrote with great economy. Don\u2019t waste a word or a sentence. And don\u2019t use big words just to show off your vocabulary. You may know a million words and their meanings, and love them. But don\u2019t clog up your prose with multi-syllable favorites\u2026\u2026 my hero Hemingway was once criticized for not using descriptive adjectives like his contemporary, William Faulkner. Hemingway responded simply: \u201cI know the words.\u201d ALWAYS see your writing from the perspective of a total stranger with your book in their hands! Never be afraid to start a novel! If you\u2019ve got a story worth telling and you think it might sell, go for it. Avoid like the plague writer\u2019s block. Beginning a novel is rough\u2026.but once you start, your creativity will flow out on the screen/paper. Kinda like stepping into a lake, thinking the water will be cold. Then you wade out there and hey, it\u2019s not so bad. Not sure if it\u2019s still around, but check out Writer\u2019s Market, geared towards How To Present and Sell. Find out how book publishers accept new writer\u2019s work, in what format, and the first steps in approaching a publisher. Never get it in your head that what you\u2019ve dashed off is golden and untouchable. Put it down, come back in a few hours and you\u2019ll see mistakes and begin editing. Fine-tune your writing with 2 or 3 drafts, without over-working it in such a way that your original spark becomes muffled. Remember, book publishers have editors who will go to work on YOUR work. ",

Once you find an idea you like, decide what type of story it is. A true (nonfiction) type, or a made up ((fiction) one.

You know, first person, third person omniscient, and so on. Those things that your English or writing instructors will typically teach you about. English grammar books would be helpful for you in order to learn more about that and any necessary mechanical things you might need to learn like sentence structure, comma usage, run on sentences, and so on. And about grammar usage. As you write remember to write like you are showing your readers what is going on rather than telling them. Especially if you are writing fiction. And do not get overly descriptive. This should help you get started a little bit. I hope this is helpful to you. Oh and you can write your novel in pen in a journal if you just want it for yourself. But if you want to write it for the public, consider using a laptop, tablet, or computer, and a word processing program like Microsoft Word. ",

There is no better way to understand what a novel is, and what different strategies in creating a novel are. Once you have done that, there are two ways of writing a novel\u2014either plan it out, beginning, middle, and end, and write to the outline, or start with a situation and characters and let them evolve. (Either way, I\u2019d second the suggestion to figure out what the end should be.) I think that writing to a plan is probably a better discipline, particularly for a first novel. I would add that, unless you are writing for your own satisfaction and don\u2019t care about an audience, you ought to bear a few things in mind: Have a definite plot and don\u2019t get sidetracked.Shoot the sheriff on the first page\u2014not literally, but make sure that you have something in your first few pages to involve the reader\u2019s interest.Don\u2019t neglect the details of the setting\u2014don\u2019t try to write a novel about life in a law firm unless you know how a law firm works.Characters are more than a physical description and a few attitudes. Remember to look at them at people. One trick is to write a short bio of each of your characters. Make them psychologically plausible.Enjoy it. ",

If she\u2019s not surprising you, you can bet she\u2019ll seem flat to your readers. One exercise I always do when I\u2019m getting to know a character is ask her to tell me her secrets. Sit down with a pen and paper and start with, \u201cI never told anybody\u2026\u201d and go from there, writing in the voice of your character.Give that character a compelling problem. Your character has to have something that\u2019s going to challenge her, torment her and propel her forward. At the heart of every story is conflict \u2013 whether external or internal, make it a good one, and remember that this problem is going to shape your character, leaving her forever changed.Make things happen! You can have the greatest characters in the world, and write beautifully, but if nothing\u2019s happening, the story falls on its face pretty quickly. In my books, I make sure something important to the plot is happening in each scene. And if there\u2019s a scene in there that isn\u2019t helping to move the story along in some vital way, I cut it, no matter how great it is. When I\u2019m editing, I\u2019ll go scene by scene and write a single word sentence describing the action on an index card. Then I lay the cards out and I\u2019ve got the bare bones of my story. I can see if things are moving forward, if I\u2019m throwing in enough twists and turns, and if there are scenes that just aren\u2019t pulling their weight. ",

Don't worry about grammar or punctuation that much at this point; get your thoughts down on paper. Write as much as you possibly can at one sitting, without interruptions. Go where the spirit moves you. Remember, you can always edit it out. I've used this general method for years, whether a short article or something a lot more involved. Yes, it's tough to get started, but once you get your get your ideas down, it really does become easier, more like a \u201cfill-in-the-blanks\u201d series of opportunities to express yourself and tell a story. After all, that's what you will be doing: Crafting a well organized story complete with exciting characters, twists and turns, maybe some sex, and then a wonderful ending. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Read over your compositions,and where ever you meet with a passage you think is particularly fine,strike it out.\"-Samuel Johnson You have a desire to write,desire will take you a long way provided you supplement it with a few routine habits.The art of writing like with many others comes with effort,practice and flair(don't let negativity get the better of you with the last one). Firstly,keep this in mind,you must get into the practice of being highly creative and not letting rules,convention and tradition limit you.Most people often find themselves restricted by using text editors on their PC's to start writing so if you fall under such a category then grab a pencil and a notebook immediately!Now you have the right approach,mindset and physical requirements to get to writing but do not have a solid and original idea?As a matter of fact,this is the point in time when many potential writers decide to stash away their ideas in their mind havens.Although there maybe a propensity for snatching ideas from other books and other forms of media,I urge you to refrain from such acts of plagiarism. In order to avert such tendencies,spend time looking around you and begin creating characters you would want,begin thinking like them, sketch them elucidating their idiosyncrasies.  If you're perplexed as to where you would want your story to take place,it would be best you start with places with which you are strongly acquainted,say your hometown or city and all the places that particularly inspire you and that may seem ideal to the situation your plot describes in even the subtlest of ways. It is a beneficial practice to routinely make notes as and when ideas and twists in plot come to you.Also,it is encouraging to share your idea with a friend you trust or even your parents or any interested layman you may encounter on a bus or train journey(however ridiculous that may seem). When you start writing,you may feel compelled to turn it into a fully fledged novel.This pressure may prove negative and you would instead be better off by aiming to just tell your story,eliminating anything superfluous.Thus,even if it ends up becoming a short story or anything shorter than that, don't be disheartened,instead share it with others around you and you might be surprised of the praise it soon gathers. As for the literary aspects, Use a lot of direct speech as it helps the reader create images of dialogue as he reads.Be descriptive of people,places and even the tone of speech,the weather etc. but do not be excessively descriptive as that can put off many readers.Figures of speech,phrasal verbs and idioms enhance the literary value of a piece of writing but avoid anything that edges on becoming a clich\u00e9.From here,I'm sure intuition,inspiration and experience will guide you as you progress.All the best!

            "answer_text": "Come up with an idea. Before you begin writing your book, you will need to have an idea. This is the seed from where your book growsResearch your concept. Once you have a vague concept, start researching to get more ideas. For example, you want to write a book about kids playing a futuristic video game. Do some research by going to arcades, reading up on the latest game innovations, and playing some games yourself. In doing these activities, you may see or experience things which give you ideas for what the story can be about or could be included in a story. Develop your concept. With a few ideas about what could be included in a story, you will want to develop your concept. Make the concept more complex by following it to its logical conclusion, thinking about what might result from the set of circumstances, or anything else to make it a more complex idea. Having a more developed concept will help you build your plot. Consider your audience. When coming up with and developing your concept, you will need to consider your audience. Whom are you writing this book for? Different people are into different things and there be particular sets of experiences and prior knowledge to go with the various demographics. You will need to consider this so you understand how to proceed with the plot, characters, and how the book is written. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two ways to write a novel:  1. You already know the story.  - Outline the story into chapters - Write your first draft as if it is the most epic creation. Don't think or worry about what you are writing. Just write. - A schedule helps to ensure that you complete it. - Once you finish writing it, keep it aside for a week or two. Then come back to it and review/rewrite/edit. Quick tips: Ensure you have a story arc. Google if you don't know what a story arc is. | Adverbs and adjectives are usually flab. Slash them whereever unnecessary. | Do a minimum of five to eight edits. Word count worries should come by your fourth edit.  2. You don't know the story but have a starting point or an inspiration.  - Start writing. - Identify what works for you: writing for longer stretches or writing a minimum word count everyday. Write. - Same tips on first draft, rewrite and edit as above.  A few things you will need to research and practice: Character mapping, Writing outlines, Setting (Place, era, etc), Plot Some novels don't have plots, but they are well written. All resources are available online for free.  You will also need three people who can give you honest feedback, preferably individuals who read a lot or other writers. If you don't have anyone, then there are some companies who provide literary reviews for a certain cost. Alternatively, you may find freelancers for a lower cost.  Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "You need to know what is going to happen before you write the book rather than decide what will happen while it is in progress. That will help you avoid a first pitfall (what do I write next?) and leads us to the next item. 1. Synopsis. You need an out line of your story, a few brief paragraphs with small detail on beginning middle and end. 2. Use a working list of chapters, detailing how you would like each one to go and for the novel to progress. You may also have a forward and afterword or other things to add. 3. Make a list of important details that can cause your novel to be inconsistent if forgotten, thereby making you look clumsy. You do not want to say that Sally drives a blue Chevy in chapter 1 and (having forgotten about that detail) have her drive a red Toyota in chapter 7. Make a list of character names and birthdays, what they drive, who they married, where they live, what they do and don't like, etc... so you remain consistent. In fact... 4. It is a good idea to write a brief biography of each of your characters before you even start writing. Know them and know your story before you even begin. There is more, but some of these preparations are a matter of personal taste and experience as well. The point is, if you take the time to make these preparations beforehand, things will go much more smoothly. I have learned this the hard way. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by a \u201cnew\u201d writer. Does the extent of your writing consist of essays and other papers you wrote for high school and college? Have you written any blog posts, answers to Quora questions, or perhaps some news articles for your college or local newspaper? Or are you a veteran writer who just hasn\u2019t written a novel? I ask because if you have no writing experience beyond what you may have done in high school or college, it\u2019s best if to get some before starting a huge venture like a novel, or you might be setting yourself up for failure. Find some places to write, perhaps on Quora or another web site that suits your interest, and spend time getting a sense of what it\u2019s like to write every day. Spend a good half hour to an hour a day or more, if possible. Have someone who\u2019s familiar with good writing read your work and make suggestions on how you can improve. See if you actually like writing, because it\u2019s not easy, and not everyone enjoys the process. Once you\u2019ve gotten comfortable as a casual writer, there\u2019s nothing wrong with trying your hand at a novel, perhaps a short one of 50,000 words or so. That\u2019s how long my first novel was, and it currently sits in the proverbial bottom of my desk drawer, never to be seen or read by anyone again. That\u2019s probably where your first novel will also end up, unless you\u2019re really lucky or talented, but it\u2019s still worth trying. My tips for getting started are below: Make sure you\u2019ve read lots of novels, but not just any novels. Read novels in the genre you want to write about. In my case, it was alternative history, so I read some alternative history novels to get a sense of how they\u2019re done.Before starting to write, research your topic. Mine was 9/11 and the hijackers, so I read lots of non-fiction books about the attacks and the people behind them and became something of an expert. This wasn\u2019t hard for me, because the topic was so interesting (which is why I wanted to write a novel about it in the first place). If you don\u2019t feel like reading some non-fiction concerning the time and and place your novel is going to cover, you\u2019re probably not all that interested in writing about that particular subject. Consider something different.Some people like to write Victorian novels, or novels about Roman times. Others want to have their stories take place in some foreign, exotic location (or even on another planet). That\u2019s fine, but remember that people reading the book will probably have some expertise about those times or places, so it helps to really know your stuff if you want to seem credible. The guy who wrote The Martian did a great job of portraying the planet based on our current scientific knowledge. I\u2019m an astronomy buff, so I was pleased to see he got things right. If he\u2019d made mistakes describing Mars, I might have put the book down.Read books about how to write a novel. I don\u2019t think I can mention any here without running afoul of the site\u2019s rules, but there\u2019s a very valuable one about how to write a novel in 30 days that\u2019s by far the best I read. I\u2019m sure you can easily find it. That book had advice that really resonated with me, which is, make sure your novel keeps the reader hooked. You can make mistakes with character development, grammar, plot twists, etc. and get away with them. But if you can\u2019t keep readers turning the pages to see what comes next, you won\u2019t get anywhere.For beginning writers, it\u2019s best to write about times and locales with which you have some familiarity. I\u2019m a lifelong Chicagoan, so I placed part of my book in Chicago, which helps give those scenes authenticity and local flavor (hopefully). For scenes in Afghanistan or New York, I did some research to try and make them seem true. Whether I succeeded is anybody\u2019s guess.The best advice for the actual writing process is to commit some time to it every day. Sit down and just tell yourself you\u2019re going to spend the next hour writing. As you go along, day after day, it sometimes helps to revisit whatever you wrote the day before, read it and edit it, and then go from there. Doing so can jump-start your brain and help you get into the writing mode. It also can give you ideas for the plot, because you may see threads that weren\u2019t evident for some reason in your previous writing session. Also, consider getting out of the house and writing somewhere far from work/family distractions. I wrote the majority of my book at the local coffee shop.Don\u2019t skip a day, if at all possible. You\u2019ll lose your rhythm. Commit to writing 1,000 words to 1,500 words a day, and hold off on something you enjoy (a snack, maybe, or a TV show), until you get it done.Anyone starting a novel benefits from having previous writing experience, even in non-fiction. I happen to be a journalist who\u2019s written for a living for nearly 25 years, so writing came naturally to me, though fiction writing is very different than non-fiction and I had a steep learning curve. Write whenever you can, even if it\u2019s a blog or online book reviews. Quora is an excellent place to give your writing muscles a workout, as well.The first novel you write is likely to end up, like mine, in that proverbial desk drawer (or computer file), but the process of writing it is invaluable and will put you on the road toward success the second or third time. Devote yourself to the process and don\u2019t quit.",

            "answer_text": "Apart from 'just start writing', which is good and common advice. Try to have more of a plot before hand, research what goes into a basic 'three act model' as a good starting point. Now some writers are what's termed 'pantsers' they 'fly by the seat of their pants'. They just start writing and see where the story goes, most pantsers will also acknowledge this makes for a longer editing process after the first draft. So the choice is up to you, there's nothing wrong with being a pantser or a plotter. Personally, after having done a stint at 'pantsing' for my first novel, I like to start with a brief outline of where my plot will go. I also like to write a synopsis before I start writing. This is an outline of what happens in the story, as if you were asked to condense the whole book into a few pages. I like to do this because reading it out or even sharing with other writers helps me notice the really big plot problems before I start writing tens of thousands of words. Once this is done I start writing the first draft. When you really get the hang of writing, you'll be able to finish a book in a few drafts. But the first book is always the hardest, so hang in there! If all else fails, this quote from number one selling novelist Nora Roberts helps me, \"You can't edit a blank page.\" So write, even if you know it's rubbish. The beauty of writing is it can all be changed at a later point. The more you write, the more you'll develop a system that works for you and the better you get at it (though writing can never be called easy). When you're done with all of this and have a first draft in your hnads, ask us again how to edit\u2013\u2013that is a whole other story. :) ",

I sat for hours staring balnkly at my laptop screen, I had a strong urge to write something, but I didn't know the 'what' and the 'how'. I wrote and I deleted. Sometimes, the sentence formations were not correct, other times I felt I wasn't able to express what I wanted to convey. Days passed and I was still stuck. Then, I summoned google to my rescue. I asked, how can I start writing? I read number of related articles and there were a few things that all of them had in common: Just write. Whatever you can, however you can. Start it. Find a peaceful corner (your room, balcony, terrace, garden, anywhere where you are all by yourself) and just get things out of your head, pour it down on that blank page, imagine a situation in your mind, get into the character and let the words flow. Set a target for a day, and write everyday. Also, when you write, isolate yourself from the rest of the world, keep your phone aside, switch off the internet on your laptop. Dedicate the assigned time just for writing and getting things out of your head. And, you'll come up with something. Work on the sentence formations later on, when you've completed the draft. When you are just not able to write, take a break. Spend time in reading. You never know when something you read rings an alarm in you head and clears the blockage. Lastly, be patient. Rome was not built in a day. This quote always inspires me to write:  Every writer faces a similar situation, just have the audacity to never give up. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many methods favoured by different writers but nothing should ever be set in stone because writing is so subjective. Among the many ways described by tutors, the one I\u2019d favour (personally) is a building model: First, you have your idea, so you\u2019ll write that down and come up with a synopsis: the whole story on a page or two (this is one of the things an agent or publisher will ask for). Then a chapter plan: A bullet point list of chapters and what will happen in each. You might also have a brief biography of each of your characters. Most important though is the actual novel (obviously), which ought to be easier to write piecemeal with the first two stages complete. When it comes to writing the novel itself, my personal preference is to start at the beginning (some writers don\u2019t) and let the narrative dictate. I\u2019ve already written the ending in my head, so I know what I\u2019m aiming for and roughly when. Using my novel Cyrus Song as an example, I knew I was going to need 20+ chapters, which turned out to be a 400pp book. Top tips: Make sure you include all that you wanted to from that bullet point chapter list you made. And keep an eye on dates and chronology: know what day you\u2019re in when you\u2019re writing. Above all, enjoy writing. The last thing it should be is stressful. Chill out and you\u2019ll write a better book. Get friends to read bits you\u2019ve written and give you feedback, but beware sycophants. Join online groups and forums, get to know other writers and ask them for advice as you\u2019re going along. Don\u2019t aim too high. There are tens of thousands of us writers, very few of whom will make a living from what we do. Most of us do it for personal enjoyment (and some of us for therapy), and knowing that we\u2019ve written something which will survive long after us. Good luck and have fun :) ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018How should I start novel writing?\u2019 It depends why you want to start a novel. Is it the money? You have a slight chance of being the next Rowling or King or Dickens. But in all honesty, you have more chance of winning the lottery. Or of being knocked down in the street by Lord Lucan, riding Shergar. [*] However, you\u2019re entering the field at an interesting time. There used to be three broad descriptions of fiction writer. (1) For hire \u2014 you\u2019re the one they go to when they want a novelisation of a famous TV series, delivered on time. (2) The mid-list \u2014 you never make a million, but you can hope to make as good a living wage as elsewhere; enough to keep you in socks and pay the mortgage. (3) The bestseller \u2014 people will buy your shopping lists, never mind your books, and pay gold for them. Then\u2026 this is a very broad-brush description, you understand \u2014 the publishing industry, for reasons way too complex to go into, decided to model itself on selling cans of baked beans. Instead of leaving books in print to gather support by word of mouth \u2014 and we know how important that is for sales \u2014 they gave them a short time to sink or swim, and put them out of print. Or moderate sales over a long period were no longer good enough; everybody had to be a bestseller. If those cans don\u2019t move off the shelf, people don\u2019t want those beans! Given that there are novels which will appeal to moderate sized groups of people, and continue to do so for generations, without ever being bestsellers\u2026 well, those got deep-sixed, as you might imagine. And now we come to modern publishing, in which self-publishing has ceased to be what it was once called \u2014 \u201cvanity publishing\u201d \u2014 but has become a solid way to start a career. I\u2019m not certain it\u2019s a way to start a career that\u2019ll pay your mortgage, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the revenant mid-list. However, it is the way things are heading. Unfortunately, it also means that traditional publishing can now pay authors much less than they once would have done, for work of a quality which should deserve a living wage. And the problem with that, you say? Is that you get a lot more people having to write in \u201chobby time\u201d, while they earn a living at another job. Which is not fine. There are certain kinds of concentration which require writing novels to be your main occupation. This is why, in Britain, there is a long tradition of novels being written by people of a certain class, who either had, or were married to, an independent income. Try Virginia Woolf\u2019s essay, A Room of One's Own, where she says that \u201ca woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\u201d. A room, that other people can\u2019t come into and demand her time. And money, which purchases that time. (A man must have them too, but they\u2019re still easier for him to get, just about.) If that hasn\u2019t put you off starting a novel\u2026 good! You shouldn\u2019t start writing a novel by thinking about money. I know a few people who do, but the vast majority of writers I ever met wanted to write a novel because they loved writing. Well, maybe not the actual writing. Having written, that\u2019s very good. You\u2019ve wrestled the many-tentacled beast of a story into a form of words, and you feel the satisfaction of victory. A few quick questions. Do you read a lot?Do you fantasise a lot \u2014 by which I mean, do you tell yourself stories?Do you love words? (Words as opposed to pictures, words as opposed to sounds.)When somebody asks \u2018why do you want to write a novel?\u2019, is your answer something along the lines of \u2018\u2026because? (implied duh!)\u2019Have you already written something, or snippets of something, but you\u2019re ashamed to admit to it?Or you have this idea that, if you could just put it down on paper\u2026Because unless you love words and stories, and it\u2019s self-evident to you that they \u2014 and producing them \u2014 are a satisfying thing to do\u2026 You might want to ask yourself if novels are exactly what you want to do. Assuming your answer is \u2018yes\u2019 to many/any of the above\u2026 You can start by writing, you can start by planning, you can start by staring out of the window and muttering lines of dialogue to yourself. All that matters is that you start, not how you start. Here\u2019s one possible way: If you \u2018don\u2019t have any ideas\u2019, as some people say, start your writing day with a pen and paper, and \u2014 without stopping to think \u2014 write down words for 30 minutes. It doesn\u2019t matter if you spend two pages writing I have no ideas. Or fuck this for a game of soldiers! If you free-associate long enough, you\u2019re likely to come up with something that tells you what\u2019s on your mind. Maybe a memory from when you were six. Maybe something on the morning news. And then you can spend a few hours asking what if?, seeing if there\u2019s a story idea in it. If you keep this up for days and weeks, don\u2019t be surprised if you produce paragraphs that could be the start or end of a story. They won\u2019t all be something you\u2019ll want to write. But you will have accessed that part of you that has Ideas. Why do I say write with a pen? (Or pencil, I\u2019m not picky.) I feel it has a different effect on the creative process. And before you say bollocks!, there are some differences noted \u2014 this references a study that students writing lecture notes with a pen get better results than those typing the notes: \u201cthey [the students writing in longhand] took fewer notes overall with less verbatim recording, but they nevertheless did better on both factual learning and higher-order conceptual learning.\u201d Ink on Paper: Some Notes on Note Taking* I\u2019m not aware of any studies on creative writing versus creative typing, but just from personal experience, I feel it\u2019s something to try. There can be an amount of processing, I suppose you\u2019d call it, that goes on between nib and page, that doesn\u2019t between key and screen. And if it turns out not to be the case for you, you can always go back to typing! I hope some of this helps you.  [*] Google it. I\u2019m not explaining an old-timer\u2019s jokes. :)  Tl;dr \u2014 when anybody tells you there\u2019s one thing you have to do, remember Kipling: \"There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays, \"And every single one of them is right!\" Only for god\u2019s sake don\u2019t do it for the money\u2026 ",

Remember, the audience is the best critic you can have.Don't write something that will impress some xyz person. Write what impresses your soul. Writing a novel just as a medium to please a random person doesn't usually work as a success.Do take a survey or read and research about the protagonists or the background set of your story.

            "answer_text": "Writing a novel is not only about expressing your thoughts or just fulfilling a wish . It's about preparing a piece of art which satisfies the writer as well as readers to some extent. To write well , before you start off you need to prepare yourself a bit . Since a novel is a long piece of writing it isn't that easy a task to prepare a story with such fine details to this extent unless you develop the power to literally live in your story . To develop such a vivid thought processing one must start off with reading ; extensive reading of whatsoever interests you the most .While reading you'll realise in which direction your imagination tends to grow or how deeply you can connect to a particular theme. Also reading more and more widens your scope of creativity and lets you think clearly of how to organise ,shape your thoughts and put them into words comfortably. After you believe you are done with this step , don't jump directly to starting off with the novel . Now you need to practice writing , you may start off with short articles and stories , this will help you gain confidence and realise if there can be any scope for improvement. Gradually think of increasing the scope of content while keeping in mind it's relevance . Then you may move onto starting with the novel. Hope this approach helps you to work well on your dream and you may be able to achieve it soon ! Best of luck . ",

            "answer_text": "It depends solely on what kind of writer you are. There are, basically, two kinds: The planner And The improviser\u2026 or the pantser\u2026 If you\u2019re more of a planning kind of person then write out your plot using The Triangle: You draw a triangle (WHO NU????? =P)You label the first corner A or 1; the tip-top B or 2; and the last corner C or 3.A (or 1) is the beginning. This is where the story starts (i.e. girl meets boy).B (or 2) is where the action is at it\u2019s highest (i.e. girl loves boy and confesses\u2026 what happens next???)C (or 3) is where the story ends (or, the falling action) (i.e. girl and boy get married). If you really want to get technical (like I do lol) then you can have A, A1, B, B1, and C. You could go throw all the numbers and just label them as key plot points/twists/etc.You then break your plot down into the bare minimum (take away all sub-plots and plot twists) of three. The beginning, the climax of the story, and the end. Then, once you have that, add in your plot twists, sub-plots, sub-stories, etc, etc.And voila! you have your plot planned out neatly; then you can jump into character sketches and writing. If you are more of a pantser and prefer to write before planning (mainly to get the feel of the story) then this is what you can do: Write. Just write at whatever part of the story intrigues you most. Write until you hit a point where you need to plot plan with The Triangle.Then, after you hit that point, go ahead and complete The Triangle.Then go back to writing or to character sketches (character sketches are MANDATORY for awesome, consistent characters!)Honestly, it will take you a long time to write a novel, I have been writing one story for almost a year and it\u2019s still a novella. If you aim small, you\u2019ll get the big stuff in the end. If you write a basic fifty page story from start to finish (really, that is nothing - fifty pages is hardly any time to get into the story) then after editing you\u2019ll have seventy-five, then\u2019ll you\u2019ll notice what characters need more developmental processes, what events need more lead up, what plot-points need more time, and then you\u2019ll have 150 pages. Don\u2019t expect to have a novella in three months (unless writing is your full-time job lol), and don\u2019t expect perfection right away\u2026 because you\u2019ll be disappointed. Good luck with your writing! And may it take flight and fly to beautiful, beautiful places! ",

            "answer_text": "I recommend outlining the plot. It may not work for you (everybody is different) but I close my eyes and try to visualize a scene from my novel like a scene from a movie. I even \u201ccast\u201d my characters with the same actors I would like to play them in the movie adaptation of my novel. Every item in my outline becomes a chapter in the story. The easiest entries on the outline are the necessary steps the hero has to take to reach the conclusion. Then we must add the false steps and red herrings, because unless our hero is God, he or she can\u2019t be omniscient. It\u2019s like drawing a road map for your story. Basically I start with an idea\u2026what action has motivated my main character to do what I plan for him or her to do? My novels typically begin with some action (usually a murder, or some other criminal activity) and the end is always the final resolution in a climatic scene, usually a showdown with the villain of the piece. But in between is the art of connecting the dots\u2026how does our hero become involved in the story, and how does he or she bring about this resolution? We not only need a compelling and plausible explanation for how we reached our conclusion, we need to show how our protagonist got there, both metaphorically and literally speaking. We need to create that trail of breadcrumbs that leads us from the witch\u2019s house in the forest to safety, the birds that eat those breadcrumbs and spoil our best plans, and then some clever twist or action that gets us to our happy ending, unless our story doesn\u2019t have a happy ending. But we still need to have some idea for how the story ends before we begin trying to tell it. Even if we decide to change the ending\u2026the point is to have a destination in mind when you begin to tell the story. In the novel I\u2019ve been developing, initially the resolution was going to kill off several characters, according to the first outline. But now the plot has changed to the point where the conflict is resolved without a major bloodbath, because it all works. The outline can be changed. But I have to have some idea of where I\u2019m going before I get started, or I\u2019ll get lost in my own plot. ",

            "answer_text": "You answered your own question. Start writing. Now. Ian Fleming wrote Dr. No in one month while typing away in his home in Jamaica. One month. 4 weeks. Didn't re-write a word. That's inspiration for you. Don't anticipate the end. Let the story take you there. That's what Stephen King likes to do. He enjoys writing the book as much as his readers do reading it. He likes to be surprised where it's taking him. It's why he cranks out so many best sellers. He's enjoying the journey as much as his readers are. Most writers do much the same. So get onboard, fasten your seat belt, and let the writing fly the plane. That's why I enjoy writing. On the other hand, former crime beat reporters like Michael Connelly and John Sandford know their subjects well which is police procedure and the judiciary system. It makes their Harry Bosch and Lucas Davenport novels so authentic. You don't have to write what you know and you're certainly not chained by the old \u201cshow not tell\u201d adage. Many bestsellers don't follow that advice at all. Dialogue should be just as people speak, not how your grammar school teacher instructed you how to speak. People often don't speak in complete sentences. They speak in contractions. They volley back and forth during conversations. Here's a hint. Use, \u201csaid\u201d more often such as, \u201cWhat business are you in\u201d, he said, rather than, \u201che asked\u201d. For any kind of statement, \u201csaid\u201d is better than describing how he felt making the statement. ",

Then you could start to write about those people and those places. Once you've sketched out those, write about links between the people, and write scenes placing your people in those places. That'll get you started. You could also start with \"I want to write a novel but I do not know where to start.\" And then explain why you want to write a novel, what you want it to be about--what and who and where; why what, why who, why where. Explain how you intend to write the novel, how long it will take, how many pages, how many pages a week, how many drafts, how you will know when it is done, and how you will market it when you are done.

Before I give you those, I want to say that I genuinely believe that there is no way to answer this question in 3 to 5 paragraphs, which would be appropriate to Quora. Every writer has to feel out and discover their own process, and this is done by trying, over and again, to write. To write different things, in different ways, in different surroundings and under different circumstances. The only general advice I can think of that applies to everyone would be: set aside specific writing time, and tell the people you live with when it is. Initially it should probably be between one and two hours. But this will also evolve. Here are my two \"standard\" answers: The first is this free advice: Book Writing: How to Write a Book Starting Today | Narrative Path. The second is my new writer's course, Read Worthy Fiction, which is also available through Narrative Path, currently only if you have a Narrative Path Library Membership, however it will soon be available to everyone at a fixed fee.

Carry a small notebook with you at all times and write down any words, sentences, or descriptions that come to mind. Have an idea of what genre you'd like your novel to be. Envision where your story will take place, as well as what the characters who will populate your novel will be like. Think of a central conflict and branch out your story from that issue. Make an outline and conduct any necessary research. Establish a writing routine that you can stick to on a regular basis, and create your first draft. Self-edit, share your work with a few others, and revise your draft until you feel satisfied with what you've created! Things You Should Do Before Starting Your Novel: Write the story you'd most want to read. Don't write a story just because you think it might be a bestseller . ..Begin with character. ...Give that character a compelling problem. ...Make things happen! ...Make it believable. ...Stick with it the project. ...And lastly: Ignore the rules",

If the story is not yet completed in your head, do not start writing. There must be a core story in order to start writing a novel. The main story has to be finished in your head. What do I want to write about? Who will I be writing about? Where and when? Even, why do I write? Everything that goes into it. No more doubts along the way, apart from the regular adjustments you\u2019ll certainly have to make. Only then the by-plots can jump in. You can either choose to write the story backwards or constructive, i.e. from the beginning. It is recommended to do what you think is best for you. You\u2019re building on a story yourself and you have all the time to come up with the best story of all time. To write the all-consuming novel/book. At least, that\u2019s how I reason. Each time you write, work at the same time of the day. Pick your moment to write. Follow your instincts. Do not model yourself after another person. Try to be unique, tell your own story. Let your own emotions be your driver. Especially as a writer. Lock yourself from the outside world and work hard on creating a personal image. Where people recognize you from, is what I mean, e.g. the stylistic elements you like to use. It\u2019s very simple to discover yourself while writing. In short, you should write a lot. Write until you won\u2019t utter a sound. And read, read, read, of course. It makes you wiser. Books make you a wise man. Read as much novels and other fiction as you possibly can, however, only write when you\u2019re fully ready. I can give you tips, we can all give you tips, I suppose. But maybe you shouldn\u2019t have read these tips, since writing is this long road of finding your own way. I guess I can only tell you where to begin. Happy writing! Peace. ",

Every New Year, people resolve that this will be the year they lose weight and get in shape. Many of them get bogged down in the details: should I lift weights or do cardio? Yoga or Pilates? Eat a low-carb or low-fat diet? Paleo or keto? At some point, you just need to move more and eat less. If you stay consistent, you\u2019ll see results and you can adjust your routine to fit your goals. And if you want to write a novel, you need to pick an approach, get in front of your computer or pull out your notebook, and get to work.  \u201cBut what if I take the wrong approach?\u201d you might ask. \u201cWhat if I start down one path and it turns out not to be the right one?\u201d A. You\u2019re better off picking the wrong path than picking no path at all.If you want to be an author, you\u2019re better off writing a bad novel and having the opportunity to learn from your mistakes than writing nothing at all.

And I\u2019m currently writing a novel where I wrote almost all the scenes in the story first, then went back and put them in the right order. Nothing is irreversible when it comes to writing. Every writer has a different style. And lots of people have shared great ideas for writing styles on this thread. The only way to find out what works for you is to pick an approach that looks good and go for it. The only way to write a novel is to write it. ",

Then I have the character try to solve the problem. When I start I have a good idea of the charter/setting/problem, and some idea of the final resolution of the problem (climax of the story). The hard part is solving the problem (the plot). I usually do a brief outline. The protagonist needs to try to solve the problem and fail. This makes the problem worse. He/she needs to gather their resources and try again\u2026and fail. This makes the problem a matter of life and death. Now the character needs to gather what resources are left and try on last desperate time to solve the problem. If they succeed you have a happy climax. If they fail you have a tragic climax. The outline keeps me on point as I work my charter through the middle of the story, and keeps me from letting him/her wonder up blind alleys. If you WANT to write a novel, you must have some kind of an idea. Create a character that would be faced with the problem you imagine and put him/her in a setting. Start by writing the opening scene of your novel introducing these elements. ",

Inspiration first, possibly analyze what you find wrong in the world today, or whats wrong in your life, and then start planning your characters and world on how you want to convey this. A good rule of thumb however is to not insert only your opinion strongly insert also insert the other opinion at its best arguments. For example say you are making your world be a dark place, crime is unstoppable, murder rates are at sky high levels, ect, It would be more interesting if you inserted a group of character or a charter into such a world who are inherently good, from here you can create more emphasis on your point of view by say having these people or person getting mugged and killed or killed in a hit and run. Basically be create with the story. Planning is key however there is a wiki article I have used which details planning techniques for writing a novel (How to Write a Novel). The creative process you must find for yourself, while taking some tips from others; but keep in mind this is your story convey what you wish but keep the language pretty and vivid (as that is where literature exceeds in comparison to other forms of entertainment.

If it\u2019s your first novel, that time and place will probably end up being your setting, just because we tend to write what we know, and the places we know best make the best, most detailed settings. Then, consider the people that pique your curiosity. What makes them interesting to you? Maybe you\u2019re fascinated by greed, or betrayal, or addiction, or codependency, or delusion, or aggression, or gullibility. Whatever the thing is that fascinates you, that will probably be the guiding character trait of at least one of your main characters. As those character traits emerge, the characters will follow. And when the characters emerge, you\u2019ll start to see a connection between them. And in that connection, you\u2019ll start to find some conflict. When you\u2019ve got your conflict, you\u2019ll have the beginnings of a plot. ",

            "answer_text": "Primarily, you must know the characteristics of novel as a genre of writing fiction. Read the following first: The defining characteristics of the novel genre include a long, fictional story comprised of characters, events and actions that have a definite beginning and an eventual end. The novel genre has several sub-categories that include historical novels, mystery novels and romance novels. Novels are stand-alone books or books that are part of a series of novels The main characteristic that all types of novels share is that they are written to entertain their readers. Novelists -- people who write novels -- use forward-moving plots to engage their readers' attention and make them care about the well-being and fate of the main character or group of main characters throughout the book. The novel genre is based upon the suspension of disbelief that a reader must invoke to immerse herself in the book. In other words, since novels are not real, the reader must accept the fictional story as plausible in order to remain engrossed in the story. Novelists keep their readers engaged by creating characters, places, things and events that mimic real life or fantasy situations that appeal to a specific demographic. For example, romance novels mainly appeal to women readers, while historical novels appeal to people who are inherently drawn to the past. Learning it seriously, you read novels of great writers as much as possible. When you will grab all things you will learn yourself that writing novel is not an easy task. However, you should start with writing with short stories. ",

Don't worry about the first sentence, minute plot points, whether you know how it ends or whether you think you're a good enough writer, just write the thing.  Writing a novel requires innumerable edits, so the end product may not even resemble much of the first draft. That's fine, but you have to start somewhere. Later you may decide you work best when you have a more involved outline or character profile, but writing in itself is how you come to find yourself as a writer.  I spent years working out the details of my first novel before I felt comfortable enough to write it, and I realise now that was too much. In the end I would just start typing and discovered the story and characters on the way. It ended up being a far more interesting ride this way anyway. It's just the first draft. Get it out of your head and onto paper. It's the first step that not everyone who wants to write a novel will ever even get to. ",

Think about the paper in front of you. How are you going to fill up this one sheet of paper? Writing. And then you start. Got a character? Start by describing his backstory in three words. Got a setting? Start by telling us how it changes through the seasons. Most of all, don\u2019t think of it as a novel. Think of it page by page and, well, before you know it, you\u2019ll have written a novel. It\u2019s over when it\u2019s over. The second draft is where you get all the planning out of the way, figuring out what didn\u2019t work the first time, etc etc. I hope that this helps you, burgeoning writer! :3 ",

If you have a reasonable idea of the beginning, the  middle and the end of the story, you are on. Then by putting that plot down on paper, carefully, leaving out nothing. In other words, create an outline.  Don't dismiss anything as trivial. The time to determine what stays and what does not comes much, much later. Note: The outline is not a rigid story skeleton you bind yourself to come hell or high water. It is a flexible core that can take any shape, and should have taken a shape that is nowhere near the original by the time you finish with your novel. Start reading. Read trade books, read other authors in your genre, read anything you can lay your hands on that might have a bearing on your novel. Research, surf, Google, leave no stone unturned. Start writing. Don't worry about beginning at the beginning. That, too, can be sorted out later. If you write the end first, that too is fine, because now you know where your story should should land up. Just .

            "answer_text": "First of all, I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re interested in writing a novel. It is rewarding and you\u2019re going to love how you feel when you finally hold that final copy in your hands. But, I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Before starting any kind of writing, you\u2019ll want to have the right tools and basic knowledge. You\u2019ve done well by coming up with an idea and plot for your novel. Now, backtrack just a little and ask yourself, \u201chow is my grammar? Spelling? Punctuation?\u201d Yes, you will eventually hire an editor, but you need to be able to form basic sentences and paragraphs correctly (which I\u2019m going to guess that you already do). If not, you can use resources such as Khan Academy and Alison to refresh your skills. They offer free grammar and language courses that are perfect for this. Once you have a solid language foundation, you\u2019ll want to look at your chosen genre and find out what additional training you may need. It is possible for you to simply dive in and start writing at this point, but you will do a much better job with your manuscript if you know about the mechanics of writing in a particular genre. I had a client who writes science fiction and editing the manuscript was nothing short of torture for me! In that particular case, I was only asked to proofread and perform light editing, so that\u2019s what I did. In reality, it needed a complete overhaul. The author meant well, but the manuscript read more like a mashup of sci-fi and action movies spanning the last 20 years. The worlds, characters, and technology were not properly constructed, making the whole novel harder to follow than it needed to be. You can avoid that mistake by taking specific courses (or doing online research) on how to set up various kind of novels (romance, murder, thriller, mystery, sci-fi, etc). They all tend to have their own set of techniques. Once you feel confident that you have the fundamentals of language as well as genre-specific conventions for plot, dialogue, characters, setting, flow, and so on, you should be good to go to begin the fun part - writing!

I don\u2019t write 100 or 500 words per day. I could never make myself do that. For me, writing is spontaneous and when it happens it happens (for pages and pages) and when it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t. That may change as I get older, especially if it becomes one of my main demands in life, but for now, that\u2019s the way it is. Forcing myself to write every day is too methodical and it feels wrong. Writing is not my profession yet. Though I\u2019d like it to be one day, I don\u2019t have to treat it that way now\u2014 not if my muse would rather bounce around with its head in the clouds and then fall asleep. I don\u2019t plan out entire books before writing them, either. I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to go, and trying to plan the whole thing out when so much of it doesn\u2019t exist yet is, again, forcing it. A story is more than just plot. Characters write the story, conflicts spring up on their own, and the plot shifts as it goes along. I wish I were a little better at planning plots, but I write books the same way I write essays\u2014 start with the first word, end with the last. Everything else is worked out in between. It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s the method that works best for me. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried outlines before. That hasn\u2019t gone well. The only time I do outline a book is when I\u2019ve already written it once, so I already have an idea of what I\u2019d like the plot to be and I just need to arrange it in a way that makes sense. I don\u2019t start at the end and work backwards, either. Though sometimes I wish I could do that, the very idea of it makes my head spin. Transitions, anyone? I don\u2019t worry about finishing, either. Some projects I abandon after a while. Some take a lot of revision before they\u2019ve even gone anywhere. I had one novel that I realized I couldn\u2019t finish with the narration pattern I was using, and now I\u2019ve started it all over from the beginning and I don\u2019t regret it. Now I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong. That I\u2019m wasting time. That if I actually tried writing every day, it wouldn\u2019t always be utter crap. That I should write first and then revise (which makes the task seem so much more monumental, daunting, and overwhelming than it already is). That writing should not be erratic or spontaneous or no work would ever get done\u2014 except, it does. At some point, even if it takes a few years, I end up with a 200+ page novel and I wonder, \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d Of course, I\u2019ve come to the same conclusion that everyone else has\u2014 just write. Just start. Starting is not the hard part. The best way to start writing a novel is just to WRITE. There\u2019s nothing else to it. Put your ideas down on paper and see where they go. The rest\u2014 technique, character development, worldbuilding, revision, editing, emotional turmoil\u2014 comes later. You were talking about starting. But, be aware that your writing process will be unique and you should write in a way that works for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are my suggestions:  Have an idea -- Even if it is a small one, have some idea of what you want to write about.Let that idea grow -- I always recommend sitting down and writing down at least a small plan of what you want to do with your idea. Anywhere from a short synopsis to a detailed outline. Write -- This seems obvious but you'd be amazed how stuck you can get on the \"planning\" stage that you don't get to the writing stage. Try to set a specific time during the day where you devote to just writing and make sure you limit the distractions (turn off the internet, tell people to not interrupt, turn off your phone, etc.) to the best of your ability (as a parent I find it can be hard to do that, but it is workable).Read -- Both in your genre and out of it. Find time to read and look at what makes you enjoy the stories. Once  you know what you like to read, you'll be able to find ways of putting that same technique into your own writing. Also, read trade books on the process of writing, publishing and other writing topics.Find a critique/writing group -- Once you get a decent amount of something written, you'll want to have an unbiased eye (not a spouse of family member) look over the piece and give  you honest feedback. Make sure you find people you trust and make sure they give you just as much good feedback as bad. Even better is a person who can give you the \"don't likes\" followed by a \"here is what I think would make it better\".Take workshops or classes -- Continue to learn. Those are six things I recommend doing to get started. Once you have a good start on that (and a finished product) then you will be getting into things like editing (which I don't recommend doing until after your first draft is done -- get your words out!) and querying.  Good luck on your writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Start with Kipling's servants, then go from there. These are \"who, what , where, when, how and why.\"  In other words; who is the principal subject - or the main characters?  What happens in the novel? Where is it set? When is it set? How do the central characters get from where they start to were they end in the story?  You get the idea. It is important to realise that you don't have to answer all the questions before you start - though some authors do - but it can be very helpful to put some mental structure on your thinking. You don't have to plan at all - some people have the talent to be able to launch into a story and it just comes out - but when inexperienced writers do this they end up editing out vast chunks of trash and rewriting whole sections, so be warned. Another very good way to start a novel when you aren't sure how to start is to go to the 'where'. Draw a random map, or use an existing one. There are some excellent resources available online which guide you through the process. I have used this technique as a teacher and kids love inventing their own worlds and explaining it, it can be a great inspiration. This is especially good for writing fantasy or sometimes sci-fi. ",

But there are steps to follow in other to come out with something excellent which will be loved by many. I hope my suggestions will be helpful to you. One , you need to read other novels, understand the way they are , view the critics and know what you can build with the help of critics. I usually use Kindle eBook store as my strong tool these are my steps 1 ) I download kindle spy 2) I choose the top sellers under the category I will love to write about 3) I then use the kindle spy to extract information about the books 4) I go to the reviews especially bad once (constructive) and write them down 5) I check on the keywords 6) I launch the keywords in the store to see similar books with it and know if I can still use such if they are many, I turn them down they are already saturated and competition will be high. 7) Then I check other things like number of pages, publication house , author if he or she is a popular writer 8) I know try to figure out how to come about with a similar novel (collection of materials in long and short run using bottom up approach) 9) I can now come out with my own guides, Topics, titles, keywords etc .

            "answer_text": "Plenty of great answers here. I would add that if you have a great story in you (or think it is great) start writing. Otherwise, learn those skills. You can outline and storyboard it before you start. You can have an objective in mind (the culmination) and simply take off toward it. There is no set rule. But don\u2019t add anything that does not advance the plot or bolster characters or setting. You may love it, but if it is extraneous, cut ruthlessly. Make your characters into individuals. Each should have her/his own voice. Avoid idiot plots. The old sci-fi master Damon Knight defined an idiot plot as one that works only because everyone in it is an idiot. If you already have writing skills, then start writing. Otherwise take writing classes or join a writers\u2019 group to gain those skills. You may not become a Nobel candidate, but you\u2019ll learn how to write dialogue and create characters, create scenes and construct a plot. Plenty of wanna be writers can\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on how you write. Some writers are like Mozart or Tesla creating it in their head before setting a note or word on the page. Some create an out line and some of us wing it.  Whichever way you go, remember, this is a first draft. It's not meant to be perfect.  Some authors do a couple of drafts while others may do ten or more. This can take a year or ten years.  When I write I'll try to get the first draft on paper. There will be a million problems; spelling, wrong word choices, multiple voices and tenses, weak verbs, confusing sentences, weak dialog, clich\u00e9s, plot problems, sketchy description, redundant or superfluous words, sentences, paragraphs and even chapters. Sometimes I need a set-up, such as a gun appears in a drawer in chapter three, but now I must go back to chapter one to put that gun in the drawer.  Some time my characters are forced to act in uncharacteristic ways, so I must give a believable reason or change their actions.  Sometimes, I discover something in myself or learn what the theme of the story is, and it's different then what I thought when I started, or the whole concept of the story changes, so now I must do an entire re-write... again.  And sometimes it just flows and the editing and re-writes are simple.  I know this sounds daunting and complicated and it can be, but If you love to write, and you need to, if you're going to write a novel worth your time and that of the reader.  This little answer will need to be edited before you get to see it.  Write like the wind!  ",

            "answer_text": "First you should plan and organize your thoughts. Then, you can begin writing your ideas bit by bit. It will be better you spare a place and time daily to write. The morning is much better since a person is more fresh and active at that time. Yet, there are many who write after midnight when they are at much peace and don\u2019t have much distractions at all. You have to pick a genre or area of your interest. You need to decide which is best for you for which you have enough knowledge to begin with. You can get more ideas by reading other similar books OK. Good reading leads to good writing. i am an aspiring author as well. Lately, I began writing a novel in English which is fiction. It is inspired by the tragic incident of MH370 of 3 years ago. In course of writing, I came with a technique myself that I can share with you. It will simplify my process for writing and completing my book for sure. Just for writing an article, a person answers 5 things. Like \u2018who\u2019, \u2018where\u2019, \u2018what\u2019, \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019..I also first wrote all such small descriptions for the novel.

(Most of the advice in the other posts are so much water on your creative fire, as I see it.) Start by writing a short story, 5000 words. In the short story you will create some characters. When you are finished with the story, write some biographical sketches of your characters. 2000 words or more for each. At least 5 sketches. Then write another story using these same characters, 5000 words. By now you have some places, some settings. Bring them to life. Describe them in minutiae. 2000 word minimum per place. 5 settings. Write another story using the same places. Let it sit for at least a month, preferably longer. Start cutting and pasting. By now you should have the makings of 1/3 of a novel at least. That's a start. Filling in gaps should double the wordcount. Where you go from there is up to you. ",

            "answer_text": "The first step is always selecting your genre. It can be a combination of 2 or more genres or a particular theme based novel. Once you have figured that out, figure out what exactly you are basing your writings on- your own self, a fictional utopia or based on a particular person(s), incident, accident, experience etc. This is basically an important part as you are making yourself clear about how and what exactly you are going to base your work upon. The next comes choice of narration-whether it's a first person encounter subject, an abstraction, story telling type or a dialogue-exchange storyline. This will be a basic concoction of your grip over the language (of choice), efficiency of expressing thoughts and actions, efficiency of exploring characters and maintaining basic story cohesion till the very end. Every novel writer has a peculiar style. Some love teasing, twisting, dropping surprise bombs, innate sarcastic brainstorming through literature etc etc. Nobody is a perfect writer, the best writer is one who's words invoke exact emotions and portray the exact scenes in the reader's thoughts, that the writer must have felt and sensed while fabricating the complex chunk of literary masterpiece.

            "answer_text": "Try this: Look into your life and see how you can weave a story out of it ... just jot down the storyline :  i was in college....met  a beautiful girl....fell in love with her....but when I proposed, she was already engaged/married....now add some drama, surprise, twists and lead it to climax...boom the end.... Perhaps you can begin writing  in simple English like this: I was pacing up to the exam hall, when a beautiful girl in simple white  tee  and denim jeans caught my attention. For a moment, I forgot my  chemistry and began to wonder: Who is this beauty?  And perhaps, you can end like this: She stood still on the wooden bridge, as I took her leave and walked away from her life. The dark clouds has thickened and soon it started to rain heavily. I was glad, for nobody would be able to see my tears. Continue writing, fill in the gaps... and later proof read and re-write the draft once again to create more impact, beauty and substance... Do this everyday for two - three hours, and also keep reading some novels for fresh ideas... Recently, i finished writing a novel like this. It's ordinary, but still I think readable by some of our current standards. Here is a sample  : My Pulp Fiction ",

            "answer_text": "Hi! I absolutely love this question! Do you have an idea for a story or a character? Do you want to write for elementary kids (MG), teens (YA), or adults? That question, particularly, will help you know where to start. Writing a middle-grade book will have a different plot and a much younger protagonist than if you were to write a book for Adult audiences. Pick the category (what age will your audience be), MG YA or AdultPick your genre. Will your story be sci-fi, fantasy, paranormal, romance, contemporary, etc.?Then decide what your primary plot will be. A great video that touches on plot is \u201cWhat Makes A Hero\u201d by Matthew Winkler, found on YouTube.This is a good starting point, but there\u2019s much more you\u2019ll need to think about to write a book. You can do it! Best of luck, Dawn For more tips about writing, visit A Wordy Woman's Guide ",

The sentence might be \u201cI have four things in my life that bug me.\u201d I can make a short page of a story out of that. Anything that intrigues me as a starting ignition point is what I need. Turns out that if I go about it by charting the whole story up front I don\u2019t ever finish. When I write the characters as they develop then I get the progress I need. See, here\u2019s the thing, \u2026, no matter what you do to get your first draft you are going to have to revise. So pick one way, see if it works for you. If it doesn\u2019t, pick another one and try that. ",

I will put in short, what I did as a writer and how I started : #1 - Feel an extreme urge to let something out and decide that you really want to write.#2 - Start to think about ideas, and develop observational skills. Believe me on this one, even the silliest things around you can be crafted into great stories. Notice the smallest things, draw inspiration from the places where people don\u2019t even reach. #3 - Buy a journal and jot down every bullshit thought that comes to your mind. #4 - Start writing your first draft after you\u2019ve formulated an outline. #5- Complete your first draft (Very very important ).

Put a deadline to it. Not necessarily the whole novel, but start with putting deadlines to chapters. Write everyday. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s crap. It doesn\u2019t matter if you write chapters or plot lines you think you\u2019re not gonna use. Don\u2019t delete anything. You never know what will become useful.Don\u2019t worry about order. Some writers need to write their novel in order. I admire the discipline, but if you thought about something cool for the last third of your novel, write it. Figure out how to connect it later.",

Push through, writing a quick rough scene sketch, until you reach the conclusion. Go back and reorganize and improve scenes until everything is in the right place.Once everything is in the right place and your story is awesome, start fixing the writing - better dialogue, better character motivation, better first and last sentences to every chapter, and adding scene and setting description (readers forget words, they remember images - put pictures in their heads.)Know your readership: make sure you know who will be reading your book, what kind of books they like and WHY they like them (research top 10 bestselling books in your genre and read all the reviews). Make sure your story has similar elements and will satisfy those readers in a similar way - but be new and different enough for them to enjoy it.",

            "answer_text": "Try a pen and paper\u2026 The best way to start writing anything is simply to start. Depending on the type of novel you're writing, the ideas would either develop as you go along or the characters will take on a life and personality of their own. Don't worry about writers block. It happens to the best of us. When you get stuck, just step back, take some time off from writing and allow the story to run its natural course. Something will reinspire you and your work will come back to life. If you're a really busy person and you find you're having difficulty planning and making time to write, I'd suggest you take s few minutes before you go to sleep, or just as you wake up, to write. You can't really write a masterpiece overnight\u2026 well it's possible, but judging by the nature of the question, I'd say give your work time, give your ideas time to mature. You may have a great idea but giving it that time to cook will make it an international bestseller. Read a lot. The more you have, the more you have to give. Your story has more substance and becomes more realistic when you have a wider range of knowledge and are able to translate that into your writing. Also, you'll find that the more you read, the more you pick up styles of other authors. You can tell J. K. Rowling read a lot of Lord of the Rings simply by her ideas and style of writing. Be innovative, be yourself. Your novel isn't your novel without a bit of you in it. If you have no passion for it, you'll struggle to put a bit of yourself into it. Writing is as difficult as any other profession, it takes passion, commitment and a hell of a lot of perseverance. It takes becoming vulnerable at times, exposing yourself to the world in a way no one else has ever seen you. It also takes strength, to keep walking when you can't run, limping when you can't walk and crawling when you can't move, but in all of that, never stopping, always moving forward. I'd like to wish you all the best in writing your novel (that's if you are gonna write one). Remember that your words are eternal and your books are your legacy, so make sure it's not just a good one, it's a great one. ",

Remember that short stories can do as much work as novels with fewer words.Writing is an art \u2013 remember that. So, whatever you have a question about (unless it\u2019s grammar or something governed by an important linguistic rule) likely has two or three correct answers. Feel free to explore your options.Read! Writers read. I\u2019ve typed this countless times \u2013 and it\u2019s true. The more you read, the more effectively you will write.Good luck with writing.

            "answer_text": "Yes there is a little known but often used trick for writing a novel. Write or type a word. Then follow it with another word. Keep adding words until you have a sentence. Once you\u2019ve accomplished that, start another sentence and perhaps another until you have a paragraph. Now rinse and repeat. That\u2019s all there is to getting started. One word after another. Then comes the hard part. You need to start editing and/or rewriting those words until they start to resemble a story. Then you need to work them over even more until they resemble a story someone may actually want to read. Throw away all the words that don\u2019t work to further the story and keep the ones that do. Here is one magic tip. Read a lot and write a lot. That\u2019s it. The first million words is for practice. If you keep it up long enough you have a chance at success. ",

Reality check time: writing fiction is not the same as making hash browns in a waffle iron. There are no shortcuts, no tricks, no tips and no hacks. If you want to write, you write. There is no other way. You glue your ass to the chair and you write. It doesn\u2019t matter if what you write is crap; in fact, if you have never written fiction before it will be crap, because you have no practice at it. You get better by writing a lot.

But what determines a writer is not whether or not the person takes, or has taken, what courses, gone through what courses of study or anything else of the sort. It\u2019s whether or not you write. I\u2019ve never taken a creative writing course in my life. I doubt I could hold still for one, especially when I consider some of the things I get to edit. Once you\u2019ve begun to write and actually turned out some finished works, then you can decide whether to take courses and hone your skills that way or not. You may be able to improve by doing it and listening to your beta readers - someone out there will read what you wrote and critique it, even if you have to pay them to do it - and eventually, your editors. But if you want to write, write. If you want to study writing, go ahead - but know that it won\u2019t make you a writer. At most, it will make you a more-educated wannabe writer. Only writing will make you a writer. So go ahead. Put pen to paper, or fingers to the keyboard, or whatever method turns your crank, but write. Hey - I had my first five pages written before I ever experienced writer\u2019s block. ",

Staying close to your suggested word count every day gets you 50,000 words in  thirty days. Novels are usually between 80,000 and 90,000 words, so your story will need to be fleshed out, but you now have a skeleton. \tNext comes the revisions. Expect to read and reread, and revise and revise.\tKeep track of characters by having index cards with birth date,  color hair, eyes, hobbies, quirks, and important events like marriages. Decide what is important to each character.\tDo the same with scenes.What happens in each scene? How does this move the story along?\tHave a time line, even if your story happens in just 24 hours. ",

Stephen King has said he has no idea how a story will end when he starts it. I tend to have key plot points in mind. The twists, the \u201cwhat if\u2026?\u201d type of things that I want to explore in a story. Sometimes, you don\u2019t know how a story starts. So start somewhere else. Instead of Chapter 1. Start in the middle of a scene that you really feel. Something that brings the characters, the conflict, the plot to life for you. No one else will read it until the book is finished anyway. I think it is the same with film making - they don\u2019t make the opening credits, the first scene and so on in linear order - the filming jumps all over the place and gets edited together before it is finished. Writing can be like that too. Once you have more experience and confidence, you can start at the beginning - but never forget it is okay to write how you want (pantser, plotter, linear or more selectively). ",

That idea that's been tingling in the back of your brain for days? Scribble it down before it becomes unattainably buried in the trenches of your brain. An outline may be beneficial, if you have a thoughtful, cohesive plan. But otherwise, it's often nice to just transform your thoughts into word and vomit them all over the page. Order will follow later. If your gut tells you to begin with thorough, extensive research, start with that. If your gut tells you to furiously smash on the computer keys until you have some semblance of a story, start with that. Novel writing is a wonderful experience because you have immense flexibility, and the beginning is the best place to let wild imagination fly free. ",

Perhaps your story will be long enough to be called a \"novel\", perhaps not.  As you proceed, you'll probably get the feeling that what you're creating is stupid. Keep going anyway. The important thing is to finish it!  It's important to make your characters suffer and to make their suffering either kill them or force them to change. Put them through hell.  Create suspense by delaying the outcome of situations arising from the characters' fears and desires. Make sure that everything that happens is plausible within the logic of the world of your story. If you really want to write a novel, and if you have the time and the resources to support you while you write it, get busy and don't give up! ",

Envision where your story will take place, as well as what the characters who will populate your novel will be like. Think of a central conflict and branch out your story from that issue. Make an outline and conduct any necessary research. Establish a writing routine that you can stick to on a regular basis, and create your first draft. Self-edit, share your work with a few others, and revise your draft until you feel satisfied with what you've created. Good luck with it. Best regards! ",

            "answer_text": "There are as many ways to write a novel as there are combinations of words that can form the content of that novel, but the most important thing to remember is that writing a novel is very similar to running a marathon. It will be a long haul, and it will take a lot of extra work beyond just the writing itself. Things like time management, perseverance, and good organizational skill can be incredibly helpful, while skills such as plotting and character development are an absolute necessity. So where should you start? You'll have to figure out what way works best for you, but for me the best start always comes in the form of outlining. I write a rough sketch of the overarching story, then I break that down into the pacing I want, and finally figure out what chapter sections I would want to keep at that pacing. This gives me a strong structural framework around which to write the story, and also makes it easier to write any part of the story as it comes to me rather than feeling trapped into having to write the chapters in the order they appear in the book.

(e.g. \u201cA young man finds a dragon egg in the mountains and embarks on a dangerous journey to escape the evil emperor\u2019s assassins\u201d) Usually for me, the outline will look much like an outline for a research paper with bullet points acting as designations of each chapter and what happens in each one. It doesn\u2019t have to be super-detailed, just detailed enough that you can know what it is you want happening in each segment. After that, it\u2019s simply a matter of writing the actual chapters.

I wrote a scene and then ended up jumping to the beginning and writing straight through. The main thing is to find what works for you. Some authors first write detailed histories of all their characters. Some authors write an outline. Some just dive in. Do it your way. You may even find that different books require different approaches. Bottom line is, writers write. And through experience they learn that a lot of the magic is in the rewriting. ",

            "answer_text": "Every writer has their own way of doing things, so there is no set formula. However, with your basic plot outline that is a good start. For me, I write the plot line down and then go back constantly to pad out the story. Some writers just sit down and keep writing until the end before going back to edit. I can't do this. It is a case of constant rereading and going back to add bits and take bits out. I also don't often know what I'm going to write before I write it. I sit down, begin to type, and the story just takes over. It is a constant revelation to me as I have no idea what I'm going to write that day. As I said, this is not the same for other writers. I'd suggest sitting down somewhere quiet and just starting to write. You never know what might come out! Good luck. ",

Inspiration comes from doing, not thinking. The more you write, the better you\u2019ll get. Books and classes are good for support and advice, but only while you\u2019re learning on the job. Remember that the first, second and twelfth drafts of your novel might be terrible. Early drafts are always terrible. Don\u2019t judge yourself. Keep working on it. It will come together eventually. As a bipolar person, you have a creative advantage because your mind is far more interesting than most! The great Carrie Fisher was bipolar and a brilliant, extremely inventive writer. Her mind was an artistic motherlode.  Just keep at it no matter what. Use that gifted mind of yours and let your voice be heard. ",

However, if you have written short stories, or other fiction, and feel the urge to write a novel then just go for it. There are no rules. You can start anywhere you like. For me, the characters are the most important. Build up believable people in your mind, give them some kind of conflict or problem to solve, and then go with the flow. For others, plot matters more - if you have a story in your mind, then start with that and gradually build up the characters involved. There are many books about writing novels, and thousands of relevant websites, but in the end it\u2019s up to you whether to write a novel, and how to go about it. ",

With that, not only will it be a hook for future readers, but it can jump-start the creative process for you, and you might decide to change the basic outline. I have no idea what your book is about, so I don't know if it's appropriate for this particular novel, but you could start with something like, \"Andre was sick of all the running.\" This sets you up for a potentially action-packed, emotional, heart-driven novel. Try to find a opening sentence that you feel has a lot of potential, and then just start writing. Don't think about your outline, or if people will like it, or grammatical errors, those can all be fixed later. Just let your hand take control and see where it takes you when it's on autopilot. Good luck. ",

There are many authors and writers who would make many, many edits in the their novels so that the readers can understand and learn the story.You also need a plan on how you would like the story to play out. One of the most stressful things about writing is to find the inspiration and imagination to write the things that you want your characters to say, what they do, what they think. But don't stress to much, the idea will come to you sooner or later and you will know what to write.I hope this answer will help you. But if not, then just go ahead with the ideas of what you want to write in your novel and how to start it. Mix up some ideas like a blender and see what you came up with. ",

I\u2019ve done it for two years now and will be doing it again this year. depending on your area, there are community write ins hosted every day where you can meet with other writers and network. in my area, we have daily write ins attended by a minimum of 6\u20138 people, and some days we have upwards of 15\u201320. join your local region and see whats around. I agree whole hardheartedly with the other answer on this thread. If your goal is to write a novel and you have no real idea of what its about or where to go, you\u2019re in the wrong area. Just write from the heart, tell your story, the story that you want to read, the story that you need to tell. that\u2019s why I love NaNo, because its an outpouring of creativity. there is no time to edit, no time to second guess, you are just writing for the sake of writing, and you will be surprised what you get out on the page. check it out and feel free to friend me, my username is cinderstar95 Best of luck!

You need to write something about that idea- anything related to it, about a page or two. Start jotting down ideas that come to your mind. Again, be it any dumb, silly idea, you NEED to jot it down, at that very moment, with anything you have -a pencil, a marker, even lipstick. I cannot stress enough on this point. Many brilliant ideas come at the most unexpected moments, and are forgotten within seconds. Trust me. Start weaving a web around the main idea-slowly at first, then, as the book starts building itself inside your mind in an amazing fashion, you need to pick up the pace. Happy writing! ",

Post it on quora. Take comments as positive feedback and improvise. Upvotes are always adorned.Learn from self experiences, experiences of others, examples peers, colleagues relatives and try to narate those stories to self, if you like them yourself, you have mastered the skills.Last but not least be original in thoughts, your written text will sound more attractive only when one do not imitate. All the best for your future endeavours. Do give a feedback if any further thoughts needs to be shared or any further suggestions needed. Cheers :) ",

Since you mentioned novels and not books, I  assume you intend to write fiction. If you are into reading much, first read as much as you can. You mentioned you have no idea how to start writing, for that  read good books of various authors, it will give you a rough idea as to how you should write. Next coming to the pages of the novels, it is really not important. A novel may be of just 100 pages or it may range up to a few hundred pages, it doesn't matter. What matters is whether you are successful in keeping up the interest of your readers right from the prologue to the epilogue. Your readers should identify themselves with the characters of your book and live with them, only then you can emerge as a successful author! ",

The characters sometimes appear, and a plot then finally a novel. Problem with this technique is that if you lose your train of thought, you could be totally lost. Then all your work is in vain. ",

So, you need to identify the main character of your novel and the events around which you wish to build the story. Once you have done that, divide them into chapters and get down to writing. If your novel is based on a real life character, write the novel as it is and then change the names. That way you don\u2019t have to do too much of thinking and remember characters in the novel according to assigned names. ",

Here\u2019s something I did which may be useful, but others might hate the idea. Don\u2019t write a book; write a short story. Then you\u2019ll have a completed scene in the overall book which may or may not develop. Maybe your idea is covered with a short story or it will suggest a larger story to be told.

I would suggest it would be a good idea to outline each chapter. Methods for doing so could come up in a quick Google search. Some authors know how their story will end before they even finish chapter one. Others don't know until they get there. Sometimes they have multiple ideas for an ending. If this is you, then you must pick whichever one feels right. The more you develop your story, the less intimidating it looks. ",

I remember an interview with Stephen King where he spoke about a conversation he\u2019d had with his mother about his father. Mrs King told Stephen King that his father was a great storyteller but he (Stephen) had the discipline and determination to finish that his father never had. It made all the difference. ",

I haven't written a novel yet but can say that outlining is a very crucial process. J.K Rowling too had developed an outline of all the incidents in the whole Harry Potter Series. She took 1\u20132 years for outlining her world to its very precise detail and then set in to write her first novel - Harry Potter and The Philosophers Stone (later republished as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone). An outline might be time consuming but it contributes a lot. Few others like James Patterson and Stephen King spend much more time on outlining than for writing the books. Hope this helps. ",

Write \u2014- not the first chapter, necessarily. Write any scene/conversation/thoughts (from your story) that comes to your mind even if it\u2019s the last scene. We revise/rewrite/edit many times, but the first draft, the whole story needs to be written first even if it\u2019s messy. Reading good books/author would definitely help. Hope it helps. ",
