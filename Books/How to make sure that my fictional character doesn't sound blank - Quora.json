            "answer_text": "Characters You have to have a good idea of who your characters are before you write them. Who they are, how they were raised or how broken they are will determine how they react to situations. If you have flat characters with no personalities, no life problems, they will not make for very interesting reading. I often talk about compelling characters and this is exactly what I mean. A very sweet woman, a young new bride, who was daddy's little girl, sheltered for most of her life, is not going to have the same verbal or physical reaction to bad news or bad luck as a hardened hooker. You have to know what you're dealing with in order to write realistic dialogue and reactions. So let's say you're writing a bank robbery scene. The two women above are taken hostage. Right from the get-go you need to know who your characters are so you can have them react in a way that doesn't leave the reader scratching his/her head. Their personalities will determine how they will behave with regard to the situation they find themselves in, to the robbers themselves, and to each other. Each will have their own style of speaking, body language, and attitude. I do a rough list of my characters that I can refer to. The 'why' of how someone reacts has to be believable. Daddy's girl will probably sit in the corner of the van and shiver and cry. It would be out of character for her to boldly try to seduce one of the robbers into letting her go. But the hooker would do that. The lists that you see people use are a bit long for me. I don't really think what my character's favorite movie is is going to matter for my bank robber. Unless he is trying to emulate his favorite movie character himself. Their favorite holidays, colors, favorite teacher? Their favorite flower? I can see where someone who likes to fill all that out would really understand their character, but it's too petty for me. I stick with the following list. Fill it out and you know pretty much what you have to work with for a character and why they do the things they do, which is the most important aspect of doing this bit of pre-writing work. \u00b7 Name, sex, age. (Davin, male, 32) \u00b7 Physical description (Short, thin, bad complexion, one weak leg that drags sometimes.) \u00b7 Educational background: field of work (Dropped out of school in 9th grade, works as laborer on construction sites.) \u00b7 Family issues/ friends (Never knew his father, mother was a drunk. His few friends are mostly in prison now. Never had a girlfriend for any length of time. Is a bit intimidated by women.) \u00b7 Flaws/strengths (Stubborn, opinionated. Is very mechanical, can fix things.) \u00b7 Dreams/ aspirations (dreams of opening his own repair shop) . Fears (That he'll never amount to anything, and will live alone in a dirty trailer until the day he dies.) Now, when Davin goes in to rob the bank the reader knows why, they know how he's going to react to the two vastly different women hostages -- and you can write realistic scenes.

            "answer_text": "One of my favorite things to do is to take a character, and write about them way before your plotline happens. For instance, I have a character named Phillip. He\u2019s a nice guy, and he has cool skills. He\u2019s a wizard (literally - this is fantasy). And he\u2019s scarred and blind. Oh, no - I\u2019ve created a Mary Sue (doez dat sound lik a Maru Sue 2 u?[1]) Now I\u2019ve gotta give this guy some depth, or he\u2019s going to be the most boring wizard ever. So I take him back to when he was a teenager, before he was blinded by a foster-parent in a fit of rage. I\u2019m going to need this scene anyway. Now here\u2019s the trick. Reconstruct the circumstances of this event, from the character\u2019s POV. Maybe start at Saturday morning. What does Phillip do on Saturday? I write everything, from getting up in the morning to get the Wall Street Journal from the end of the driveway for his functional alcoholic father, Alan, figure to the moment he falls asleep that night, having spent his day avoiding Alan as much as possible. Now write Sunday. Does he go to church? If yes, do people there have any sense of Alan\u2019s abusiveness? Does anyone try to help, or do they ignore it? Is there brunch at the country club afterwards? Again, follow your character through the whole day. In the process I found that Phillip spends time at the archery range while Alan golfs. This adds depth - it\u2019s painful to lose a hobby like that, after he\u2019s lost his sight. When I write Monday, I find that Phillip is a subpar student who has no motivation, but he\u2019s bright. His teachers are disappointed because he used to be so much better. When I write Tuesday, I find that Phillip has a Mouse Ears hat from when a previous foster-family took him and their own kids to Disneyland. It\u2019s bittersweet, because they were so good to him, and yet they didn\u2019t love him enough not to send him away. While you\u2019re here, take the time to write the trip to Disneyland. Write the day he had to go to live with a new family. On Wednesday, he and his friend finish Silent Hill (they get the good ending this time) on his friend\u2019s Playstation before he has to go home and make dinner before Alan comes home drunk. This gives you the chance to explore what happened to Alan\u2019s wife. Maybe she left him for another man. Maybe Phillip doesn\u2019t know either - she was just gone one day, and Alan was angrier than usual. Maybe that we the first day he hit Phillip. You get the picture. Explore their past. A character with no past is a flat character. They don\u2019t have quirks. Look how much I can relate to, just with this amount of information. Not everything you write should end up in the final draft, but don\u2019t get rid of it. Refer back to it, so you can be consistent. BTW - Phillip is no longer my main character, he\u2019s my main character\u2019s adoptive dad. And he certainly doesn\u2019t feel like a flat caricature of a dad. Footnotes[1] Chapters 1 - 22",

            "answer_text": "Good question. We\u2019ve all been there, in fact if you\u2019re a writer from scratch like me, it should be expected\u2026 it sounds wierd but obvious, but many styles and genres of fiction books actually have limitations and the thought of every writer is how they going to cram this all in. So the first thing is identification of what you are doing, or at least its estimate. How long is the book (before and excl. Draft work) Whats your pov and pop (point of view/point of perspective) Your writing style and syntax - structure After figuring those out you need to realise, in many points your main character will actually be blank - there gotta be more exciting stuff anyways. Dont do those italics inner thoughts. Your character has to have a logic that makes sense. Considering most writers are into language; for the rest of our lives, most library fiction books will be about detectives. That just investigative english at work. your character must have a level into the story, just like the villains are at the core of the plot - they worked hard for their plot to happen and some just happen to them but just like a calamity, the main protaganist is never alone so its a shared value. Another thing to consider is aphorisms and witty word. When you writing paragraphs and understand the full stops, you\u2019ll realise your making progressive waves of points into a paragraphs. The core of that is reaching aphorisms short and mid term. Morale - long term So various elements must come together with various points, in your chapters\u2026 there will always be 3 major points you want to make but you must choose one and trust your readers.

            "answer_text": "One thing I often use is to write my fictional characters based on real characters: real historical characters I had researched on, or real current celebrity/political figures I know quite a lot about, or real people I know from my life. It can be partially based on this person, or it can be a combination of different people. (However, when combine \u201cpeople\" together, be mindful of consistency). Write what you know, right? Real people (historical or current) are more interesting than make up ones. So create your make up characters based on real people. Think about their personality, and put them in your story, in conflict, and imagine what they might do under the circumstances. Let your character \u201cbe\" themselves, and see where it leads. I should also caution though, please do not insert yourself into the story. Author Avatar - TV Tropes is one of the most annoying cliches out there. I think it is OK to write your characters based on a certain aspect of yourself. Or if you do want to write yourself into the story, make yourself a supporting character, a cameo, don't take the center stage, don't make everything and everyone revolve around you. ",
