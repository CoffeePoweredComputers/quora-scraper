            "answer_text": "Transfer ebooks from an old Kindle to a new Kindle Fire Step 1: Connect your old Kindle to your computer via USB. You will find your kindle device as a drive under \"My Computer\", Click it and open the drive. Step 2: There should be multiple folders. Open the folders and drag selected files from the Kindle and drop them into the computer's hard drive, transfer ebooks and other documents from the old Kindle to your computer. Step 3: Connect another Kindle to your computer via USB, then there will be a removable disk displaying in your computer, open it and transfer the documents those files copied from your old Kindle to the new one. For audio books please put them in the Kindle's \"Audible\" directory, and for normal books please place them in the \"Documents\" directory. To transfer purchased books: All your purchased Kindle booksa are stored in your account's Kindle Cloud, all you need to do is de-register your Amazon account in the old Kindle then re-register it on the new one. Go to the reading app, all the books you have ever purchased in Amazon Store will show up on your bookshelf. Share books between two Kindle devices registered with the same account Note of Caution: You are allowed to register your Amazon account on several Kindle devices, then your purchased books will not auto-sync to both of your Kindles, but only the later registered one, at the same time, those already downloaded books still remain in your old Kindle. For you newly purchased Amazon books, you can still control which device to sync the item to in the Manage Kindle page. Step 1: Register the second Kindle with the same account registered to the first one. Maybe you purchased a Kindle Touch before then get a new Kindle Fire HD, or your friend or family have got another Kindle and you want to share your purchased book to him/her. Never mind, in one word, it is possible to register your account in another Kindle and won't do much harm on your previous Kindle. After successful registration, please go to Amazon official site then navigate to \"Manage Your Content and Devices\" (Formerly \"Manage your Kindle\"). From \"Your Content\" you will see all your purchased files. Step 2: Click on \"Deliver\" button. From the new pop up window, you can see all your registered Kindle devices and apps, which means, although you can't auto-sync your purchased books to your old Kindle device anymore, but you can also manually deliver them to any of your registered device. Up by now, you have learnt how to transfer contents from an old Kindle device to a new one; and how to register on two Kindle devices with the same account and transfer purchased contents to them. But what if you are not convenient to share your account with anyone else but only some books? Yes you can lend them out,but you must sacrifice your own 15 reading days, which is not that satisfying. I have written several books on how to master your Kindle device. Check my profile ",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking about books bought from Amazon or sent to your Amazon library via SendToKindle app or e-mail, forget about USB. Simply register your new Kindle to the same account, and you will see all your library content. Tap on a title (while your Kindle is connected to Internet via WiFi or 3G), and it will download almost instantly. You can also \u201csend\u201d them from Amazon\u2019s MYK library and device management page (amazon.com/myk). There is no need to download more than you are currently reading - the books are not going anywhere from Amazon cloud. Most publishers allow their books to be downloaded to 6 Kindles simultaneously (some as few as two, many to unlimited number of Kindles). To \u201cfree up\u201d one reading license, remove the book from one Kindle (through its UI) and sync. Copying via USB will not work for DRM protected content (most books sold by Amazon). Those books are encrypted at the time of download using a key derived from destination device serial number, and only the device it is intended for will be able to open it. So, download, don\u2019t copy. You can copy non-DRM\u2019ed content (usually from sources other than Amazon) via USB. But even then I find sending those books to my library at Amazon and later downloading them just like those I bought from Amazon more convenient. ",

You can also make them available in Amazon's 'Cloud' reading section.  Add your new device in under 'Your Devices'.  It's a bit of a nuisance because you have to do this in blocks of 10. There may be another way, but not that I am aware of.  Click on the [ ... ] and synchronise them to your new device. The easiest way by far is to connect your Kindle to a PC and copy your data to the new device. There are other answers already posted that provide clear instruction on how to do this. ",
