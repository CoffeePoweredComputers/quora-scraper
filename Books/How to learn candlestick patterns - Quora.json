            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written about it here: Do candlestick patterns work on their own? A systematic FX back-test using Python. A few useful information about them before you start trading them: Candlesticks on their own do not work but this does not mean that combining them with other indicators won\u2019t give us something profitable.If they did, then, they would be arbitraged directly and directly disappear. Remember the no free lunch principle in Finance. However, there are millions of possible patterns, and certainly many are profitable, but not the ones we see on the internet.There\u2019s no guarantee in trading, no perfect strategy, only good strategies based on many components (among them, you can include candlestick patterns as they are a gauge to market psychology). Do not believe signal providers that promise you 80\u201390% accuracy, they\u2019re scammers and will cause you to lose money. Please take this advice seriously.Anyway, here\u2019s a primer on some famous candlestick patterns: Candlesticks are a practical and easy way to understand the sentiment and the state of the market. Four basic information can be found when looking at a candle, the open price, the closing price, the high, and the low of the day (or week, month, etc.). Below is a simple representation of a bullish and a bearish candle.  FIGURE Bullish candle in white and a bearish candle in black. The sticks on the above are the highs and the sticks from the below are the lows of the period.  FIGURE Candlestick chart. CANDLESTICKS PATTERNS Dark-cloud This is a bearish pattern formed from two candles. The first candle is a bullish candle while the next one is bearish. Typically, the opening price of the bearish candle is above the closing price of the previous candle and it should close around its body. The greater the penetration of the bearish candle, the greater the probability of a top to occur.  FIGURE Dark Cloud Pattern. Piercing Pattern This is the counterpart of the dark-cloud. It is a bullish pattern. We see this pattern in a falling market, the first candle is bearish and the second one has to be bullish. Normally the second (bullish) candle opens lower than the first candle and should close at around half the length of the previous candle. This strikes a resembles with the bullish engulfing pattern, except that, with the latter, the body has to completely cover the previous candle\u2019s body.  FIGURE Piercing Pattern. The morning star The morning star is a bullish reversal pattern, thus occurring at the bottom of the market. It is composed of three candlesticks: \u00b7 The first candle should have a big body and should be bearish. \u00b7 The second candle has a small body that does not touch the first candle\u2019s body. \u00b7 The third candle should be bullish and should have a body that is inside the first candle\u2019s body.  FIGURE Morning star Pattern. The evening star This is the counterpart of the morning star, and it\u2019s a bearish reversal pattern. Basically, it has the same steps as the morning star: \u00b7 The first candle should have a big body and should be bullish. \u00b7 The second candle has a small body that does not touch the first candle\u2019s body. \u00b7 The third candle should be bearish and should have a body that is inside the first candle\u2019s body.  FIGURE Evening star Pattern. Sometimes the second candle can be a doji and it is perfectly fine to use it the same way as a morning or evening star. We call this pattern a doji star. When we say the body of the candle should not touch the previous candle\u2019s body, we mean a gap. Gaps are discontinuations in prices that occur due to sudden strengths of movement or a lack of liquidity. The Harami The Harami which means pregnant in Japanese is a two-candle pattern. It has a relatively small body which follows a full body candle, that is why it\u2019s called a Harami.  FIGURE Harami Pattern. Three black crows and Three white soldiers The three black crows\u2019 pattern is a pattern composed of three consecutive bearish candles that typically have their openings within the prior session\u2019s body (and not tails). The three white soldiers\u2019 pattern is the counterpart of the three black crows. It is therefore a bullish pattern.  FIGURE Three black crows Pattern.  FIGURE Three white soldiers Pattern. Gaps Gaps are discontinuations between prices and there is a belief that they have to be filled at some point in time. They are very valuable and have many types. A common gap is the one that occurs in ranging market and typically gets filled. A breakout gap signals a new trend and a runaway gap reinforces that trend.  FIGURE A gap. Tasuki The Tasuki is pattern formed by two candles that gap higher or lower. The color of the candles does not matter. What we should know is that this is a continuation pattern.  FIGURE Tasuki Pattern. The Tri-Star A basic and interesting candlestick pattern is the doji. It signals market neutral conditions or confusion. If a market is trending upwards and a doji appears, it could signal a correction or even a reversal. It\u2019s simply when the opening price equals the closing price which results in a \u2018+\u2019 candlestick shape. The Tri-Star is probably the rarest pattern of all. It is formed by three consecutive doji lines in a top or bottom. The middle doji has to be the either the highest at a top or the lowest at a bottom.  FIGURE Tri-Star Pattern at a market top.  FIGURE Tri-Star Pattern at a market bottom. Tower tops and bottoms A tower top occurs when there is an uptrend going and we notice the bodies of candles getting smaller and ranging until we see a big bearish candle that might start new trend.  FIGURE Tower top Pattern. A tower bottom occurs when the there is a downtrend going and we notice the bodies of candles getting smaller and ranging until we see a big bullish candle that might start a new trend.  FIGURE Tower bottom Pattern. ",

            "answer_text": "How do I learn candlestick patterns?  Candle stick charts are pretty much the norm in investing and trading however learning how to properly read one depends on how much time you are willing to put in. I know many traders including myself who have in the very high thousands of hours reading and analyzing charts who are experts at the price action of the instruments they invest and trade. Candle sticks should only be used for confluence of signals and never used to make a execution decision with real money in the live market. If you are a raw beginner just starting out look up Lance Beggs or Stephen Bigelow their candle stick presentations are the best online and they are free. The only time you should be executing a trade in the live market is if your metrics of your rule based trading plan you composed and work from are present on the chart and that\u2019s it. If you\u2019re trading a daily chart and using the End of Day method you are only looking at your chart at the close of RTH anyway. If your metrics are set up and match your rules you execute, if not, THEN NOT. Remember cash is also a position and you don\u2019t always have to be in there. The other advice I can give you is as I said, you should only be using candle stick signals to provide confluence of your metrics being present, you should not be using those kind of signals to govern trade execution and if you are and you\u2019re losing money maybe it\u2019s time you step back from your trading station and reflect why that is. If you\u2019re a raw beginner have a look at these books How to Build a Winning Rule Based Trading Plan, Daily Chart Trading for Beginners . Check out all of my other Quora content so you can learn how to do investing and trading properly. There is also a lot of beginner investor and trader information at my main blog. I hope this helps Good luck with your trading and investing and remember: Trade smart\u2026OR JUST DON\u2019T TRADE! Stock Trading Blogger ",
