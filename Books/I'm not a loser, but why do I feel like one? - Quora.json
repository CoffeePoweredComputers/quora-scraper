            "answer_text": "You\u2019re conflating two issues. You don\u2019t feel like a loser because you are a loser, you feel like a loser because you feel like a loser. People can and do feel like a great winner while suffering soul crushing defeat. People can and do feel like a loser when they are winning the highest honors. You might want to check and see if you really want to be a winner. Given my background, I knew at a very deep level that success is dangerous. You may have the same belief. If you do indeed want to feel like a winner, then check to be sure you are taking care of the basics - do you get enough sleep? Do you get enough vitamin D? Do you feel that you are of service to someone or something? It sounds like you are doing want you want, studying law, and that you have good friends. All good. Keep up the good work. But don\u2019t expect to feel like a winner just because you are winning. Feelings are more complicated than that. ",

            "answer_text": "This is one of the most confusing questions I\u2019ve ever seen. You boast that you have succeeded and have a good support system, but still somehow feel like a loser\u2026There are a few possibilities on why you feel this way: Your friends surpassed your accomplishments in life, making you feel like your already impressive accomplishments feel average. It is common for people to feel like they are average in an elite college if most other people in that college are more impressive even though there is a big world out there full of subpar people.You didn\u2019t really earn your accomplishments on your own or earned them the honest way and possibly took some shortcuts or help to achieve them. As a result, you feel like you got more than you feel like you deserved.",
