            "answer_text": "Simply, children pick up what the adults around them do frequently. So, it is advisable if you prompt the parents or the closest adult near to the child to start reading books while the child is sitting nearby. This would make the child curious as to what the adult is doing instead of paying attention to other things such as Smartphones or Television and instigate him to look through the said book to find anything interesting. There is another very effective technique, however, it would not work unless the child knows how to read. If the child can read, then instead of telling him to read storybooks, it is advisable that the adult starts reciting stories to the child. To build up the child\u2019s interest, this routine must be carried out every day at the same time unless the child gets completely gets accustomed to listening to stories on that specific time of the day. Then one day, you have to begin a story on such a subject that very much interests the child, and when the story reaches a high-point, stop reading the story and make some excuse as to why you can\u2019t finish it that day. Say that you are going to finish it later someday. When the child complains that you must finish the story, tell the child politely to finish it by reading himself/herself. If he refuses, keep the book open and go away, and unless the child reads the story, refuse to finish it no matter how much the child pleads. After the child finishes the story, carry on with the previous routine. Do this same thing once in two weeks or more, and slowly decrease the time gap between carrying out this process. One day, you will find the child has started reading all by himself/herself and you don\u2019t need to worry anymore about reciting another story to the child ever again. However, no method will dish out a 100 Percent success rate. You can only hope that the child has the desire to read books somewhere deep inside his mind, or else, nothing can make the child stick with books. Hope this helps! ",
