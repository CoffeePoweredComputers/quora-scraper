We seem to really enjoy having digital clutter in our lives. We buy books with good intentions, Then they rott on our shelves.  Why Do People Buy Books They Don't Read?The Decline of the American Book LoverBased on the website above it appears that people don't even buy or touch books. So people who at least buy them are one step better off than the people who don't even do anything with them.   Personally I've found a helpful system, I fill my book shelf. I read the book once, Then I get rid of it. I'm not allowed to get more books than my book shelf can hold, So I'm constantly getting rid of and buying new books. I take notes on my books, And If it bores me I don't finish it. ",
