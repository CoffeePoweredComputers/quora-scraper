            "answer_text": "I was walking past a closing down cafe in Falmer near Brighton about 3 years ago and noticed that the dumpster skip was full of the whole contents of the cafe. I came back in half an hour in my van and pulled out out of the skip; 2 la Cimbali M1 coffee machines, 2 la Cimbali milk coolers, a fully automatic hot chocolate machine, a pro meat slicer and various other bits. i had to root around to find the drip trays and other accessories but it was all there. Everything worked fine, the coffee machines just needed their regular service . They were a bit scuffed on the plastic side panels from being manhandled into the skip, but i polished out the scuffs with T cut and toothpaste. Look online, a La Cimbali M1 costs nearly \u00a310 000 new. If you cant find a dumpster skip full of all the gear that you need, you could start small with what you can afford. Do super high end drip filter coffee with hand made cups. Yum! Good luck with the cafe. Its very hard work for very little rewards, but if you really want it, live the dream! ",
