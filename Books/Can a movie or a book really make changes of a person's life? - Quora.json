            "answer_text": "Yes, it can change your perception. Our brain cannot distinguish between feelings triggered by something you experience or something you see or understand from a book. That\u2019s why meditation works, that\u2019s why if you read you develop faster and in a more meaningful way. You cannot experience in one lifetime the joy of success, the pain of losing everything, war, being imprisoned, being different; the loss of your land, your love, your health, your family, the fight for something important, the indifference for that important thing; being alienated, being part of everything; but you can experience and understand by reading and watching good movies. You need to wish to understand, and you need have empathy otherwise you can read and watch as much as you like and remain unchanged. ",

            "answer_text": "YES & NO. It largely depends on your mindset when you read a book/watch a movie & more importantly, it depends on your course of action towards the impulsive feeling ! So, YES: You feel stimulated and take action to change and HOLD ON to it. That\u2019s a WIN. NO: You feel the adrenaline rush, get super motivated BUT take NO-action. You just move-on with your regular stuff\u2019s. When i saw this question, i immediately remembered these quotes (below) which formed the basis of this answer. \u201cWhen the student is ready, the teacher will appear\u201d - Source: A quote by Lao Tzu \u201cWhen you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it\u201d - Source: A quote from The Alchemist ",

            "answer_text": "Not exactly the most inspirational, but still relevant. Many moons ago, I watched the remake of \u201cDawn of the dead\u201d. In one scene, a woman arrives with a group of survivors, complaining of severe pain. It turns out she is infected with the zombie virus and has to be dispatched. After she is killed, the new and old survivors remark how no one knew what her name was. It was then I realized what made the scene so tragic. She died without a name. She was just another body in the quicklime pit, and will be buried with all the other nameless victims. I decided that I would not share the same fate as \u201cFattycakes\u201d in the movie. My life, and death, would be meaningful. I will do something worthwhile, something others would appreciate long after I am gone. I would make my life meaningful, let others prosper because of my work, I refuse to die without a name. ",
