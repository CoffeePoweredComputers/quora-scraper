            "answer_text": "Agatha Christie saw lots of Belgian refugees after first world war near her home. So she wrote about this Belgian refugee who used to be in Belgian police. Only problem was she had thought that was only one time thing. She never had imagined she had to keep on writing about the character. If you read her autobiography you will see her frustration with the character. To start with in the first book only Poirot was supposed to be around 60 so she herself wondered how could he kept on living and solving murder even after he was 100 maybe. She did not know much about Belgium too. She has expressed her frustration through her alter ego Ariadne Oliver in her books too. ",

            "answer_text": "Frankly, I am not too amazed. Poirot is a fastidious, egoistic, short, eccentric, bald (with a false beard and a false moustache) french-speaking Belgian. In short, a foreigner. She created him possibly inspired by the eccentric characters created by Arthur Conan Doyle and others. She created him and my belief is that she detested him from the beginning. The popularity with the readers kept her going. In her later years, she herself has admitted that she hated Poirot. By 1930, Agatha Christie found Poirot \"insufferable\", and by 1960 she felt that he was a \"detestable, bombastic, tiresome, ego-centric little creep\". Yet the public loved him and Christie refused to kill him off, claiming that it was her duty to produce what the public liked.
