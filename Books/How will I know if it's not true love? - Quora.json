            "answer_text": "The first thing to do in regard to a question like this is to define your terms. For example: What do you mean by true love? What would it mean to you to \u201cknow\u201d that about your current relationship? Second, consider the great practical difficulty that perhaps \u201ctrue love\u201d is just a mistaken concept, in terms of love. Does the idea of \u201ctrue\u201d love negate or diminish actual and meaningful love? Third, do some research on love and evolution, and try to come to grips with how love functions in terms of evolution and brain chemistry. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s kind of hard to answer, but just remember that no relationship is perfect, they all have their ups and downs. Another thing you could think about is would you be proud/happy to have a child that\u2019s like them? Do they act like they hate you? Do they try to put any effort in spending time with you? Can you see yourself with this person in the future? ",
