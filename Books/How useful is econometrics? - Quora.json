            "answer_text": "How useful is econometrics? What did Hume mean by reason is the slave to passions? Why is ethics a considered a practical science? What is the extent of the usefulness of Adam Smith\u2019s system? Before I give my very negative answer I have to enlighten the higher element of the science, those that are aware of the chief progress of western philosophy, so that they [do] understand that the criticism I am about give [does] need to be answered. There has to be an element of the science that is aware of the popularity of Adam Smith among that part of MIND that is fascinated with useful. Useful as I use it here means; of such great practical use there is no end of it. I have doctored the definition up a bit but it is for a good cause. I am trying to expose the element of Smith scholarship that feels the power of the system is much greater than the a priori mind, that mind that is prone to go into econometrics or one of the other useless fields, [can] understand. First thing I have to do is qualify my idea that the a priori mind is useless. The Reasoning proper mind is not actually useless. These minds obviously have many uses. The problem is it is out of its league in the critical matters of life; ethics, economics, and the very broad endeavor that could be characterized as \u201cintellectual art\u201d. I want to say one more thing as it will allow the man of science to save face. I am not saying that you guys are intellectually inferior only that you have got to get your mental faculties straight; you gotta allow your instincts to rule your reason. Actually this is not the way to put it. I don\u2019t want to confuse you guys. I have to get this right before I launch into Hume\u2019s \u201cOf the influencing motives of the will\u201d. Second try to pass a critical idea: I need to put Hume\u2019s idea of the dominant species of reason, the active part of our mind, into a pithy statement (a natural law) whereas it will bring to mind how [certain] of the very very complex feelings within our mind are prioritized not instincts. Instincts are the whole of feelings as they are to ensure our prosperity, safety, livelihood, economic status, etc., etc., etc., they have to be reprioritized within as evolution of culture has naturally done already \u2014 this is a critical reason to read the Scotts. I am not getting this right. It is too difficult to explain. I will have to leave it. Before I do I have to give a quote from Hume as it is important in the perfecting of this idea of getting your feelings straight as the forces in life naturally allow \u2014 actually insisted is the better word; Hume brings to mind that our instincts were to be adjusted within so that certain feelings [did] get priority. I have to give the critical aiding quote without explaining it. Then leave this that is of great aid in explaining how econometrics is truly useless as a science and move into the pithy proof that it is. The following is associative understanding that econometrics is not useful \u2014 not at all. In fact they are (arguably) the biggest bunch of zeroes of science: \u201cIf we consider the ordinary course of human actions, we shall find, that the mind restrains not itself by any general and universal rules; but acts on most occasions as it is determined by its present motives and inclination. As each action is a particular individual event, it must proceed from particular principles, and from our immediate situation within ourselves, and with respect to the rest of the universe. If on some occasions we extend our motives beyond those very circumstances, which gave rise to them, and form something like general rules for our conduct, it is easy to observe, that these rules are not perfectly inflexible, but allow of many exceptions. Since, therefore, this is the ordinary course of human actions, we may conclude, that the laws of justice, being universal and perfectly inflexible, can never be derived from nature, nor be the immediate offspring of any natural motive or inclination.\u201d Excerpt From: David Hume. \u201cA Treatise of Human Nature.\u201d iBooks. Hume is saying that the laws of justice were not of nature but strictly a matter of great practicalness to man; they had to be probable reasoned with the desired outcome of usefulness in the form of progress or what the liberal mind calls progressivism. I have to say one more thing about this before I wrap it up. Hume did say that justice was artificial in spite of this I have to warn the reader that this is where many scholars of Hume bite the dust total understanding that is in Hume wise. You gotta read Hume in the spotlight of evolution or you will fall into the trap of supercilious idiocy that has been naturally set for you. \u201cOf the influencing motives of the will\u201d is the source of [the] basic understanding that [tells] naturally cultured instincts econometrics is not useful at all. I am tired. You guys will just have to read it yourself \u2014 I am truly exhausted. Not saying I am not going to help only that it will be when I am rested and it will be in a different question answer. In the meantime enjoy Hume. ",

            "answer_text": "Econometrics, a combination of mathematics, statistics and computation which is used to analyze economic economic data is useless in isolation, it's relevance lies in it supporting a specific economic theory or comparing competing theories. Aris Spanos once said,   No economic theory was ever abandoned because it was rejected by some empirical econometric test, nor was a clear cut decision between competing theories made in the light of evidence of such a test.  In this sense, econometrics will never lose its relevance because a theory without evidence is just speculation and econometrics or statistical analysis in general is the only tool that can provide that evidence. Hundreds of false and ludicrous theories are rejected every year because of some or the other flaw in their econometric model and economics will be flooded with thousands more if econometrics is not used to verify them.  This is not to say econometrics is all encompassing. As economics is evolving, so are the methods to analyze economic data and conduct economic research. There is increasing emphasis on experimental economics and high quality research papers have been published using calibration and simulations. Econometrics is now the secondary empirical method for many areas of economics. It is still useful for its simplicity compared to its alternatives and this gives it greater acceptance though. Paul Semuelson summarized it the best when he said,   Even if a scientific regularity were less accurate than intuitive hunches of a virtuoso, the fact that it can be put into operation by thousands of people who are not virtuosos gives it transcendental importance.   An undergrad economics student can run regressions, while a normal undergrad without special training cannot run simulations or calibrations. Confirmation bias can give me hundreds of spurious correlation but it is upto me to not pay any heed to them unless I know how to correctly use econometrics and rely on my theory based judgment when thinking whether to accept or reject the results of a regression. Econometrics is useful if I use it well.  But then again,   ",
