            "answer_text": "Interesting stance. I enjoyed both authors, though each had their strengths and weaknesses. If you really want to get a good summary, and you want it to be meaningful and actually useful for once you start reading the series, then the best option is the Official Tor Wheel of Time Re-read series: Wheel of Time Reread, done by Leigh Butler. They have a good deal of depth and exploration of the series, which is a must considering the extreme length of Wheel of Time If for some reason you really want to skim and miss most of the good parts, then I guess technically the Wheel of Time Wikia would sort of summarize the bare bones of the plot. But at that point, you\u2019re effectively reading condensed snippets of a 4.4 million word series, which, frankly, seems like a waste of time. If you have to, do the Tor Re-Read, then jump into Sanderson once you reach his books. It won\u2019t be nearly as fun as reading the series from the start, but it will kind of get you there. Anything short of that, and you\u2019re basically doing the joke summary: Wheel of time abridged, some fun for WoT fans. ",

            "answer_text": "Wheel of Time Reread on Tor had a great blog series. They did a re-read of the whole thing with summaries and analysis as they went. Tor in general is a great resource for Fantasy and Emily Asher Perrin\u2019s writing on the genre is delightful. Otherwise, Wheel has an entire Companion book and if you find the original \u201cWorld of Wheel\u201d it won\u2019t contain spoilers for the last few books.  My unasked for opinion follows. Please ignore if you just want to know where to read about the series. Honestly, I just wouldn\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t imagine any of the books Sanderson co-wrote resonating if I didn\u2019t already care about the characters and the build ups are intense only if you\u2019ve travelled the journey with the characters. It\u2019s like watching Return of the Jedi because you like Ewoks. Or jumping into Harry Potter at The Half Blood Prince. Sure, you can roughly follow what\u2019s going on, who\u2019s good, who\u2019s bad, and who needs to be smacked over the head and roasted over a slow fire, but the emotional resonance won\u2019t be there. It won\u2019t touch you. Also, Sanderson isn\u2019t writing as himself, or for his usual audience. He\u2019s writing for Jordan\u2019s audience, building Jordan\u2019s world, completing Jordan\u2019s vision. That means the characters are built already, the magic is in place, and there\u2019s no room for the double switch-back that you get with say, Maris. And \u201cthere\u2019s always another secret\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here. He changes both his style and his plotting. The joins are particularly obvious in The Gathering Storm, which is caught between two authors. Overall, it\u2019s not really Sanderson. However, if you can\u2019t be dissuaded, read the first half of book 1, Eye of the World, which introduces almost everyone who matters, read some blogs and some of the Companion, and then be prepared to be very confused when you move onto book 12 and tiny details you don\u2019t know suddenly matter a lot. Or just re-read Sanderson\u2019s entire output, by which time he\u2019ll probably have another two books out. ",
