            "answer_text": "\u201cExcellence demands effort and planned, deliberate practice of increasing difficulty.\u201d (K. Anders Erricson) While reading a lot is a very good way to come across new words, you won\u2019t be able to retain them unless you make a conscious effort towards applying those new words. Here\u2019s what I do - I maintain a separate notebook to list down any new words I come across while reading. I come back to the list immediately after I finish reading and look up their words in the dictionary. I never write down the dictionary meaning of the new word in my notebook. Instead - If I can sketch the meaning/ associate an imagery with the word, I do a rough sketch next to it. If its not possible to do that, I write the meaning of the word as I understood from the dictionary (i.e. in my own words). This ensures that I have internalized the meaning instead of simply memorizing it.I make a column \u201csimilar to\u201d next to the word and write 2\u20133 synonyms of that word. This is important to put the word in a frame of reference and to know which word from my current vocabulary I can substitute with this fancy new one.If there are any nuances or restrictions in the usage of the word, I make a note of it. For e.g. some words are more technical and make sense if used in medical or legal or any other specialized context. This ensures that I use the word in the correct context instead of sounding like a braggart who just uses big words.I write an example sentence in which that word is used or I make a note of the original sentence where I first came across that word. This helps pick up the correct syntax/ grammar around the word.I come back to my vocabulary notebook once a week, pick any one word at random and try to use it during any of my conversation/ communication over the next week. This ensures that I also pay attention to the correct pronunciation.I know this seems like too much effort and you definitely don\u2019t need to follow all the steps I listed above. Even if you do any one of the above, I can assure you that you will retain new words for longer and actually be able to use them frequently. It is all about intentionally applying what you have learned. Knowledge is a necessary but not sufficient condition to pick up any skill. Hope this helps! Feel free to comment if you think I can improve or optimize my methodology. ++bonus tip: solving crosswords and playing other word building games is a very good way to improve your vocabulary. ",
