            "answer_text": "In publishing, a distinction is often made between a \u201cshort story\u201d, \u201cnovelette\u201d, \u201cnovella\u201d and \u201cnovel\u201d based upon the number of words used. These distinctions are rather arbitrary, with the latter three terms basically being \u201cnovel\u201d in three different languages. I\u2019ve seen novels called novels just because they are published on their own, while a longer text gets called a \u201cnovella\u201d just because it is included as part of a collection. And I\u2019ve seen, e.g., \u201cnovellas\u201d called \u201cnovels\u201d just because they wound up being serialized in 2 or more parts. And, to confuse matters more, I\u2019ve seen single novels that are larger than some series or trilogies. With graphic novels, you cannot even arbitrarily define a \u201cnovel\u201d by the number of words used. Once upon a time, a \u201cgraphic novel\u201d was all about the format, NOT the page count. Essentially, it referred to a single issue, self-contained item with glossy pages larger than a regular comic book. This could be contrasted with a one-off \u201cspecial\u201d (regular dimensions and printing, but often with extra pages), or a \u201cspecial issue\u201d (ditto). A \u201cgraphic novel\u201d could still fit in somewhere with a regular periodical (e.g. an X-Men graphic novel), meaning it wasn\u2019t an entity in and of itself. And a \u201cspecial\u201d could still have a much higher page count than a \u201cgraphic novel\u201d. But a \u201cgraphic novel\u201d tended to have a larger page count than a typical comic, and had that glossy stock. In contrast, there\u2019s also your \u201cTreasury Edition\u201d, which was on regular newsprint, but at a super large size, and with extra pages. Again, it could be a one-off like \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d, or fit into a series like \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d. Then there\u2019s also the \u201cmagazines\u201d, like Epic Illustrated, Savage Sword of Conan, etc, etc. But, lets face it, some people now refer to anything as a \u201cgraphic novel\u201d \u2014 even a typical 32 page publication \u2014 merely because it sounds more mature than \u201ccomic book\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a novel, therefore it is literature. It is not funny, therefore it is not a comic\u201d. We no longer have a unique term for those glossy giants. My suggestion is this: A graphic novel should take up as many pages as are required to best tell the story in question. Not a page more, not a page less. Then the publisher should market it at a price that is reasonable for its size and quality of printing. That said, the total number of pages of the published item (including covers, end pages, intros, etc) would need to be divisible by 4 \u2014 the only other option would be publishing a 2-pager on one sheet, which I doubt anyone would consider to be a \u201cnovel\u201d (and calling a single sheet folded many times into multiple pages a \u201c2-pager\u201d to try to call me out would be cheating).

            "answer_text": "Enough pages so that the price per page is less than buying all of the collected issues (or hypothetical collected issues, if it\u2019s an OGN) individually. Let\u2019s break this down:  DC\u2019s Drawing the Line/Rebirth $2.99/20 page comics - $0.1495 - 15 cents a page. DC and Marvel\u2019s standard $3.99/22 page comics - $0.18136 - 18 cents a page. DC\u2019s $9.99/80 page giants - $0.124875 - 12/13 cents a page DC\u2019s $9.99/98 page celebration issues - $0.1019 - 10 cents a page DC\u2019s $4.99/100 page giant original+reprint magazines - $0.0499 - 5 cents a page DC\u2019s Prestige Format oversized comics $5.99/50 pages - $0.1198 - 12 cents a page Okay, so disregarding the $5 reprint outlier, we have a price point that ranges from about 10\u201320 cents a page, usually around 15\u201318 for \u201cnormal\u201d comics. Let\u2019s take a few examples of trade collections (graphic novels):  Batgirl: Stephanie Brown volumes 1 and 2 $24.99/296 or 327 pages (semi-omnibus style collecting 12 issues or more) - $0.0844 or $0.0764 - 8 cents a page. Batman volume 9: The Tyrant Wing $16.99/148 pages (collecting 5 issues, two of them oversized) - $0.11479 - 11/12 cents a page Batgirl volume 5: Art of the Crime $16.99/152 pages (collecting approximately 6 issues) - $0.111776 - 11 cents a page So, in general, I expect a price to page ration of about 8 \u201312 cents a page for a graphic novel collection. Otherwise I don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting my money\u2019s worth. ",
