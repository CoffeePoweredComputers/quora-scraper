            "answer_text": "I am a huge fan of Jane Austen so I echo the several recommendations you have received about her books. I am also a fan of Elizabeth Gaskell. In particular, someone 14 years old can probably appreciate Gaskell's masterpiece, Wives and Daughters, as well as her other books (some people compare Gaskell's North and South to Austen's Pride and Prejudice, although I don't find them very similar.) Anthony Trollope is hilarious and you should give him a look and see if you like what you find. I also really enjoyed reading The Hobbit when I was about your age, and many people your age get into the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Have you read much science fiction or dystopian fiction? As a genre, SF is old enough to have classics of its own.  If you haven't read Fahrenheit 451 you need to move it right up to the top of your list. I loved Isaac Asimov's robot stories, collected in I, Robot, when I was about your age.  I also spent a lot of time reading short story anthologies in science fiction, featuring stories by Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, C.M. Kornbluth,  Jerome Bixby, and others. In modern speculative fiction I recommend the \"Bigend trilogy\" by William Gibson: Pattern Recognition, Spook Country, Zero History. Then there are the classic American literary fiction writers: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James (American and British), Edith Wharton. There's so much there. Read The Great Gatsby, Washington Square, The Portrait of a Lady, The House of Mirth, The Age of Innocence. Enjoy! Please feel free to come back and ask more questions. ",

            "answer_text": "I have not reviewed the other answers, so I am sure there will be several dupes. Foundational Literature: The books you are expected to have read, because they are the most basic ones, ones that are referred to constantly: The Epic of Gilgamesh. More a curiosity, but it is interesting to see where literature came from. The Odyssey and the Iliad, Homer. The Divine Comedy, Dante. Don Quixote, Cervantes. The Canterbury Tales, Chaucer. L\u2019Morte d\u2019Arthur. Sherlock Holmes. Dracula, Stoker Frankenstein, Shelley The Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway Genre Fiction: More specialized tastes. Detective fiction: I, The Jury, Spillane The Maltese Falcon, Hammett The Big Sleep, Chandler Science Fiction: The Lensman Series, E.E. Smith Cordwainer Smith, Collected Stories. The Foundation trilogy, Asimov The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Heinlein Ender\u2019s Game, Orson Scott Card. Literary fiction: Whatever you like. Frankly, I did not enjoy Edith Wharton, Dickens, Trollope, or James Joyce, but tastes do differ. History is neglected as a \u201cgenre\u201d, but several history authors are excellent writers: David McCullough, just about anything. I have never read a bad book by him. Simon Winchester, just about anything. I have never read a bad book by him. Richard Rhodes, the Making of the Atomic Bomb. John Hersey, Hiroshima. All about the nuking of Hiroshima. David Kahn, the Codebreakers, cryptography through history. The Story of Civilization, Will and Ariel Durant. 11 volume history, about 12,000 pages, and well worth the time it takes to read it. Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond. Puts history in perspective. I could go on for hours, but you would not have time to read them all. What I recommend is find a list of \u201c100 best books\u201d, read some of them, and see what you like. Not all \u201cclassics\u201d are to everyone\u2019s taste. The only reason you read some of them is for class; others you read because you enjoy them. ",
