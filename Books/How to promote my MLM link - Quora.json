            "answer_text": "Promoting MLM using any media is a slippery slope. If distributors were allowed to openly promote their \u201cbusiness\u201d, within days social media would be saturated with distributor websites promoting their MLM products/business. However, MLM is highly dependent on recruiting (because recruits represent the vast majority of product purchases and other corporate revenues), and who would join any MLM \u201copportunity\u201d if a quick google search showed there were literally 1000\u2019s of competitors located within 50 miles? For that reason, almost all MLMs have strict policies preventing freedom to promote\u2026..unless you pay a fee to corporate and use their in-house approved sites\u2026..at additional cost. ",
