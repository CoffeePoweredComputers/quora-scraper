            "answer_text": "It depends entirely on how you have built this character up to that point. If you have created a reasonable personality for whom such a situation would be believable, or if you have created a situation where the shock of such a situation would be an important turning point in the character\u2019s life then you could probably get away with it if it is well written. Surprise breaking of character can be effective if it\u2019s important and rational within the story. Men, generally, tend to be stoic and withhold their emotions, but that is a generality and cannot be applied to every single male character, that would be boring. But if you have built such a stoic character then you had better have set up an exceptionally good reason for him to break out of that shell. A small example, My character of Brigadier General Chip York, USMC, a tough, stoic, combat proven Marine, opening up to his friend regarding the love of his life: \u201cYou envy me? You think I don\u2019t have any doubts, that everything is simple and easy for us? You think I don\u2019t worry about being 12 years older than her or that she\u2019s a ravishing, gorgeous, world famous celebrity recognized everywhere we go and that every sane, healthy male on the planet fantasizes about having sex with her? \u201cBut I love her and if there\u2019s one thing I HAVE learned about relationships it\u2019s that you can\u2019t spend your whole life waiting for the perfect one to come along. When you find one that feels pretty good you have to grab it and work with it and adapt to its problems as best you can. Otherwise you\u2019re going to have a long, lonely, empty, life.\u201d Out of character for Chip, something he would never admit or say to anyone but his friend Al, and then only in that specific situation. Not a perfect example, but you get the point. ",

So if something terrible had happened to your male character, like a break up, and if he is opening up emotionally, it is realistic. Check this out. I wrote one scene for you. He looked at his mother. She was there, staring at him. A shadow of grief crossed over her face as she realized something. \u201cWhat happened, son?\u201d He didn\u2019t want to say anything. With trembling lips he was only able to say one word. \u201cNothing.\u201d There was a pause. She came near to him and cupped her hands over his face. He tried his best to hide the pain behind the mask of his smile. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m there for you to listen.\u201d Her simple words were the only thing he wanted to hear. And then he revealed his grief. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It can be realistic. It depends on the emotional intelligence of your character as well as the situation. For example, if he tends to bottle up his feelings, choosing to bear the weight on his own and a tragedy happens which can be minuscule or huge, pushes him over the edge, then in a fit, he opens up because the dam with his stoic mask, has broken and perhaps unintentionally he out pours emotions to his family. Another situation could be, he\u2019s sensitive and yearns the compulsion of being adored or touch of sympathy that he\u2019s been denied so long and his family is the closest thing he has left. The right mix of the situation, the character\u2019s attitude and his family can make it realistic. ",
