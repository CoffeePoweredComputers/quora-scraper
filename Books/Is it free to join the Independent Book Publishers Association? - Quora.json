Independent Book Publishers Association (membership fee page) Now, since I went through the trouble of answering this for you (the answer is no, it\u2019s not free), could you at least do me the courtesy of explaining why you asked here? I\u2019m curious because so many questions on Quora can be answered with a 10-second Google search. I really don\u2019t get it (and I\u2019m not counting \u201ctrivia questions\u201d; this one obviously isn\u2019t). Thanks.
