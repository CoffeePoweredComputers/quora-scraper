            "answer_text": "Yes you can go with solving full NCERT questions at least 3 times before the board exams. You need to focus on the concepts plus the requirement of the question. Go through illustrations very well becoz they are asked straight away. Keep aside RD Sharma as now the time left for your exams is very less and our board organisation follows its books not the books made on the basis of NCERT. All the very best.Hv faith in NCERT. You will rock . ",
