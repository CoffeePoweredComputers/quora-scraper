            "answer_text": "I will give a traditional answer: start with classic adventure novels. These books were produced to cater to a wider audience, so they are easy to read. Many of them are possitively hooking, because they were released in installments with cliffhangers, much in the same way TV series are released nowadays. Besides, they have been filtered by the tides of history: only the best have become famous and come to us. And you may be somewhat familiar with the plot (after all they are really famous) so you may want to find out what it is all about. Some of my favourites: \"The prisoner of Zenda\", by Anthony Hope; very short but intriguing story.\"Robinson Crusoe\", by Daniel Defoe; be aware that the language is from centuries ago, so if you do not want to struggle with it...\"The three musketeers\", by Alexander Dumas; there is a second and a third part, if you fancy those.\"Michael Strogoff\", by Jules Verne; its race-against-time structure makes it really appealing.\"King Solomon's mines\", by Sir H. Rider Haggard; it is just so exciting because of its \"lost world\" plot.\"Dracula\", by Bram Stoker; some people are critical of its Victorian style and spirit; to me it is superb.\"The black arrow\", by Robert Louis Stevenson; one of the best historical novels of all times, set in a period that partially inspired \"Game of thrones\"...Last, but definitely not least, \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", again by Dumas. This is probably the most powerful novel of the list. Monte Cristo is the epitome of the revengeful man, and the novel, set in Dumas times, is the story of treachery, vengeance and its consequences; brilliant. It is really long, but is made of an infinity of short chapters which were released periodically, most have a cliffhanger, so it pushes you to keep reading.I think these are good choices to get into the habit of reading. They are first class, they are, generally easy to read and use plot and topics we can relate to, as most of it is adventure and action. Never underestimate the classics! Edit: I cannot believe I have forgotten Jack London. He has great novels, but if you are getting into the habit of reading you should check his short stories. There are a great number of them, all amazing. They provide a lot of food for thought! ",

            "answer_text": "I wish I could give you a better answer, because it\u2019s going to vary enormously depending on your tastes. For example, some people get quickly addicted to mysteries even though the general formula is roughly the same. Ditto romance novels. Ditto Westerns. Mysteries, in particular, can be a kind of \u201cmental cotton candy\u201d that some people never grow tired of. But I am going to offer a suggestion that is effectively 4 books in 1, or rather 4 stories in 1. Stephen King\u2019s anthology of novellas, \u201cDifferent Seasons\u201d was the very first King book I read and still, in my opinion, by far the best. There is a \u201chorror\u201d theme to some of these 4 stories but\u2026 and this is the beauty of it\u2026 these are not just strictly horror stories. They are four great, chilling, fast-paced, emotionally powerful stories. They are very rich in character and each has a strong narrator\u2019s voice, making each a pleasure to read. In King\u2019s intro to the book (at least the edition that I read), he lamented the lack of marketability of the novella form \u2014 somewhere in length between a short story and a full-length novel\u2026 typically about 80 pages. But here\u2019s the beauty of it in this case: short stories are typically too short for film adaptations (and have to be expanded), while full-length novels are typically too long and have to be cut, cut, cut\u2026 But the novella turns out to be precisely the right length for a film. And perhaps not surprisingly, as a result, THREE OF THESE FOUR STORIES have been made into major Hollywood movies\u2026 and two of those are even considered GREAT, or near great movies! And yet even if you\u2019ve seen these movies, the experience of having everything retold in King\u2019s own voice is very worthwhile. I had the good fortune to read all these stories before any became movies. One of them is \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d or rather its title in the original book: \u201cRita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\u201d which King labeled as the \u201cSpring\u201d portion of the four \u201cdifferent seasons,\u201d subtitled \u201cHope Springs Eternal.\u201d My favorite Stephen King anecdote. One day King was shopping in a little store somewhere in a small town, and he came across a middle aged lady, who looked at him funny and said, \u201cAren\u2019t you the guy who writes a lot of those horror novels?\u201d King nodded politely and said, \u201cYes, Ma\u2019am, I\u2019ve written a number of those.\u201d And the lady responds by saying, \u201cWell, I HATE horror and thriller novels! They\u2019re way too violent. What I want is a good story. I wish more writers could write a really good story, like \u2018The Shawshank Redemption\u2019!\u201d Stephen King smiles and says, \u201cWell actually, I did write the Shawshank Redemption.\u201d She scowls at him and shouts, \u201cNo you didn\u2019t!\u201d Anyway, the Shawshank Redemption is just one of the four novellas in King\u2019s \u201cDifferent Seasons.\u201d Another is a story called \u201cThe Body\u201d in the book, but they changed the title to \u201cStand By Me\u201d when they made it into a film. I hope you will enjoy these four stories as much as I did. And anyway, Stephen King did write The Shawshank Redemption. Every last word of it. And to his credit, the screenplay matches the original story almost scene-for-scene, much of the dialog word-for-word. The story is so good, either on the page or the screen, that it required almost no changes in going from one form to another. It\u2019s just a perfect story as it is. ",
