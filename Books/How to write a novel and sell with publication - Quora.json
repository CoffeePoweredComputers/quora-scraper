            "answer_text": "Hi, WARNING! What I am about to say would hurt your feelings. Writing, publishing, and selling novels are three different parts of writing and you need a hell lot of patience and good writing to achieve success. Writing and getting published is not as easy as people tell you. One cannot become George RR Martin overnight. There is no shortcut. Writing - Be brave enough to write. And finish writing. Because many people just start and lose the passion. They never finish their novels. Publishing - This is another world! You have to pitch an agent who could pitch your story to a publishing house which takes between 4 weeks to forever! That is why people turn to self-publishing and never make money because there is no marketing strategy in place. Some have also started to self-publish for free on KDP. But it is really hard to get good reviews, ranking, and sales. Selling - Many friends, relatives, and acquaintances ask for a free copy. Why the hell did you write a book? To sell! But no one is just interested in reading unless it is free. Thus, I think you must approach a great editor and get your book edited once you have written it. Later, take that to an agent who can pitch it for you. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "First you have to learn how to write a novel and that\u2019s where education comes in educate yourself learn everything you need to know about writing a novel and then concern yourself with publishing. If you don\u2019t write a good strong book you won\u2019t get it published and even if you sell it privately he won\u2019t sell anything if it\u2019s not good. Education is always the key. ",
