            "answer_text": "He was extremely angry and with good reason. Dumbledore had been ignoring him all year despite all he had been through and his previous closeness, his godfather had just died and it was a bad year. Harry doesn't need the fragment of Voldemort's soul to get angry. I'm not even sure it could take over him. So no, he was just angry and grieving, not a good combination. ",
