            "answer_text": "I see it as a negative. Not completely undivided negative, but nevertheless on the whole negative. So what's the good part ?  I think it's genuinely a good thing that the world is becoming more open about female sexuality; that adult women will now openly read a erotic book on the bus, and discuss it with others. This increasing freedom is a good thing; for far too long has women been treated as if they're forbidden from having a sexuality. The bad parts ? I don't like this particular erotic book; there's both literary and feminist reasons for this; I'll stick to the feminist ones here since that's what the question asks about. First, the relationship as portrayed is abusive; and yet portrayed as if it's a good thing. Healthy BDSM is not the same thing as abuse (at all!), and yet in this book there's several elements that are more like abuse than like BDSM. And secondly, of course I'm not a fan of the dream of billionaire-boy. I don't think women should aspire to earn a living by-way-of being loved by a wealthy man. And this story spends a huge deal of time on talking about and demonstrating how massively wealthy he is. In fact his two only positive traits are pretty much wealth and good looks; I dare say that if a poor man of sub-average looks had treated her the same way; the reception would've been different. ",

I haven't seen it (obviously! xD), but I know that it and the movie promote very unhealthy ideas about BDSM. The relationship between the two main characters is apparently similar to abuse (apprently the guy stalks her and ignores consent and safewords? if this is true, that's not okay, ever), and I hate the idea of women watching this movie or reading the book and thinking that that is a \"normal\", healthy relationship, because that can only lead to more abusive relationships, sexual assult and domestic violence in real life.
