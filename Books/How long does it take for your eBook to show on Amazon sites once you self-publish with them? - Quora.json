            "answer_text": "After you have pushed PUBLISH then the pop up declares that it is done in 72 hours with a congratulating message. If everything is ok, then you start observing the term \u2018Publishing\u2019 within 6 hours. If it takes more than 12 hours, be sure you are going to get some email from them raising some issue about your book. In short, they ask for 72 hours but they take very less time to bring it on Amazon. The gree colour LIVE starts appearing in less than 12 hours. All the above observations are based on my experience after publishing 20 books with them. In the case of Google Books, they generally do it in 12 hours. Once they did it in three hours with one of my books. But, it takes nearly 24 hours when you book start showing overall their portals. ",

            "answer_text": "It might take up to 3 days (72 hours) for Amazon KDP to publish your book once you submit it. They check your book files to make sure they don\u2019t violate any of KDP policies. But once your book is accepted and published, it becomes available in all the stores you selected when setting up the book for publishing in your KDP dashboard. eBooks take lesser time to come live than paperbacks. Most times my eBooks come live the same day I submitted the book files, latest the next day. But my paperbacks take up to 2 days to come live. But if you update any of your book files (cover or manuscript), it may take up to 3 days (72 hours) for the changes to reflect in your book (that is, if you republished your book, your changes will be live in 72 hours). Check my blog, Microsofttut for more Amazon KDP self-publishing tips and tutorials. ",
