            "answer_text": "No. But some spaces can retain the energy left behind if the people who lived there before were violent, miserable, hateful, cruel or sick. You can walk in and feel the energy in the space if you are sensitive to it. You just get a feeling that something is off or not right, or you feel pockets of coldness when you walk through a room or maybe you have a hard time feeling comfortable there. You can look up how to cleanse a space - usually using sound vibrations, burning sage or other methods - and open a window to allow the negativity to escape or be driven out. I don\u2019t believe that any house is permanently negative. You can also get a book on Feng Shui and read about how to change the energy of a home, based on where it is located and other structural features. You can always change your luck. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A: Can houses really cause bad luck? Houses can only cause bad luck for superstitious individuals who possess a very strong confirmation bias. It\u2019s all in their head. So, no! In reality, neither houses nor anything else can cause bad luck. The type of luck that implies a supernatural agent does not exist, nor even a supernatural realm.
