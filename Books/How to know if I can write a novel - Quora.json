            "answer_text": "If you have a story that takes you over and you know that you have to pen it down or else you will find no peace is when you know you can write. To write a novel, you should have an idea about a story. An idea which germinates inside your head and you put your heart into it to nurture it. Say you want to write to a love story, the characters are evolved in your mind the emotions you feel are the emotions the characters feel , the plot is what how you would like the characters to live. Writing is beautiful , only if you find the world of your imagination enticing. I rediscovered myself while writing my book of short stories called \u201cThe Lady in the Mirror\u201d and I am sure every writer goes through similar rediscovery while penning down his or her novel/story.

            "answer_text": "Firstly decide your storyline and all the characters in it... and then write a short version of the story and then break those lines in the summary into small parts, each of which is a chapter in your story....now expand those 1 or 2 lines and let your imagination work..... and who knows you are the next big thing in the world of literature. if you think you can write a novel.. there isn't any harm in trying 1... give it a try... atleast start writing it and if you enjoy doing it... then continue it. just make sure you give the character sketch of each of your characters and the places they go nicely... coz a novel is all about imagination and you must set a clear picture of your characters in the reader's mind. finally i wanna say, always keep a pocket diary handy and all the strange thoughts, good or bad, write in it.... coz its possible that a new and awesome thought strikes your mind regarding the story..... it can happen while you are watching tv, taking shower or anywhere as it is said that- MOST AMAZING THOUGHTS COME WHEN YOU ARE NOT EXPECTING THEM. I hope this helped you and read some good novels before doing your own as it would help you in getting a picture on how its done.......best of luck! :) ",

I mean, you HAVE written a story or two, haven\u2019t you? I mean, nobody would THINK of building a home who has not even nailed together a birdhouse, right? You expect your plumber to have the education and experience to know to shut off the water to the house before disconnecting the faucet, correct? ",

Writing a novel is mostly about focus and perseverance. The ability to write a successful novel comes second to actually picking up a pen/keyboard and writing day in and day out. Calling it an abomination or a masterpiece is something best left to the audience. ",
