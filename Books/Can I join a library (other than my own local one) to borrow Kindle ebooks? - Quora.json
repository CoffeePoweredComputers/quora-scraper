            "answer_text": "I can answer this question based on two anecdotal experiences. Growing up in rural Connecticut, I held a library card for my local library.  When I was in middle school, and the limitations of my small town library be came more apparent, my parents took me to the neighboring town which had a substantially larger and better funded library.  I was able to get a card for that library as well, despite not living in the town (apparently they would extend borrowing privileges to anyone who held a current library card from another CT public library).  As such I was able to borrow from both collections.  This was however before the era of Kindles and eBooks (one of the big draws of the larger library was their much more extensive VHS collection). Later, when I moved to Massachusetts for college, I got a card for the Boston Public Library.  The requirements are fairly easy to meet if you reside or work in MA.  When I moved to Medford, MA, I then acquired a card for the Minuteman Library Network, which has similarly simple requirements.  I held the two active library cards simultaneously. With the MLN card I was able to access their e-book borrowing system, although the titles that are available to you may vary depending on which branch you designate as your \"home branch\".  For the BPL, if you have a card, you can also access their e-book borrowing system.  To my knowledge there is no clause prohibiting you from taking advantage of both simultaneously. If you meet the requirements, you could even get an eCard for the BPL, which would allow you to access their digital resources without the need to actually go to a physical branch. In the end, it will mostly depend on the policies of the Library who's collection you wish to borrow from, but it appears that some (perhaps most) libraries have no conflict with you holding multiple library memberships.  The public library in your states largest city or capital might be an excellent place to start if you are seeking a more comprehensive collection to borrow from that you are eligible for without having to pay additional fees.

            "answer_text": "My kids and/or me are members of 3 library \u201cdistricts\u201d in the Bay Area in California. I was honest with them all and gave the home address of my city. I did physically go and join them in person- not sure if you can join on line. But we borrow ebooks from them all thru Libby and Overdrive apps and there were no joining fees for any. I plan on joining a couple more to reduce hold times and increase variety! Most library ebooks can be read on kindle - only a few can\u2019t and those are mostly graphic novels or picture books. The other great thing is the smaller districts let you recommend ebooks and then they buy them - this is great for my son who churns through kid\u2019s books series. The big city district does not have this option. And lastly, they also all have audiobooks to borrow that play great thru the Libby app- which I think is better than the Audible app. ",

Some libraries do require that members come there in person every so often, to try to prevent abuses (like people from China checking out ebooks from halfway around the world). Note that there are other ebook library services available as well. For example, Hoopla Digital offers streaming audiobooks, music, video & ebooks for viewing on tablets, phones, or desktops (though not Kindle e-ink readers). ",
