Was there ever a black pope? That depends on your definition of \"black\", pretty much. Jesus and St. Peter - traditionally the first pope - certainly had African ancestry. There was all that time that the Jews spent in Egypt, for one thing, and, well, look at a map. It's not exactly a long way from Jerusalem to Africa. There were probably some people going back and forth. As Eric Stoltz mentions, there were also three African popes, all of whom are believed to have been of Berber descent. Does that make them black? Well, it makes them African, but not sub-Saharan African. Does that \"count\" as black?  So, in my opinion, the answer to your question is that there isn't an answer to your question. Has there ever been a pope that was as dark-skinned as Cardinal Peter Turkson? Probably not. But there certainly several that were a lot darker than Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. ",

He is generally addressed as Father General. The position sometimes carries the nickname of the Black Pope, because of his responsibility for the largest Catholic, male religious order and is contrasted to the white garb of the pope.

However, although their place of origin was recorded, their race was not. It would never have occurred to the people of the Roman Empire at that time to record the color of someone's skin, as race is a relatively modern construct. For them, ethnic diversity was so common that it was not even worth comment. So we have three African popes. Were they black, or dark-skinned people of North Africa along the Mediterranean (like Egyptians) or were they children of Roman colonists? We'll never know, but odds are at least one of them was black. ",

Instead, I am assuming you are talking about someone from an African nation. We honestly do not know one way or the other, although it is more than reasonable to assume that several of them might have been from Africa. Before the Muslim invasion and conquest of northern Africa, Catholicism was very strong, and some of our greatest saints came from there. For instance, St. Augustine of Hippo was a north African saint. And it is entirely reasonable to assume that several of our Popes may have come from there in the first six centuries before Christianity was entirely wiped out in Africa. ",

Since we didn\u2019t have photography and no one cared enough to write down the skin color of the Popes at that time, we don\u2019t really know if they were black. Most North Africans are white, but the Berbers have darker skin. (St. Augustine was probably part Berber). Skin color totally aside, I\u2019m hoping for Cardinal Robert Sarah or Francis Arinze as the next Pope. ",
