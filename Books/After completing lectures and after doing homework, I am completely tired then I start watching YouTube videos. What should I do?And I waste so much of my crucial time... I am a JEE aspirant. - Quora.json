            "answer_text": "If you are a hardcore aspirant, who can not live without IIT Bombay, then you gotta throw your phone away , and sit in library , have doubts ,ask in doubt classes ,study thoroughly in classes, avoid internet as possible , even using mobile other than studying and practising can also waste some of your time. I guess now a days jee is online.I guess now due to corona ,you are home locked , so going to youtube may be an easy thing. So join groups on net which are preparing for jee. If you are not , then you can give a little time , after your thorough studies in class and self study. Give a little time for outdoor playing , listen to music , avoid lyrical songs , start watching infographic channels , like robotics or animals or something which gives you info and avoid watching funny ,or pranks ,or story kinda things ,These things will help a lot in your engineering college. Believe me in the college the students who already know other things than study are much more happy and calm as compared to bookish ones. But still preparing for JEE is your first priority . All the Best !!! ",

            "answer_text": "The JEE exam. Is among the toughest exams of our country. One needs mental as well as physical strength with a proper stretegy to score a good rank in this exam.sometimes a week stretegy or no stretegy are the main reason of time wasting. You are saying after completing your lecture and doing home work you become tired and start watching you tube video there is no problem with it as it helps in freshing our mind but if you see videos for long time it consume your imp. time that altemately effect your result. First of all you have to make a good time table and what to study next day plan so that you have a plan for next day (what to do plan). Like after completing your home work may be you dont have any next plan and it distract our mind and altemately waste our time. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In our stretegy and time table it should be very clear that what to study and why to study this thing at this time. For scoring good marks your goal should be very clear and our stretegy should be very rigid and flexible at the same time. Our time table and what to study plan is totally based on our strength,weakness and our daily routine and also depend upon many surrounding factors (like someone is doing some is doing his preparation with doing job ). So first of all make a time table and start following your time table slowly for atlest a week then see the changes and analyse the changes and if result is positive start following your time table strictly and if result is negative make another time table based on your analysis and start following ( as i said your timetable should be flexibe as well).
