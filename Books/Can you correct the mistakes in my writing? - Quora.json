Of course, plenty of them are paid and if you really need one for permanent usage I\u2019d recommend you to buy one. However, if you only occasionally need to check some text you can use a tool like this one: Correct My Writing. You will instantly get the report about your: grammar;punctuation;spelling;sentence structure;style and enhancement.Just insert your text into the tool:  And hopefully, this will help you! ",

If your mistakes are grammar and spelling the average word processor can take care of major problems. You can install Grammarly which also works on comments in web pages. If you have problems with your story and its context then that would be an entirely different issue. ",
