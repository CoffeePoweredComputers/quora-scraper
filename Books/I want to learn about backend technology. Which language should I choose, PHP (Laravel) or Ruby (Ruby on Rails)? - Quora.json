            "answer_text": "These are both excellent choices and it would be hard to go wrong with either. More  important than simply learning Laravel or Rails, however, is learning the software engineering best practices that surround these languages.  Things like:* team-based development with pull requests, gitflow, pairing* test-driven development, rspec/phpspec* coding to a style guide* watching hundreds of videos (Laracasts, Railscasts, Ruby Tapas)* never stop learning* work on real projects, and contribute to open source when you don't have enough paid work - hiring managers value experience over everything* learn the patterns of enterprise application architecture* never work alone* teach others what you've learned* go to conferences and develop relationships with key people* master the tools of remote working and collaboration* get smart about data modeling and SQL If you just learn Rails or Laravel without doing the above things, you won't be any good and you won't find the career very rewarding. Also pick the one that will allow you to get started immediately. ",

            "answer_text": "NEITHER IS USELESS. C'mon these are well used technologies, and I would strongly suggest you follow your heart on this one. If you have the will-power to cover both, please go ahead. You'll learn that you can get things done faster when using ROR over PHP - meaning it's useful for prototyping, hackathons and the likes, where you are constrained by time. However, I think more long-term jobs are done with PHP. Plus they both have strengths and weaknesses. As for which is more used: a lot of folks are learning ROR these days, but your PHP knowledge would prove fundamental. So my take, if you need to get something done quickly, go for ROR. And then settle down to grasp PHP concepts.   EDIT:My view on this has changed over time. Now I'd simply tell you to go for ROR without thinking twice about it. If you want something else, I'd say learn any of the Python web frameworks (Django, Pylons, Flask... -- in no particular order) or Node.js. That's the future! Good luck. ",
