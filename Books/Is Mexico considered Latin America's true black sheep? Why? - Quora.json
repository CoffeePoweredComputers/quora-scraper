            "answer_text": "Nope. Sort of on the contrary. Mexico is seen as a leader of the 35 nations of Latin America, or at least as one of the leaders or high influencers in a small group (with Argentina, Chile and Brazil). And Mexican ex-pats in countries other than the US (where we do have systemic relationship \u201cissues\u201d that flare up occasionally) are in general really loved and appreciated. The \u201cblack sheep\u201d stuff is more self-talk than anything else. So we are highly self-deprecating, but others don\u2019t see us as a black sheep unless we\u2019re doing something stupid and embarrassing, like yell homophobic insults in soccer. ",
