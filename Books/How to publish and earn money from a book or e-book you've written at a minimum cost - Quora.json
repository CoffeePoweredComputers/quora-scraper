            "answer_text": "If you want to earn a small amount of money, self-publish as an ebook/print-on-demand paperback through Amazon. That's is the cheapest, easiest way to turn a book into revenue. If you're very, very good and very, very lucky, the book could catch on and make you rich. E. L. James did that with Fifty Shades of Grey. But that's a one in a million shot. The most likely thing that will happen, by far, is you'll make $100 or so. Alternately, if the book is pretty good, you could get an agent to represent you and sell it to a publisher and get an advance. That's pretty hard to do unless you have connections and the book is quite good. It's gotten far harder in the last two years. But hey, maybe you're the next Seth Godin. If you want to earn a larger amount of money, you will have to invest in editing to make the book better and promotion to get it visibility. And then you'll make money, but not from the book. Most authors get the bulk of their money from speeches or consulting associated with the book (if it's a non-fiction book).

            "answer_text": "There's a variety of way to look at this question, but ultimately the answer is that it won't be easy. It's great that you want to be an author (or you are an author), but, honestly, authors don't make money writing books. Even if you self-publish or go with an actual publishing house. There are exceptions to this rule, but you will notice that for every best-selling author out there, there is at least 1000-10,000 authors who aren't.  So, how do you make money? Get traction. Great a fan base. Get followers. Have other people read your book and take the criticism (or flattery). The cheapest way to get your manuscript into a print book is to self-publish. You can do that really easily on any platform and they can probably turn that into a pdf you can put on Amazon or your own website to sell. But will you make money from this? Depends on your book, the topic, the writing, the audience, and your own brand. However, it's unlikely.  If you're in the business of making money, I would not advise writing a book with that in mind. Write what you want to write and post it online, on fiction sites, enter something in a competition, share it with others so it gains momentum. Publishers and agents don't just take submissions, they look for them as well. Eventually, if you have a great platform and a decent book, it'll get picked up by a publishing house and you can get an advance and decent royalties. ",
