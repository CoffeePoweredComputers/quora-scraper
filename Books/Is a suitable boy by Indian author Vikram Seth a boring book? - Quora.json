Partition, riots, Hindu Muslim romance, love for ones children, love for parents- so it's a good wholesome book in some way. But I really adore the writing. I think that's what makes Vikram Seth a great author. Also, just so that you know- Vikram Seth is writing a sequel to it by the name- A suitable girl  Thanks! ",
