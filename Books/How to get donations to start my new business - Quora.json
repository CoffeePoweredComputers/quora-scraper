            "answer_text": "I have not heard of any such concepts yet and your idea appears to be a novel one. There is a closer cousin though called \u201c Crowd Funding\u201d , but in India, I am afraid, it has not gained popularity. Let us approach your idea in a practical manner. Indians, do not rank very high in the world with regard to making donations of any kind; be it money, time or organs. Yes ,the tax paying class do make some donations yearly ( not all) only if the scheme has a tax relief tag. We do not volunteer free community service and donate our time. We would rather watch stupid TV serials at home than offering voluntary service for a few hours a week to the old, sick or disabled. And for organ donation, we still think we should approach the crematorium with all our body parts intact. Under this mindset, I do not see your idea fetching many takers. You do not qualify for a tax rebate scheme in your business. Nor do you plan to share your profits. So why should anyone be interested? You can perhaps only look within and try out with your family and friends. But I am not sure if that will also work out. ",

Founders convince others for funding. Funding (or donors) act because of a belief in founders ability to generate outcomes around a solid purpose and clear customer. ",
