            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a lot easier than it used to be! Many editors freelance now, but here\u2019s what you need to understand: editors are not \u201cone size fits all.\u201d In the professional writing world, there are different kinds of editing passes. Most people coming into the business just assume an editor fixes your grammar and spelling. NOPE. A good editor\u2019s first pass is for \u201ccontent\u201d or \u201cdevelopmental\u201d editing, where they ask the big questions about your book, characters, and plot. Here\u2019s something my content editor pointed out recently in her notes: I know this character carries a lot of trauma, but are you hitting it a little too hard and too often? By page 250 it\u2019s starting to feel routine. Is there a way to show this in different ways and reactions throughout? Here\u2019s another from a prior series: The main plot involves rescuing a character, which definitely needs to happen, but structurally this may make readers feel you\u2019ve spent too much time moving characters around before any action really occurs. It would be great if you could bring out your B plot more strongly during this section while also moving the A story forward. My point is, a really great editor doesn\u2019t just fix what you\u2019ve gotten wrong in mechanical terms; they question your pacing, your characters, your plot, your assumptions, everything in order to make the story as strong as it can be. Notice that in neither case did the editor tell me what to do. They asked questions or pointed out issues, and it\u2019s my job as the author to figure out the best way to address the issues. Content/developmental editors are, therefore, expensive and somewhat rare, but for the first pass on a book, that\u2019s what you want. The editorial pass that comes after that is copyediting\u2014fact checking, grammar, spelling, making suggestions on how to improve the flow of the actual words on the page vs. the content behind them. Then you\u2019ll need a further proofreading check; you\u2019ll do that yourself but having another pair of eyes do it is kind of critical because authors are their own worst proofreaders in general (our brains fill in what we meant to say and we\u2019re too close to the material to be objective). So: how do you find editors? Internet searches are fine; generally you\u2019ll find what you need there. Try these specific words: \u201cdevelopmental content editor fiction for hire\u201d or \u201cdevelopmental content editor nonfiction for hire.\u201d Same for copyeditors. (You can use the same editor, btw, if they\u2019re good at both, but content editing is the rarer skill.) Or, ask for recommendations from successful authors as to who they used. Most people are happy to share resources. (Be sure to skip the ads and look for individual listings.) NOTE: If you\u2019re submitting to a traditional publisher, content editing, copyediting, and proofing are all free to you as part of the publishing process. ",
