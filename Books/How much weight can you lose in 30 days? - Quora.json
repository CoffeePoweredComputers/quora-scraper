            "answer_text": "My Friend you can easily lose 20 pounds in 30 days. We have been warned that losing weight quickly is not safe. This statement is actually not true. While there is some level of truth to this (there\u2019s always an extreme to every situation), for the most part, this is false. How to Lose 20 Pounds In A Month Why? For one, losing weight slowly is a motivational killer, TRUST ME! Imagine this, you cut out all your favorite foods, drinks (alcohol for me), desserts, and now you have to start exercising consistently in addition to all this. Now you\u2019ve reached the end of what seemed like the never-ending week only to find out you lost 1 POUND! YIKES! Wouldn\u2019t you rather see 5 or 6 pounds knocked off the scale? Of course you would! Okay, okay. I\u2019m done with my stories, and I will cover the main topic here for you, how to lose 20 pounds in a month. How To Lose 20 Pounds In A Month Tip #1. Carbohydrate Detox If you want to lose 20 pounds in 30 days, then make this your number one priority because it is THE MOST important one! Before I go into too much detail, you\u2019re probably wondering what a carb detox is. It\u2019s when you eliminate carbohydrates completely out for one week. WHAT? Yes, I did say seven days! I also did say this was a CHALLENGE. If it was easy, everybody would already be doing it. Let me assure you, it is possible. It\u2019s challenging for sure. However, try comparing this to losing a family member, raising kids on your own, losing your job, or going through a divorce. Compared to that, detoxing from carbs for a week is a walk in the park. Ok, so then what would I eat for that week? Lean protein and leafy greens for the most part. Obviously, you would be detoxing from sugar as well (sugars are carbs). How To Lose 20 Pounds In A Month Tip #2. Incorporate Intermittent Fasting  I\u2019ve discussed how important intermittent fasting is many times. I really can\u2019t say it enough! Using this eating technique is an extremely beneficial way to help you lose weight. If you are unfamiliar with intermittent fasting, it\u2019s simply an eating schedule where you go through periods of eating and fasting. The one I follow and recommend is the 16-8 method. You would simply eat for 8 hours, and fast for 16 hours. Here\u2019s an example of a few ways to schedule this\u2026  How To Lose 20 Pounds In A Month Tip #3. Eat Nutrient Dense Foods  This is just as important as the first tip. Another HUGE factor for helping you lose 20 pounds in 30 days. No matter how well you apply intermittent fasting or how active you are, it will all be for nothing if you aren\u2019t eating correctly. Since you want to know how to lose 20 pounds in a month, this is going to be the lifeline to your success. Incorporating all of the necessary macronutrients is key! Having the right proteins, fats, and carbs (aka macros) in the right amounts is going to attribute to 80% of your weight loss. I assure you\u2026 If you want to lose this amount of weight in this short time frame.. Then pay attention carefully as I list these foods. We will start with protein first\u2026 Protein: \u00b7 Lean Ground Beef \u00b7 Salmon \u00b7 Turkey \u00b7 Chicken Breast \u00b7 Eggs \u00b7 Egg Whites \u00b7 Tilapia \u00b7 Tuna \u00b7 Plant Based Protein Powder (low carb) \u00b7 Non-Fat Greek Yogurt \u00b7 Low-Fat Cottage Cheese \u00b7 Hemp Seed Carbohydrates (Complex): \u00b7 Sweet Potatoes \u00b7 Yams \u00b7 Brown Rice \u00b7 Quinoa \u00b7 Oats \u00b7 Oatmeal \u00b7 Wild Rice \u00b7 Legumes Vegetables: \u00b7 Spinach \u00b7 Kale \u00b7 Brussel Sprouts \u00b7 Green Bell Peppers \u00b7 Asparagus \u00b7 Bok Choy \u00b7 Onions \u00b7 Celery \u00b7 Romaine Lettuce \u00b7 Artichoke \u00b7 Arugula \u00b7 Spaghetti Squash \u00b7 Green Beans Fruits: \u00b7 Apples \u00b7 Strawberries \u00b7 Blueberries \u00b7 Raspberries \u00b7 Kiwi \u00b7 Banana \u00b7 Watermelon \u00b7 Grapes \u00b7 Grapefruit Fats: \u00b7 Avocado \u00b7 Olive Oil \u00b7 Coconut Oil \u00b7 Peanuts \u00b7 Almonds \u00b7 Natural Peanut Butter \u00b7 Natural Almond Butter \u00b7 Fish Oil \u00b7 Flaxseed Oil Whoah! That\u2019s a lot to remember. If that wasn\u2019t confusing enough, how am I supposed to know what to eat and how much? No worries, here\u2019s a simple schedule for you to follow\u2026 Week 1: >30 Carbs per day Week 2: 50-75 Carbs per day w/ exercise incorporated Week 3: 75-125 Carbs per day w/ exercise incorporated Week 4: 75-125 Carbs per day w/ exercise incorporated Yes, you did see exercise on that list, so of course, the next step is going to be\u2026 4. Exercise This such a broad statement\u2026 While exercise is not necessarily required, it is HIGHLY encouraged! Why? Just a reminder that if your end goal is wanting to know how to lose 20 pounds in a month, then you better listen up again. The majority of individuals who are capable of losing this kind of weight in that time frame without exercise\u2026 are also the ones who have a lot of weight to lose. That being said, I still would NEVER recommend excluding exercise from the picture. Regardless of your weight, it would be a mistake not to. The only situation I would say to put this idea to rest is if it is \u201cNOT SAFE\u201d for you to be exercising. In this situation, I would recommend walking in place of exercise. Anyways, enough with my rambling. I\u2019ll finally get to the point and explain which forms of exercise you should be incorporating. Strength Training:  This is going to be one of the most beneficial forms of exercise you can include. Some of the many benefits strength training provides are\u2026 \u00b7 A decrease in body fat \u00b7 Improved body composition \u00b7 Stronger bones and joints \u00b7 Increased strength \u00b7 Increase in muscle mass What I would recommend is a mix of HIIT and Upper/Lower Splits. Perhaps one week do a combination of full-body HIIT, and the next do upper and lower splits. (If HIIT is too dangerous, then just stick to upper lower split type of workout routines) Cardio: There are two different types of cardio you could incorporate\u2026 \u00b7 LISS (Low-Intensity Steady State Cardio) \u00b7 HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) Cardio. What\u2019s the difference? An example of LISS would be to go on the elliptical for 30-45 minutes keeping a steady pace. During this cardio session, you would want to keep your heart rate high enough to burn body fat (using fat for energy). Just make sure it\u2019s not too high where you would be tapping into carbohydrates for energy. HIIT on the other hand, you would be doing a much shorter cardio session. For example, you would start by sprinting on a treadmill or an elliptical for 30 seconds with 90% maximum effort, followed by 1-2 minutes of a decreased pace. You would repeat this for 4 rounds, 5 rounds, etc\u2026 The idea is to build yourself up. For beginners\u2026 I would recommend starting out with NO MORE than an 8 minute round and working your way up from there. Last but not least\u2026 5. Proper Rest  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard it before\u2026 You need to get around 8 hours of rest each night. The problem is, even though most people are aware of this, there is still a good chunk of them that still aren\u2019t getting enough sleep. According to the CDC, 1 out of 3 Americans do not get enough rest Ok, but why is it so important to get proper rest? Well, you put yourself at risk for gaining weight. Lack of sleep also increases your appetite. This is because two of your key weight loss hormones (leptin and ghrelin) become unbalanced from improper sleep When you are putting yourself through a carbohydrate detox, the LAST THING you want is your appetite to increase. What\u2019s going to end up happening is you are going to crave EVERYTHING but what you should be eating. Probably the most important one reason you need proper rest is so your body can heal after your workouts. Without proper rest, your muscles won\u2019t recover adequately leading to potential injuries and muscle atrophy. The CDC recommends getting 7-9 hours of rest if you are 18 years or older. Bottom line, this is extremely important if you want to lose 20 pounds in 30 days, so make sure you get enough rest! ",
