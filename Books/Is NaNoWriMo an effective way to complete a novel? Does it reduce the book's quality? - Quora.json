            "answer_text": "Yes, it is. Especially for writers who are not able to stick to a deadline. I speak for myself, but I think that counts for every writer or author out there; having a deadline makes us put our butt down and our brain to work. The idea we have to finish a story in a limited time fuels up our creativity and makes us clear our mind vision on the work to do. It also educates you to show up every day on your writing station (wherever and whatever it is) and do the work. Deadlines teach writers discipline. Because discipline is the blood of our work. I did two NaNoWriMos in my life; I won both, but while during the first one I finished my novel way beyond November 30, the second time I actually finished the story within the thirty days. But both times, the deadline enhanced my writing productivity and made me feel more alive and aware than ever of what I was doing. NaNoWriMo is very useful because it gives you a taste of what the writer\u2019s life is about. It teaches you how to be there every day and churn words down as the story evolves live. About reducing quality? That doesn\u2019t exist. First drafts are not meant to be good or elegant. It is well the contrary. They could be good, but they don\u2019t have to be. The first draft is the only way to put the story down, to make it visible and factual. The first draft exists so you can work on creating a better and better novel, draft after draft. It can take a long time, but if you don\u2019t even start, you\u2019ll have nothing to work on. And first drafts need to be written while inspiration is hot iron you keep hitting, that\u2019s why NaNoWriMo is perfect for it. Quality is achieved more and more with each draft, and it takes a whole different kind of work. ",

            "answer_text": "I was with ya until the second half of the question. Then my eye twitched. Yes, for some NaNoWriMo is an effective way to complete a novel. Some people need that hard deadline. Some people need to be challenged and make it into a friendly competition with others. Some people enjoy the timed writing sprints and may not feel comfortable doing them outside of a NaNo environment. For whatever reason, some people find NaNo to be effective in helping them write the novel they\u2019ve been wanting to write. Now, to address the eye-twitching portion of the question. No, it doesn\u2019t reduce quality any more than any other motivation or writing method. People need to get off the idea that when it comes to writing, speed has a direct effect on quality. It doesn\u2019t. My first drafts turn out pretty good. I only know this because anyone who\u2019s read samples of my first draft writing ask me how many passes with edits I\u2019ve made. But even so, there\u2019s HUGE differences and improvements that I make when I go for a second pass or third. I use track changes both in my screenwriting and novel writing and there\u2019s so much red and green font and strikeouts that it looks like a holiday card upchucked all over my screen. First drafts aren\u2019t meant to be quality. They\u2019re meant to get the story translated from brainwaves to words on the page/screen. NaNoWriMo is for writing a first draft. Ergo, there is no variation on quality between the NaNoWriMo participant and the person who bought a cabin in the woods to spend time writing. ",
