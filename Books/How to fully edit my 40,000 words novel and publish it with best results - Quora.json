            "answer_text": "As others have stated. 40k word count is barely a novel but it makes a decently short novella. Most of not all professional editors take between 10-15k words out of a true book which is closer to 80-100k. So in editing your novella it would be decimated by such a cut and it would get pruned quite heavily. A publishing house wouldn't even examine it unless they were in the market for a short story and after editing it would be puny. So sorry write a much longer story before calling it a novel 80,000 or higher is generally novel sized books. ",

Unless it is aimed at mid-grade audiences, 40,000 words is very short for a novel. I suspect every publisher will dismiss your work without examining it because of the word count.
