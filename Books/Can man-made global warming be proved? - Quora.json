Can you think of any actions that any climate alarmists lobby for that I have missed? Let me know in the comments. if you agree that is a pretty good list, representing the desired actions of those pushing the claim that man-made climate change is real, and significant, and catastrophic, then consider this\u2026.. In 1977 before ANY climate alarmism claims had been made. Before anyone was crying that the world was going to cool catastrophically, or warm catastrophically, or change catastrophically, the US government was having problems with OPEC. Embargoes imposed against them. Price increases used as punishment. The impact was huge economically. At the time, the US was importing 16 million barrels per day. And the price been jacked up by OPEC from $3 per barrel in 1972 to over $40 per barrel. So the US government at the time created a plan to reduce oil imports. A plan to help the US economy. A plan to ensure that foreign powers couldn\u2019t control the US politically by having control of their supply of crucial energy.  See if you recognize the actions required to \u201cSave The US Economy\u201d\u2026 Investment in Solar, geothermal, biofuel, and other renewable energy sources?  Programs to encourage the installation of solar panels on residences and businesses.   People not choose to buy gas guzzling vehicles. People to choose vehicles with better gas mileage. Or even better electric or hybrid vehicles. Build more energy efficient homes and buildings. Programs to encourage retrofit existing homes and buildings to make them more energy efficient. Purchase energy efficient appliances and replace old appliances that are not. Use public transit when possible. Have a \u201cprice on carbon\u201d, increased taxation on fuels.In all, the Carter US Energy Independence Plan mentions taxation 88 times. I am not going to copy and paste them all into this answer. You can look through the document or take my word for it. Here is one proposing a $0.50 cent a gallon tax on fuel if consumption by the country did not go down.  Utilities install smart meters and switch to time-of-use billing.  So. \u201cIS Man-Made Global Warming True?\u201d That is a question you should answer for yourself. Before any climate claims were ever made, the US government (and several others), because of OPEC and the increase of the price of oil, and political blackmail, decided to push people to USE LESS OIL. And USE LESS OIL by following steps X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D, E, etc. The people didn\u2019t really listen. Since then, people have been told. The world is in danger. The world is on a runaway warming train to hell. Everyone is in danger. Everyone in the future will suffer. Many will die. Disease is going to spread. Floods and Tornadoes and Hurricanes are going to get worse. Drought is going to get worse. Animals are going to be pushed to extinction. Bee colonies are being disrupted. Coral is dying. The oceans will turn to acid. The polar ice caps will melt. The seas will rise. Lands will flood. Everything is going to turn to shit. We have to act. And we have to act now. For the sake of our children and our grand children, we have to act now and we have to act together. We have to unite to stop the planet from turning to hell. We all have to contribute and pay the price. The future is catastrophic. And the only things we can do to stop the catastrophe and to SAVE THE WORLD is we MUST FOLLOW STEPS X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D, E, etc.  Whether you want to believe that steps X,Y,Z,A,B,C,D,E, etc. are about Saving The World, and not about oil and politics, and OPEC and dependency on foreign oil, and the global price of oil\u2026. Well that is up to you. Some people are willing to believe some pretty crazy stuff. Deities, angels, ghosts, leprechauns, goblins, sprites, fairies. If you want to believe that your efforts are needed to save the world, and X,Y,Z,A,B,C,D,E are the way to do it, don\u2019t let me stop you. But don\u2019t ask for my help. Don\u2019t preach to me and try and convert me to your cause. Don\u2019t ask for money from me. Don\u2019t tax me. Don\u2019t increase government debt. Just the individuals who are believers, they should do what THEY think is necessary. And leave the rest of us out of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on the last few centuries of data for atmospheric CO2 from the Law Dome ice core data and the Keeling curve (CO2), the CDIAC\u2019s historical record of fossil-fuel CO2 Emissions (ECO2), the Arrhenius logarithmic law relating atmospheric CO2 to its radiative forcing (RF = log2(CO2), reconstructed total solar irradiance (TSI), and the historical records of surface temperature on land and sea (HadCRUT4), all averaged over 63 years, I would say yes beyond a reasonable doubt. Does CO2 come from ECO2? Since 1750, XCO2, the excess of CO2 over its preindustrial level of 280 ppm, has been rising at 2% a year and has closely tracked 40% of ECO2 throughout.For an analogy, suppose you are blindfolded and you pour water into a leaky drum at a rate increasing by 2% a minute, and the amount in the drum rises at a rate also increasing by 2% a minute, yet at any time only 40% of what you\u2019ve poured remains in the drum. After a while you become convinced that 60% of the incoming water must be leaking out leaving 40% in the drum.I would say that, beyond a reasonable doubt, this proves that the water in the bucket came from what was poured in. Maybe some natural source is also adding water, but it would have to increase at a rate exactly matching the increasing rate you have been pouring it in. What are the odds there would be such a natural source?Replacing water-in by ECO2, water-remaining by XCO2, and \u201cminute\u201d by \u201cyear\u201d, this exactly describes what is happening with emitted CO2 and retained XCO2. I would say that, beyond a reasonable doubt, this proves that the excess CO2 in the atmosphere came from what was emitted.Does HadCRUT4 follow the combination of TSI and RF = log(CO2), in some proportion or other? When all three are smoothed with a 63-year running mean and the last two are fitted to the first using multiple regression, the standard deviation of the residual is 5 millikelvin (mK). Leaving out TSI worsens the fit to 15 mK while leaving out RF and just using TSI gives a fit of 35 mK, as per the following figure. Fitting just RF (= log2(CO2)) yields a model that curves up, projecting a rise in 63-year climate that is 2.66 \u00b0C higher than today (2016) assuming XCO2 continues to rise at 2% a year. Fitting just TSI is no fit at all because TSI rose in the first half of the century but not the second half, unlike HadCRUT4. Fitting both together however gives a very good fit. This shows two things: (a) RF alone doesn\u2019t explain rising HadCRUT4, and (b) RF and TSI together does an excellent job of explaining the coarser or more slowly changing aspects of global climate. In particular global surface temperature averaged over the 63 years 2069\u20132131 (the meaning of 63-year climate in 2100) is likely to be 1.90 \u00b0C higher than today if XCO2 continues to rise at 2% a year, the rate it\u2019s been growing for centuries now. That plus an approximate 1 \u00b0C rise since CO2 was at its preindustrial level of 280 ppm (RF = 8.13) comes to a total rise of almost 3 \u00b0C during the industrial era up to 2100. I suspect that 1.56 \u00b0C is below the true climate sensitivity (CS) because 63-year TSI is a bit distorted, and that a 21-year filter will raise this CS to more like 1.8, though not as high as the 2.19 \u00b0C obtained when TSI is omitted from the model obtained by fitting 63-year data. [EDIT: I appended the following to the original comment, and also changed AtCO2 to CO2, plus more minor edits.] CS as defined here is simply the coefficient of RF = log2(CO2). It is similar to the IPCC\u2019s Transient Climate Response, which models CO2 as growing at 1% a year. If instead CO2 is modeled as 280 + XCO2 with XCO2 growing at 2% a year a much better fit is obtained to the IPCC\u2019s Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) as per this figure.  Except for the period 2030\u20132090, where the XCO2-based model drops a bit below RCP8.5 before returning at 2090, the two are essentially interchangeable. I prefer the former because it is a simpler encoding of RCP8.5 where it is known, and who knows what CO2 will be in 2060? I suggest calling the XCO2-based model the Hofmann model, since it is essentially the one David Hofmann proposed in 2010. As an alternative to Transient Climate Response in modeling I suggest the term Prevailing Climate Response for climate sensitivity estimated based on the Hofmann model instead of TCR\u2019s 1%-a-year model. Now if you invest $1 at 2%, in 242 years you will have 1.02^242 = $120.57. By the same token if XCO2 in the model is 1 ppm in 1772, then the model says that 242 years later, i.e. in 2014, XCO2 will be 120.57 for a total CO2 of 400.57 ppm, within 1 ppm where it actually was that year. And if CO2 continues on that 242-year-old trajectory, by 2100 it will have reached 942 ppm. (The RCP8.5 pathway has 936 ppm for that year and 945 for 2101, i.e. essentially the same.) If for any reason it doesn\u2019t reach it then of course it could end up either higher or lower, we\u2019re only saying if. Methane in melting tundra swamps might drive it higher, decarbonization might drive it lower, both might happen and cancel each other out, no one can say for sure. But no one can say it won\u2019t continue along its present path either. ",

Not to someone who\u2019s unable to believe anything that conflicts with his simplistic ideology. Not to someone who believes anything connected to his tribe, and nothing that isn\u2019t. That is, not to the fossil fuel industry\u2019s shills, pawns, and dupes. Man-made global warming was first proposed as a wild hypothesis in the 1820s. It was proposed as a serious theory to be investigated about a century later. It was proved to the satisfaction of a majority of climate scientists by the 1970s. As their models and predictions proved out, it was accepted to the satisfaction of a majority of real scientists (people with a postdoc research track record) by the early 2000s, resulting in position statements by nearly every national science association of every developed nation by around 2005\u20132010. Acceptance by most citizens of most developed nations followed, with the exception of the United States, due to a massive public deception operation that the Russians would envy, started around 1980 but kicked into high gear by 2000, now amounting to around a billion dollars spent. That kind of money can buy minds as long as the purchase is in line with the biases and short-sighted self interest of the dupes. And here we are. Unfortunately, as Mark Twain said, it\u2019s far, far easier to dupe someone than to convince them they\u2019ve been duped. Because it means they not only have to change their minds\u2014always tough\u2014but they also have to admit to you and to themselves that they\u2019re weak-minded pawns. Testosterone poisoning won\u2019t allow most men to do that. Hence the squad of denialists you see here on Quora. They never admit anything, but just play \u201cyes but\u201d and throw up another canard. You can see their basket of canards at www.skepticalscience.com, a climate website set up by real climate scientists, as opposed to the 100+fake sites set up by the Koch Foundation and its cronies.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Take a container of air and a container of air that has a higher concentration of CO2 in it. Beam each container with infrared radiation using a laser. Measure how much energy you beam into the first container and beam the exact same amount of energy into the second container. Record the temperature of the containers of gas after you have finished beaming in the radiation. If the air with high CO2 concentrations is warmer than man is playing a role in changing the climate. As burning fissile fules for energy for society releases massive amounts of CO2. This has been done already many times. The result. The gas with more CO2 in it gets hotter as CO2 absorbs infrared radiation much more than normal air. Really is just simple chemistry. Basic identification of the properties of a molecule. In addition our solar system by chance has already done this experiment for us. Venus has a thick atmosphere of CO2. This increases the temperature on Venus. It makes Venus hotter than if it had an atmosphere of air or no atmosphere at all in fact. It makes it so much hotter that the surface of Venus is actually several hundred degrees hotter than the hottest spot on Mercury. This in spite of the fact that Mercury is much closer to the sun than Venus. If CO2 absorbs more heat than air then dumping more of it into the atmosphere will warm the planet. It then becomes a matter of how much will humanity's CO2 production warm the earth. It turns out its such simple chemistry that we have known the answer to this question since the 1960\u2019s. It took us that long to learn because it simply hadn't come to our attention before then. The Russian missions to Venus in the 1960\u2019s and the surprise of the much higher than expected surface temperature brought it to the attention of the general scientific community and changed all of that. It turns out that at our current rate Earth will be 1.5 degrees F warmer by 2100, and it will continue to warm significantly for another 100 years after that date even if all CO2 emissions completely cease in that same year. Such is the nature of the chemistry of air with new CO2 in it. It's really sad to me that we have to debate the validity of basic chemistry just because the implications of said chemistry mean that man, in order to save the environment, has to fundamentally change society's infrastructure. I find our current political environment extremely distressing and depressing. It's honestly a wonder our burning of our planets most convenient energy source hasn't caused more damage. We do it on such a massive scale. Every time you burn a gallon of gas about half the biproduct is CO2, and you emitt 19lbs of it. Pollution is being created on such a massive scale it's appalling our society is doing so little about it. Almost knowbody is doing anything at all. Do you know somebody personally who has done anything at all to help the problem? My guess is no you don't. Solar panels are good but few people own them. With the grid in the state it's in, in well over half of America electric cars emitt more CO2 than the average gas car. And in the rest they are only marginally better. It's even worse that a large portion of the country refuses to believe in basic science at all, and can give no argument for doing so. We still haven't come much farther from the days of the church executing Galileo for claiming he believed the sun was at the center of the solar system. So to answer your question can the theory of man made global warming be proven? Yes and it has been proven since the 60\u2019s. It's basic chemistry. Simply understanding how well both air and CO2 absorb infrared radiation and then using logical deduction: if I put hot stuff into cold stuff the temperature of the cold stuff should go up. That's it. As simple as that. Basic chemistry and basic thermodynamics. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s take a look at the meaning of the word proof. Definition of proof 1a : the cogency of evidence that compels acceptance by the mind of a truth or a fact b : the process or an instance of establishing the validity of a statement especially by derivation from other statements in accordance with principles of reasoning 2 obsolete : experience 3 : something that induces certainty or establishes validity More at: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proof The definitions relating to your question are numbers 1a and 3. By definition 1a, man-made climate change has already been proved. By definition 3 \u201cestablishes validity\u201d, man-made climate change has already been proved. The \u201cor\u201d between the statements means that only one of the conditions must be met, and validity has been established so again man-made climate changed has been proved. So when \u201cskeptics\u201d demand proof, they are focusing on the certainty in the definition. But when it comes to scientific theories, certainty can never be a requirement for scientific theories because theories can and do change. Newton\u2019s Theory of Gravity was modified by Einstein\u2019s. Newton\u2019s theory had problems (orbit of Mercury) but it was accepted even without certainty. Einstein\u2019s theory has problems (black holes) but is accepted. The Standard Model of Particle Physics has many problems (dark matter, for one) but is accepted. By demanding certainty, the \u201cskeptics\u201d are demanding more than the definition of theories requires. The purpose of demanding certainty is to create unreasonable doubt. For more information on this tactic, I suggest googling \u201cMerchants of Doubt\u201d. \u201cA scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment.\u201d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory ",

            "answer_text": "Here are the numbers: Total Co2 in the atmosphere was 2000 Gt before industrialization. Currently this is at 3000 Gt. We almost added 1000 Gt in less than 100 years. Currently we are adding about 40 Gt per year. Global warming is not man-made, it is a natural process, however, humans are accelerating it and that is why it is called AGW or Accelerated Global Warming. Let me give my logical explanation of NATURAL global warming. We had five ice ages so far in the life of this planet. What do you think separated them? Obviously it was global warming. So, there were five ice ages and five global warming periods in the past. There is no denying that global warning is a very natural process. Every ice age ends in a global warming phase and every global warming phase ends in an ice age. When global warming phase ends and enters ice age, it will be a very chaotic process and many species die and very few survive. Again it all depends on the intensity of the ice age. In the past, some ice ages were very severe covering most of the plant and some were very light and didn't do much damage. More damage is caused if the increase in global temperature is very rapid and that is what we are fearing. What we as a species should do, is to hold this planet in artificial balance so that the natural global warming will not dive into another ice age. For this we need lots of ideas and research to be done to make it happen. If we don't do anything, earth will naturally plunge into ice age chaotically. With AGW this may happen sooner than later. During this chaotic process what is our survival probability? This is what is of concern now.

            "answer_text": "Global warming is purely because of anthropogenic activities. But climate change is both natural and induced. Global warming is major contributor to the rapid climate change which the world is witnessing. This period is termed as anthropocene in environmental studies. It all started in the eighteenth century with the beginning of industrial revolution. With the advancement in technologies forested areas have been cleared and paved way for industries. In this respect the worst affected is temperate forests. Many Mining companies have ventured into new areas for mineral exploration. They have cleared large tracts of forests. This has also resulted in the loss of carbon sinks. Forests and oceans are the best carbon sinks of the world. As a result of this the amount of co2 in the atmosphere have crossed 400 ppm. Another important reason is the consumerism. Consumerism results in usage of large amount of resources in an indiscriminate manner. For eg an affluent family has 5 cars. They could use public transport and this will reduce the emissions from the cars. Agriculture and livestock rearing is another major source of GHG emissions. Rice cultivation is the major contributor of methane. Increased usage of air conditioners. Now the air conditioners are using HCFCs. They don't have any impact on ozone layer. Thanks to the Montreal protocol which has sanctioned the phase out of ozone depleting chemicals. But HCFCs have global warming potential. Ocean acidification is another reason. Because of increased release of GHG gases the ocean has absorbed too much of the GHG gases. This has resulted in the reduced intake of GHG emissions by oceans. Rio earth summit was a major initiative towards combating climate change. The recent Paris agreement should be followed by all the countries religiously by sticking to their Intended nationally determined contributions(INDCs) to halt further global warming. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes man made activities are largely responsible for global warming such as: Burning Fossil Fuels: burning coal to generate electricity, burning oil to power vehicles and aircraft (vehicle emissions), or burning wood in fires used for cooking or to provide heat, etc. changes the state of stored organic carbon from a liquid (e.g. oil) or solid (e.g. coal/wood) into a gas (carbon dioxide) which is released into the atmosphere. Deforestation: vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis, converting this to carbon which is stored within all plants (i.e it is a carbon sink). When vegetation is burned, this organic carbon is released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide, and in so doing becomes a carbon source rather than a carbon sink. Decomposing organic matter: landfills, animal waste, sewerage and dams are all human sources of methane. For example, organic matter is trapped behind dam walls where it sinks to the bottom of the dam and decomposes. Bacteria produce methane in the decomposition process, which slowly escapes to the surface and is released into the atmosphere. Landfill gas operations and biodigesters provide a method of mitigation, and not only harness methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, but also provide an alternative source of fuel. Natural gas extraction: methane escapes during oil and gas extraction (e.g. fracking) operations and is released into the atmosphere. Fertilizers: Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas that is released primarily by fertilizers used in agriculture and landscaping, but also during the burning of fossil fuels and other organic matter. Atmospheric nitrous oxide levels have risen by roughly 18% since the Industrial Revolution, spiking rapidly towards the end of the 1900\u2019s. Industrial appliances: Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are long-lasting greenhouse gases that also destroy the ozone layer. CFCs do not occur naturally in the atmosphere \u2013 they are synthetic compounds that only originate from human sources, including: aerosols, foaming agents, refrigerants, and other industrial applications.

Although there are various natural processes that can cause global warming, such as super volcanoes, asteroids striking the Earth, changes in the Earth\u2019s tilt and position relative to the sun, etc., none of these are happening now. The current warming is due to humans adding greenhouse gases such as CO2, methane, NO2, and CFCs to the atmosphere. Not only is that the only explanation for the current warming, the current warming matches the predicted warming that has been calculated to be caused by the increase in these man made greenhouse gases. To deny that the current warming is man-made, you would not only have to come up with some other explanation for the warming (where there is none), you would also have to explain why the known warming effect of CO2 and other man-made greenhouse gases is NOT occurring.

There are plenty of people who think they know better than the scientists. People don\u2019t usually dispute scientific expertise unless it challenges their ideologies. Global warming messaging has been crafted so that it seems to challenge ideologies of free market ideologies, freedom from government intrusion, and our traditional/familiar/successful fossil-fuel-based life. The messaging is expertly done, well funded and widely distributed, and it\u2019s been tremendously successful except that the success is so very detrimental to the everyone who believes it. ",

That CO2 is a greenhouse gas has been known since the 19th century, the rest follows logically.

Moreover, currently the sun is slightly cooling, so without our greenhouse gas emissions there would be no warming at all. ",
