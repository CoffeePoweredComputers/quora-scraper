            "answer_text": "A Gothic novel may be described as an English genre of fiction popular in the 18th to early 19th centuries, characterized by an atmosphere of mystery and horror and having a pseudo-medieval setting. Northanger Abbey was the first of Jane Austen's novels to be completed for publication, in 1803. However, it was not published until after her death in 1817, along with another novel of hers, Persuasion. Northanger Abbey is a satire of Gothic novels, which were quite popular at the time, in 1798\u201399. As in all of Austen's novels, the subjects of society, status, behavior, and morality are addressed. Northanger Abbey, however, being chronologically the first novel completed by Austen (though revised later in her life), and notably considered a point of departure from her other work as a result of the boldness with which it flaunts its . . . deceptive air of simplicity with broad, bold humor includes several major themes that are specific to this text. Such themes include: 1. The intricacies and tedium of high society, particularly partner selection, and the conflicts of marriage for love. 2. Life lived as if in a Gothic novel (as if life is the same as fiction), filled with danger and intrigue, and the obsession with all things Gothic. 3. The development of the young into thoughtful adulthood, the loss of imagination, innocence and good faith. 4. Reading as a valuable tool for personal growth. ",

            "answer_text": "Northanger Abbey can be more appropriately considered a \u201cparody\u201d of a Gothic novel. It has all the defining elements of one, but gives each a refreshing turn. For instance, Eleanor Tilney, with a frightening and cruel-looking father, living in a mysteriously fitted up abbey, in a gothic novel would have made an excellent heroine to build a melancholy, passionate or magical tale around. Contrary to that , she has a life, quite normal and a romance that is steadfast and patient ending in a happy marriage. Every time Catherine hopes to find something shockingly mysterious, she finds something commonplace and uninteresting. For an era that was obsessed with gothic novels, this was a fresh satire on the quirks of that genre. It is, in all essentials, a gothic novel, considering the atmosphere built up, but it stands out in its treatment of these gothic elements. ",
