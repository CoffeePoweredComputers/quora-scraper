            "answer_text": "There are two ways to invest. One is by being a stock trader, a person who buys and sells stocks by attempting to buy undervalued stocks and sell overvalued ones. Time horizons for this type of investor range from minutes or hours (the day trader), to weeks or months, to maybe even 2 or 3 years.  It's possible to get rich this way, but very difficult.  Most people who attempt this fail in the long run.  Oh yes, everyone's an investing genius in a hot bull market.  But when the tide turns, when the bear rips up the party, when the investing pros like to say there's 'blood in the streets' and everyone rushes for the exits , only the few, most experienced investors, with nerves of steel survive.  Everyone else, the vast majority,  end up getting slaughtered in the ensuing panic. The other is the long term investor.  This person is patient. Time horizons for this person are 10 years, 20 years, 40 years. The long term investor generally builds her wealth slowly by constantly investing whatever they can afford each paycheck.  Twenty or thirty years ago they bought stock in a broadly diversified portfolio of solid, well run companies and occasionally adjusted the portfolio as long term conditions change. Today, it's much easier to achieve the same result by investing in an S&P 500 ETF. People who invest this way, patiently, for 20 or more years will definitely see their wealth grow.  Here's an example of how much you would have in your investment account if you invested $1/month in the S&P 500 for 40 years:  \u200b \u200bThe chart shows the total dollars in the account at the end of monthly rolling 40 year periods, starting with the first period from Jan 1871 through Dec 1911 and the last period starting with Jan 1976 and ending with Dec 2015.  By the way, this assumes reinvesting dividends, and the chart is in inflation adjusted, constant 2015 dollars. Note that $1 every month for 40 years means that you invested a total of $480.  The average ending value of your investment is $2,387, in other words, on average, you would have multiplied your wealth by 5x, which represents a 6.7% real rate of return on your investment, or roughly 9.2% including inflation if you assume an average inflation rate of 2.5%. And although the worst case is $761 (Jan 1881 to Dec 1920) followed by a very close second worst case of $789 (Jul 1892 to Jun 1932), your chances of ending up with less $1,000 were around 2% while you had a 90% chance of ending up with more than $1,400, more than tripling your money (remember this is in real dollars).  In fact you had better than a 50% chance of ending up with more than $2,000, multiplying your investment by 4X.  And if you were lucky enough to win the market timing sweepstakes (Sep 1919 to Aug 1959) you would have ended up with the best case of  $5,122, a whopping return on your investment of over 10x. Here's another way to look at it.  Let's assume in today's dollars you are making $50,000 a year and you are able to save 10% or $5,000 a year and invest it in the S&P 500 and you reinvest your dividends.  Assuming the next 40 years have the same average performance as the last 145 years did, you would have $868,000 in you retirement account at the end of your 40 years of patient investing. Making a $100,000 a year?  Invest 10% and you'll end up with over $1.7 million. Anyway, you get the general idea.  If you want to accumulate wealth you need to become a capitalist and being a capitalist means investing. There are even more lucrative ways to get rich.  The best way is to start a successful business and grow it, like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.  However, this is not easy, to make an understatement!  Your odds of succeeding on the scale of Jobs, Gates, or Zuckerberg are about the same as your odds of becoming the next super athlete or the next music superstar.  However even starting a modest successful business and growing it over 20 or 30 years can be more lucrative than passive investing in an S&P ETF.  However this is very hard work and is not for everyone. And the other way is to get into the finance business, successfully invest other people's money and get them to pay you for it.  Also not easy.  But then, there are hedge funds that pay their owners over $1B a year.  So there you have it. Personally, for the vast majority of people, the rest of us mere mortals, I recommend the patient long term approach and invest as much as you possibly can. Patiently investing in an S&P 500 ETF couldn't be easier.  No decisions to make, just do it.  The hardest part is the discipline of doing the actual saving, and if you can't do that, well then, there's no hope. It's not fast, it's not exciting or sexy, but it's easy and it works. Good luck. IMPORTANT NOTE: In response to a comment, I edited the text above to note that the above chart is in REAL dollars, inflation adjusted to constant December 2015 dollars. ",

This dream materialized, but I\u2019m almost ashamed to admit that today the majority of my income is \u201cunearned\u201d. :O  POWR crypto currency How easy is it to get rich by playing any game? Anyone can play at investing. You can learn how to use the buy and sell keys in a few seconds. You can transfer funds to your player account in a couple of minutes. That\u2019s it. You are good to go. Just buy, sell, buy, sell,\u2026 The only question is what to buy? And when? And when to sell? If you manage to consistently make good decisions then you will become very wealthy very quickly. That\u2019s it. Easy. They say that more than 90% of traders fail. That you are much better off giving your money to professionals. I used to be an employee and I used to give the savings I made to those huge investment corporations. I still have those accounts - they yield something like 20% a year. I used to think that that\u2019s a lot. I used to think that I\u2019m a real cowboy for setting my account to 80% stocks. Today I have dozens of open positions. Some are stocks, some are crypto currencies. I used to experiment with forex too but I don\u2019t like it as much. I made a large Buy-and-Hold long term acquisition just a few days ago- POWR crypto currency. Highly recommended. Definitely buy and hold some Bitcoin if you haven\u2019t already. I bought my first bitcoin in 2015, after meeting some crazy guy that kept going on and on about it. His religious zeal intrigued me. It cost $200 back then. I still hold that position with a 4100% yield in less than 3 years. That\u2019s a bit more impressive than 20% a year wouldn\u2019t you agree? So crypto is much more lucrative but if you insist on stocks I don\u2019t think the big tech companies are going to slow down any time soon. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple,\u2026 you name it I own it. You know who is one of my surprising top performers in tech? PayPal ! Those guys seem to know what they are doing. I also think you should buy a Tesla. A share of the company that is. Netflix will probably become a huge player one day, even more than now. These are all guesses. Predictions of the future. Some will prove to be wrong but I bet many will prove to be right. I personally find investing to be fun and exciting but it\u2019s a risky game that is definitely not for everybody. It\u2019s much easier than building a great company but I try to do both. Some may need to overcome a fear first. Here's a free course I made: How to overcome fears | Udemy ",
