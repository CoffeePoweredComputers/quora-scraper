            "answer_text": "This is a must read if you are preparing for SSC JE 2019. All of you already know about the exam pattern and marking scheme. Let me tell you something else. Here is the cut off marks for preliminary examination :  When the pre exam of JE 2018 got over , many reputed coaching classes of Delhi and dozens of YouTube channel were predicting cut off marks and all of them said that cut off will be less than JE 2017 pre cut off. But when the cut off was announced everyone was shocked because nobody was expecting that cut off marks will be more than 120. As you can see in the above picture it was127.40 for UR and 122.91 for OBC. My first advice would be that if you are starting your preparation then set your target of scoring 150+ marks in pre examination. Most of the aspirants come outside the examination centre and realise that they have done some silly mistakes in 3\u20134 questions. If you aim to score 150+ then you will end up scoring around 140+ which can be considered as safe score. Now check out this below image of subject wise marks distribution :  Till 2017 they were asking 25\u201330 marks questions from Building materials and concrete technology. But in 2018 they asked only of 13 marks. Same variations happened with other subjects also. So give equal importance to all subjects. Do not skip any subject. They all carry equal weightage. Aim high and work hard. JE is not an easy game now. You are competing with IITians and NITians. All the best ! Check out this video for detailed analysis and complete strategy on how to score 150+ marks:  ",

Now individual topic to be list out . Candidates can prepare two lists of strong and weak topics. This way candidates can decide which topics to be given more focus and which less. Study Material: Candidates should start their SSC JE Preparation by having the preparation material. look during diploma we all prepare our notes and follow basic book for exam just take reference to that. some of the topic we need reference. you can follow the youtube videos for better understanding for Clear your Doubts Make a Study Plan: Candidates are advised to design a fixed study plan which will have fixed study hours and also incorporate their other daily fixed activities. Cracking the SSC JE Exam is not a cakewalk but candidates who prepare with sheer dedication will have their success ensured. Practice previous years question papers : Solve previous years questions papers, sample papers and answer them like you are attempting the real exam. Give yourself 2 hours and try to finish within that time. When you are answering the questions read them properly and only answer those that you are sure about because of the negative marking. Adapting yourself to the exam environment can help take away any fear related to the exam. A lot of candidates fail in the test because they are not able to attempt all the questions. Do not get stuck on a single question and lose out on half the marks. Be wise with your time. Good luck .. ",

For the pattern, you need to go through the previous year question papers and understand the type of questions asked. To download the questions, visit Study IQ. If you have good subjective knowledge, start with practicing different set of questions. You can download the set of questions from the same website. Pay equal attention to all the topics in the syllabus. SSC-JE paper 1 is objective, so practice as many numerical as you can. And solve problems on regular intervals as to improve your speed. Always revise your class notes or subject notes to memories the formulas & its applications.
