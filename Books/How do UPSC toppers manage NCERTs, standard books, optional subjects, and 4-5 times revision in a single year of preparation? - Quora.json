            "answer_text": "Single year preparation is not small one but if someone has great focus on his preparation with intense hardwork & discipline like rock lying on groundWe have usually 12 months before appear in prelim exam & 3 months more before taking mains exam so generally someone has 15 months to make his/her name in coveted list of UPSC toppersAs per my knowledge, I want deliver prudential strategies that would help to break through this prestigious exam in a single year of dedicated preparationFirst of all, if someone is going to appear in CSE exam then he/she should be ready to allot his/her 10\u201312 hrs in study with proper guidance here guidance means not let be misguide distract yourself during your preparation or even until you reach at your destination (LBSNAA)So if someone has 10\u201312 hrs of time for study then make your study schedule very judiciously like roughly if we talk about he/she could denote 2hrs to read newspaper from his/her daily routineNow move towards NCERT which are very simple books, as per my concern , to cover 6\u201310th class ncert it will take only one month if you are putting 3hrs of your daily routine & to cover 11\u201312th class ncert someone will take two months more so in terms of totall time someone will take only 3 months to cover complete ncerts by putting only 3hrs of your study routineNow we have 6\u20137hrs left so utilise this valuable time in a very calculative way, allot 3hrs for your optional subjects & 2 hrs for 1 standard book whatever you would like to read like polity by Lakshmikant or other thanNow revision that is very crucial thing in whole preparation, it is like we have one more subject so revise all those contents whatever you would read in a week , a/c to me you should make \u201c5 days rule\u201d it means study for 5 days in a week as per your schedule & reserve two days for revision only whatever you have done in 5 days revise all those content in these two days (saturday & sunday), repeat this cycle until your final exam, trust on me this way you could revise 4\u20135 times very easily so I hope this answer regarding your query is enough",
