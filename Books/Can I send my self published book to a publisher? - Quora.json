            "answer_text": "Short answer: no. Now let\u2019s talk about publishers and what they are looking for. I'm going to assume you have taken writing classes and seminars and have written a spectacular, sharp novel that contains no grammatical errors, has no cliches, has a fresh plot, compelling characters, hooks where they are supposed to be, that you have inserted twists, that your pacing is perfect, and you wrote killer dialogue. I'm going to assume you know the market, what is expected in your genre, and have written the correct number of pages according to the guidelines. I'm going to assume your chapters are the correct length for the type of story you wrote, that the scenes are stellar, and that there are no POV problems. If you haven\u2019t done all of that \u2026 don\u2019t bother reaching out to a publisher. Remember your competition is every known and successful author in the world who are also contacting publishing houses and pitching their books. How can you compete with them if your book isn\u2019t up to par? If your book is really ready, here's what you do: There is a difference between an agent, who tries to find a publishing house to take on your book, and an editor at a publishing house who also might offer a book contract. Let's start with the publishing houses. In the publishing world there are five major publishing houses: Penguin Random House (Penguin, Dutton, Putnam, Random House, Alfred A. Knopf, Doubleday, Crown, etc.) , Simon & Schuster (Poseidon, Pocket, Threshold, etc.), HarperCollins (Harlequin, etc.), Macmillan (St. Martin's Press, Tor, etc.), and Hachette (Little, Brown & Company, etc.) Very few of the Big 5 publishers and their subsidiaries accept unsolicited manuscripts. You must query them first, which involves you knowing how to write a killer one-page letter asking them if they are interested in reading more of your novel. If they are, they will request 3 chapters and a synopsis of your book, which requires you to know how to write a synopsis. Then you wait. I waited for 18 months once (and I had an agent) for Harlequin to send me a rejection letter. There are many, many smaller publishing houses. Yes, they don't have the power and reach that the Big 5 does, but you have to start somewhere. My suggestion is to scout around the Internet and find an agent that represents the type of book you have written. Query him/her and see if you can get a contract with an agency. Then let the agent do the job of shopping your book around to publishers. They have the contacts and the know-how. Yes, you pay them a fee from your sales. But you wouldn't have had any sales without them. And they don't market to the 'little publishers'; not enough money in that for either of you. Also, make sure your book is ready. Have it read by other writers and take their comments seriously. One good site to try is querytracker. com. That is a free website that lists agents and publishers and tells you which ones take which genres and what their requirements are and how to submit to them. Not every agent in the world is listed here but there's around 1400 of them on this site. Do your homework and find publishers on that site that take on new writers that don't have an agent. Query them. If you don't know what a query letter is Google it...there are many sites that show you how to write that letter. Smaller publishing houses may be more willing to take a chance on a new writer than one from the Big 5. If you are lucky enough to get a request for 3 chapters and a synopsis, and you don\u2019t know how to write a synopsis \u2026 check out this blog: Great Synopsis Checklist | Writers In The Storm To get the attention of an agent or editor you MUST write a book they want to represent. With that said, only query the ones that represent the genre your book is in. The query letter is the industry standard. Learn to write a killer query that hooks the agent and makes him/her want to read your work. I always (even though it says not to) include the first 5 pages of my ms (manuscript) along with the query. If they are interested, they will read them. If they read the first few pages and I can hook them, I'll get a request for a partial, which is 3 chapters. So there's your in... a killer query and a grab-em-by-the-throat first five pages. Just make sure the rest of the ms is as good as the first 5 pages. The other way to get the eye of an agent is to attend local writing conferences where agents are setting appointments. Most times, unless your book is just awful, they will ask for you to send the first 3 chapters as a courtesy because you attended the conference. There's your in. Make sure your chapters are sharp and fresh. The conference has a fee, but if you can fit it in your budget it is well worth it in just the lectures and knowledge you are going to gain.

            "answer_text": "There are a few publishers who will consider a self-published book. There are not many, and they are typically small, less well-known publishers. Few agents will consider a self-published book because they tend to favour the larger publishers who won\u2019t publish a previously self-published work. Some competitions also bar authors who have self-published, and some accept works from self-published authors as long as the actual submitted work hasn\u2019t been published. Indie publishing is increasingly gaining recognition, though.  It\u2019s a matter of looking carefully at the specifications provided by the publisher or contest organiser, and if they are unclear, send a polite email to inquire. In today\u2019s market, finding an agent and/or publisher to take on an unknown author is a challenge. Many competent writers elect to self-publish because the road to market through a traditional publisher is long and hazardous, and plenty of excellent works never find a publishing home. There are tons of excellent self-published works out there (despite the fact that some will shun anything self-published and denigrate any author who considers self-publishing). Sadly, there are also a lot of terrible self-published works, and differentiating can be difficult (though sites like Amazon and Goodreads assist judgment by encouraging honest reader reviews). In an ideal world, all good quality written works would be taken up by a traditional publisher and self-published titles would all be correctly judged trash. But we don\u2019t live in an ideal world. And technology and changes in the market have greyed the lines between traditional publishing and self-publishing, as well as making it harder to secure a traditional publishing deal. If you are seeking a traditional publishing deal, my advice would be not to self-publish. But understand the road is long and hard and you might paper your walls with rejection letters until you quit and accept that the only way your work will see the light is through self-publication. If you are prepared for the long haul, confident your work is good enough, and able to write good submission cover letters and a good synopsis, submit to agents - and I wish you all the best. But self-publishing is a valid option, and plenty of authors have made strong profits and achieved recognition following that path. Don\u2019t let the detractors convince you otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure you can. Having self published a book gives the publisher information about the sales potential of the book. If the book has sold less than a few thousand copies, they\u2019ll know to avoid it. If the book has sold tens of thousands of copies, they\u2019ll know it has potential. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll publish that particular book, but it does give you an advantage when pitching your next book. I had a self-published book that sold tens of thousands of copies (at the time), but I was looking to expand into bookstores. I pitched it to a publisher, and this lead to collaboration on a project, very similar, but not identical, to the self-published edition. I\u2019ve since signed four publishing deals with the publisher, which is great for me, because it gets my books into bookstores, and it helps with the production and editing costs. When pitching to publisher, you really want to keep in mind what your goals are. The margins on self-published books are much higher, so the benefits to becoming professionally published are typically limited to production cost savings, access to better editors, and a (slight) advantage in distribution. There may be a promotional advantage, but often the author is still responsible for most of marketing. ",

            "answer_text": "The easy answer is the conventional answer: No. The rationale is simple. If you have self-published a book that has sold well, a publisher will view the available marketplace as that much smaller than if the book hadn\u2019t previously sold any copies at all. In other words, if your book has a potential market of 1,000 buyers, and you\u2019ve already sold to 500 of them, that leaves a greatly diminished marketplace for the publisher to plumb. If, on the other hand, your self-published book has sold only a few copies, a publisher is likely to look at it with a jaundiced eye, as in \u201cIt can\u2019t be very marketable if not even the author has managed to wrangle many sales.\u201d If it\u2019s viewed as not very marketable, of course, a major publisher won\u2019t touch it. Fortunately, that conventional thinking may be changing a little. Recently, some big publishers have taken a chance on top-selling, self-published books with the hope that there\u2019s enough of a market still \u201calive\u201d to generate strong sales, particularly in light of the publisher\u2019s use of its own marketing and sales departments and the availability of foreign rights sales and film/television options. So, in that case, a good-selling, self-published book may be eligible for conventional publication. Similarly, a conventional publisher could view a poor-selling, self-published book favorably if the editor falls in love with the writing or the story or both and thinks he could position it more successfully than you did. But don\u2019t count on it. The very best way to sell a self-published book to a conventional publisher is to rewrite, re-title, and repurpose the original book. If you\u2019re a writer, that shouldn\u2019t be difficult. Expand or sharpen the book\u2019s original outline. Add a new beginning (opening) chapter or two. Sharpen and/or expand the existing chapters wherever it makes sense to do so. Add a few chapters more (it\u2019s always easier to add entire chapters to expand a book than it is to add a few sentences here and there throughout the book) AND cut any sections of chapters that are dead weight. Finally, stick a new title on the cover sheet, even if it\u2019s not your favorite. If you can produce a book that\u2019s 40 - 50 percent different than the original self-published version, you technically have a new book on your hands, and that means you can ethically shop it around (or hopefully find an agent willing to do so for you) to conventional publishers. As a caveat, I would still tell prospective publishers that, while the book you\u2019re pitching is \u201cbrand new,\u201d it\u2019s story line is based upon a book you originally self-published on (date). Then sit back and pray for good news. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Self-publishing, as many people expect, is not as easy as it seems to be. Sometimes while self-publishing your book, it may cross your mind that getting your book published through an established publisher would have been way easier. But there are certain things you need to know to clear your thoughts about self-publishing. Niche Books Perform the Best: One of the mantras of self-publishing is writing a book with a well-defined topic with a target audience to focus on. One of the popular topics could be religion or maybe politics. Whatever the topic maybe, if it targets a specific audience it becomes a bestseller. Create a Unique Title: If you want your book to become a bestseller, make sure you create a title which is unique. People buy books on the basis of titles, a good title makes the reader buy the book to know about the storyline. Self Promoting your Book: There is a very thin line between being overly aggressive and being assertive when self-publishing a book. It is good to promote your book on social media networks, but it gets a little too much when all you do is a tweet about your book. Make sure that you keep self-promotion to a limit where people are excited to buy your book. Quality is a Serious Challenge: Make sure that whatever you write is original, genuine and of high quality. When self-publishing a book, you write up becomes your USP. Make sure that the write up is such that people after reading your book, recommend it to others as well. This will increase the sales of your book and will help in making it a bestseller.

If you are submitting your self-published book to a publisher, it\u2019s because it\u2019s not selling in the sort of numbers you want. So the publisher will look at it, typos, clunky phrasing, plot holes and all, and then will look at the sales numbers, because once you publish, you have a sales record. And the publisher will say, \u201cYou managed to sell 235 copies of this book. Why should we spend thousands on it if you can\u2019t sell more than 235 copies?\u201d Now, if you\u2019ve sold tens of thousands of copies, and for some reason still want to offer it to a publisher who will pay you much less per copy than you are making now, the publisher is likely to say, \u201cThose are great sales figures, but you\u2019ve probably sold it to most of your potential market by now so we don\u2019t want to waste thousands on it.
