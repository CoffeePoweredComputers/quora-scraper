            "answer_text": "\u201cThe essential work, however, took place at the desk in his studio, which provided him with all he needed: stacks of paper; black for dark-brown) and red ink pots and a supply of copper-gallic ink powder to be mixed with water; raven quills and a knife for preparing and sharpening quill pens - the same knife was used also for\u2026\u201d This is a snippet from J.S.Bach, the Learned Musician, by Christoph Wolff, which gave me not only more of what I know about Bach than all other sources combined (except the music itself), but also an armchair tour of Northern Europe in the 18th Century - fascinating book. Bach wrote more than 1128 works - those are just the BWV numbers in the main catalogue \"Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis\u201d = BWV. Dozens of pieces have been lost; and a few were written by others but attributed to him, so no number is exact (I myself have published one cantata and no songs, but have written 20 cantatas and 400 songs, but I am not Bach (\u201cIch bin nicht Bach\u201d). I cannot find any source that verifies the legend that he wrote a fugue every day before breakfast - but it\u2019s not too impossible to believe. Anything you do, if you keep it up, you can produce enormous amounts of anything. I live on a hillside above Rainier, Oregon, and need to go over the Columbia River to go to work. Just two separate trips a day, each taking about the time it would take Bach to write a short composition. The Bridge gets repaired a lot, and it\u2019s a nuisance (especially if the bridges in Portland are being fixed and traffic comes up our way in addition). Once while waiting in line, I thought, \u201chow much do I actually use this bridge?\u201d Twice a day on the average, over and back = 4, x 365 days in a year = 1500 crossings a year. I\u2019ve lived here 22 years, so 1500 x 22 = 33,000 trips! Bach\u2019s active lifetime as a composer = age 20 to age 65 = 45 years. Enough? We can be grateful that he was successful at finding good jobs and could afford to buy ink and paper, which was recycled from rags, and very expensive to produce, as if today you took the best photo paper you could buy - dollars for each sheet - and used it for writing music. Of course, Bach\u2019s music was - priceless. ",

            "answer_text": "Bach lived between 1685 and 1750, that\u2019s 65 years. If we count only 45 years as \u201ccreative\u201d, he had on average a little over two weeks for one title. But many of those works were short pieces, like the Inventions and Sinfonias (BWV 772\u2013801, each one counted separately); every set of prelude + fugue in The Well-Tempered Clavier is counted as a separate work \u2014 and there are many more examples. Not to mention that (as it was the habit in those times) he often recycled older works. He could have written over half of his works easily in one, maybe two years, leaving on average one month or more for some of his longer works; but he could have finished most of those in a week or two, leaving even more time for the really tough ones\u2026 So no, for his lifetime 1128 isn\u2019t exaggerated. We know that some of his works were lost. I\u2019ve seen estimates between 10% and 90%\u2026 1200\u20131300 works, maybe even 1500 are well within the believable limit; but for over 11 thousand works we would need about 10 thousand really short pieces.
