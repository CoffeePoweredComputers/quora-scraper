            "answer_text": "I would not say all but, almost all the books I can guarantee that! There are a lot of ways by which you can read free books on Kindle but I think the best way would be by using Calibre. I am a regular Kindle user for more than 2 years now and I use this trick for most of my books. You need to have a software called Calibre on your Desktop/Laptop. This software will enable you to transfer files from your PC/Laptop to your Kindle. This software can also be used to read books on your PC. The important part of this software is the ability to convert one format to another. The Kindle supported format is MOBI. You can put other formats like Pdf and Azw3 and they would still be visible but, the experience would not be great. So it is best if you convert the format into MOBI. Using Calibre you can convert any format Like PDF, Epub to Mobi and you can enjoy the book in your Kindle. There are just 3 simple steps. A) Google the name of the book which you want to read. Almost 99% of the book which you want to read would be already available online. One hack here is that try searching in double-quotes to get great results. For example - Think and grow rich free download instead of this, try this search, \u201cThink and grow rich free download\u201d It will give you exact and more accurate results. B) The second step would be to convert the book into MOBI format.  Wait till the conversion is done. The Jobs section in the bottom right shows the number of conversions which are pending. C) Transfer the book to Kindle.  In this way, you can read almost any book for free. You would need to purchase very few books if you follow this trick. Hope it helps. Happy reading :-) ",

If you read 1 book a month and it cost say Rs.200 each, you will end up spending Rs.2800 in a year. Thats fine i think right for the value books gives us. Keep reading, learning and implementing!
