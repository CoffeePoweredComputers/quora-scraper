            "answer_text": "Hi DeniseGood question, I still go through days of depression, the key is it's a day here or there now, where it was weeks on end. It still hurts, but it no longer devastates me. The things that helped me were seeing a therapist, reading the book \"Psychopath Free\" (a must read for victims of narcissism), accepting that: I was taken advantage of, I was brain washed, that the person I thought was in love with me was a liar, a sick person who has no problem destroying people. I had to realize my innocent thoughts of \"there is good in everyone\" wasn't true. There are evil people out there and I can't change them.  Then coming to the realization, that I'm still a good person, I'm a little jaded, but I still love to help others, that my empathy (though at times has almost killed me) is a gift. I had to realize the difference between helping someone and being a co-dependent. I had to build walls that I thought I never needed, but I have to protect myself first. I am still the wonderful human I was before the narcissist and this will only make me stronger. There are far more good people out there than bad. As my wonderful therapist said, \"I needed to quit looking for lost puppies to save\".  I made myself a list of things I was going to do to help me heal, things like staying in touch with my brother, giving thanks daily for all the wonderful things in life (truth, love, happiness, another day alive, my health, my job, etc.) walking and enjoying nature, loving on my dog because he loves me unconditionally, telling my family and friends that I love them and care deeply for them. Help others that have been through abuse and show them there is light and it's within them. Denise, You are the keeper of the light, the narcissist is void of any light and he tried to steal yours, but light (love) can't be extinguished it's still there and it's still yours forever. It is in you and part of you. Share the light with the people that can accept it and give you light back. They are out there, I promise. Go out there and shine like the beautiful light you are. I truly wish you peace and happiness, Rob ",

            "answer_text": "I'm so sorry you experienced this horrible abuse and still feel depression. As hard as this is to accept at present, you so have choices. Be kind to you as kind as you would be to others.. Be patient with yourself and accept your feelings and emotions. They are very real.. It all takes time.. A long time. If you have thoughts too dark and too deep please go see your doctor. You may need therapy/counselling. But most of all you need to know there is a future. You can get better, you will recover. It all takes time. This is what I did. I got to know as much as I could about my ex, what happened and why. I forgave myself for being so bloody stupid as I went over and over all the silly choices I made, all the forgiving, the second chances and the expecting my love to eventually be enough.. For expecting change. Now I'm one to accept others as they are, but he presented as a very nice amicable person who changes immediately after our marriage which he wanted, not me.. Stupid ah\u2026I knew all along but was easily persuaded this choice was good. I wanted the old me back.. I had changed so much. I didn't want to be a victim, I wanted to be a survivor and from then on anything which I took on because of him had to go. Fear was a stronghold.. In many ways to minor degrees it still is. I have gained comfort from recently discovering he has left the country\u2026wonderful I can travel anywhere without fear\u2026I have a motor home bus\u2026I wrote and wrote and wrote.. Long letters, long lists anything to get my experience out and unravelled. A lot started to pull together and make sense\u2026it helped to understand. It empowered and allowed me to feel in control of my life and choices. I don't know when I went around that corner, but I was soon laughing at comedy on TV.. My spirits lifted. I did not rely on others but found my strength within. That's the best strength. I am retired but so vuntsry work.. I'm involved in my community. I attend motor home rallies. None of it is easy, but I want it to be,so I make myself do it. I know in time my confident, cheerful self will fully, completely return. Giving into depression. Giving into self sympathy, just giving into anything in fact allows him to win. And you know what? He's not wining. This is the best choice, your choice and the way back from narcissistic abuse. Wishing you well. Hugs. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I am sorry to read that you have severe depression as a result of a love relationship with a narcissitic person. Take Heart! Let no episode of depression go to waste. You are on a road to new discoveries, healthier living and a happiness you may not even imagine. Consider, you have been brought to the emotional depths of your very being, this view, this experience of these depths can be reversed and soon allow you to soar higher than ever, higher than you may imagine and you will do this with joy in every step of the way. You are already getting a lot of advise so pick the basics and start working at them. You know what they are: time with friends, do good works, sleep, eat healthy, meditate and grieve. Oh, you may need a good therapist too. Never, Let yourself feel as if you are a victim of whatever shit the narcissits put you through. To overcome this take some time to realize where you are now, then step back to who you once were and the path you were on. After that you will be on the path of new discoveries, cheerfulness and great mental health. Being severely depressed is a sickness. You need to take care of this just as you would need to take care of a broken tooth or a flu virus. Accept that this happened to you and only you can heal yourself. Accept that overcoming depression, is a sickness of your mind so it will take several months. As you ponder what happened, In the midst of the turmoil of all the what the?? and the Why??? Do a few things to know you are not alone. Ever listen to hard rock? Many rock bands seem to know alot about abusers and the affect on their loved ones. If you enjoy it, try listening to this to give you a system of sentences to keep this in perspective. Check the website BPDFamily.org and http://NPTfamily.org this will give you a social group to go to in confidence and discuss things. From where you are now? imagine having two mental bags. In one bag you put in feathers and in the other you put in stones. In the bag with feathers are all the sweet, kind, encouraging and beautiful things loved ones have said about you. In the other bag is stones. For every word of ridicule, humilation, isolation, demeaning statements and every physical hurt is a stone. As the bag of stones was filling up, so was your anxiety on what was going on. Once the bag of stones was full depression moved in. Like many who write on here, myself included, once that bag was full we just kept on living. Not knowing anxiety is cumulative and for myself I just made things worse and worse for my mental health. Does this sound like where you are now? I hope you like to read books. First get the book, \u201cLove without Hurt\u201d by Steven Stosny. The book guides people through reclaiming their lives as they determined at a younger age and lost their way. This suggestion is for you to refocus on who you are. People who have had simply soured love relationships cannot see where you are. You are one (one of many ) who has had a love relationship without compassion. By refocusing who you wanted to be, that is, who you wanted to be before you were manipulated and isolated from what your heart knows is important, you will regain your inner self and will become a shooting star of cheerfulness, encouragement and joy.

            "answer_text": "Thank you for your A2A\u2026 I am not a therapist but I am a victim of two narcissistic relationships in my life, my mother and my spouse. So I am just going to share my personal experience with what I went through during my recovery. Before I start I want to clarify what defines a narcissist and a narcissist victim. A narcissist is a person who exhibits the following signs of narcissistic personality disorder: Grandiose sense of self-importance.Lives in a fantasy world that supports their delusions of grandeur.Needs constant praise and admiration.Sense of entitlement.Exploits others without guilt or shame.Frequently demeans, intimidates, bullies, or belittles others.A narcissistic victim is someone who has lost their identity and self-esteem due to verbal and/or physical abuse in a narcissistic relationship. Some of the major signs of being a narcissist victim are: You find yourself constantly apologizing for something you said, did, or didn\u2019t do.DepressionIsolationFeeling helplessIndecisionSelf-blameThere are generally two types of victims when it comes to narcissists. Those who were victims from a previous narcissistic relationship and those who they turn into victims during the relationship. When it comes to recovery this is what I found worked for me: I first had to determine where my victim mentality originated. The best way to do this is through therapy. I spent a couple of years in therapy working through this one. If you don\u2019t do it, even if you manage to recover for a narcissist relationship, you will still be vulnerable to becoming a victim in another narcissistic relationship. Next I had to convince myself that no one can please a narcissist. This is probably the hardest thing to do because most narcissists are very self-confident and charismatic and their being interested in you makes you feel special and needed. This makes you want to please them. But pleasing a narcissist is impossible. Nothing you can do will please them. You are never good enough for them and they let you know constantly. I also found, by experience, to avoid other relationships for at least a year after my breakup. This is because all you are doing is trying to replace them with someone other than yourself. You need to reconnect with yourself. Generally you can do this by independence, relationships with friends, and pursuing new challenges in life such as taking up yoga or going back to school. This will also allow you to connect with others of similar interests which will also build your self-esteem. Last but not least, is don\u2019t rush a new relationship. If they really care about you they will be patient with you. Time is your friend. The longer you are with someone the more likely you will start to see past any facade they might possess. Remember your happiness is just as important as anyone else\u2019s. ",

            "answer_text": "This isn\u2019t psychotherapy, but I\u2019m going to talk about how I would work with someone like you to figure out the problems, and how to fix them. If you walked into my office and asked that, the first thing I would raise is the possibility that the cause of the depression is not the narcissistic ex-husband, but rather, the damage he inflicted on you. I would suggest that the origin of the depression is inside you (the damage), not external to you (the ex). Of course, I wouldn\u2019t just lay my ideas on you like that. We would have a two-way conversation to study whether this makes sense, or doesn\u2019t make sense. If we agreed that the damage is inside you, the next step would be to identify the damage. I\u2019d suggest that you look inside yourself, and assess things like your confidence, your self-esteem, your self-worth, your overall emotional state. We might size up how you functioned in the past, when you were at your best. You might describe a happy, confident woman, for example, who managed a lot of responsibilities well. Then we\u2019d compare that to how you\u2019re doing now, so we can see how the damage you experienced is affecting you. We would probably spend the next 3,6,12 months helping you rebuild yourself into the person you once were, and restoring your confidence so you can be that person again. The specifics would vary a lot based on the person. There would probably be some teary moments, where the full extent of your pain leaked out, as you process your way through it. Obviously, different psychotherapists would approach the problem in their own way, but a lot of us would probably follow a plan similar to what I described above. We\u2019d hold your hand through the hard moments, and be your biggest cheerleader as you made progress in your recovery. If you are not in therapy, perhaps my description helps you understand what it might look like, and whether it is something you should consider. It also helps you distinguish a good therapist from a bad one. If the therapist is following a plan similar to the one above, you know you\u2019re in good hands. If they just sit quietly and nod occasionally while you struggle with your feelings, you know maybe you have a dud. You\u2019re still the good person you were before, but you\u2019ve taken a lot of hits, and many of your systems that make you who you are are damaged or shut down. As you repair them, you will return to your full potential. Thanks for the question! ",

After enduring so much emotionally, mentally and even physically, I believe it\u2019s natural to fall into depression. I did, too. The key, in my opinion, is to not get comfortable in your depression. You have to continue to work through it. This is a phase - just like anger, crying spells and rage were When I first left him, I started taking weekly trips to the spa. Massages help your entire body relax - including, your thoughts. I also started going back to the gym. Exercising releases serotonin, endorphins and dopamine. These chemicals help your mood change for the better. I also listened to a lot of audible books. Getting a better understanding of the disorder helped me understand what happened to me and why. The two books I highly recommend are: \u2018Psychopath Free\u2019 by Jackson MacKenzie and \u2018Dodging Energy Vampires\u2019 by Dr. Christiane Northrup. I also kept hair and nail appointments. Don\u2019t let yourself go. It will only make you feel worse. I believe when we look good, it helps us feel good. Stay pretty - for yourself. Candles. Aromatherapy does wonders and truly helps you relax. They\u2019re still a part of my everyday routine\u2026 Recovery from narcissistic abuse requires effort - a consistent effort. It\u2019s not something that happens over time. You have to work for it. Start doing different things and see what helps boost your mood. If you can\u2019t do it on your own, see your Dr. and see if an anti-depressant with help you. Best wishes. ",

Although I\u2019m not a mental health professional, I have experienced both the effects of a relationship with a narcissist and severe depression, so I will do my best to answer you based on my experience. First of all, congratulations on getting out of a toxic relationship. It was a brave step, because narcissists constantly undermine our self-confidence and even our sense of self. Everything is about them, and when we love them, we will do anything we can to please them. They are also incredibly controlling, especially in subtle ways. I am sure it took every ounce of your mental and emotional strength to leave, and I can understand why you feel lost. I hope you are in therapy. It is the best way I know to rediscover yourself, even though you will most likely have to work through some painful truths about yourself and why you got into the relationship in the first place. (Yes, narcissists can be incredibly attractive, especially if you don\u2019t have a lot of self-confidence to start with.) If you haven\u2019t started seeing a therapist, please, please do so! If you can\u2019t afford a private psychiatrist or psychologist, please look for more affordable or even free public mental health services. Antidepressants can help because they do help lift your mood, but, at least for me, getting to the root of the issue through therapy was key to recovery. It will take time, but it is so worth it! At the same time, self-care is essential. Do things just for yourself: Change your hairstyle, treat yourself to a spa day, have a massage\u2026 Get out into the sunshine, go for walks, learn to meditate. See friends, or get involved in activities you enjoy and make new ones. Sure, it can be scary, but remember that deep inside you is a strong woman with wants and needs of her own. You can do it! ",

He may not be a TRUE narcissist, meaning that he may not show enough of the markers t be diagnosed OR he may, I don\u2019t know. He also may only be a rather selfish and self-involved person with little empathy or compassion - OR sense of shame. If you can manage this yourself, come to an understanding that depression is a response you have chosen as appropriate for this circumstance. Since it may be of your (unconscious) choosing, it may also be subject to your control - with some work. A therapist could give you some good help with that work. Depression isn\u2019t something that just comes out of nowhere and lands on you, even if it feels that way sometimes. It is produced inside you and by you because we have all been taught that the loss of a partner, even a vicious one, leads, or should lead, to depression. We also take it as a measure of our quality or worth, sometimes. As a prize, I\u2019ll bet you NEVER choose a partner like that one again. I had one like that, and I\u2019ve come to know the signs - even almost SMELL them - in certain men, and I know to avoid them like poison, which is what they are to me. ",

I guess with imagery you might be able to send some of it back. However, he may have caused it but now its your depression. You have to own it and deal with it, the best way you know how by taking care of yourself. By not believing the lies that were put on you. By not allowing the memories of him to keep you in lethargy state of mind. Exercise - go for walks, whatever gives you more energy. Eat as healthy as you\u2019re able to, let your friends and family support you. Do kind things for yourself. Allow yourself to grieve, what you lost - what you thought you had but didn\u2019t, what was taken from you. Get angry enough to make changes. Try to remember who you were before him. That person went into hiding and needs to know its ok to come back out. Get help, Read books that help. YouTube has videos where people talk about exactly these kind of issues. ",

            "answer_text": "Since I was a2a, not being a clinical psychologist, continuing psychological therapy seems appropriate. Neuropsychological research indicates that dwelling on negative events in any way, to include conscious attempts to forget, merely sustains or strengthens neural connections in the brain. Neural connections weaken with disuse, such as when the brain is engaged in other activities (e.g., be open to new experience and new relationships). (Incognito: The secret lives of the brain(2011), by neuropsychologist David Eagleman, PhD, who directed the Laboratory for Perception and Action and the Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, Baylor College of Medicine, is a Guggenheim fellow, and headed the Center for Science and Law, a national non-profit institute, and serves as an adjunct professor at Stanford University) Why those victimized commonly have difficulty separating due to a common human cognitive process. There is also the probability of displaying behavior associated with Trauma Bonding: https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/10-steps-to-recovering-from-toxic-trauma-bond-0110175. This is a mindset leading one to have difficulty separating from an abuser, based on conflicting positive and negative reinforcement.

            "answer_text": "First and foremost, always remind yourself that the abuse was not your fault! Any abuser has deep seeded issues that he doesn\u2019t want to address. That is ALL on him, not you! However, you can take care of yourself to make sure that you invite in the love you deserve. No one wants abuse but sometimes we have a difficult time recognizing the red flags. You can be upset if you get pickpocketed, for example, but the experience will make you more vigilant. You will get your voice back in time but only by being kind to yourself. Kindness for abuse is getting the treatment that you need to heal. Find a therapist and/or support group. Please don\u2019t be ashamed for asking for help, we all need it sometimes. Keep a schedule, even on days when you don\u2019t feel your best. Maybe plan something to look forward to once a week. I like the app headspace. It gives 3 min meditation everyday with helpful advice on thinking. But please get some help, you deserve a happy life!!! ",

Your post makes it sound as if you were \u2018under the thumb\u2019 of this man for a long time. Long enough for depression to manifest itself. It could be useful for you to think that getting better is going to become easier the longer you walk a recovery path. I would think you may experience some rough roads and some painful falls, but getting better and becoming the best person you can be will be worth the effort. You may have to relive some of the pain you suffered while married, but it is acknowledging past wrongs, naming them and in doing so making them more \u2018right sized\u2019 so you can overcome them. kapm kapm ",

In this lies the answer: study and learn to understand who you are , what you are and why the things in your life are happening like they are happening. There is a good reason for being involved with a narcissist, that reason is in you. A narcissist only bonds with a co-dependent. Only after you found out and freed yourself from the reason in you. Its a diffiult road to free yourself and I suggest you look for professional assistance. There is a lot to learn and more difficult : a lot to change. Maybe this is a start:  Lots of strength and success on the journey and don\u2019t stop till you feel you don\u2019t want to stop learning anymore ! ",
