            "answer_text": "That depends on the accuracy of that textbook as related to current state of the art. Let me tell you an interesting example related to being hired as a systems administrator. Many companies have pre-employment tests that closely resemble Microsoft Certified Professional tests. The challenge with these tests is that they are sometimes out of date and the person applying to the position needs to remember the differences between the current release, which makes what the question asks possible or expands the limits, and the \"correct\" answer that it was not possible at the time the software was released.  For example, Exchange 2003 Standard Edition had a hard limit of 75GB per data store. This expanded 75GB limit was introduced by Service Pack 2. That limit does not exist in Exchange 2007, except that the default limit is in fact set to 50GB. If the test question was written about Exchange 2003 prior to Service Pack 2, the expected answer is no longer correct. The original Exchange 2003 limit was 16GB, which was then bumped to 18GB with SP2, but could optionally be increased to 75GB per data store. Thus, a test preparation book on Exchange 2003 exam would contain wrong information by the time the exam was updated to reflect Exchange 2003 SP2. You would not believe how often this happens in the rapidly changing industry of information technology. That is why taking pre-employment exams on older technology that you no longer use every day is exceptionally challenging. The majority of base knowledge does not change. That is why it infuriates me that college textbooks issue so many expensive print editions where the information is substantially the same but the students are forced to buy a new edition to remain on the same page with their group. We will eventually move from proprietary textbooks to peer-reviewed textbooks that are available at no cost to any student. This is already happening. Accurate and current fact-based textbooks not influenced by religious beliefs and government agendas are essential for continued progress so we can avoid having to replicate the costly experiments and years of research. We should also have accurate historical record to avoid repeating the same mistakes. ",
