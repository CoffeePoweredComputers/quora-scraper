            "answer_text": "Book editors do a lot more than just read and edit raw manuscripts. They are a key part of the chain of command in publishing and have a lot of influence over which books get published and which ones don't The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not provide a separate category for book editors, however, it does include the title under the more general term Editors: \u25cf\tMedian annual salary: $58,770 ($28.25/hour) \u25cf\tTop 10% annual salary: $114,460 ($55.03/hour) \u25cf\tBottom 10% annual salary: $30,830 ($14.82/hour) For comparison purposes, let\u2019s look at the editing rates and use an average page-per-hour and an average hourly rate. For instance, the EFA lists basic copyediting of 5\u201310 pages per hour at a cost of $30\u2013$40 per hour, so I\u2019ve assumed 7.5 pages per hour at a cost of $35 per hour. The other total calculations also use their respective average rates. For a 70,000-word book, your editing costs could be: \u25cf\tDevelopmental editing: $.08 per word, or $5,600 total \u25cf\tBasic copyediting: $.018 per word, or $1,260 total \u25cf\tProofreading: $.0113, or $791 total It\u2019s easy to extrapolate from this what your total expected editing cost could be. Fantasy, sci-fi, and epic novel writers should be forewarned. For a 120,000-word book, your editing costs could be: \u25cf\tDevelopmental editing: $.08 per word, or $9,600 total \u25cf\tBasic copyediting: $.018 per word, or $2,160 total \u25cf\tProofreading: $.0113, or $1,356 total These prices may vary from company to company to. Book editing companies like Edioak provides book editing services at a cheaper rates. ",

            "answer_text": "As noted by several other people in their answers, this depends entirely on a number of factors, most importantly: The type of editing: are we talking about developmental editing, copy editing, or proofreading here?The length of the manuscript;The genre.To give you an idea, here are some average rates for developmental editing on a 70,000-word manuscript, which were calculated after analyzing over 2,000 quotes from professional editors: Romance: $1,302Thriller, Crime & Mystery: $1,377Sci-fi & Fantasy: $1,372YA: $1,428Historial Fiction: $2,149Literary Fiction: $1,533Middle Grade (MG) $1,435Memoir: $1,743Business, Self-help, and Health: $2,828As you can see, average prices can vary widely depending on the genre. This is due to certain genres (non-fiction, historical fiction) being much more time-consuming for the editor as they require more research. The same analysis was done for copy editing \u2014 still for a 70,000 word manuscript: Romance: $1,302Thriller, Crime & Mystery: $1,377Sci-fi & Fantasy: $1,372YA: $1,225Historical Fiction: $966Literary Fiction: $1,393Middle Grade (MG) $1,155Memoir: $1,295Business, Self-help, and Health: $1,547Please do note that the quotes used for this analysis all came from professional, veteran editors. So if you\u2019re just looking to get started as a book editor, you probably shouldn\u2019t attempt to replicate these prices. Instead, do as much beta reading for authors as you can to hone your skills, and then get started with lower prices to earn your first few clients. You can get the full analysis (including proofreading averages) here. ",
