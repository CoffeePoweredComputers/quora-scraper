            "answer_text": "Do you really spend a lot of time watching TV? Or is it on a lot because you use it for background noise when you do other things? If you couple watching TV with doing chores, you can\u2019t really turn it off and read, because the chores won\u2019t get done. You need to find time somewhere else in your schedule if you are really serious about reading more. Now, if you actually sit in from of the TV, watching, and doing nothing else, then yes, you can cut out a lot of that, and start reading. First, how much of your time is spent watching reruns, and how much is spent watching new programming? Is the new programming on broadcast TV that you watch in real time, or do you watch things On Demand, or on Hulu or Netflix? Also, do you watch new programming with other people, so it\u2019s a social activity? The first thing to cut out is watching reruns while doing nothing else. The second thing to look at is things you watch On Demand or on pay channels that you don\u2019t watch at a regular time. Can you couple those with things like folding the laundry? That way, you don\u2019t get to miss out on shows that may actually be stimulating for you, but you are not using time you could be spending reading. If you watch broadcast shows in the evening to unwind, during their original run, that may be something you do when you don\u2019t have enough energy to read. Also, if you have a couple of times a week when you get together with other people to watch something, or if you and your SO watch something together every week, keep those times intact. OK, now you have decided what viewing to keep, and where you can eliminate viewing, and find time to read. How do you choose books? Choosing books you want to read is very important. If your books don\u2019t hold your attention, you will be back with the TV in no time. Don\u2019t choose books you think you should read. Don\u2019t try to read poetry, or the canon of English literature, because you think you should. If you have not read much in years, try reading your favorite book from childhood again, just to warm up your reading muscles. See if that primes you for reading again, if you will forgive my mixing my metaphors. If you liked science in school, and hated English class, try reading Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s books, or read Paul Offit\u2019s books on vaccines. Or go to a bookstore, or Amazon\u2019s website, and browse the science books. There\u2019s nothing wrong with reading non-fiction. Heck, if you want to read True Crime, read that. Whatever gets you reading is good, because one book usually leads to another. Read Agatha Christie novels, if those hold your attention (they are actually pretty well-written). Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you are wasting your time reading something that doesn\u2019t somehow qualify as \u201cliterature.\u201d A book does not have to be a Pulitzer nominee to be worth reading. Pretty much anything that is the written word is tapping into the part of your brain that decodes and interprets writing, and something that holds your attention is always going to be better than something that does not. Do not read in the room the TV is in. If you have a TV in every room, move one of them. Make a room that doesn\u2019t have a TV, and that will be your reading room. Or if you like to be outside, go sit on the porch, or front stoop, or whatever you have, and read there. If the TV is staring at you, you will be tempted, but if there is no TV in the room, it will be easier to stick to the book. Finally, there is nothing wrong with some TV. It\u2019s all in the balance. I even believe it\u2019s possible to read too much, and I speak as someone who, in my teens and 20s was obsessed with reading. I missed meals and sleep for reading. My parents were a little worried about me, and couldn\u2019t convince anyone else there was a problem, because so many other parents were trying to get their kids to read. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t watched TV in 6 years. In theory, I still follow a lot of the things that I used to watch regularly on TV, I just exchanged television with other media - internet, radio and newspapers, because amount of commercials became unbearable for me. I use internet for watching movies and series, newspapers and credible sites for staying informed, radio for discovering new music and interesting interviews. I encourage everyone to try it. The best part of switching TV off wasn\u2019t even one of the reasons why I did it. It\u2019s the freedom to own your schedule. No national news at 8pm, no favorite TV show at 9pm, no half an hour of commercials that you didn\u2019t want to see and listen to at all. Instead you get to decide what you will do, when and for how long. When I have a lot of work, I skip watching new episode of a show that day. When I feel lazy and have a free day I can stay home and watch 5 episodes in a row (with occasional toilet breaks as needed) Back to books. If you haven\u2019t read books regularly, you may find this switch a bit hard. Television occupies our attention on multiple levels: we\u2019ve got visuals, sound, human touch, whilst in reading you\u2019re dependable on your own motivation and imagination (well, writer\u2019s too). I suggest that you start with audio books and see how that goes. You\u2019ll get more comfortable in visualizing what you hear and their is the human touch - you listen to expressive reading so it\u2019s easier to catch emotions etc. I recommend audio books for your transitional period, but if they are not an option, you can go for a physical book and some background music. Even though I\u2019ve been avid reader for years, I often play instrumental music while reading because it calms my anxiety and consequentially makes me experience book better. Background instrumental music is also a great trick to use while studying, when our attention seems to demonstrate its own free will and goes to everything else but the textbook. If you get discouraged when you start reading, don\u2019t despair. There are so many different kinds of books out there. I\u2019d say that on average I don\u2019t finish every 5th book that I start. I don\u2019t quit easily, but if I\u2019ve already gone halfway through and it doesn\u2019t hold my attention even a tiniest bit, I know there is a better book option for me and I go for the next one. So, pick some subject you\u2019re interested in, check out best sellers or books that some tv series and movies are based on and find your style. And just to be sure, lose the remote. ",
