            "answer_text": "Hello, R.d.sharma is not tougher than NCERT book, it's just that it gives you exposure to large number of problems which you probably wouldn't encounter in NCERT. The author tries to offer maximum number of problems possible with different possible conditions to let students understand the topic efficiently! Many topics will be explained in detail considering various cases unlike the NCERT! Hope this helps! ",

Honestly I started using these books when I came to 11th and 12th and I realized that as long as your basics are strong , these questions will be easy and will serve as extra questions for your practice Cheers ;) ",
