            "answer_text": "Daenerys is only ever two things. 1 - attracted to power. And 2 - in love with BEING loved. You can call her kind, or gentle or affectionate or whatever, but every single move she made over the entire series boils down to power. Power is the Targareyan currency, it\u2019s all they know. And Daenerys is very much a Targareyan. She and Viserys lived on the streets from city to city before they sought out Illyrio in the name of reclaiming the Iron throne. In the name of power. Viserys sold Daenerys to Khal Drogo in the name of power. She murdered her brother to gain power. She was going to unleash Khal Drogo and 40,000 Dothraki screamers on King\u2019s Landing to rape, steal and kill in the name of power. Think about that before you call her kind or gentle or whatnot. She married Drogo, a man who bought and raped her, because of his power. *\u201cDragons, Khaleesi, from the shadow lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.\u201d* Illyrio gave those eggs to Daenerys in the name of beauty, to bring something beautiful to the world. And as soon as they were big enough to begin killing, that\u2019s what Daenerys had them do. She says \u201cZaldrizes buzdari iksos daor\u201d (a dragon is not a slave), but instead of showing the world how dragons can be magnificent creatures, she used them to inspire terror across the world. All in the name of power. She freed an army of slaves in the name of power. Conquered three cities that she had no legal claim to in the name of power. She killed and tortured because it made her feel powerful. Every ruler has to take life, it comes with the job. Ned had to, Robb had to, Jon had to. But they beheaded their enemies because it was quick, relatively painless and above all else, it was humane. Or as humane as it could be. Daenerys burns people alive not because it gives her any kind of tactical advantage, but because it makes her feel powerful to hear them scream as their skin blackens and their flesh is scorched from their bones. Using dragons in the field is one thing, but to execute someone by dragon fire as she did Varys and the Tarly\u2019s? Cruel. Brutal. Unnecessary. Everything Daenerys does is in the name of power, including burning down King\u2019s Landing, and for people to just go \u201cthat wasn\u2019t the real Daenerys\u201d because they\u2019re still clinging onto the benevolent image of the woman who gave a crucified man water one time (and he still died), is stupid.

            "answer_text": "Azor Ahai and TPTWP are One - Made up of Two People No, Daenerys is not \u2018evil\u2019, not at all. Daenerys is on the \u2018good\u2019 side in terms of the ASOIAF story - as the \u2018bad guy\u2019 side of the good. Daenerys is the other half to the balance of Jon and his purity, which is why Jon Snow is surrounded by all things white, and Daenerys is surrounded by all things red and black - red represents martyrdom and black represents sin or contamination. I believe Jon is Azor Ahai and Daenerys is TPTWP and that they are 2 that become 1 although not as in \u2018two hearts that beat as one\u2019 as in being in love but as two sides of the same coin which need to unite to fight the Great Other. The Light and the Dark of the Good. Daenerys will need to die, before the Battle for the Dawn, in order for Jon to have all he needs to move forward and successfully fight the Others. There is a story back in Yi Ti in which a great warrior bearing the sword Lightbringer was able to fight off the darkness - in order to make the sword effective he had to plunge it into the heart of his wife Nissa Nissa. Nissa Nissa means the beginning, or a remembered loved one. Many who love daenerys will never forget her, she will remain one who is remembered. Especially once she becomes a martyr for the freedom and liberation of mankind from darkness. It makes ssnes for Daenerys to end up in the Nissa Nissa role. Daenerys is not just the Mother of Dragons, Daenerys IS the Dragon. She says this constantly, however the 3 dragons are the red herring to distract us from seeing the truth of Daenerys being the Dragon who saves man, through her self sacrifice. daenerys dragon fire, her dragon blood, her DRAGON HEART is the heart of fire, the fire which the sword Dawn will be plunged into and when it is pulled from her dragon heart of dragon fire and dragon blood, it will transform into the glowing red sword, the sword the color of blood and flames and sunsets \u2026. the wording and colors GRRM uses to describe dragon flams.
