            "answer_text": "According to Pulitzer they are, since a literary prize was awarded to the graphic novel Maus. According to plenty of universities, they are, since there are literature courses taught about comics. According to TIME Magazine's list of the greatest novels of all time, they are, since Watchmen is on that list. Those are not meant as merely appeals to authority -- the point is that the view of comics as literature is not some wild and crazy, obscure fanboy sentiment, contrary to the false assertions that some have made in that regard. There is plenty of valid, intelligent, informed debate about comics as literature, and the definitions of literature are broad enough to allow different opinions on the matter, so the idea that there's so clear \"definition\" and \"boundaries\" of what kinds of textual writings of storytelling are or aren't allowed is a fantasy. Reasonable, informed people can and do disagree on the matter, is the point, and while I can and do make the argument that yes, comics are literature, I don't say that those who prefer a more narrow definition of \"literature\" are objectively demonstrably \"wrong.\" And I think of course that there's a very valid argument that SOME -- plenty, in fact -- comics are not literature. Some comics, for example, don't have any text at all, and are merely images and artwork. Some have very little writing, to the point they can be understood without the words. And I'd say that a book of artwork is not \"literature\" and so such comics are not in my opinion \"literature.\" But a lot of comics ARE literature. Some comics in fact are dominated by text, and even include large portions that are strictly text. Those who are just uninformed about the modern nature of comics probably lack knowledge about such things, and so don't understand the issue fully. But it's a fact that comics like Watchmen for example are probably 25% or more text, often pure text only on many pages. I believe literature has evolved over time -- and that's a belief backed up by the evidence. The earliest literature was carved or pressed shapes into blocks, mud, or other substances. Some literature consisted of poems carved or pressed onto palm leaf strips. Literature changed as more evolved written language developed, and as format and medium for presenting the work evolved and improved. We have literature filled with painting and artwork, we have books on handheld electronic devices, we have books with interactive text that you can touch and pull up more information or definitions or translations, and so on. Can it be true that the nature of literature, how it is written and presented and the formats, can all evolve from one form to another that seems entirely different alongside the first, but that if it has too many drawings it suddenly can't possibly be literature anymore? Does a palm leaf with pressed symbols for a poem have more in common, classification-wise, with a modern electronic illustrated novel on your Kindle than Watchmen has with that novel? One can make the argument that yes, a poem written in ancient limited symbols on a leaf is more like an illustrated novel than Watchmen is, but it's going to be a rather hard argument to make. Consider other art forms -- music or painting, for example. Have you ever seen a painter create work with oils on a canvass? Have you ever seen another painter create work on a wall with acrylics? Have you ever seen another painter create work on a piece of furniture using blood and oil? One painter uses a brush, one a wooden stick from a tree. How about musicians, would you claim that a singer of opera and a piano player aren't both creating music? I think that, in my own opinion obviously, literature is an art form in which textual writing is telling a story within certain frameworks for presenting the information. I think that yes, words are necessary. They are, I feel, the \"sound\" in music, for comparison -- a piano and a singer both create melody with sound, which is the language of the art form. Literature uses words, text, in a similar way. Some literature includes imagery to accentuate the words, just as some music uses instruments to alter and enhance the tune and melody. Literature is not, however, merely the words and a story, because framework matters as well, otherwise medium becomes lost in the art form. It's not just about a surface medium, since a wall could be a surface as well as a page or a Kindle screen or a palm leaf. The point of medium is context for experiencing the written word within a contained format, something requiring you to engage the text in a certain way in order to understand the story being conveyed. Some people prefer to say that some kinds of books don't count as literature -- a \"Computers For Dummies\" guide, for example, is not literature in the eyes of some, but is literature in the eyes of others. That's a separate debate, but it's a valid one that has a lot of people on either side, and the point is that differences of opinion exist precisely because the meaning and boundaries of literature are not set in stone or so narrow as to include only the books your English professor made you read. Classifications matter because they help us identify and understand things better. It isn't valid or helpful to say a glass of milk is literature, but it's also not valid or helpful to say that only one narrow definition can possibly exist and all others are invalid. There's room in between, and within that area lies my own definition of literature and that of many others with perfectly reasonable, valid considerations for why some comics are literature. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cLiterature\u201d is a tricky word in the same way that the word \u201cart\u201d is tricky, because some people believe that calling something literature is an assignment of high value as opposed to just an assignment of an intellectual category. I believe that we should use the word literature only as an objectively defined intellectual category, so there is no value judgement attached to what we call literature and non-literature - only objective criteria. This is not to say and that we should not evaluate individual examples of literature and call them either good or bad according to our personal tastes and experience with different qualities of literature. But as I said, it does mean that we shouldn\u2019t use the category literature as synonymous with quality. My reason for prefering to treat literature this way is that I have democratic values. Calling something non-literature (when what you actually mean is \u201cbad literature according to your standards\u201d) implies that you think anything you don\u2019t like should be banned, and contrary to that, I believe in complete freedom of speech, which means that all kinds of written materials should be legal to publish, so they can be discussed openly in society. The guardians of \u201cgood taste\u201d can guide us in our choices, but they should never be allowed to keep us from making up our own minds about what it is worth reading, in the way that totalitarian regimes try to do. So what is literature - objectively speaking? It is any intentional composition of sequentially written symbolic signs (letters, words, sentences etc.) designed to pass on meaning, whether it be in the form of fiction or non-fiction. By this definition, even a shopping list is literature, which may sound odd to some. But as I said, I think it is important that we use the word literature in a totally objective, unbiased and unpretentious way. And now we come to the big question: Are comic books literature? Comic books are a combination of static visual art (the pictures) and literature (the words) and as such, they can be seen both as a subcategory of static visual art and a subcategory of literature. So generally speaking, yes, comic books are literature. But what about when the comic book has no words in it? Does it then stop being literature and become purely static visual art? I think giving an answer to that question requires us to understand exactly what literature is on a slightly deeper level. If we look at the individual letters of a word, we can see that each of them is a tiny picture with a certain meaning, that is, a sign that symbolizes a sound in the spoken language. But we also realize quickly that each letter can symbolize different sounds depending on which place it occupies in a word, and that each word can symbolize different meanings depending on which sentence it appears in. And so on and on it goes. The longer the text is, the more we rely on our most basic understanding of literature, which is that texts consist of tiny, simple pictures/signs, that can be put together to form increasingly more complex sequences of contextual meaning - for instance a storyline, a poetic experience or an explanation of a phenomenon. Sometimes these sequences present their meaning in a very straightforward way as in school textbooks and sometimes they present their meaning in a looser, more metaphorical way as in poetry, which leaves room for a more personal experience of the meaning of the words. But if the pictures in the wordless comic book are arranged in the usual, sequential way of comic books and the book can be \u201cread\u201c a story, a poetic experience or something similar, I would argue that it is indeed a form of literature, because then the pictures take on the same role as the letters and words. They become the symbolic signs we string together to form complex sequences of contextual meaning. Consequently, if the pictures in the wordless comic book cannot be read as a sequence, it is no longer a piece of literature and also not a comic book, because I believe we must maintain the definition of a comic book that says that it is a combination of static visual art and literature, if it is to have any meaning as an intellectual category (if you can offer a good counterargument to this point, I would be very interested to read it). Once again, I should stress the point that when I deem the wordless \u201ccomic book\u201d, that cannot be read as a piece of litterature, to be a piece of non-literature and a non-comic book, I am not making a value judgement. I am simply saying that this type of work belongs in a different intellectual category. You could say that in this case, it would be more correct to call it an abstract piece of static visual art that uses the aesthetics of the comic book, but is not a comic book and not literature, because it does not use this aesthetic as part of a language that expresses something akin to a discernable intended meaning. It choses to remain obscure. I suppose there are those, who would argue that even under these circumstances it is still a comic book and literature, because the creator of it clearly intended it to be a piece of obscure literature, perhaps to make some kind of ironic, anarchic or nihilistic comment on the futility of trying to make something meaningful. But I would argue that once you as comic book creator abandon the objective of creating meaning, you also abandon the area of comic books and literature and move into an area of art, we could call anti-literature or perhaps meta-art - art that does not express anything in itself, but has a kind of meta-meaning by virtue of being percieved as the antithesis to something - a rebellion against the norm. So to get back on track, the comic book is by definition in a shared subcategory of both static visual art and literature, and therefore, a work that is not in both categories cannot be considered to be a comic book. Static visual art can be used in many ways, but when it is used in a comic book it must serve the literary purpose of the comic book, either by supporting and deepening the meaning of the words or by completely replacing the words and playing their traditional role in literature. Words can express the details of a point of the plot with more precision, but pictures do a better job of showing actions and evoking emotions, and in works that are more emotion driven than plot driven, you may only need the pictures to fulfill the literary ambitions of the comic book.

            "answer_text": "\"Literature\" constitutes all written fiction, and comics absolutely meet that criteria. (Some people in their answers are interpreting 'literature' to mean 'literary fiction,' which is essentially a genre. It's not. Literature is a corpus.) However, Comics are also visual art/fine art/illustration. So the answer is actually kind of muddled. Plays are considered literature, though they're made up of dialogue and stage direction, though individual performances aren't considered literature. Movies, Television Shows and Audio Dramas aren't usually considered 'plays' but of course they are, and their scripts would certainly fall under literature as well. By that criteria, a comic book script (dialogue, 'stage directions' to the artist) would constitute literature, and if those scripts are published separately (and many have been) then I would say they're literature without question. However, a finished comic book is less like a play's script and more like a play's performance -- albeit a static one. It's a full execution of that script, which has also been interpreted and altered by the artist by necessity. It is undoubtedly art, but a different artist could take the same script and produce a completely different comic sheerly by dint of artistic vision, perspective and interpretation of the writer's text. So, are comic books themselves literature? No. They're art that fuses illustration and text into a medium. But a script of that comic book (even one created after the fact) would be literature, the same as a play. ",

            "answer_text": "Comics are not literature. They are more than that. Because I define literature literally (ha), according to its etymology (\"writing formed with letters\"), I think this question is like asking \"Are movies music?\" Yes, comics can share the medium of literature (and even include bits of it), but they are necessarily more than that, as the form of comics is defined by the use of drawn images in conjunction with written words.  Saying that \"comics are not literature\" sounds derogatory, but that's only because of our underlying cultural conception of the term \"literature,\" which understands it generally as those printed works that have artistic value and cultural significance. This is inherently positive, which is why we don't talk about \"good literature\" or \"bad literature,\" but are more inclined to say something \"is literature\" or is not. Because of the unwieldy nature of the term, I've found it easier to approach this question under different phrasing: \"Are comic books literary?\" And, just like asking 'Are movies musical?', the answer becomes pretty obvious: \"Some are, some are not.\" The question becomes one of description, rather than of evaluation.

            "answer_text": "The concept of literature is ultimately a value judgement just as the concept of \u2018art' is. You might as well ask whether comics are good or not. The answer is some are good and some are not - just like anything else. There are a number of strategies used to turn the concept of literature into a hermetic cult that priveledges whatever has been deemed worthy of study. These tend to depend upon claims that it is not a value judgement but rather a particular type of writing - it should be pretty obvious to most observers that this is a lie. The canon exists for a useful reason but concepts like literature have a tendency towards incestuousness and self serving elitism. Priveledging things because they reference, or situate themselves in, the tradition of the Western Canon and not priveledging things that don't is pretty obvious in this regard. It has more to do with the politics of funding the humanities in our universities than with the worth of the works that are included or excluded. To be frank the very concept of excluding an entire medium from being \u2018literature' or \u2018art' is an absurdity. The question should be whether there are comics that are worthy of your time. To which the answer is: yes of course there are. ",

Literature is SOLELY based in the Written art form. Comic books are based in the Sequential Art art form, which uses primarily images to tell it's story. Word bubbles and dialog notations are used, but rarely do they break the 4th wall. The closest youd get to a genuine comparison is if you had one picture of a person on the first page. with a word bubble coming from them that encompassed the rest of the pages with only text. That be the CLOSEST comparsion you could make because at that point the story itself would not be accompanied by any further images. I recommended this in a previous answer, but I cant stress this enough : Read SCOTT MCLEOD'S UNDERSTANDING COMICS It is an amazing book and you'll fastly see why the two art forms are not the same. Hope that helped. IG: welsed ",

Most of the answers given already are answering the question \"Are comic books works of art\" to which I fully support all the answers given. However,  what makes comic books a unique genre is that they are a synthesis of words and pictures.  Literature is the art of written work (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature).  In a fully realized comic book, in which the words and images are matched to create a work of art, the 'written work' does not (and in my opinion should not) stand on its own, but unifies with the pictures to create something wholly new.  Who am I to argue with the Pulitzer committee.  I guess I'd just say that I'd prefer to see a distinct category. ",

We do not have lofty standards like we used to, as when the Romantics pined for emotion and the New Critics for organic unity. Rather than paying attention to the content of the work--if it is well-written, &c.--the study and identification of literature comes from understanding how people engage in this written material.  Questions which seek to conflate the word \"literature\" to mean something written + its innate value are therefore now questions which are irrelevant, and in fact betray a sort of backward thinking that express that unless a work reflects certain values (which are very often suspiciously like the values imposed upon colonies by imperial powers, from Rome's hellenistic ideals to Europe's conservatism to America's liberalism and neo-liberalism, and so on) it cannot be considered among the objects we designate \"art.\" So comic books are literature. What matters is how you engage in them, not in what they are. ",
