            "answer_text": "Oh man, I feel sorry for you if you try going in the direction of thinking that trend line \"analysis\" will help at all. \"Investing\" is worlds apart from technical analysis. Do not be fooled by people like the other respondent who claim to know what they are doing but almost certainly do not. If you want to know what really works, study the people who have made real money. There are two sets of people: Quants, who typically have PhD's in math - and Investors, who typically have a very solid understanding of economics and corporate finance. Both require a pretty serious toolkit in order to play effectively, but that is how the real money is made in this. I could give you more backup for this and explain why this is the credible answer, but just do yourself a favor and trust me in this. Unfortunately, it is not the \"easy\" answer - but making outsized returns in any market isn't easy. Fortunately, the skills developed along the way are pretty transferable and so you don't need to get to Warren Buffett skill or brains in order to significantly benefit from the learnings. My advice: - Study for the CFA.. it is a good set of financial frameworks and will give a tangible goal- Read Michael Porter's Competitive Strategy to get a better understanding for the different drivers of businesses- Read the write ups on Value Investor Club to understand how an investment thesis is formed- Then spend the next few years reading every other book on valuation and investments that you can get your hands on You will read a lot of crappy books along the way. But relatively speaking, given how much reading is typically required in order to be a good investor the time spend learning from these books is minuscule. The hardest part is finding the motivation. Do some research on the compensation differences between CFA holders and your average person on the street and maybe that will help. Read some books about Julian Robertson or George Soros or read Barbarians at the Gate if you want more intellectually-driven motivation. I don't know why you wouldn't want to trust me on this. The effort involved also sheds a huge amount of illumination of how the world around you works. It is a vast ocean if insights for those who are truly curious and interetested. But get past the idea that there is quick money to be made. That is just going to take you in a counterproductive direction. Roll up your sleeves and do the hard work needed to get there. There are no shortcuts. ",

            "answer_text": "You can always start at the beginning, Technical Analysis by Edwards and McGee, (Technical Analysis of Stock Trends by Robert D. Edwards and John Magee: Robert Edwards, John Magee: 9781607962236: Amazon.com: Books) and Technical Analysis A to Z (Technical Analysis from A to Z, 2nd Edition: Steven Achelis: 9780071826297: Amazon.com: Books).  If you're starting be careful of Technical Analysis. Most of the people who try to sell you products work on a historic basis not a forward looking basis. Basically they tell you that it happened like this in the past so they'll know what to do in the future. When it comes to forward looking (ie from today), some of them can be worse than chance. I would strongly recomend that you set up a practice account (without using real money) and practice in that account. You'll quickly find out if you're good or not. You can setup an account with Yahoo Finance, Google Finance or any number of other services. This way if things do not work out you did not risk any real money. At the very least you get to practice. My adice is to setup 2 portfolios, one set and forget (your base case) and one where you practice. In my case, my set and forget has outperformed many of my strategies.  Best of luck. ",
