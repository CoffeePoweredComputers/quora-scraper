            "answer_text": "Its quite enough. But after that you should practice previous year IIT JEE Questions also. This is what we recommend: JEE Maths: Start with NCERT, RD. Then go ahead with A Das Gupta, MCQ in Maths, Advanced Problems in JEE (Balaji) and then previous year questions from Arihant 39 years !etc More books of Arihant and GRB can be used if needed. Practice previous year IIT JEE questions MANY TIMES (You can use Arihant 39 years for that ! ) . Become perfect in them. Solve other people\u2019s doubts. These will help you score better :). People run after so many modules and crap test series. Instead you should focus on limited material and do it more number of times !! Many questions ask only basic concepts but a good clarity in them. Self study is definitely most important. But coaching really helps you score more Best Wishes  ",

Best book can be varied according to the time you have for preparing and also the current level of your preparation. If you want a detailed book with concepts as well as problems, try cengage books by G TIWANI but if you have all your concepts clear, try new pattern iit maths by SK GOYAL. It only contains questions of higher level. Also, don't forget to do the previous year questions of IITJEE as they are quite helpful. Enjoy preparing. Best of luck\u2026 ",
