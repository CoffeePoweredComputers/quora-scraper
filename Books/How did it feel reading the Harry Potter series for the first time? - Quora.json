            "answer_text": "PS isn't a particularly challenging book, for an adult reader, and I only started it because I was curious. I was given 1-6 by my middle childs best friends Mum. She's *very* religious. Very. Like, she prays at the drop of a hat, and is convinced god is helping her when she finds her lost keys. \u201cBlessed\" was a common word. \u201cIn Gods hands\" was also frequent. Obviously, she thought they were satanic. Clearly we were already beyond redemption, as atheist pagans lol. We also got all 6 of The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel. Excellent stuff. I enjoyed those, too. Back to PS. I was curious, so cracked it open in the late afternoon, and finished it later that night. It was an immersive experience. JKR might be a bit loose when it comes to plot, and it's holes, but she\u2019s great at setting a scene. I wanted to know what happened next, and it was a relief that the books didn't stay \u201ckiddy\" as the kids got older. Obviously, I had to head down to the shops at the end of that week, to buy DH myself. ",

            "answer_text": "I was bloody annoyed! All my friends were obsessed with it and I was at that age and of that mindset where I resisted trying anything that the majority of my peers were into, simply because I liked being contrary and \u201cdifferent\u201d. Eventually, to get my friends to stop nagging me, I agreed to read the first book with the understanding that if (when) I didn\u2019t like it, they had to go a whole week without quoting it. Much to my chagrin, I was hooked by the end of the first chapter. ",
