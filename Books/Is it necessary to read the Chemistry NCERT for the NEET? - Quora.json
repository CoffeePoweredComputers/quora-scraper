            "answer_text": "No it isn't. The focus of the questions in the exam is not on the theory that'd be required for a board exam. This exam requires practise and its better to rely on Coaching modules and/or notes for theory and solving questions for practise. Even if you want to read NCERT, read NCERT Chemistry Class 12th. Do not touch 11th NCERT unless you want to waste your time. But if you're pressed for time bypassing NCERT is your best bet. Hope this helps. ",
