            "answer_text": "Game of Thrones is a fantasy series. Harry Potter is a fantasy series. These two literary series have massive appeal across generations, sexes, ethnicities, and sexual preferences. No, reading fantasy is not gay.As for your brother... I suspect that he is one of three things:1. Ignorant. I don't know anything else about him aside from what you describe, but I'll keep it light and just go with ignorant.2. Young. He just doesn't have any self awareness or empathy towards others, yet. As such he says things like this because he hears other people say it and just thinks that it is okay. This would also fall under ignorance. Good news: he can change as he gets older and learns how words affect others and in turn how they affect him. (fingers crossed for you that this happens)3. Your brother has no imagination. This is possibly the saddest of the three as he'll be forced into a life of conformity. He'll choose it because that is all he will know and accept.He'll never realize the wonder of escaping into far flung places that only he can see in his mind. He'll never know the joy of meeting somebody else that geeks out over building an entire world that he dreamed about, planned out, and spent hours making it just right. Chances are he'll never wake up face down in anything other than a text book because he just couldn't go to sleep without knowing what happened next.Keep reading. Fill your mind with impossible ideas. Keep imagining. The world needs more people like you. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was about 14 me and my circle of friends used to use the word \"gay\" with that exact definition.  If I remember correctly, we used it as a descriptive word for anything that we weren't into. Back then I was into hip-hop, so - naturally - teachers that liked classical, jazz, etc, were \"gay\". And no one ever stopped to think \"hold on, that teacher is married\", so, even though we used the word \"gay\", it became so natural that the homosexual meaning was almost gone. Around the age of 16-17, after leaving school, I completely changed. My music tastes, my close sense and I was a bit more sure of myself.  My brother then started doing the same thing as your brother is doing to you. I just laughed.  One day, I was in a great mood, and I wanted to mess with him. After he said it, I didn't tell him to \"piss off\" but asked him to \"come here. Close the door.\" Then I acted as if it was hard for me to say it, \"I beg you don't tell mum and dad... .\" That's when his body language changed, and I started telling him that I was gay and that I knew about it for few months, that I can't sleep at night.  When my brother is about to cry his nostrils flare. I really wanted to milk it, but I couldn't be bothered to have to explain the joke to my parents. So I said. \"And the bitch of it is, the boy that I want to be with is ... you!\" then I couldn't help my self from laughing.  After he got the joke, he said \"F* off you gay boy\". You can't really do anything about it, just don't take it seriously, and believe me, if you can pull it off, it is well worth shocking his socks off Just in case that doesn't answer the question. No. Reading fantasy, or anything for that matter, is not gay.  -------- Stephen Fry says:  If you are physically bullied the best thing to say is \"no, no no, don't do that, you'll give me an erection\" ",
