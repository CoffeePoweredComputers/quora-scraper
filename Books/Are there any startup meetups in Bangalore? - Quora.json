            "answer_text": "You can check out Meetup - We are what we do, Eventbrite, Townscript - Upcoming Events in Tickets Today, This Weekend & Month, and Eventshigh - Events & Activities in Bangalore, Today, This Weekend and Upcoming - Events High for regular event updates. These are the good ones. Apart from these, you can also check out some startup communities and event organizers like Pushstart, and Main Home - HelloMeets. I check out these sites every Tuesday to pick out the event for the week. I have been attending events regularly for the last 3+ years. The no of events happening had increased to a large extent over the last 12 months. It's always important to qualify the events that you attend. The objective should be very clear about why and what event you want to attend. Over the years I have tried and validated events to some extent and attend only those that I feel might be valuable in terms of both learning and networking. I had to find those by attending each and every event that comes my way for months. Now I just pick and choose just 2/3 events that I need to attend in a month. Some of the metrics I use are as follows: If the event is happening in a coworking space, especially the premium ones\u2019 the chances of a large gathering is very high - good for networkingBe careful with the topic of the event - that way you can understand what type of audience will be attending as well as the knowledge that you can gather from the event apart from networkingCheck out the speakers and their qualification - you can learn from their experience as well as an opportunity to be connected with themPaid events are really good, - But need to be qualified based on the organizer, speakers, topic and the venue.Hope this will be useful for you to get started. All the very best. ",
