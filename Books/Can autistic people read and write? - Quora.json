            "answer_text": "Most of us can. The ones that generally cannot are considered level-3's, or autistics that need constant support. Many of these types are also known to be nonverbal. I started reading at 3. Due to the fact that I also have cerebral palsy, I had difficulty with handwriting for many years, but since learning cursive in 3rd grade have been told I have \u201cbeautiful and legible penmanship\u201d. I actually prefer to write in script, even though many younger people cannot read it (that is the failure of our education system in my opinion, however\u2026.thankfully, my autistic 14-year old can; he's been exposed to my cursive writing since he was 5). I was tackling books by Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, and some psychology books by age 7. Astronomy was my topic of choice; I read James Mischner's \u201cSpace\" before I was 10. I was reading at a college level before high school. As for my writing style, I have been known to make a few mistakes, often writing exactly how I think. When I have to write something in a specific format or given style, I am fully capable of doing so. My scores on tests in school for writing, spelling, and reading were always in the top 1\u20135%. I was trained at a young age on how to write formal business documents including resumes and contracts (I even wrote and filed my own divorce papers with the State of Texas under the supervision of an attorney). I hope this answers this question appropriately. ",

Nothing about autism requires that an autistic person cannot speak, hear, read or write. Some autistic people have no or poor language skills, but some actually have precocious speech and precocious reading and writing. I know of one autistic person who taught themselves to read before they started school: their mother sounded out the letters to them, and they then worked through a story book they knew well, until they could read fluently. Autistic people tend to have unusual language in some way, but that can take many forms: too much, too little, very loud, very soft, very uneven, very wordy, very self-centred, very oblivious to the give and take of \u201ctypical\u201d conversation. For some autistic people it means no speech at all. We are all different. ",

            "answer_text": "Only a small percentage of autistic people cannot read and write. They are generally people with intellectual disability alongside the autism. The percentage is slightly higher in the autistic population than in the general population because the incidence of intellectual disability is slightly higher (there are many forms of autism and some, like fragile x, have higher rates of intellectual disability). It is not autism that prevents someone learning to read and write. Non-verbal people can learn to read and write, even those who cannot hold a pen can learn to use a computer to write. I personally know many more illiterate neurotypical people than autistic and I know more autistic people than most people. ",
