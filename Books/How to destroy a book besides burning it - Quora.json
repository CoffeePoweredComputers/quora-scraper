            "answer_text": "Here are some other ways: Put it in a blender and turn it on. That way, the book will be shredded, or you can just put it in a shredder as well, but it depends on the materials the book is made of.Feed it to your local goat or similar creature. They would eat it all up.Dip it in bleach or black tar. That way, no one could read it.Chop it all up and put it in water. Then add some Koolaid and mix it. Finally, pour it into something that won\u2019t get you in trouble.Rip the pages of the book, and use it to make a pinata. Discard the cover, or reuse it for some other project.Send the book into a black hole. It would take a while, but once it\u2019s entered the event horizon, it\u2019s gone forever.Punch holes into it. Eventually, it would look like a mess.Rip the pages out. Simple as that.Crush it with critical force, with a machine. No one would read a flatted book, right?Blow it up in a contained area. It\u2019ll become a mess.Or, instead of destroying a book, if you want to get rid of a book, you can always donate it to your local library, or selling it. That is if it doesn\u2019t contain any of your personal information. But this question asked for this, so, I hope you find these methods helpful. ",
