            "answer_text": "Yes, you can in fact look at these statistics, These are the highest paying jobs in the U.S. These are the 25 best-paying jobs in America in 2019, according to US News & World Report Doctors are among the highest payed salary workers, rightly so they do a great job! But lets take a deeper look at the American debt level. It is not just for the lower to medium earners, in fact its quite correlated to salary, and by profession Doctors are the most indebt, I know they have a lot of student loans, but with an average in come of $200,000 this could be paid off with in a few years if budget right. Consumer Debt Statistics & Demographics in America. Its states that those higher earners are in more debt. Why? They spend more, most western countries have come victim of the consumer lifestyle that is they want the nice car, the big house and all the trimming that come with it. When is it enough. So, is it possible to become rich on a low income? Well, let define what a low income is? The U.S states that the medium house hold income is $60,000 Here\u2019s how much the average American earns at every age. A low income would be below $50,000 per household. A quote by Rich Dad poor Dad once said \u201cits not about how much you make but how much you keep\u201d So, is it possible to do become rich on a low income? Well define what you call rich, but according to definition rich person - a person who possesses great material wealth. So, from a numerical point of view it hard to classify. But a high net worth person is defined as anyone has disponible assets of over $1 million.  Is this possible for a low income person. Well yes. Save, this is dependent on your age.  If you are younger, you need to save and use the compound interest. The good news is that you don\u2019t need to be Warren Buffet and average results and simple makes use. If you are 30 years old earning a lower than average income in the U.S say for the sake of simplicity $2000 a month. You save 10% of this a month (Millionaires save 20%). This is $200 a month you invest this is the S and P 500 using dollar cost averaging at 7% (less than what it has historically done).  This over 35 year period $260,348.06 interest just from ending at $344,348.06. This is you have only put in $84,000. This alone will put you in the top 5% of savers in the U.S. Just from saving 10% of $2000 a month. So, what other options do you have say you manage over 4 years to save a yearly income of $24,000 and invest for the sake of simplify 30 years ago in the S and P.  This would be now worth $336,480. If this was then added to the compounded interest it would equate to near $1 million. (I am fully aware that history show no point into the future but is used as a point of demonstration).  So, how do you do this? Live below your means, most people spend on items they don\u2019t need and have no value to their lives. Cut this out and you can start to save. Invest long term and make little changes. Use compound interest. If you can start saving young. https://investmentsforexpats.com/reforming-savings-plans-at-investments-for-expats/ ",

Some leave high-income careers like engineering or medicine to invest. Most don\u2019t hit the very wealthy part, though. It\u2019s mostly people who own companies, invest lots of money that they\u2019ve already made, or do something highly creative that disrupts art or technology.

So, you do not need to have a top salary job, but a project or skill that is valuable like software development or an athletic talent helps a lot. ",
