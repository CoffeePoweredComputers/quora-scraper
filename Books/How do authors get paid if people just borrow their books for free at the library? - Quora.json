            "answer_text": "Most readers don\u2019t rely on the public library because of the restrictions placed on borrowing the books. New or popular books are frequently unavailable and time limits apply. Shopping the used bookstore offers a moderate price for the freedom of owning the book, but readers have better success finding the specific titles they want by buying new. Payment for new books does not go directly to the author. There are a lot of people involved in the creation and distribution of the book, and each person needs their cut. The publisher typically pays the author an advance upon purchase of the rights to publish the book. Then they pay editors, formatters, illustrators, and the printing press up front for their services. Once they have turned a single manuscript in PDF into a few thousand copies of a professionally produced book, they sell those copies to various bookstores. Some stores order three copies because they have limited shelf and storage space and don\u2019t expect to move them quickly. Others order dozens, even scores at a time because they have the space and/or they anticipate selling high volumes. When those stores run out of copies they either reorder or buy something else, depending on how they think the market is going to act. If the publisher runs out of copies they order another printing from the press or just let it disappear, again depending on how likely they believe future sales will occur. Unsold copies are marked down at a loss, given away, or simply destroyed to make space for more lucrative investments. In all of this, authors are only given a small percentage of the sale for each new book, and nothing from second hand sales. They don\u2019t see anything until that small percentage has equaled their advance, and they must share their percentage with their agent. The publisher has to recoup their losses, and the store has its own overheads to account for. No matter where you fall in it, the publishing industry is a tough one to make money in. That\u2019s why a lot of people do it primarily out of love, and simply hope to earn enough to pay the bills. ",

            "answer_text": "Authors get paid by people buying their books. Buying books A lot of people don't borrow it from the library as they want their own copy or don't like to borrow it from the library. If I like a book so much I want to read it whenever I want, I don't want to end up in the library and seeing the book isn't there because someone else borrowed it. For some particular authors I know I want to have the book on my shelf, so I buy them. No need to borrow them if I can buy them, right? Library The people who go to the library are people who either don't have the money to buy all these books or who want to read books without paying for them as they don't know if they like the book well enough to buy. It's a good way to sample a few authors as well to see if you like their books. Of course a library doesn't actually conjure these books out of thin air. They actually have to buy them. That can be financed by the subscription you pay for being a member. Authors Of course authors get also paid a sum upon it getting accepted for publication, but they're supposed to earn the majority of their income by means of a percentage of every book sold. That includes books being bought by libraries but also every individual who buys a copy. It's not a lot \u2014 you generally get only a small percentage per book, as the publisher needs to make a profit as well, but if you sell ten thousand copies you still end up with a few hundred bucks as royalties, perhaps even as much as a thousand if they're hardcovers and therefore more expensive to buy. I hope that answered your question somewhat. ",
