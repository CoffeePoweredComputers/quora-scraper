            "answer_text": "The way you start learning Japanese (presumably self-learning) is by first developing a plan. Not just a plan where you become generally \"fluent\", but something measurable. If you've ever procrastinated on a deadline until the last minute, then you've probably experienced Parkinson's Law. You'll find a way to divide up all the work between now and the deadline. Got a few hours? You'll haul ass. Got until the end of the month? Somehow you'll always food a reason to put out off. If you're staying from the beginning, you have a week to fully memorize hiragana. Another week to get katakana. A week is arbitrary, but don't underestimate yourself! Don't give yourself a month. The same applies for everything else, but you'll have too be more creative with your goals. Maybe you could allocate yourself two weeks to learn all of the N5 kanji. Kanji gets easier to acquire as you more and more, but you are in for a difficult time with the first few dozens. It's easy to focus on something concrete like the characters, but remember that they are there for a reason: consumption! As soon as you can, start consuming Japanese media. Start with the simplified NHK Web Easy stories. Move onto Terrace House and Samurai Gourmet on Netflix. Read annotated Japanese books with side-by-side English translations. Immediately start with the Japanese subtitles and guess what they're saying, then go back and see if you were right. Find a native person to talk to. Don't get too caught up on learning as much as you can, focus on the goals that you set for yourself. Quantifiable results can be measured, and you'll sooner learn about how fast you can learn by testing out different amounts of things to learn. I think that the Internet provides a bevy of resources and curation of these resources that will help you discover some great stuff you may not have known about before. My current goal is to be able to read a full page of a Japanese novel and know what happened, only needing to refer to the dictionary 10 times. It was originally 5, but I quickly learned that my vocabulary and grammar were not up to snuff\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Learning kana (hiragana and katakana) is an excellent first step, and can be very rewarding when simple Japanese phrases and writing especially in pop culture suddenly become readable.  But I know how this will pan out - finding a hiragana/katakana chart on Google, and then trying to memorize the characters purely from rote and practice - and it will be frustrating, and neither effective nor enjoyable. In my early days of Japanese language mania back in middle and high school, I attempted to learn kana from these charts on at least 4 different occasions over 4-5 years; but despite samurai-style pain and perseverance I never succeeded beyond being able to write them on demand - I could never recognize them quickly enough for practical use. I only became a fairly effective Japanese speaker and writer after 2-3 years of incredibly intensive college-level study and a short stint in Japan. That said, while you begin to discover your love and passion for both the language and culture and then ponder possibilities for full-time study in the future, I would strongly encourage you to get started on your own. Using a textbook is critical in setting up an effective, rigorous and entertaining routine for learning the language and monitoring your progress. I passionately recommend the \"Genki\" series of textbooks and workbooks (http://www.amazon.com/Genki-Integrated-Elementary-Japanese-English/dp/4789009637), which is recognized as one of the best beginner platforms and is used almost universally in colleges across the United States. You don't need to buy the CD - here is a university resource containing all the recordings (http://www.ncsu.edu/project/japaneseonline/JpOnline.htm). Working through the book lessons (which are absolutely hilarious and incredibly effective) and listening religiously to the recordings will take you very, very far ahead on your own. After a few months you will be so hooked that you may no longer be content with your own efforts and begin searching for professional alternatives. I also recommend JapanesePod101.com (I swear I don't work for them!), which is probably the best Japanese learning podcast available. They recently started charging for a portion of their podcasts and study materials, but I believe that you can download virtually all of their earlier podcasts (which are the beginner and lower-intermediate portions, those you need the most) at no cost. The beginner podcasts are primarily in English, so they are a very friendly and entertaining first taste of both the language and cultural quirks that Japan is so well-known for. If you like good-looking Japanese men and women (admit it), then I recommend watching their television dramas, which are almost always a hoot, sometimes fantastic tearjerkers, and always positive motivation for language learning when things get tough and interest is running dry. You can watch many of these programs on free video-sharing sites such as mysoju.com, or if you want high-quality versions go to d-addicts.com. Leave a comment if you want specific recommendations! Dramas are a great way to listen to real-world practical Japanese. Some people like anime, which is loads of fun, but I don't recommend it for learning, because very casual Japanese bordering on rude/crude tends to be used, and you will pick up bad habits. For speaking practice, ask around if you or your friends have Japanese-speaking acquaintances, and try to set up lunch once a week during which you can practice. The most effective of these pairings is with a native Japanese speaker who might be needing practice in speaking English herself. Such 'conversation partner' arrangements are tremendous fun and can take you light years ahead in becoming conversant and just accumulating all-round confidence in using your new language. Just reading and listening is no good, wait till you get your first compliment from a Japanese person on your spoken Japanese!  Best of luck!!! I wish you success, and I hope you will experience not just the elegance of the language, but also the beauty of the country, and the hospitality and strength of her people. ",
