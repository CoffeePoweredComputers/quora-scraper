I won\u2019t really recommend you to look forward to joining Xavier\u2019s for B.com. Also, a big minus point is, that you will never be able to be a part of any fest or any other event that happens in the campus. If you are still keen, or want to know more, feel free to visit the office from 10:30\u201312:45. ",
