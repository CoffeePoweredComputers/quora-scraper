            "answer_text": "Hm\u2026.I\u2019d say that the best solution is to keep your phone or any form of social media away from you when you are studying. I only kept the important apps like my email, todo list, notes\u2026etc. I used app like Quire to remind me of my tasks for the day and keep track of my progress. Tasks management softwares like this can come in handy when you are trying to finish all of your projects. Hope this helps! ",
