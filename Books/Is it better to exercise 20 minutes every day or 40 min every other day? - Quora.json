            "answer_text": "Depending on where you are starting from and what your goals are this may vary. However - assuming you want to get in better shape or lose weight - the question you need to ask yourself is - what will my level of intensity be if I exercise 20min everyday versus 40 min every other day. If you can maintain a sufficiently high level of intensity (how hard you go) during a 40 min running workout - every other day may be better - as it allows your body to rest on the off days. However if you will essentially reduce your level of intensity during a 40 min workout - because you have not built up enough stamina and strength to run for a full 40 min - then a 20 min workout everyday might be better for the first 6 weeks or so. Many people engaged in a cardio based workout routine will reach a plateau and think they need to go from 10min on the treadmill (as an example) to now 15\u201320min on the treadmill. What happens though - is that in order to sustain the effort for those additional 5\u201310 minutes - their overall level of intensity dips - and the total output of the workout diminishes. So be honest with yourself and choose the plan that you\u2019ll be pushing yourself consistently when you do workout. ",

            "answer_text": "Daily exercise, whether for a short or long time is essential for good health. On average, you should aim for 30 minutes of low stamina exercise (e.g. walking, stretching or beginner\u2019s gymnastics) or 15 minutes of high stamina exercise (e.g. running, dancing or pool laps). The difference between the two is one makes your body produce more sweat than the other, increases heart rate and only needs to be done for 15 minutes as it burns the same amount of calories as a 30 minute low stamina exercise. (Note also that these exercises must be done continuously, breaks do NOT count as part of your exercise time. If you wish to take a 5 minute break, do so either halfway through your exercise time or at the end of it.) 20 minutes per day (including a break) is sufficient for high stamina exercise, but not low stamina exercise. And 40 minutes every 2 days is unhealthy for either low or high stamina exercise. Hope this helps :) ",
