Then take notes and skip four lines then tape record the class and transcribe what you missed into those four lines. Do your schoolwork and grade it like a test. Sort out the problems that you\u2019ve got right the first time and put them aside, the idea is you\u2019ll never miss them on a test. The remaining problems that you did miss make a smaller footprint target to review and to concentrate and focus on. Evaluate the body of missed problems if there are several that are basically the same Learning issue. This strategy reduces the footprint of the target remaining to master. ",
