In depends upon the state but most states I believe require you to at least have your bachelors degree done with 120 credit hours before you sit to take the CPA exam. W From personal experience though I would recommend getting your education done before sitting for the CPA exam. It is just easier to focus that way. Additionally, if you are looking for a CPA review course I personally used Roger CPA review and I cannot recommend them enough as they were instrumental in helping me pass the exam. ",
