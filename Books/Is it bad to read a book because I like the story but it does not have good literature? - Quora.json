            "answer_text": "Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to  be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only in  parts, others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read  wholly, and with diligence and attention.- Sir Francis Bacon There are different kinds of books. Some are written better than others, some make better sense than others, some are more enjoyable than others and so on. What you want to read is a question of personal choice. It may be because it is useful, entertaining, enlightening, or some other desirable quality. It is never bad to read any book. Books may be bad or good, but reading is never bad. At the worst case, you may thoroughly hate a book, in which case you gain a better understanding of your own tastes so that you know what to pick up in the future. ;D I have read Harry Potter series and I liked it - both the story and how it is written. I have read books with better stories and better written books. That does not mean that I regret reading HP. In fact I believe that reading HP series has helped be enjoy other fantasy books better. I haven't read Brida, so I don't know how good it is. But judging from the fact that it is written by Paolo Coelho, I get the feeling that it is written for an older demographic than Harry Potter. So the comparison between these two books may not exactly be fair. ",
