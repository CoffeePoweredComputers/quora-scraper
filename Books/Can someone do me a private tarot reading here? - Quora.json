            "answer_text": "As a clever person once said: It's hard to predict anything, especially about the future! The fortune teller, the medium, the psychic, the Tarot reader, etc, is very skilled people, who catch instinctively and with great skill the client's signals, through all the small-talk that occurs within the actual seance, where the \"reader\" with special words and phrases has enticed the client to say what \"the reader\" \"need to know about what the client wants for the seance. Think above this: If anyone was able to predict anything at all, the psycics, the fortune tellers, etc.. would of course bet on betting, and get very rich, instead of living on the relatively small amounts from the clients. If the client ask to money or death: Is the explanation generally: The spirits we contacts, always refuses to accept that I/we ask questions about money and death. But note: The somewhat strange result of a prediction said by a clairvoyant, or an astrologer, is incredible often, that a client, now more or less subconsciously, focuses all her/his energy on the prediction to come true. - - - The above as well as coincidences are the main reasons why people believe in predictions!

You've seen through the lies told to you and you'll break off that relationship. BS: Make that seen through the lies of psychics and fortunetellers and will end this experiment. ",

If you do this in the wind you might find the carrot will not stabilize. If you don\u2019t like the choice the magic carrot made, you pick the next closest outcome. If you don't like this carrot Tarot you could eat the carrot. The same trick works with an arrow as it rhymes with tarrow but the arrow is not edible. ",

If you don\u2019t have cards, you can have your cards dealt for you at facade.org or the Sacred Text Archive. Besides, do you really want to do this \u201cin public\u201d? ",
