            "answer_text": "Learn the principles of financial independence, and then do them. When you are financially independent, you will be able to make a good financial advisor. Until then, while you are still practicing and learning how to follow the four rules of investing skillfully, just answer beginner type questions on Quora. The way that I do. I don\u2019t know of any good books on becoming financially independent. My answers seem to be about the best advice out there, though other people obviously know FAR more than I ever will about how to actually make scads of money. My biggest obstacle is that I refuse to cheat people, or to steal their money. If I allowed myself those luxuries, then I would probably be rich already. My next biggest obstacle, is that I am still fairly ignorant. It might surprise you to know that there is rampant ignorance in the world surrounding financial matters. It is SO bad, that utter idiots routinely are awarded Nobel prizes for their supposed contributions to advancing human understanding in economics. Just today, my email from Merrill, (one of my brokerage accounts), contained advice to enhance income while nearing retirement. Among several articles on the topic, they ACTUALLY advised holding off on taking your Social Security benefit payment in order to get the 8% bigger benefit each year! This is an idiot move, for all but the most foolish people, who never do learn how to invest any of their money, but only spend it all on consumption. For everybody else, there are FAR, FAR more skillful things that you can do with your SSA benefit, starting right at age 62! To start your experiential learning path to financial independence, go and open a Roth IRA account at any conveniently located financial institution that doesn\u2019t ever charge you any fees on the account. Open it with the account minimum, and then never close the account. Simple. One step closer to financial independence! Do it today. If you haven\u2019t done it by the end of next week, then you should probably think about a different line of work, as you lack the ability to take significant action. ",
