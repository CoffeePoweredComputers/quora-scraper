If you want to play safe, get the land transferred in your name by way of gift deed made in your favour by your mother, get the Gift Deed registered with the Sub-Registrar of the district after paying the Stamp Duty applicable in the State for this transfer process. Thus after building the house on this piece of land you shall be sole owner of the property. ",
