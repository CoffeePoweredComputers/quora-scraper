            "answer_text": "Dopamine. You're constantly on your phone, eating high sugary food and doing no exercises. You're never forcing your brain outside of its comfort zone. If you're constantly using your phone/computer/drugs then you're constantly in a state of high dopamine. If you stop those activities and start to read, your brain becomes confused because this new activity does not provide high amount of dopamine with little to no work. Overcome it by cutting out those dopamine surges. Install apps to restrict phone usage. Uninstall apps (like qoura :)) that constantly keep you on the phone. make sure you turn off notifications as mucb as possible. You built a habit of picking up your phone etc.. when receiving a noti. Then after you reduced your phone and computer usage to only essential and stopped doing things that give you high unnatural amounts of dopamine like drugs or videos etc. you can start with the recovery phase. Recovery phase also known as dopamine detox is when you stirp away exercises unnecessary phone/computer/drug/alcohol etc\u2026usage. Your goal is to stay in this low state of dopamine also known as boredom - > boring for at least two days before you start to pick up a book again. Because you're stripped away from high dopamine stuff (remember how you applied phone restrictions with apps yea) and you spent some time in the low dopamine state also known as boredom, your brain will naturally grab the book because it is literally the only thing that provides medium amount of dopamine (you've to genuinely like the books topic, e. g you won't learn rocket science just by detoxing).

Otherwise you might try recorded books. I don\u2019t know how much expense is involved but you may be able to ger help from the school or some organization. Good luck. ",
