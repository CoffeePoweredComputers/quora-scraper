            "answer_text": "For every subject, you first need to build your sense of direction in your studies. That means you need to be constantly aware what are the topics you already know and what are the topics still require you to spend more time to study. In order to build your sense of direction in your studies, you need to study to understand, which provides for solid memories, rather than studying to remember/memorizing. Assuming you are still in school (though it can be applicable in college), this is what I will suggest you do Allocate a fixed time for homework and studying in each day. This will give you an idea on how much time you need each day to do both which makes you more organized.For each day, ideally before you g to bed, allocate 1 hour to finish your homework and the next hour doing some short revisions from what you learned during school.The short revisions include writing some short notes of what you know and what you still need to learn from today\u2019s lessons.In the final 5 minutes of that one hour revision session, you do a reflection on what you have learn in all your lesson today. This meaning making a summary of what you have learned today and what you still need to learn or not sure or seek help from the teacher on the next day.By doing a reflection, you get a clear idea of what you know and don\u2019t know which then gives you direction on what you need to learn in school. This will naturally give you a sense of purpose in studying and studying as well as keeping you engaged in your study session. Thus, you will naturally have the motivation to keep learning and studying.During the weekends (or any full day), allocate a 2 or 3 hour study session, with a 15 minutes break in between, on each weekend for a study session. The most ideal time to do this is in the morning when you just had your breakfast. In the last 15 minutes of each study session, you also do a reflection on what you have learned and what you still need to improve on. This will give you a sense of direction on what you still need to learn in class for the next week. If you repeat this step, you will realized you are studying more efficiently by constantly focus on improvement. You may add one more 3 hour study session on a full day if you do not have anything else on. All this allows you to study efficiently and still have time to have fun and have a good night sleep See Timothy Soo's answer to How do top students study? ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some thoughts that might help you. They revolve around making effective use of your time and making progress even when you\u2019re not in the right frame of mind. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one \u201cright way\u201d. These tips might help you find the right way for you and techniques to help you be productive even when it\u2019s a struggle. Allocate more time to your weaker subjects Which subjects are easiest for you, and which are most difficult? It\u2019s likely that you will need to do more work on your less favourite subjects to get decent results. It is worth diverting time from subjects you can do easily in order to improve your grades overall. Know your attention span Most people can concentrate for 45 minutes at a time, it\u2019s a natural bio-rhythm. After that your concentration dips. If you recognise that shift, you can take a moment to review your work so far, look out of the window and stretch, then get your head down for another 45 minutes. At that point, stop. Take a proper break. Refresh before attempting another subject. Work with your body Don\u2019t study when you\u2019re hungry or tired. Be disciplined about looking after your physical needs and making a calm environment so you can study easily. Go with your moods If you really can\u2019t face the difficult subject, then warm up with something more appealing. Do it for 45 minutes to get your brain into gear. Then swap to the one you have prioritised for study. If you\u2019re getting nowhere despite real effort, don\u2019t punish yourself by sitting at a desk. Get up, move, do a sport. Write it off for today, but get back to you studies tomorrow. Make a timetable This is really important. Go through your curriculum and allocate time to each area. Tick them off as you go. It\u2019s acceptable to be flexible and swap one study session for another if that gets you moving forward, but make sure you come back to the areas you need to study. Don\u2019t overload I think it\u2019s better to do fewer subjects in a day with deep attention than to skim over the surface of every topic. In an evening, do a maximum of two subjects. Over the course of a full day, attempt three at most. Set yourself essays or prepare a presentation Write about the topic you need to master. Perhaps structure this as a presentation. There\u2019s nothing better to identify the gaps in your knowledge. You will really consolidate what you know if you do this. Practice past papers. This is an absolute must. Get into the habit of doing previous exam questions under exam conditions as often as you can. Mark the results. Pay attention to timing. Exam technique is vital. Can you allocate time appropriately in proportion to the marks for each question? Are you disciplined about moving on when this time expires, regardless of whether you\u2019ve completed the question or not? Usually, you pick up more marks per minute in the first few minutes of working on a question but there comes a point where you will gain little further reward for perfection. This is the Law of Diminishing Returns in action. Use different methods to make the information stick Try different study methods. Prepare flashcards - make you own - this is invaluable.Try mindmaps to organise information and see connections and themes.Underline and highlight your text books.Use sticky labels to flag important topics in books so you can find them again easily.It really is a good feeling when you master a subject. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Study roughly 5 subjects one day and the other 4 subjects the next day, but rotate between the 9 subjects that you do. If you study 5 subjects Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and the other 4 Tuesday and Thursday, the next week reverse the subjects and study your 4 Monday, Wednesday and Friday and the other 5 Tuesday and Thursday so there will be an equal amount of studying for all 9 subjects.   Also mix in the easy subjects to study with the hard one. For example study 3 hard subjects and 2 easy one day and the other 2 hard and 2 easy subjects the next day (or however it applies to you). That way you won't get discouraged or exhaust your brain studying for all hard subjects at one time ",
