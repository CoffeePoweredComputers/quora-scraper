            "answer_text": "It is quite good. Accredited by NAAC. One of the best colleges in Ranchi, in fact the best college in Ranchi. In other colleges you can afford to bunk your classes and still manage to give the semester exams but that is not the case with the St. Xavier's College , Ranchi. One of my classmates wasn't allowed to appear in the semester exam just because he had less than 75% attendance. This college doesn't compromise with it's rules. Professors are well qualified and hardly do they miss their lectures. I was a commerce student and relied totally on college notes for the exams. Co curricular activities keep taking place every now and then. Cricket series, football games, basketball all these take place every year. But the main attraction is the college fest which takes place for three days every year. I studied there for 5 years and those were the best days of my life. You can look for better options if you have the marks and if you can afford in other cities but St. Xavier's College, Ranchi is great as well. ",
