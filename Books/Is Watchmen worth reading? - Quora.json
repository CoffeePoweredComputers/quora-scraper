            "answer_text": "Yes. The concept of Watchmen as conceived by Alan Moore is powerful and dark. The cinematic version is fairly faithful for certain scenes but cannot compare. It's my personal opinion that the film gives a sanitised feel even in the gritty scenes. Watchmen's text also provides a lot of texture and contemplative points. The accompanying clippings and stories engage the reader to the point of immersion. I found this very compelling, especially the real life murder of Kitty Genovese is entwined in its creation. If you are an avid DC fan, you may know that Moore's creation has never been integrated into the mainstream DC universe. The stories were too dark and deemed social commentary. When it came out in 1986, it was pioneering work That said however, there are hints that it is the big reveal in the current story arc.  Best wishes! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are considering reading Watchmen after you have watched the show, you will find that it is a lot different from the show. I hope you realize that Watchmen isn't in fact a book but a graphic novel with several issues. Watchmen, when it came out shook the comic book industry with its idea of moral justice and how killing can actually be justified. Alan Moore never wanted sequels but since DC was losing its copyright to the author, they went on to create multiple titles linked to the watchmen but none have worked out quite as well as the original. I'd say their efforts with the button and doomsday clock were great. Moreover, a spinoff on each character, before watchmen and Minutemen we're also launched. ",
