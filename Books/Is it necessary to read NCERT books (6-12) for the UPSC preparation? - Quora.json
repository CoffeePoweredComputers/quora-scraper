            "answer_text": "When you are planning to prepare for civil services examination, the role of NCERTs in your preparation must be clear to you. NCERT books are very crucial for the preparation of civil services examination because they help you to build your foundations and to bring conceptual clarity. NCERT books help to clear your concept because they are written for school syllabus hence they are written in a very lucid language and representation is very attractive. So it is always advisable to a civil services aspirant to read and revise NCERT book properly and do not avoid them. Various coaching institutes provide notes in the name of a gist of NCERTs but it is always suggested to read the original one without looking for any alternative or short cut. The cost of skipping NCERTs might cost you huge in reverse. Further, if you want to have an idea that why NCERTs are important for civil services preparation, you must go through the previous year papers of IAS prelims and mains exam. After analyzing these papers you will realize that whatever knowledge NCERTs provides us, can help us to solve so many questions in prelim and mains exams. So do not listen to much people who tell shortcut of clearing IAS exam. Follow the step by step process and believe in yourself. You will sail through one day. All the best for your bright future. ",
