            "answer_text": "There are several ways to do this depending on your situation. If you plan to build now you can finance your land and construction costs in one loan(called a construction-perm). If you intend to wait awhile before building but want to purchase just your land, you can obtain a lot loan and pay for it until you're ready to start building. Lenders will usually require a minimum of 10% down on lot loans. Note also that any land that exceeds 5 acres will usually require a larger down payment and in addition many conforming lenders won\u2019t make the loan. You can still obtain one, usually with a \u201cfarm\u201d lender. If you\u2019re under 5 acres most lenders will help you with that. Really there\u2019s not much difference in buying land and building to buying an existing house, just a little different process. The financial aspects are, for the most part, the same. Good luck to you! ",
