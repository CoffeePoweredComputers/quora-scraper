            "answer_text": "Reading books puts you into situations you wouldn't otherwise live through yourself, and introduces you to people you wouldn't otherwise meet. And good books give you a new understanding of those circumstances and characters.  By (vicariously) giving yourself those experiences, you can not only understand yourself better, but understand the thoughts and motivations behind other lives.  Approaching the world from that position of understanding, either logical or emotional, broadens your spirit -- even long after you've put that book down. ",
