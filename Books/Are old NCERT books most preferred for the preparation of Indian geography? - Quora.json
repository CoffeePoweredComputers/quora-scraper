            "answer_text": "No!!! A big no since old NCERT books are old and you are preparing fresh so what is your logic behind preferring old NCERT to prepare geography. Look old things are only beneficial for those subjects which are static like History.Geography is not that much [] you need to understand that preferring old book isn't a good idea. My advise to you that 1st go with old NCERT from 6th to 10th (only reading not notes making) After that watch Mrunal Geography videos lectures series (just watch don't make any notes) they cover whole static portion very simply. If you read the Ncerts of 6th to 10th then it will become more easy to understand. After that take 11th and 12th class NCERT just read 1st time and then start making not only in 2nd reading keep little bit more space between your notes to add more information. After making notes of NCERT watch Mrunal videos again and supplement your notes with related information. Till now you have a Good notes of static portion.keep a thin \u20b910 notebook along with your notes just to add any current affairs. If you want more then go for GC LEONG to add more. This is all you need to do to prepare Geography for CSE. All this will take 4\u20135 hrs of a day for not more than 30 days to prepare. Apart from all that you also have to have a atlas for maps Hope this will help all the best.\ud83d\udc4d Some glance of my notes      ",
