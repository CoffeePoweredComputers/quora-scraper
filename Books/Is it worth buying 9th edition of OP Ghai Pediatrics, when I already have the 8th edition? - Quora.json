            "answer_text": "You know its funny I had my O.P. Ghai, ninth edition open when I came across this question on Quora right now. If you already have the eighth edition, I would not say its necessary to buy the ninth. The only new changes would be those in immunisation schedules, national and WHO guidelines and standards, which I am sure you will be updated on in your college by your professors and peers. Other than that, the internet is there, which even people with the 9th edition will have to look up to check. I will, nonetheless, add a picture of the \u2018Preface to the Ninth Edition\u2019. The 5th paragraph might give an insight.  ",
