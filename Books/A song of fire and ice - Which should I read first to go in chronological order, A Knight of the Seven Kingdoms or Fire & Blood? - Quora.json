            "answer_text": "Fire and Blood, Vol 1 comes first, chronologically. The first volume of Fire and Blood, published last November, covers the first half (pretty much) of the Targaryen rule in Westeros. It begins with Aegon\u2019s Conquest (2\u20131 BC), while also having some information all the way back to the arrival of the Targaryens to Dragonstone (114 BC). And it continues till the end of the regency of Aegon III (136 AC). The \u201cBC\u201d and \u201cAC\u201d here refer to the calendar years in Westeros - before and after the Conquest/Coronation. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, published in October 2015, is a collected edition of three novellas, which were first released as parts of anthologies in 1998, 2003, and 2010 respectively. The first novella, The Hedge Knight, takes place in 209 AC, some 73 years after the end of Fire and Blood Vol 1. The second novella, The Sworn Sword, takes place two years later, in 211 AC, and the third novella, The Mystery Knight is set a year later, in 212 AC. ",

            "answer_text": "It does not matter. The two works do not really spoil each other. That said, I would recommend Fire and Blood first. It gives you an appreciation of how destructive Targaryen civil wars are. The Dunc and Aeg novellas then gives the suffering and divisions on the ground. I fear Fire and Blood makes it sound like Jaehaerys and Cregan waved magical wands, Lord Peake fell from grace, Aegon dismissed his regents, and they lived happily ever after. If you want to go by Westerosie chronology, go with the order I gave above. By publication, it is the first three Dunc and Aeg novellas, then Fire and Blood. ",
