            "answer_text": "Sure, why not? If so, mine is the snake. I\u2019m drawn to snakes, I\u2019ve never feared them. I find snakes relatable. Snakes aren\u2019t aggressive. They are shy, secretive animals. Snakes do not bite out of malice and they certainly do not go looking for enemies. They will defend their lives if/when needed. Snakes like to be left alone. Snakes have been unfairly given a bad reputation. I once saw a woman stoning a snake to death outside of church, I was a small child then and couldn\u2019t do anything except cry.  ",
