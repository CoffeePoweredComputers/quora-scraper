            "answer_text": "There is nothing that says that dreams can only be about things or situations you have experienced in real life. Having seen a movie, or read a book, or played a game are all experiences that you can dream about. Even just having somebody tell you a story is enough. Dreaming is your brain\u2019s way of sorting all of that information, and allows you to explore your emotions regarding things.Whatever reason you may have, you connect a pack of wolves with a particular kind or sense of danger. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve experienced it yourself, or even if you\u2019ve been in a similar but different situation (say, dogs attacking you, rather than wolves), you\u2019re dreaming something that embodies whatever emotions you connect with it. You can talk to a therapist if you want to figure out precisely what caused you to have to deal with the emotions you\u2019re dreaming about. You could do it on your own too, but you want to be aware that a) people often don\u2019t ask themselves the right questions, and b) if your emotions are unstable, you could cause yourself severe anxiety issues. Even if you do not suffer from that, you still might not know what questions to ask yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Could this be symbolic?!! Not sure what else it could be? You\u2019ve never seen a wolf, but we know what one looks like, right? We all know their reputation, right? Sheep slayers, voracious hunters, dangerous, right? But they are becoming extinct (on a comeback now) and because of that, we care for them, and like to see them as dogs. Now, in your dream, your nightmare, I assume that you see wolves as the former, vicious killers. What could that mean, if it\u2019s not symbolic? I could mean that you are simply afraid of wolves. Symbolically, it\u2019s much more complicated. To me, things in my dreams are symbolic. A wolf can stand for a lot of different things. If you work for instance, you may be afraid of being verbally attacked by the boss, It could mean you are reluctant to be out in the wild. You may find comfort in your city home. Humans are called wolves if they hunt relationships, being one night, or permanent. They hunt down (usually) women, but man can be the target of a wolf also, though we do masculinitize wolves don\u2019t we) So is it symbolic? Sure. Of course. We don\u2019t know. Basically, you have to figure it out. ",
