I think leadership and management are in a great place, especially as we\u2019ve all gone remotely in our businesses due to Covid19 pandemic. Some people were remote to start with of course, but a lot of businesses have disbanded in gone out of office. So for a leader or a manager to be able to communicate with his or her team of eight people or 80 people or 800 people, video is a great way to do this where you don\u2019t need to call a meeting and everyone needs to drop what they\u2019re doing.
