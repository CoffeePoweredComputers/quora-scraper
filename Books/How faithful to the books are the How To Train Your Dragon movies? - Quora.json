            "answer_text": "How To Train Your Dragon is one of my favorite movies of all time with incredible music, a relatable protagonist, and excellent animation. The themes are hard-hitting and heartfelt, and the storytelling and pacing are near perfect. However\u2026 This is Percy Jackson and Artemis Fowl levels of book inaccuracy (with HTTYD being the exception of actually being a movie).  Let\u2019s list off some differences that I remember since I don\u2019t read the books years ago. The key difference is that humans and dragons coexist in the books while they don\u2019t in the movies. Dragons are seen as pets in the book while the movie shows that they are the enemy. The coexistence of humans and dragons is brought up near the end of the series while sort of just existing in the back of the stories.Another key difference is the Toothless\u2019s. The movie\u2019s Toothless is a Nightfury meant to be feared by all while book Toothless is a one of the smaller dragons as well as one of the brattier.Hiccup is a normal weakling teenager in the movies, but book Hiccup is (I believe) a middle schooler. Book Hiccup also has the ability to speak a dragon language called \u201cDragonese\u201d and is the only one to speak this language.Hiccup in the movies has a squad of dragon riders in Astrid, Snotlout, Fishlegs, Ruff, and Tuff. Book Hiccup only has two friends, Fishlegs (Hiccup\u2019s best friend) and this girl named Camicazi from a local tribe. I believe she was the inspiration for Astrid. Snotlout exists, but he\u2019s Hiccups cousin as well as bully.Hiccup\u2019s archenemy is a guy named Alvin who I believe shows up in the cartoon series.Reading is looked down upon in the books with the exception of a manual on training dragons. What I\u2019m about to present to you is a word-for-word interpretation of the inside of the dragon manual that was proudly published and looked upon by the elders in the village. As you can tell, the books and movies are pretty dang different. Have fun stormin\u2019 the castle! It\u2019ll take a miracle! Joshua Nguyen ",

            "answer_text": "Faithful in theme perhaps, nothing else really. The characters are completely different (mostly.) Hiccup has red hair, Snotlout is his taller cousin, Tuffnut is 99% irrelevant, Fishlegs is an asthmatic twig, Astrid and Ruffnut don\u2019t exist, Stoick and Gobber are much dumber and Toothless can fit on Hiccups shoulder. If that's not enough to convince you that they are vastly different, the dragons speak. Granted it\u2019s their own langue, but Hiccup can speak it. They\u2019re both amazing in their own ways, but they are way too different to even be compared fairly. ",
