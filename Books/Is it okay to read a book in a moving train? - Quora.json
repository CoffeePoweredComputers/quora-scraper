            "answer_text": "Reading is good anytime and anywhere. However if you are the type that gets motion sickness or a headache due to eye strain .. I would perhaps suggest avoiding it. However I must say that I have had some remarkable reading done in trains or in transit when I am not on the driver's role. Travel makes sometime take a break and lets your mind ruminate . But I recommend reading in transit only if the journey is more than couple of hours long. I hate taking too many breaks while reading a good book. Your mind kinda gets bugged and you end up dropping it. If its something educational and small bites are required go for it but you will pay for the extra stress you put on your body, not to mention the disturbances since most short rides are crowded. I would recommend an audio book or a video for those times. ",
