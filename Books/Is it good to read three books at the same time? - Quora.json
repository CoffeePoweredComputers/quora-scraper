            "answer_text": "If your mind allows it, it definitely is a good idea with non-fictional books, rather than fictional literature. For I basically have a strategy of roll back book myself. Book 1: The most important book or the book you actually want to read. In my part, most of these books are information-oriented (fictional/non-fictional) that I need. Book 2: Reference book that is related to the book 1 or a topic in book 1. This helps you to switch between the books and writing method while not letting you change the entire topic or concentration. Book 3: Sometimes it's hard to keep on digging into a book/topic when there's lot of text in it (Philosophy for example). You keep pushing yourself, your mind rejects the information into memory. So sometimes, it's good to switch the whole topic. This is why I keep a book (majorly like a thriller or autobiography). This will be my rollback book. I read it for sometime until my mind soothes n relaxes, and then after a small break, I'll get back to the book 1. It's different for everyone, and you've to find out if you're upto it. There's no bad, if you're not. If you're, this is an example how you can design your own strategy based on multiple factors like your reading pattern, type of books you read, your schedules n other hobbies etc. It's important to keep your mind relaxed while reading something important.

            "answer_text": "It totally depends on you. If you can read three books or more at the same time its okay! I do prefer to read several books at the same time when they have different themes or when they aren\u2019t exactly similar. Like I said before, it depends on you: if you can read them at the same time cool but if you can\u2019t its okay too. Of course, if you can read them at the same time it\u2019s more practical and you get better at some reading skills. Also, I love to read and I read a book like in a week or so even when I\u2019m reading two at the same time. I used to think that having the skill of reading several books won\u2019t be something useful in life, but when I entered to college it helped me a lot. At least in my college we need to read a lot and several books for information and it helps if you have a reading skill, reading faster or just being able to read more books at the same time. It helped me a lot but there some of my classmates didn\u2019t read at the same pace and they were good! ",
