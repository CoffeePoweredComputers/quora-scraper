            "answer_text": "When you are in a crisis, which need an immediate action what are you supposed too? You even rack your brains out and still you don't think logically. Why? Because the life of your loved one is at stakes. Harry was willing to take ant illogical way to protect Sirius from that falsely implicated memory of voldemort. And he choose physical action over authenticity. He chose to take a trip to ministry and save Sirius. Not even knowing that he was safe in grimmauld place . And it was even asserted by Hermione. But did he thought that at that moment voldemort was much more powerful than the order? Yes. At that moment the only thing concerned Harry was Sirius and facing voldemort again. And how to get out of this castle which was runned by an 'high inquisitor' monster. And at a quick fetched plan like this, we always forget to include a crucial thing. And which it was the mirror given by Sirius. Obviously to the fact that it didn't had any role until the deathly hallows as harry would repeatedly visit Sirius in his fifth year. Blasted off from the tapestry, blasted off from world. ",
