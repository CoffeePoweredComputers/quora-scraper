            "answer_text": "I had answered a similar question earlier and I am putting my words here again: Years back, I had some real \u2018pain in the neck\u2019 when I was building my reading habit. I had to do it anyway, so the only option I had was \u2018commitment and the commitment to the commitment\u2019. I gathered motivation and emotional support from my friends who were voracious readers. I started with short books, I started with merely 2/3 pages a day. I would read them and talk about the content with my near ones. That helped me a lot. I gradually increased the number of pages daily, and the volume of books also got upgraded. I picked the genre that appealed to me the most. Now, reading is a core habit and I have at least one book on my bed all the time. PS: There\u2019s a simple fact about \u2018habit\u2019 - if you are doing it, you are getting results, if you are not doing it, you get absolutely zilch! ",
