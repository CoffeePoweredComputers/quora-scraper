            "answer_text": "Firstly, \u201creal value\u201d and \u201cebook\u201d are contradictory terms. You can put any price on it you want, but over $9.99 on Amazon, you only get a 35% royalty. So you wont get half the royalty you might expect to get. Real value has no meaning in ebooks. The only thing which matters is reader expectations, and they expect most books to be below 9.99. To get over $10, you will need an absolutely eye grabbing cover, a blurb which draws people to want to read the sample, and an absolutely perfect reading sample which makes people want to read the rest. The slightest thing wrong with any one, and it wont sell at 9.99, let alone any higher. Even then, the price will put off a lot of people. Now, here\u2019s the real problem: Self help books dont sell at $2.99. I dont know what convinces you your book is worth $100, but I seriously doubt you will get any takers. Even for a glossy photoed hardcover, you wont get $100. You might get $9.99. If you\u2019re lucky. I have a self help style book which is 400 pages long. Everyone in the world should be reading it. It definitely does change lives. But hey, its listed at 1 mill+ in the Kindle store, and I get a sale or 2 a month. At $9.99, and Kindle is actually discounting it at the moment, and it still isn\u2019t selling. Now, coaching services. Which is more important to you? Selling ebooks, or making your ebooks feed people to your coaching services? If it was me, I\u2019d be making the book $2.99, promoting the hell out of it, and making sure the front and back matter advertise your services and link directly to your online sign up form. The way I see it, your book isn\u2019t a product. Its a marketing tool for your services. Make it 99c, and promote it a lot on launch, and you might get 100\u2019s of people read it, and a dozen of them might sign up for your services. Or you still might not sell any and get no flow through at all. You wont know until you try. As I said, you can put any price on there you want, but getting 5 people to buy at $9.99, will get you the same royalty as 1 person buying at $100. And at $9.99, you might get 20 sales or 50 sales or even a 100 sales, for each $100 sale. Do the math. ",

Yeah. Will it sell? No. And \u201clife changing experience\u201d? I have had my life changed by a book twice, and I bought both of those for under fifteen dollars. For one hundred, I don\u2019t want life changing, I want the secret to immortality and a bottle of tequila, too. Nobody will look at a book priced for one hundred dollars they\u2019re not even getting a physical copy of and buy it. Get over yourself and charge twenty dollars, max. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Unless you have separate proof that your coaching services have that much value, nobody is going to buy your ebook for $100. How can you prove it? Find one example in your book which makes it glaringly obvious your method works. Give it away free with a link to purchase in the book. Be sure to set it up to accept all forms of payment, including currency conversion (PayPal is one). There are lots of places where you can promote for free and many more which will promote for a small fee. You might sell one copy. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to make your book $2.99-$5.99 and sell lots of copies? You still give away the sample, but the likelihood of generating sales is much greater at the lower price. ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t expect many purchasers. $100 is a lot for an ebook. If you manage to sell any, the chances are it will be immediately pirated and made available free. A realistic price would be $2.99 to $9.99 with the lower end being more likely to sell. At that price you\u2019d get 70% royalties less a delivery charge, typically 10\u00a2. Between $10 and $20 you actually earn less than at $9.99 because you get a 35% royalty. The higher your price, the fewer your sales. If you charge $100 you would have to produce a remarkably convincing explanation of why this price is justifiable. ",
