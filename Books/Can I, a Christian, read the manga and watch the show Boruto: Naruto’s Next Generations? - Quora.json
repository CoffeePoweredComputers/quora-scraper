            "answer_text": "It depends how much your into Christianity. I\u2019ll pretend your an extremist of the religion (like few members of my family) Watching things like anime and manga are purely for entertainment and for your own enjoyment and this alone should stop you to watch such things, but if that\u2019s not enough for you and you still think there is nothing wrong in reading an harmless manga think about the message and content that those manga\u2019s give, most of the time there are wars, killing, swearing, and dark symbolism. (just like the bible) I always been fascinated by symbols and Religions I been into Occultism Symbolism for quite a while until i figure it out how dark was to get into this hole, that said in Naruto there are a lot of those symbols and if you would do a personal research you\u2019ll notice how packed is this manga with occultism, starting with the 3 tomoe sharingan which are the representation of the number 666, Uchiha \u201cthe clan possessed by the evil\u201d  and you will find the same style tomoe also on naruto activation of KM and if you sum them all they always bring up 666 i dont think is a coincidence also Naruto in Kurama mode resemble a devil with horns made of chakra  and the eyes that the author told us are an amalgamation of a frog and a fox coincidentally they also resemble a snake and a goat, two sacred animals in occultism  and you know who else has similar eyes? Baphomet which is one of the most powerful devil and symbol for satanic worship. And if all those coincidence are not enough think about all the God like characters in the manga they all resemble Devils with horns and dreamlike powers including the loved Hagaromo which is supposedly the wisest of all and don\u2019t let me start with his mother.  What about the music of the Anime ever notice it? most of the time feels like dark ambience organum music which is often used for occult rituals. What about Boruto? is it the same? **SPOILERS** well the boy is literally possessed by a devil and the show hints that will probably be his primary Godlike power together with his \u201cwicked eye\u201d but it seems there is far less symbolism compared to the previous generation.  Question: Can a Christian watch Boruto anime? Of course he can because in this case Naruto (not a big fun of Boruto) is much more than that, is a over 10 years journey of a loser that become a legend through hardships and friendships with lot of joyful and painful moments that only true fans can understand and let me tell you it\u2019s completely worth it. Just wanna clarify everything i said above is not been proven and are things that i personally noticed. I\u2019m not saying kishimoto is an occultist but there are a lot of coincidence that resemble it. And i wanna apologise for any english mistakes which is not my primary language. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my take as a Christian. Boruto has swearing in it, not ideal, but not uncommon in anime and manga. There are a few scenes of partial nudity; some just happen while others appear because some maroon passed Sexy Jutsu on to Boruto. Those are my gripes about the show. Now, if you know all this and you believe that 1) you can avoid or overlook these aspects and 2) keeping up with the series won\u2019t mess up your standing with God, go ahead if you think it\u2019s good entertainment. Also, whether you feel any confliction after you read this or not, consider praying on it. With situations like this, it\u2019s wise to seek an answer from Him first before relying on the internet. Don\u2019t jump into stuff because a Christian on the internet says it\u2019s okay, especially when you can ask for clarity from Him as easily as I can. There\u2019s no shame in wanting verification sometimes and a double check won\u2019t hurt my feelings. ",

            "answer_text": "No! Its forbidden!!!! Lol all jokes aside, of course you can! There is no reason why you can't read and enjoy whatever you want. Whether it is for or against someone's belief or religion its always good to read and enjoy things you like regardless of who you are and where you came from. If Manga is something you like go ahead and read whither series you prefer. Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (at least in my opinion) isn't as good as a story as its prequel but it does a good job to engage you in its world with its characters. In the end this is a fantasy story that teaches some morals and some philosophies that may or may not align with what you believe in. That is perfectly fine as a human it is always beneficial to learn of different perspectives and different cultures through literature and other mediums. As Naruto always says Believe It!!! Or dattebayo!!! (Which doesnt actuall translate to believe it as it is a mistranslation on the dubbing of the anime). ",
