            "answer_text": "I've been thinking about this one for a bit, hence the delayed answer. This is for those readers who think that they are alone and whose caution, experiences, fears etc. around money have made them want to throw the towel in. There is a way to grow! When I was in college, I had a great corporate finance class and business statistics teacher. Little did I know this was the first real decade of developing financial analysis models as a method to make decisions. It was cool stuff. I learned, but I didn\u2019t master it. I used the concepts, but didn\u2019t know enough to get results for myself. A few years later, at my first corporate job, I remember my dad being very proud of the bank stock he had been buying over the years and how his (and our) sacrifice was growing into a nest egg. He also shared stories about buying oil company stock which shortly later went thru a buy out. It made him lots of money. No analysis. No sharing of lessons learned. Just gut, trust and results. A few years after a divorce, in my early 30s it was time to start building a college fund for the kids and a retirement account for me. I went to my local bank and saw their on-site investment advisor. He talked about buying mutual funds, buying on margin, shorting stock etc. All cool stuff, but I had no idea how it all worked. I put a couple hundred bucks in to get it started\u2026.. and nothing\u2026. for years. No follow-up. No ongoing education. It was an odd but normal experience to open an account and never to have anything happen. At the same time I started putting money into my 401K. It was my personal wealth tax. I always felt it was never enough and I was to late in the savings game. None the less, with a little luck, a growing market, and some semi-random choices of mutual funds, my 401K grew so much so that about 5 years later, I was able to use some of the money to buy my first home. Lots of reading. Lots of luck. A growing market and success. Then the death spiral of investing! I listened to my peers each of who was \u201cinvesting\u201d. Most were engineers who developed interesting ways to make and grow their money in the stock market. Lots of analysis. Lots of feeling good. Lots of successes. Then the dot.com crash\u2026\u2026\u2026 Lots of losses, lots of bewilderment, lots of margin calls, lots of stock options with the value of toilet paper, lots of what-the-heck-just-happened. So I decided their approach was as ignorant as mine. What really scared me was when I was working at a financial planning software company and the product experts, the FAs were sharing their love of poker, cards etc, and how their investment advice caused their family to lose (significant) money. hmmmm. The point of these vignettes is to demonstrate how many conscious and unconscious emotional memories and distortions we have around money. 2 favorite books that I keep on my shelf are, Money and the Meaning of Life and The Energy of Money. They really helped me come to understand my idiosyncrasies around my behavior and beliefs with money. It\u2019s actually a lot simpler. Why would I hire a financial advisor? I help me navigate my ignorance, to expose me to topics that I don\u2019t know about so that I can learn. And lastly for me to learn to listen, sense, ignore the fluff and trust my gut. Would I hire them? Nope - not yet.To learn. An FA has a view. Mostly One View. Mostly their or their investment firm\u2019s view of how they make money and we get some of it. I can learn from that - to determine what I don\u2019t want to do. Would I hire them? No. I said I\u2019d learn from them, what to look for and who to stay away from.To create an incubator for me to find out what kind of investor I am. Do I like risk? Do I like predictable returns? How do I react to losses? How do I mitigate loss and manage thru it? How do I set up my investments so I am not taking out money during the loss time? What are the biases in the tax law toward the wealthy? What were the successes of the quiet, already retired, self-supporting, abundant feeling investor? I look for the investor who simply states simple facts because the facts worked. I also look for the investor who works because they don\u2019t have to but because they love to. Most already retired folks aren\u2019t FAs.So did I hire an FA? Yes. He is retired. He was my former boss. He retired when he got laid off in his early 50\u2019s. He is analytical. He is a great teacher and explains things really well. He became wealthy working at a regular corporate job and by being frugal, patient, informed etc. No big wins. No big payoffs. And he is a fiduciary. He doesn\u2019t get paid for selling me product like my insurance guy or banker or loan person. This is where the model fractures: Some of us want very little involvement in our money, wealth, its growth, its losses. Just like the check we expect every month, we just want to know we are saved and salvation is a guarantee! Some of us, like myself, what to know everything possible so we can know what to expect, in order to weather the ups and downs with as little emotional impact as possible, like a buddhist. Some of us want the fastest and coolest way to make as much as possible. The more unique and exotic, the better it must be. They all work and they all fail. So for me - I have decided that: I pay my Fiduciary FA for his brains so I can be smarter. I can ask him a variety of what if questions: e.g. I am concerned about high PE ratios, what are my options? I am concerned we are in the top 25% of the market prepping for a downturn. What are my options? I want to invest in warrants, what is the upside, downside and your opinion? He is smart. We have similar investment attitudes, but I do not do everything he does or suggests and vice versa. I like real estate. He likes REITS. I have a 40/60 ratio of stocks to bonds. He has 60 / 40 (but moving to 50/50). I like doing analytics on and buying individual value stocks. He doesn\u2019t. But since its my money, I drive it. On the other hand, my wife would be happy giving her money to an FA and letting them manage it and telling her how she did once a year. She has had a lot of success / luck in finding a person who has done a good job for her. She believes if you hire the right person, then in their professional capacity, they will do an excellent job. And in her experience, she is mostly right. Where for her, these people sort of show up, for me, I\u2019ve had to go look and find them and learn along the way. Having worked in financial services, I think she has the more infrequent experience. Her brother on the other hand, loves technical investing. He does everything himself and would never hire an FA. A tax attorney - yes. A FA - no. He tells us what we should invest in, but I don\u2019t understand half of what he says and he is too smart & busy to spend the time educating me, and he\u2019d forget to tell me about the trades to sell. So, I\u2019d never hire a FA, CPA, lawyer, doctor etc unless I was 1) going to learn from them and they\u2019d let me own my decisions. I like the idea of paying people for what they know, not what they sell me. 2) And I always want the option to change or end our agreement when the value is no longer there. The key is to use these experiences to come to know my approach, come to understand my biases and then make informed, logical, makes-sense decisions as needed. 2 other books that helped me keep this simple was, The Automatic Millionaire, and MONEY Master the Game. They aren\u2019t the silver bullet, but for me they are simply, a basic way to learn, be informed, ask good questions and learn along the way to ones financial success. In my opinion and experience. Best of success and searching! ",

            "answer_text": "In my case, a financial advisor was/is worth the money, for 3 reasons: 1. I had saved up through my 20s and invested them through my own research into 401ks, IRAs, additional investing via robo platforms. But the amount I was working with is larger now, and a good chunk was not invested yet because of some upcoming changes (next point), and I was worried about making an expensive mistake. 2. I was about to make a couple of big decisions that would impact my financials (join a startup, consider buying my first home). I researched on my own on forums and blogs (401k rollovers, equity compensation, mortgage options, etc.), and instead of being able to figure things out like I used to, I got overwhelmed, because there were more things to consider than in my 20s. The contradicting advice from my peers, each with different financial situations, didin't help. 3. The time and effort I was spending - 6 months of on and off researching, getting overwhelmed, delaying decision, then researching again - did not get me any closer to sorting it out. I'll admit, if someone suggested 6 months prior to then that I should get an advisor, I would have likely ignored it. A large part of deciding I was finally willing to pay/hire is because I tried to figure it out on my own, and no longer could. So for me, an advisor (ended up costing ~$2,000) to help me sort out a holistic financial plan and action steps that took all aspects into account, was worth the peace of mind I got. Ultimately, whether something is worth it or not, is subjective. Not dissimilar to whether it's worthwhile to hire a personal trainer / therapist / etc. or just attain your goal on your own. It comes down to 1) what you need help with because you don't do it well on your own, 2) how much you need/want it that you want to pay for it, and 3) if the product/service delivers well. Frankly - I found the last part, finding the right product/service - in this case, finding the right fiduciary advisor who was holistic - to be the toughest part. Not every advisor is created equal. Like some other commentors, I encountered poor experiences with quite a few advisors at banks, insurance companies, etc., was close to concluding an advisor is not worth it, before finally finding the right one for what I need: How I Found My Financial Advisor - Christine [Disclosure: From my own pain point, I ended up starting a platform to make it easier for those searching for fiduciary advisors, including non-AUM, advice-only advisors Find A Financial Advisor Who Puts You First. I want to make it the search process easier and more transparent for others. Feel free to give it a try, welcome any feedback.] ",

            "answer_text": "Paying a financial professional to manage your money really depends on your situation and your expectations. If you are expecting to pay a financial professional to make you a lot of money and beat the market in general, it\u2019s probably not worth it. Most financial professionals will not beat a good index fund over a 15 year period. Even most mutual fund managers themselves do not beat the market over 80% of the time in a 15-year time frame. How much money will you be investing with the Advisor? If you do not have a good amount of money to invest, do not expect a lot of attention. You might get a meeting once a year and a phone call a few times. Advisors have to make a living like everyone else and their wealthy clients pay the bills. They will spend the most time with them. If you do have sizeable assets to manage, are you concerned about tax issues, proper diversification, and estate planning? If the answer is yes, a financial professional might be worth it. An advisor\u2019s job is really there to do just what the title says and advise. Their worth is in possibly the suggestions they may have for things like diversification and not to earn more money for you than average market returns. If the market returns something like 8%, don\u2019t expect your advisor to get you 15% returns is an example. For most people, a financial advisor may not be worth the fees and commissions. If you take the time to learn about investing and don\u2019t have a lot of money to diversify or tax issues, you may be better off on your own. Think of the fees or commissions that you would pay on say 200k. If an advisor charged a 1% advisory fee each year, that is 2k the first year alone. Is that worth possibly a few phone calls and an annual meeting? Let\u2019s say the total time spent in a year was 3 hours. That is about $667 per hour. How does that sound? The real issue might not be deciding if you need an advisor, but how to find a really good qualified advisor for your situation. There are new advisors entering the business every day and even one\u2019s with decades of experience may not be right for you. There are times people need an advisor and more times when they probably do not. The ultimate decision is a personal one. Here is a previous article I wrote titled Does Everyone Need a Financial Advisor? It may surprise you how challenging it can be to find a truly qualified advisor. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the person. If you know a lot about investing, or at least the basics AND can control your emotions, why not DIY invest. However, how many people do you know who stayed calm during the financial crisis? How many people do you know who have the self-control to buy and hold for 30 years? How many people do you know who are broke compared to having money? For that matter, how many people who are high-income, do you know who are broke? Here is the thing, a good advisor can be a behavioral coach not just focusing on investing. It is harder to do something stupid if you need to talk to somebody with experience. When I joined the gym years ago, I did it alone. It didn\u2019t work. I only started to see progress once I went to classes, used a trainer and so on. After using a trainer and going to classes, it got easier to know how to use the equipment well. But the equipment seemed so easy to use, I simply didn\u2019t take into account some of the emotional issues with getting fitter. The same applies to investing and in addition to that, there is one positive of using an advisor many people don\u2019t factor in. Believe it or not, many of the clients that have came to me, are paying less in fees. Yes less in fees. Why? Many of them have been doing things like stock picking and buying very expensive actively managed funds. So advisors can actually reduce costs for those clients. Do the maths. A 1.1% all in cost (say 1% advisor fees + 0.1% for index funds) beats 0.2% for the platform + 1.5% for actively managed funds + all the time to pick those funds. So it depends on many factors. For beginners, who are new to investing and don\u2019t know much, it is almost always a great idea. For people who know what they are doing and can do it quickly online, without wasting time and speculating, then they can sometimes get good returns as investors. These statistics though show many DIY investors aren\u2019t behaving in a way that is conductive to good long-term returns;  Just do a search on Quora and how many people are asking questions like `is this a good time to invest into markets`. Those kinds of people will never be good DIY investors. As a final point, what is the biggest indication of wealth in retirement? Returns? Income? No\u2026\u2026.how much you contribute and for how long. Spending and investment habits, therefore, are 3x more important than income and even investment returns, although returns are important. So a good advisor shares some tricks for speeding less. That pays for the fees 2x-3x over. Simple example. I told a client a simple trick last year. I said, `don't invest what is left over after expenses, put in a direct debit to your account one day after you are paid`. That forced her to be disciplined. The result? She is investing 300% more than before. From $500 to $1,500. Without even trying.

            "answer_text": "Its not so much a matter of want and need but it more so depends on your situation. Let take a second to look at what value a financial advisor could add, then see if any of these values resignate with you. I will break it down to you like I do to my clients. Financial advisors add value on three main aspects of your life and I like to call them the \u201cBig 3\u201d. MONEY. It\u2019s all about the Benjamin\u2019s, right? When I talk money here, I am not talking about the investment returns that some advisors \u201cpromise\u201d that they can get you, I am talking about the money that advisors save you. Americans pay 40% of their money to taxes and 30% of their money to interest every year on average. A competent advisor can save you $1,000\u2019s on interest and taxes with proper planning and execution. The advisor can be worth his weight in value on this aspect alone.PEACE OF MIND. I don\u2019t know about you but the feeling of having peace of mind over your finances is one that can\u2019t be priced. Having sleepless nights worrying if you\u2019re on track for retirement, or how you\u2019re going to pay off the hundreds of thousands in student debt can be daunting. An advisor can help you build out a detailed financial plan and budget for how you need to allocate your money to achieve the goals that are important to you. All plans are unique and there is no one size fits all approach here so don\u2019t listen to anyone on tv that says there is.TIME. Time is the most precious thing that we have on this earth and we must cherish it as such. A financial advisor can save you time in a multitude of ways. Think of how much time you spent looking up answers to financial questions that you\u2019ve had and still end up unsure of what the right answer was. Or how much time you\u2019ve spent trying to create a budget or understand the statements in your 401k plan. Your financial advisor can be a one stop shop for all your financial service needs. They can also be a resource for your financial education. I insist on educating all my clients on financial concepts that are relevant to their current situation.These are just some of the aspects where a financial advisor could provide amazing value to their clients. All in all, I do think that everyone can benefit from having a financial advisor in some scope. Some individuals may only need to see an advisor once a year, while others may get the best benefit seeing their advisor monthly. But having a trusted advisor to talk with regarding a topic as complex and emotional as personal finance is a huge step in the right direction toward financial freedom.

            "answer_text": "Financial planners come in two flavors - either percentage of assets managed or a flat fee. The cost becomes high when you have a lot of assets, that's for sure. The other way the cost of advice would be high is when the advice that you receive does not provide enough value to cover its cost. This is when you need to find a person who knows more about financial planning than you do (otherwise you can save a lot of money do it all yourself without paying anyone). It will take time, some trial and error, unfortunately, but when you find the right person, two things will happen: #1 - they will be worth their weight in gold for you, and #2 - when you ask about any gift you can give them, their only response would be to keep your money (and invest them) and provide them as a reference to another person. I was lucky enough to work with a brilliant finance person, and she was kind enough to recommend her adviser to me. What can I tell you? After the first consultation with that planner, I came out having had learned a great deal about finance (and I thought I was a decently informed individual) and knowing that my finances were now in good hands. How long did it take me to find such a person? From about the time I was in my 20s to the time I was very close to 40. A long time. During that time I have managed not to make too many mistakes with my investments and got decent returns but it was mostly blind luck, which is not a sustainable investment strategy, so I do not recommend it. And yes, a good planner will cost you money, and there will be times when the money would be lost, even if temporarily, on some investments, but the goal here is not short-term day trading, but a long term investment and long term gains. I am definitely sticking with my adviser for long-term. ",

            "answer_text": "The only way to answer this question is whether your financial advisor has skin in the game! Or in normal Non-Nassim Taleb words - is your financial advisor\u2019s interests aligned with yours? It\u2019s important to find that alignment of interest. Consider this, are the pilot\u2019s salary worth it every time you board and aircraft? Or is it worthwhile to have your Uber driver make money while he is transporting you from one place to another? Yes! Damn right! Because it\u2019s alignment of interest. If he is a bad pilot or Uber driver then he will kill himself along with you. So he has to do his job very carefully in order to survive. On similar lines, politicians to voters is a metric that has limited or sometimes no alignment of interest. Because they have a habit to personalise any profits and socialise the losses. So if the crude oil falls, then government gets to make money and if it rises then taxes are raised to breach that import gap. So next time when you meet your financial advisor - ask him to show his own portfolio. That way you will understand the funds that he is selling are the ones where he has personally invested, studied and looking for a good growth ahead. Or you can ask him for his own financial plan too. If he has a plan to retire early, then he will be able to guide you correctly as well. As he has taken the pain to understand all the plausible ups and downs. Rather than simply following a text book format. In a nutshell, if you are able to evaluate a financial advisor\u2019s skin in the game. Then yes, those fees are worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "As the saying goes, \u201cit depends\u201d. Are you looking for someone to take orders from you but not offer any real advice or education? If so, then having a financial advisor is probably not for you. If you are looking for someone to educate you in an objective manner, then working with a financial advisor may be a great person on your team. Great financial advisors, and this can be said about pretty much any professional, listen more than they talk. In order for them to be a strong resource for you they need to know what your hopes, dreams & goals are. Then, they will ask even more questions to learn what is at your core. What is the single most important thing you want your money, business, etc. to do for you? They can\u2019t really help you if they don\u2019t know exactly what you want and need. Financial advisors, the truly great ones, listen intently, constantly are learning more in their industry, and will always bring value to you beyond just selling a product. They should be a partner, a team member, someone that has a vested interest in you and your future. Ask yourself what you want out of a relationship with a financial advisor. If it is sound advice, education, solutions, and a long term relationship, then perhaps it makes sense to engage the services of one. Do you due diligence. And remember, if you don\u2019t like them, then none of the other stuff matters! Best Regards, Derek ",

It is 2019! Google can tell you alot. Being wise and doing your own research on the content and making decision is the key to financial sucess. Think about it. You give a financial advisor your age and risk profile before the meeting. The person will go to GOOGLE and check on the latest growth stocks, dividend stocks, insurance coverage. He/She will be using the same tools for his research before speaking with you. The only difference is that the person has 30 mins to decide for you, whilst you need weeks of research before being brave enough to decide on a decision. But that couple of weeks will save you $500 for each hour! I did not even captured performance and yearly fees there. Look at me. An Engineer who is took cheap to pay for a financial advisor who receives weekly thank you for helping others for free. :-) The reason why I do not pay these blood sucker is because\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 back in 2010 I went to a financial advisor. He started selling me like $600 worth of insurance packages. I asked him how is his personal investment doing. His super duper honest response! Nah I cant afford it, Cause I have two house and a yatch to pay! True Story! ",

            "answer_text": "A good financial advisor can be one of the best long term relationships you ever had. Having a financial advisor can help you save time and money.  Good financial advice includes not just what you should invest in but also what to stay away from. If your advisor is a fiduciary, that means they will act in your best interest.  Investing is hard and complicated. There are many smart players in the market. The good news is that you can hire someone smart to do this for you, instead of trying to figure this out alone. You need to have a lot of confidence when investing your hard earned savings. And confidence comes having good processes in place. Your relationship with an advisor can be nuanced. The really good ones stay with you for many years. They listen to you, understand your goals and fears, help you target specific goals, and make a plan for accomplishing them. They can help ensure that your money is invested methodically according to your plan. They can provide solid, structural risk management and best of means of execution to take advantage of market opportunities. Investing should disciplined, systematic, automatic, and data-driven. Most people don\u2019t have the time, energy, or resources to achieve this on their own. Make sure you do some independent research to find the right advisor for your personal finances. At qplum, we believe in building a community where we all can learn from each other. Our groups cover a broad range of subjects that appeal to new investors and experienced professionals. We do this so you have a community where you can meet new people, learn new skills, and never feel isolated. With finance, it\u2019s always good to have people you can lean on.

I believe you can do better than a financial advisor if you can and will do your homework. I've spoken to many financial advisors. Most are sooo focused on ultra-safe investments that they don't make you much money. They know you'll dump them in favor of someone else if they lose you any money. I run circles around financial advisors because I live and breathe the markets, do my homework and I'm willing to step up to the plate on investments advisors would never recommend. So, the answer to your question depends on you. ",

So, is it worth it for you to go to the doctor? Maybe. Get a checkup every once in a while. Go if you feel sick or if you have some health questions. But you probably don\u2019t need to go every day, week, month, or even year. Same as with financial advisors. And another thing, if all you are looking for is for someone to \u201cbeat the market\u201d with your investments, don\u2019t go to a financial advisor. Go to a fortune teller. Financial advisors can check over your finances and make recommendations that may allow you to develop a financial plan, improve cash flow, reduce expenses, reduce taxes, reduce financial risk, increase chances of reaching your retirement and other financial goals, provide financial peace of mind, and many other things. Financial advisors don\u2019t beat the market.

            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s not. Financial advisors affiliated with investment banks are out to maximize wealth for their companies and themselves, not for you. Even if they have a fiduciary duty to you (which many don\u2019t), they will limit their recommendations to products that give big kickbacks to their firm via 12b-1 fees, revenue-sharing, etc. In fact, studies have shown that if you work with a bank-affiliated financial advisor, you are likely to end up WORSE off than if you go it alone. It is a very sketchy industry. The best financial advice out there (which most financial advisors won\u2019t give you!) is to invest in index funds. This will minimize your fees and thereby maximize your returns. So, you just need to figure out is what proportion of stocks & bonds is appropriate for your situation, buy some index funds, and you\u2019re good to go. That\u2019s it. If you do decide to go with a financial advisor, choose one who charges by the hour (never by commissions or percentage of assets), set up your portfolio, and maybe check in once/year. That\u2019s all you need. And if that advisor recommends anything other than index funds, be very wary. ",

It includes bonds and so many different funds, emerging markets, international funds and you name it. I am hugely diversified in this fund. Now a team of EXPERTS watches the market and buy and sell shares of different commodities in this fund for me. I pay them a fee. I cannot do this for myself, not even remotely. Do they deserve to receive a fee for their work; I think so and so I gladly pay it because I do fine. I do not expect to make a killing in today\u2019s market, but want to preserve my hard earned money and watch it grow. I am invested at a moderate growth level and that is appropriate for my age. The fees I pay are tax deductible. So you decide if you are competent to invest your own money wisely; I simply was not. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the advice, and depends on the cost. Most individual investors can cover their basic investment needs through one or a few low cost index funds. Realize that the decision that will have the greatest impact on your investment return is how you split your investment pie, between stocks, income related investments, namely bonds, and cash. Using the so-called back of the envelope method of taking your age, subtracting that from 100, and using the remainder as the percentage to invest in stocks takes a minute or so. Understanding that you should max out any tax deferred or preferential opportunities, such as a 401-k plan also doesn\u2019t take much effort and can be done on your own. Purchasing term life insurance instead of whole, and eliminating your credit card debt are the next major financial decisions that you can make independently. That should cover most investors for their first million or up to several million dollars. Total cost? About 10 basis points (0.1%). maybe. Give or take a few. High cost investments, such as annuities, or hedge funds really shouldn\u2019t be part of your core investment planning up until you have exceeded that several million dollar point, or have some special investment circumstance / estate planning, such as providing guaranteed income for a disabled minor. But even in this circumstance you should be careful funding annuities. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There are many good answers to this question. I would add a response specific to India. In any geography that I know of it, it is *not necessary* to have a financial advisor. Almost any product that they would ever give a suggestion on can be bought by the individual herself. Contrast this with, say medicine, audit, etc. - there are restrictions on what an individual can buy directly. In India the situation is complicated by the vast number of \u2018advisors\u2019 who work on commissions. While they can give you some advice that is useful, they would evidently be driven by their arrangement with the provider of the products. People often take this advice - mostly given free - to be a complete financial plan; this typically leads to less optimal results. SEBI has regulations on Investment Advisors. A key provision is that they act in the interest of the client, and don\u2019t take any form of commission or other thing of value from the products that they suggest. In effect, the adviser acts in a fiduciary capacity. (The regulations don\u2019t use this phrase though.) These fee-only planners can help you in a more comprehensive way.

            "answer_text": "A research by the Queensland University of Technology found that financial advice has positive effects on clients' financial and general well-being, particularly for longer-term users. The majority of clients viewed financial advice as making a positive contribution to their financial well-being and to a range of psychological well-being factors, with highest agreement for sense of security (83 per cent), financial well-being (82 per cent), sense of control (78 per cent) and peace of mind (77 per cent). About half of the clients surveyed had been using the services of a financial planner for more than five years with about one quarter using services for more than 10 years. Clients using financial planning services for longer periods of time perceived themselves to be in a better financial situation and were more likely than those using services for shorter time periods to agree that financial advice contributes to the various dimensions of their well-being. Just over 50 per cent of clients rated their knowledge of financial matters as moderate while 40 per cent rated it as good to very good. Longer-term clients are more likely to perceive they have better knowledge and understanding of regulatory issues, suggesting that experience of financial planning and/or financial matters may play a role in developing clients' awareness of issues. Choosing an adviser is an important decision so take your time and ensure you feel comfortable in their qualifications and experience as the decision will likely impact on your future retirement. ",

Virtually anyone can hang up a sign claiming to be a financial advisor - no certification necessarily needed. Be careful and ask if the advisor gets paid a percentage of your portfolio or by the products he/she recommends. The latter is a red flag - advisors that get a bonus for recommending XYZ mutual funds. I use a fee-based financial planner in addition to my own investing experience. The fee model means that decisions are made jointly and all aspects of my financial life are covered, from investments to insurance, mortgage(s), rentals, and estate planning. Most advisors will not handle or are no qualified to cover all aspects of one\u2019s financial life. Many advisors are qualified and certified, no question.

            "answer_text": "That really depends upon what you mean by \u2018financial advisor\u2019 and what an advisor has to offer. Most people who are characterized as financial advisors are brokers for financial products. In other words, they don\u2019t really sell \u2018advice\u2019. They sell securities and insurance under the guise of \u2018financial management tools\u2019. Most investments in the stock market, futures and the masses of \u2018derivatives\u2019 have a VERY high chance of loss. The best mutual funds have been tracked to show maybe a 1% average gain over very long time frames and most of them show small losses over very long time frames. How odd then that the fund managers make billions on commissions. That\u2019s because these funds specifically intended for you to start putting money in and keep putting money in and don\u2019t ever withdraw. This is the kind of client that keeps the fund alive. \u2018Churning\u2019 of the fund is what creates commissions, and various fees and commissions are a big contributor to the erosion of the Clients\u2019 actual gains. Such \u2018investments\u2019 are often marketed on the theory that, IF you simply match the long term average appreciation of the S&P index you\u2019ll make a long term average return of 8%. For a variety of real world reasons, that just doesn\u2019t happen. One of the biggest reasons is the churning of the funds, but there are other contributing factors as well. Or they\u2019re marketing on the \u2018scenario\u2019 model. For example: \u201cIF you add this much per month, and IF you get an average 12% annual return that compounds, and IF you keep contributing for this many years, THEN at retirement IF you withdraw at this rate this is the income you\u2019ll have. The IF\u2019s and THEN\u2019s sound compelling, but in reality no one has ever seen them play out. You\u2019ll see a number of disclaimers in the \u2018fine print\u2019 that are required to tell you this, but most people ignore it in favor of hopeful thinking. The \u2018advisor\u2019 seems like a nice person who really cares about you and your retirement future, and his pitch sounds so confident and irresistible.

            "answer_text": "I have hired a financial adviser. Why? Well, do you see this list below?  List of cognitive biases from Buy the Cognitive Bias Codex print - only from jm3 & Design Hacks This is the list of cognitive biases that cause all sorts of mental mistakes in our brains. Some are innocuous, yet some are significant. So when I think about money, what my household takes in, and what is spent on both necessities and discretionary things and experiences, I fall victim to all sorts of cognitive biases that skew my decision making that often leads to sub-optimal and many times irrational decisions. Hiring and working with a fiduciary financial adviser that goes beyond rote investment recommendations leads to challenging discussions about why we do the things we do with money. Frequently my financial adviser sees the things I do not see myself because I am blinded by my own cognitive biases. This independent perspective, a perspective outside my own personal experience, is tremendously valuable in identifying poor financial decision making and poor behavior around money. This is why I\u2019ve hired a financial adviser, and if your financial adviser doesn\u2019t engage in this kind of bias discovery with you for the fees that you pay, perhaps you may want to consider finding another adviser who does.

            "answer_text": "An interesting question. To me investing money requires a specific set of skills and great knowledge. Each of the people who have provided answers to your question have these skills and knowledge yet they have provided sometimes conflicting perspectives. As a business owner who has finally gotten past just surviving on a day to day basis I began to wonder what I should do with my excess income. It became very clear that I would either have to take the time to acquire a new set of skill and grow my base of knowledge of financial planning and investment as well as add the tasks of managing a portfolio to my to-do list OR find someone else to do this. I\u2019ve met a number of people over the years who are actively involved in managing other peoples money. None of them struck me as all that good at it. So I looked for an alternative . I found it in a new technology based form of investment management. There are a handful of relatively new companies that have sprung up that use sophisticated algorithms that buy, sell, track and manage investment capital. These \u201crobo-investment \u201c firms like Betterment | Rethink What Your Money Can Do and Wealthfront - Planning & Investing Made Easy are reviewed in this article:Top 5 Robo-Advisors in 2017 that might help you. These service charge less than human financial advisors and have been out performing even the best. Both Betterment and Wealthfront have over $5 billion in funds they manage. As a business owner I just have too much to take care of to learn and manage my own program. For some reason I trust computers to know and act on my behalf better than a person even though I know there are people behind the computers. Don\u2019t know if that makes sense but I recommend you check into it. I\u2019m making money using Betterment. Good luck and godspeed! ",
