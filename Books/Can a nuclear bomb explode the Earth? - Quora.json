            "answer_text": "Theoretically, one could 'blow up' the earth with a (or several simultaneous) huge explosion in/on/near the planet, but that scale is well beyond our current technology. Think about the scale, the mass you're dealing with. A fireball a few miles across with a proportional shockwave is still insignificant compared to a 25,000 mile circumference, dense ball of matter. You may be able to screw up the atmosphere for a while\u2026 and kill much, maybe all humankind, by detonating a lot of bombs strategically\u2026 throwing particles and radiation into the atmosphere, but realistically, using every weapon made at one time could make\u2026 Madagascar go away most likely. Now, one could get creative and maybe 'push' the moon out of orbit (maybe too big still) or 'steer' an asteroid at the earth for a gigaton type impact. Perhaps amplifying plate fault lines for a \u201cblow up the very outermost layer, sort of\u201d effect? Even then, our planet is quite large relative to nuke weapons. If you could grab some \u2018sun\u2019 - or a few cups of neutron star, that'd be potent. ",

If you turned all the uranium currently present in the Earth\u2019s crust into fissile material (not an easy task), it would not be sufficient. If you simultaneously exploded all existing nuclear weapons currently in the world\u2019s arsenals\u2026 Not even close. As noted, the huge asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs dug an enormous hole in the Earth\u2019s crust and threw this molten material out of the atmosphere\u2026. But other than a major extinction event it did essentially nothing to the structure of the planet. ",

We could, however, render it useless for agriculture, and therefore uninhabitable. A few hundred Castle Bravo style detonations would do it. Bravo was a 15 megaton blast that was about 1/3 fusion, and 2/3\u2019s fission of a U238 tamper/pusher. The nasty fallout plume covered many square miles of mostly ocean, but islands 200 miles away had to be evacuated, and are still not great places to grow food you\u2019re going to eat. Proliferation is a serious threat. ",

            "answer_text": "The use of the term \u201ca nuclear bomb\u201d indicates that you are asking if a SINGLE nuclear bomb could explode the Earth. At this time the answer is NO, not because enough fissionable material does not exist but because it would require the summation of ALL the nuclear material (if not substantially MORE) into a singular device and the delivery of that single device to the precise location on or in the Earth to maximize the effects of that powerful an explosion would be impossible. Exploding the Earth would be problematic even if such a precise placement existed. It might be possible to locate a position that would start a chain reaction in the Earth\u2019s mantle that could lead to its destruction but without an explosion of Earth occurring. Remember, I said at this time. Who knows what the future holds? ",

It\u2019s the life on Earth that will suffer for centuries (or more), but all life will not be extinguished. In any case, the planet Earth would survive a nuclear war just fine. Here\u2019s a fun little video that says it all nicely.  However, as far as the impact on just one city, well that\u2019s a bit more sobering thought. It would be devastating in that area. This video shows what to expect from just a single weapon.  ",
