            "answer_text": "New 52 Superman could but most versions can't. Most versions once exposed to a red star their powers immediately go away. Here\u2026 Let me show you\u2026  Here's New 52 Superman on Krypton watching his own parents. If you're wondering about the suit, once he arrives on Krypton the suit changes to that color. Superman theorized it was his kryptonian bio-armor way of helping him conserve his powers under a red sun. But then we are shown that was not the case\u2026  So here the suit returns to normal and Superman is still using his powers on Krypton. He later theorized that because he was exposed to the energy of a yellow sun for decades, that his body gained a resistance to the effects of a red sun.  Here is Superman with one version of Jor-El deep down into Krypton crust.  This is Rebirth Superman. Basically a retcon version (but still basically the same) of the Pre-New52 Superman.   As you can see Superman up until this point he has his powers fully active. But\u2026    As he was sent to a solar system with a red star his powers in a manner of seconds begin to disappear. Which was also mainly true in almost every Pre-New52 versions of Superman.  There is however one exception! This was shown to us in the DCAU. When Superman is sent to the future of the Earth when its sun became a red star. Superman had no powers on Earth. But with the help of Vandal Savage, he was able to get his hands on a miniature power sphere that was like a miniature yellow sun. With that power sphere in his possession his powers immediately began to return. Meaning that for Superman to have powers on Krypton or any solar system with a red star he needs something that provides him with yellow sun energy. If he has that then he can have powers even in a red sun environment. JLU Superman as Army of Darkness' Ash! ",
