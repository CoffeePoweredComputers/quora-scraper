            "answer_text": "Michel de Montaigne invented the essay and coined the name (in French). He is always asking himself how much he really knows, thinking for himself, and he explores the limits of his understanding rather than regurgitate things by rote. Montaigne is the exemplar of what the Essai does. He has influenced many subsequent writers, some serious, some writing to entertain and amuse us. As for writers who wrote things that are similar, here are a few: Francis Bacon - EssaysSir Thomas Browne - Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial and Pseudodoxia EpidemicaRalph Waldo Emerson - EssaysSamuel Johnson - Lives of the Poets, essays on the plays of ShakespeareDavid Hume - EssaysThomas Mann - Essays of Three DecadesHenry James - The Art of the NovelE. M. Forster - Aspects of the NovelFrank O\u2019Connor - The Mirror by the Roadway, The Lonely VoiceBertrand Russell - Why I am not a Christian, A History of Western PhilosophyVirginia Woolf - A Room of One\u2019s OwnLytton Strachey - Eminent VictoriansJorge Luis Borges - the distinction between his stories and essays is hard to make at times.

            "answer_text": "I not would say that there are similar books. Montaigne invented the essay in the first place. Essay comes from the French \u201cessai,\u201d which means \u201ca try.\u201c While Montaigne was one of the most influential European writers and philosophers of the Renaissance, I don\u2019t think anyone set out to imitate him. If they did, their works no longer exist. Along with Shakespeare and many others, Montaigne influenced both Friedrich Nietzsche and Ralph Waldo Emerson, both of whom wrote essays. Maybe you take a look at them and see if you can see Montaigne\u2019s ideas reflected in what they wrote. ",
