You can pay a professional editor to do the work or you can follow a number of alternative paths to the (hopefully) same result. Many beginning writers just don\u2019t have the cash to pay hundred of dollars to get their book edited, so that option is not realistic. So, the alternatives\u2026 BETA Group. This is a group of peers who read your work and give constructive feedback. Pick them from your writer\u2019s group or approach friends and family who are relatively well read. It\u2019s a sort of many eyes can find things that a single set might miss. Often writers will form a group of 5\u20136 who will do this for each other throughout the writing process, meeting weekly over coffee or whisky to talk read and reflect.Quid pro Quo. Find another writer who is at a similar level of skill and offer to edit their work in exchange for their editing yours.Mentor. Find an editor or professional writer who is willing to teach. The process of editing becomes the platform for the instruction.Delay method. You become your own editor. Put some time, at least six months, between the completion of your first draft and the revision process. The time will enable you to view the work with a bit more clarity. Work on something else during the interim.The kindly elder. Depending largely on your age, there may be any number of people who will gladly help you by editing your book. These might be teachers, grandparents, aunts or uncles or other people you know who will do it for you because they just love helping out emerging artists.Publisher. Most publishers take on new authors in what they recognize as pretty raw. Your agent will see the potential in your work, but will recognize when it needs to be honed for the market. Publishing houses have editors who know the ins and out of the market and can help you polish and focus your work. Proceeds from your book pay the salary of the whole publication team from editor to layout artist. The more work they have to do will of course cut into the royalties they pay you, but if it makes the book sell, why not?",

Get beta readers who are experienced editors who read your book for entertainment. As occupational obsessive compulsive behaviour kicks in and they offer their expertise to improve your writing, thank them for their help. Of course, this doesn\u2019t work if you write rubbish. Editors don\u2019t read rubbish for fun, they get paid to read rubbish, so why should they edit your rubbish for free. I know there are people who say I\u2019m lucky to have editors among my enthusiastic beta readers, but it\u2019s not luck. I had been writing for two decades before I thought about publishing my work. Two decades of honing my skills. Trading critique with other writers \u2014 reading their work and providing feedback, while they do the same for you \u2014 and being fearless about showing your drafts so you can improve yourself through constructive criticism. Nobody is waiting for your novel. You can edit it yourself, you can hunt around for beta readers, but if you want a professional editor to take a look, you will need to invest either time or money.

EDIT: Due to a question merger, my answer is a little out of place as what I describe is certainly not free. The original question I answered to was: \u201cHow can I get my novel edited?\u201d You may have writer friends who may offer to help - that may work, but being a good writer doesn\u2019t necessarily make one a good editor. The problem is to find someone who is not only good but who also works well with you - a question of chemistry. There is a reason why writers and editors are often long-term collaborators (some of them are even married - figuratively as well as occasionally literally). You can find professional editors through a web search, on sites for freelancing gigs. Sometimes, editors are listed in the imprint of a book. In my experience though, the best way to find one is asking other writers for a referral. Also check for other projects your candidate has worked on - not just in terms of quality but also in terms of genre. Good professional editors will offer a small sample either for free or for little money. They may be picky about their projects, though. One word of warning: There are a lot of good editors out there, but also very bad ones and scammers as well. Personally, I would avoid working with a text services agency (they often underbid and oversell and treat their staff like s**t). In any case, ask for a direct contact to the editor working on your text. Good luck. ",

There are a lot of scams out there, of services which will offer to publish your work for a fee, will give you lists of editors to hire, artists to do cover illustrations you can pay, etc. These are not how publishing traditionally work, and should be avoided. An old adage is \u201cMoney flows towards the author\u201d. Avoid any arrangement that tries to change that around. If you want to self-publish, fine, but remember that the job of a publisher is different than the job of an author, and money will flow away from you-as-publisher, even if it always flows towards you-as-author.

My point here is that if you want to consider yourself a writer, you\u2019ll have to learn to edit it and fix it yourself. Actually, reading your question again, I\u2019d say, we can assume you can already do these things. In which case you need an editor to read it and tell you where the problems are, where it lags and where it needs to be reshuffled. That kind of editor is around and available. Expect to shell out one or two thousand bucks, depending on what you want them to do and not do. On this, you need to come to a very firm understanding of what the work will and will not entail. This is a very important point. Expect to pay something going in and you should agree to progress payments along the way. ",

Their editing skills vary, and it\u2019s not reasonable to expect a full line edit from a beta reader. If you sell a book to a publisher, the editor there will edit your book. Many literary agents also provide some editing help before subbing the book to publishers. If you\u2019re self-publishing, this obviously isn\u2019t an option. If you follow editors, agents and authors online, you may see giveaways for manuscript critiques, but these are usually only partial critiques.
