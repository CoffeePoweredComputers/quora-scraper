            "answer_text": "You are asking about who the authors of the publications, books, and articles are. Some subjects and the kind of writing is straightforward and very easy, which makes substituting authors into that writing role very easy. Some subjects and the level they are examined at are more difficult, and therefore require someone with greater expertise who also has a reasonably good writing ability. Books depending on their composition and arrangement can be very instructive, structured, and methodical in how they teach you or organize the entire subject within the book and its scope. The communication pattern is also very different between a book and some authors and an article and some authors, wherein the length is greater and usually focused on an academic program if a textbook or it is for field publication as a public good. And the articles are shorter length, intended as news and reports, and may have more concrete and broadcasted kinds of style and intended effect. An article can also be seen in a research journal, such as a short report or entry into that journal, making a volume of such articles bounded to the research and specific interests of the contributing authors. That is still a differing way to read the material as compared to textbooks in academics, because the books are usually more well thought out and the arrangement of words is intended to be very explanatory and solid. Mostly, you can judge someone by whom that person reads, meaning the authors and sources that person can comprehend and interpret based upon the reason or purpose they started reading that work. There are specific field leaders, figures in history, or researchers whose published work is very rare and their specific occupation and role in the institution is also rare, as compared to more common and widely distributed public materials. For a well rounded and good conversational approach to most relationships and encounters in public, you should be well read in the news, reports, and media broadcasts, because these are intended to keep the populace up to date and informed about our society and surrounding world.

            "answer_text": "In the first place books are usually a good bit longer than articles with more room for facts. Hopefully the book\u2019s author put in the time researching what he is writing about and gets his facts right. Most authors of articles do this also but in my opinion you are more likely to encounter inaccuracies in articles than in (nonfiction) books. Then too articles are more likely to be more concerned with opinion than fact. Article authors are likely to be working for an Overlord who tells them what their opinion is; something book authors don\u2019t usually suffer. Books also have more room for reasoned arguments and opposing points of view. Books are usually more comprehensive and have more detail. Articles just don\u2019t have the room for depth and comprehension. Articles are a one-trick pony. ",
