            "answer_text": "Firstly, I really appreciate that you are trying to take the studies seriously. Coming to your answer, see there are around 7\u20138 methods of learning. Following are some of the examples - Visual - People remember by seeing the pictures etc. Like in comics, paintings etc. If you can remember comics easily, then this is your best method.By hearing - People listen to the audio books, songs, radio etc and they grasp the things easily. If you find it easy to remember complete songs or follow radio commentary, then this is your best method.By reading - People who find it easy to remember by reading, are generally fond of novels, blogs etc.Studying in group - Such people want the support of positive energies to be around them. They can remember the things only through discussions, debates etc.Studying in isolation - Some people can not tolerate even a single disturbance. They have a great focus, but they need to be alone to concentrate and learn.Logical Reasoning - Some people are never able to learn the things, until they understand it completely. For example, historical dates rarely have any logic in them. But science is bound to have logic in it. Science is comparatively easier and history, geography is very difficult for the people that possess the logical method of learning.Please note all these are just rough and incomplete ideas that I read somewhere sometimes back. I would advise you to try remembering your chapters using all the above methods. The method through which you are able to grasp the maximum content, is probably the best method for you. In simple words, salt, sugar and chilies are all used to add taste. But if you add salt for making tea and sugar for making chicken, the results may never be good. Same is the case with your method of studies. You are progressing on the correct path, but only you need to follow YOUR most suitable method of learning. Once you find it, you can easily go on to complete a whole book in 3 days or less, without any stress. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah i can understand I\u2019m also practicing engineering . There are a few methods: 1) Attention span can be increased just like endurance at any activity, through exercise. Read more and you will be able to read more. Figure out your current attention span. Let's say it's 25 minutes. Set goals to slowly raise it. Read for 25 minutes. Then next time read for 40 minutes. And so on. 2) The biggest enemy of attention is distraction. Remove all distractions, like cell phones, Facebook ,Twitter and \u201cPORN\u201d. Get yourself a white noise generator, if background sounds distract you. 3) After removing exterior distractions, you're left with your own interior distractions - the things that make you start thinking about other things. The most recommended way for dealing with those distractions is meditation. 4) Read more interesting books. 5) Engage yourself in the reading by making it active by highlighting or taking notes. Odds are, though, you'll hit physical limitations, like eye strain or a full bladder, long before finishing a 300 page book. An important point I feel I should mention is that if your intent from reading a 300 page book is to learn the content of that book, then you are not helping yourself by reading longer. Your working memory and cognitive load will saturate based on the amount of content, long before a 300 page book is completed. Once you've hit those limits, you are fooling yourself by continuing to read. Your brain will not be able to retain the information - and there isn't much you can do about that. For learning purposes, reading small sections and then stopping for awhile to let your brain process the material before reading more, is essential. If you're just reading for entertainment, then the more the better! I've spent many a Sunday afternoon working through a few hundred pages of a good novel. Once my imagination had sunk into one of the Harry Potter books, the only thing that interrupted my reading was urgent signals from my bladder, several hours later. So, all the very best buddy !!
