            "answer_text": "Q: Is Global warming man made or just a natural occurance? Here\u2019s a shocker. How about if it\u2019s both? The fact is, mean temperature and everything that goes with it has fluctuated throughout the history of the earth, long before man ever existed. There have been many causes that we know of, and there are many we don\u2019t. The earth is perfectly capable of resetting the thermostat by itself. That is not to say that the cause of the latest round of climate change isn\u2019t man\u2019s emissions. It\u2019s also not to say that the current round of climate change isn\u2019t a blend of a natural swing and man\u2019s emissions. However, it\u2019s pretty undeniable that increases in carbon dioxide lead to warming, lowering of pH in the oceans, and other complications, and it\u2019s also pretty undeniable that man in digging up fossil fuel and burning it is releasing carbon dioxide that was long sequestered back into the atmosphere. Therefore, whether we caused the latest round of climate change or we\u2019re just piggy-backing onto a natural cycle, our behavior certainly isn\u2019t helping and is probably amplifying it. The key is to think rationally and maintain healthy skepticism of anyone who offers an absolutist opinion either for or against manmade climate change. There is plenty of evidence supporting the existence of man\u2019s impact, but nothing is simple about multivariable systems. The uninformed often see things as absolutely one way or the other simply because they are not accounting for all the variables, or they\u2019re to some degree unethical and, fully aware of the license they\u2019re taking, they try to bolster their arguments by introducing controversial reconstructed data or disputed models into their arguments either for or against as incontrovertible fact. No matter what anyone says, the degree to which climate change is attributable to man and the extent of our ability to curtail its effects is not a debate that\u2019s settled among scientists. The truth in complex systems, as in most things, is often between the two poles of the extremes of thought. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "It is both. It is natural because, we always had warming periods between ice ages. Our planet has gone thru 5 ice ages in last 2.5 billion years. What do you think exists between two ice ages? it is warm period. It is in these warm periods that flora and fauna evolved. In warm periods they evolve and in ice ages they perish. Now in the last ice age, humans have evolved along with other multi celled species. This warm period is very precious to all living creatures on the planet. This warm period is going to end naturally drowning the planet into the next ice again. This is a natural cycle. We also call it man made because of rapid release of CO2 into the atmosphere and not giving enough time for the atmosphere to balance itself and causing atmospheric turbulence resulting in erratic climatic conditions. It is not the heat that would bother us in the future, it is the unsettling atmospheric turbulence. Every time CO2 level in the atmosphere increases, it traps more heat and atmosphere has to balance itself to the new reality. If CO2 emissions are slow and steady, the atmospheric imbalance will not be life threatening even though it exists mildly and there will be enough time for flora and fauna to adapt. However, what is happening now is that we are releasing 40 GtCO2/year and our planet can absorb only half of it. The planet\u2019s average temperature is going up by a degree every decade. It means that by the time atmosphere adjusts to the new CO2 level, some more CO2 would have been added. This atmospheric turbulence will continue until we slowdown the CO2 emission to a level that is sustainable and ingest-able by the planet and give the planet some breathing time to find an equilibrium. So far from past 100 years we have added about 1000 GtCO2 to the atmosphere. Before the industrial revolution our atmosphere had 2000 GtCO2 and now it has 3000 GtCO2. Last decade we were adding 35 GtCO2 per year and now we are adding 40 GtCO2/year and this rate will continue to raise because global economy is expanding. Skeptics keep saying that this level of CO2 was there many decades ago also. However two fundamental things they fail to grasp. It is not the CO2 level that decides the atmospheric turbulence, it is how fast it got in there. Was there enough breathing time for the atmosphere to adjust to that high level in those good old days? Was the atmosphere chaotic? They don\u2019t know, and it is hard even for the scientists to grab such kind of data from the past. Scientists can only detect how much CO2 was there many centuries ago, but they can\u2019t say how turbulent atmosphere was or at what pace CO2 was added. Because of this data ignorance we keep debating. I am the author of the award winning book \u201cUnleashing Artificial Intelligence Against Global Warming\u201d which deliberates such issues in depth.
