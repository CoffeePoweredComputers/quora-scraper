            "answer_text": "Equanimity (Emotional balance). Rest all they can learn with a balanced mind which can look at life and situation with calmness. Without emotional balance even a genius can not be successful or happy.    According to Buddhism: (source Wikipedia)In Buddhism, equanimity (upekkh\u0101, upek\u1e63h\u0101) is one of the four immeasurables and is considered: Neither a thought nor an emotion, it is rather the steady conscious realization of reality's transience. It is the ground for wisdom and freedom and the protector of compassion and love. While some may think of equanimity as dry neutrality or cool aloofness, mature equanimity produces a radiance and warmth of being. The Buddha described a mind filled with equanimity as \"abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill-will.\" ",
