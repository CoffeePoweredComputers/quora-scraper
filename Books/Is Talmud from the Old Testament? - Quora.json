            "answer_text": "Hmm. Sort of. Not exactly. The heart of the Talmud is called Mishnah, meaning \u2018repetition\u2019. What is repeated, are declarative statements of commandments FROM the Torah (and the Torah is the first five books of the Bible - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy). The larger part of the Talmud is called \u2018Gemara\u2019, meaning \u2018completion\u2019. Gemara consists of the records of discussions and debates carried out by various scholars, teachers and sages over a period of several hundred years, STARTING with one of those short mishnaic statements, and - basically - going off in different directions from there. Like the Congressional records, sometime the Gemara discussion is on topic, and sometimes somebody goes off on a tangent and throws in a story or idea or memory, which is only slightly related (if at all) to the original topic. Which is why you can find just about ANYTHING \u2018in the Talmud\u2019. There are straightforward legal discussions. There are ghost stories. There are debates on the fine points of the meaning of a particular legal term. There are recipes. There are discussions of contingencies, and \u2018what if\u2019 this or that esoteric event happened - what does this law mean in THIS case? And there are mother-in-law jokes. The sages agree, they disagree, they call on past authorities to support their position, they call on past authorities to dispute their position, they gossip about their coworkers. It\u2019s all in the Talmud. But yeah - the Talmud is from the \u2018Old Testament\u2019. We don\u2019t use that term for the Jewish Bible, but okay. The Mishnah is from Torah, but the Gemara sometimes brings in material from - anywhere. Talmud means \u2018the thing to be studied\u2019 and some people refer to its contents as \u2018the sea\u2019. It is not something to just READ. The entire Talmud seems to assume that you ALREADY know everything that is in it, as well as everything that is in the Bible (the Jewish Bible) AND a whole lot of other material, just to know what the first page is talking about. Starting into the Talmud is like jumping into the sea - it is continuous all around the world, and does not have a beginning or ending - it just IS. The first page is page two. I guess \u2018page one\u2019 is all the material you are already supposed to know before you start. You can also start just about anywhere, because there is no sense of \u2018chapter one comes before chapter two\u2019. You can start at any place you like. In English translations, most Talmuds weigh in at 40 to 70 volumes - depending on the edition, and which commentaries are included. ALL editions of the Talmud include several major commentaries on it, printed in the (wide) margins surrounding the Gemara which surrounds the Mishna. And in addition to the \u2018big commentators\u2019 - like Rashi or Nachmanides - there are entire books of commentaries by other scholars over the last thousand plus years or so, who didn\u2019t get included. Children usually start with Talmud study somewhere in the middle, with the laws of lost and found articles, because a lot of that is fairly concrete. I think the first mishnah in that section is something like \u2018if you find your neighbor\u2019s donkey, you must return it\u2019. And the Gemara goes on with things like - what if it wasn\u2019t a donkey? what if it was stolen? what if it is dead? What if you don\u2019t like your neighbor? what if you don\u2019t know who the donkey belongs to? what if it has an identifying tag on it? What if it doesn\u2019t? what if it was a chicken? What it if was a chicken and you can\u2019t find the owner? Suppose you can\u2019t find the owner and you take the chicken home and it has babies? and they have babies? Do you own the eggs? do you own the babies? what if the owner shows up and the original chicken is dead but you now have 372 chickens and you\u2019ve been selling the eggs for the last ten years? what if you spent money feeding the chickens? Does the original owner (who lost one chicken) get one chicken, or does he get ALL the chickens - and does he have to reimburse you for the chicken feed (less, of course, your profit from selling eggs)? (and at this point, somebody was reminded of a traditional recipe for making a poultice for injured chickens, and here it is). What if you found a purse with money in it? What if you just found money scattered on the ground? What if you SAW something on the ground but you pointed it out to your friend and your friend picked it up? What if you can\u2019t find the owner? Is it yours? Is it your friend\u2019s? Do you split it? how do you split something that can\u2019t be divided? What if your friend says he saw it first, he just didn\u2019t SAY anything at the time? Suppose you DID find the owner, but you had to spend money on advertising. Does the owner need to pay you for your time and trouble? yes, no and how much? why? And that, dear reader, is \u2018the Talmud\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "The Talmud is a set of Jewish books consisting of Oral Law, discussions and arguments about the laws as well as little tidbits of life and ideas and stories from the teachers who were discussing the laws, and commentaries. Because it is a set of JEWISH books, we use Jewish terms: for Jews there is no \u2018Old testament\u2019, we have the ONLY Testament\u2014the Hebrew Bible, known to us as the TaNaKh or TaNach. That is written Torah and tradition, and along with that came oral and visual explanations that eventually, when Jews were being forced into the diaspora, got written down so that the oral law would not be totally forgotten. The oral law that was written down became known as the MIshna. Thus, Mishna is \u2018oral Law\u2019 part of the Talmud; the discussions and arguments and stories and tidbits of life are the \u2018Gmara\u2019 part of the Talmud. In the Gmara part, there are often references to TaNaKh, because that is a core of our tradition and instruction. Therefore, the Talmud is NOT from the TaNaKh, but is based on and contains quotes from and references to, TaNaKh. ",
