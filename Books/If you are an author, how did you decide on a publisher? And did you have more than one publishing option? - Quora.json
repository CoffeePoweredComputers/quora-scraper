            "answer_text": "I wanted a publisher that would do very thorough editing, provide technical review for the book, produce the book, and put a lot of effort into marketing it. I had several options, and one even went to a contract before I backed out. Find a great publisher that met all of my criteria has meant that it\u2019s taken longer than I expected to get the book out, but I\u2019d rather have a solid product with a good consumer base than just get a book out there somewhere. If you\u2019re new to publishing, a publisher that will walk you through each step and be very thorough about it is a very good thing, particularly if you might want to publish more books in the future.

            "answer_text": "If you use an agent, they put your book in front of a bunch of publishers. Some will be interested in bidding on the book. There is often some kind of an auction. You don\u2019t have to choose the highest bidder, you might decide after having met some of the publishers that one or another would do the best job. In each case where I put a book out for bids, I chose the highest bidder \u2014 but that was because they were the ones who best understood the value of the book and had the most resources to promote it. If you are selecting between reputable publishers on a basis other than the size of the advance or the richness of the royalties, you may also choose based on their distribution (e.g. do they have good foreign rights sales, do they have textbook sales), how fast they can get the book out, or how much you respect the editor.
