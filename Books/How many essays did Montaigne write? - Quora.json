            "answer_text": " A better question would be, how many essays did Michel de Montaigne publish? After all, who knows how many drafts Montaigne\u2014a fastidious writer\u2014tossed in the fire? The Complete Essays of Montaigne translated by Donald M. Frame (Palo Alto, California: Stanford University Press, 1989) lists 107 essays from 1572-1588. That\u2019s 57 essays in Book I, 37 in Book II and 13 in Book III. Donald Murdoch Frame, professor emeritus of French at Columbia, says in his Notes on the Translation that he based it on the Bordeaux Copy. That is the copy of the 1588 (fifth) edition in which Montaigne wrote annotations and marginalia in his own hand. My own copy, alas, is of a much more recent vintage:  Anyway, Donald Frame earned his doctorate with a dissertation on Montaigne. If he says the collection is complete, I\u2019m inclined to take his word for it. Dr Frame does say that he included \u201cvariants of earlier editions of the Essays (1580, 1582, 1587), as well as post-1588 additions that were deleted after being written.\u201d He made these available in the footnotes \u201cwhenever they seemed interesting enough to mention (italics mine).\u201d So Montaigne\u2019s translator tossed some drafts in the fire himself, metaphorically speaking. I love Paul Landowski\u2019s statue of Montaigne at the Square Paul Painlev\u00e9 on rue des Ecoles. It\u2019s in the 5th arrondissement, across the street from the Sorbonne. See the shiny toe of Montaigne\u2019s slipper? That\u2019s from generations of anxious students rubbing Montaigne\u2019s foot for luck on the way to their exams. I\u2019m superstitious, so I rubbed it myself (I stayed at the Hotel Sully Saint Germain on rue des Ecoles, a few blocks from this statue).
