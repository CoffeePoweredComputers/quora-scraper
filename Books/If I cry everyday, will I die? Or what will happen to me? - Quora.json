            "answer_text": "If you cry everyday it is called as self pity. Only if others feel sorry for us, and help us it is worth crying. A little crying to get over the pain and sorrow is good to relieve us and it helps to relax. But continuing to cry everyday over something is not good for our body, mind and for our self confidence. We all feel like this sometimes in our life. Crying is a waste of time, energy, tears, water and salt from your body. Your body needs salt and water for proper conduction of messages in your nervous system. Water is essential for all activities in our body. Too much crying when really sad can lead to depression, blood pressure because of the stress of loneliness. But it will not kill you so soon. You will only pass time all sad and filled with negative thoughts,swollen eyes, headache, dryness and depression. So get up, stop all this and move on. Feel fresh and reborn. Wear good clothes, eat well and don't let anybody make you cry. You are a strong person. My best wishes and prayers are with you. ",
