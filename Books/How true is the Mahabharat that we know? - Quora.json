            "answer_text": "Mahabharata has had many versions over the years. The South and North versions, The Bengali Mahabharata, the one translated by C. Rajagopalachari all of them presented the epic of Mahabharata in their own way. There were however over the time many distortions of the epic and many later additions as well as interpolations. The writings of the Mahabharata were originally retrieved from manuscripts over thousands. The critical edition published by Bhandarkar institute of Oriental research was done after a lot of research over the various versions, manuscripts over the years. They excised some slokas from the Mahabharata which they believe to be interpolations or later additions to the epic, So the CE has comparatively lesser amount of slokas than any other version. I personally believe the Mahabharata epic was real since it presents name of those kingdoms or states and geographical locations which is still present today in the modern times but there just might be some exaggerations or fictional stories present, this is just my opinion.

Then kumbakonam south edition Gita press gorakhpur and c rajagopalchari are most oldest and authentic. But I want to say one thing the image of mahabharata is mostly created in our minds is of TV serials and fake novels. Who who have read these books have true knowledge ",
