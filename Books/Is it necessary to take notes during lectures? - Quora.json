            "answer_text": "I almost never take notes. I find notes are good for learning specifics, but bad for gaining a good understanding - which is what you should be striving for. Taking notes makes you focus on the specifics and semantics of what the teacher is saying. Just listening to the professor helps you remember the gist of what they are teaching; all of the unnecessary details melt away, and you are left with a basic understanding. There's no such thing as multitasking; your brain can really only process one thing at a time. In the case of class, your brain is working only on eithet transcribing or translating. I find translating to be much more effective.  For example, a professor walks through a math problem on the board. You could either follow along and write what they wrote verbatim, hoping that you will be able to decipher and understand it later as you study for your final, or you can listen to the professor and try to understand what they are doing as they are doing it - no need to study it later.

            "answer_text": "'Necessary', no. There's no universal formula for this, it depends on a case by case basis. Some take notes of everything, others just listen to the professor. Personally I barely take any notes during lectures except for when the prof says something that is not on his or her slides. Actually you just said that yourself: most content is found in textbooks and other reading materials, but not all content. My real learning process happens when I rehearse and make exercises.  So no it's definitely not necessary but whether it's a good thing to do or not depends entirely on you. ",
