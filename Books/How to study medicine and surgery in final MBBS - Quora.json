            "answer_text": "Welcome to the final year of MBBS. Having just completed my final year, I am quite eligible to answer this question. And to be honest this answer is not intended for toppers as I ain\u2019t one. :) First and foremost, Medicine and Surgery are vast subjects - oceans. So, if you\u2019re gonna explore the whole of it, be prepared to get drowned. Its not possible and neither is it practical. But what you should always have in your mind when approaching these two mamoth subjects, is, strategy. Let me elaborate a little. I will say from both perspectives of the university exam as well as gaining knowledge. Medicine It is the amalgamation of Physiology, Pathology and Pharmacology. So, if you have these basics right, medicine should be easy to understand. If you haven\u2019t studied well all these, then there\u2019s no point in wasting time re-reading them in final year. That should have been done in Part-1. You can take up any book like Davidson (which I didn\u2019t like), Kumar & Clark (wonderful but vast), Cecil (short but too concise), or any other book. If you\u2019re not a topper and have never touched Harrison, please don\u2019t if you don\u2019t want to mess up. For clinics you can use Arup Kundu (jewel of jewels), Macleod, Hutchison. This array of books are more than enough to provide you vast knowledge of medicine. If you have more interest you can pick up Oxford handbook or Washington manual for a short read. Next comes the university exam part. If you are able to devote time, Matthew is a wonderful read. Or else stick to last year papers, quest/buster and notes. Trust me, final year MB exam is the most hectic exam you\u2019ll give till date. Do not miss postings. I cannot emphasize this more. You\u2019ll learn more at bedside than at your study table. Be meticulous about minute things when examining a patient. Those will count marks. If you don\u2019t want to go through all these, but want a great tutor, there\u2019s no alternative to Rakesh Nair if you have time (if you start at the beginning, you\u2019ll have time). He is the god of medicine. Unsurpassed. Surgery Well, surgery gave me lot of troubles at the beginning of my final year. It is a different ball game and unlike medicine you just can\u2019t get surgery out of some basic subjects though anatomy and pathology are fundamental to it. So, surgery needs to be treated differently. Take up SRB or Manipal (former the better) as per your choice and go through it. I had severe problems with understanding concepts, so I took uup classes by Pritesh Singh which was wonderful. Though many people advocate reading Bailey as a first read, but the truth is Bailey cant fetch you marks in theory exam as it is more like that of Robbins. Great to gain knowledge, but poor for reproducing them in exam. Clinics are mandatory. Take up books like M.L. Saha or S. Das or Bailey\u2019s clinical methods for clinics. Do know the clinical methods for common cases very well. They will be covering all you need to know. Washington manual or Schwartz handbook is again wonderful for short reads. Ultimately whatever subject it might be, you need a solid base of knowledge on which the base of clinical examination stands upon. So, both are equally important. I have seen people neglect either. Don\u2019t do that. Also, when going to clinics, from now on learn to communicate, because communication is the key. Respect the patient and thank him/her in the end. Be empathetic. Treat a patient like a patient and not like a case. Thank you. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Medicine and surgery are very vast subjects and studying their textbooks is a herculean task. Moreover, it\u2019ll take up most of your time and the yield will be very low. You can attend classes by Dr. Rohan Khandelwal for surgery and Dr. Deepak Marwah for Medicine or any other reputed faculty. That way you\u2019ll have all the must know things in these subjects at one place. Once you have understood the subject, the textbooks will be easier to read and grasp. You can also add extra points from textbooks and clinics to your notes, so that before any exam be it proffs or pg entrance, you can quickly revise everything. ",
