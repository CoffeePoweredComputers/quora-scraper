            "answer_text": "I can give you a brief overview of how I self-published my book: Write the manuscript.Get some other eyes on it. Line up some beta readers. Hire a professional editor and proofreaders \u2014 or get someone with skill in those areas to volunteer their time. Errors in self-published books are one of the main reasons for poor reviews.Design an attractive cover. Pull up the bestsellers in your genre on Amazon and see what their covers look like \u2014 and design your cover in a similar style. (This should be done by a professional if you are not artistically inclined.) The cover is one of the most important parts of your book. It\u2019s what gives readers an immediate sense of what the book is about. If it doesn\u2019t match what readers expect in your genre, they will be disappointed in your book. For example, if your cover makes your book look like a Young Adult fantasy \u2014 but your book is really a romance for adults \u2014 you will get some nasty reviews from a bunch of ticked-off teenagers.Format your book for Kindle and/or Createspace (Amazon\u2019s print-on-demand service). You can find professionals to do this for you for under $100.Fill out the screens in Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) and/or Createspace to upload your book. With KDP, your book can be reviewed in less than 24 hours and will be available for sale shortly after you approve it. With Createspace, I recommend you order a proof before approving. This adds extra time to the publishing process, but it\u2019s well worth it.",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer you on two levels. First is the where do you do it, second is the how. You probably know that companies such as Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Kobo, and Smashwords make it possible to publish your ebook \u2014 for free. You need to load honest information about who you are (even if you use a pen name) and how you will pay your taxes on the income. You also need to provide a bank account (or in some cases a Pay Pal account) so you can be paid. You could consider loading only to Amazon and an aggregator. Smashwords is an aggregator and they load your book to a bunch of sites, such as BN, Kobo and more. They save you a lot of work. Another aggregator is Draft2Digital, but I pretty much use Smashwords. Amazon\u2019s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) http://kdp.amazon.com Smashwords www.smashwords.com Nook Press for Barnes and Noble www.nookpress.com Kobo http://www.writinglife.com Google Play Partner Program https://play.google.com/books/publish/ All of these sites have instructions about how to prepare your book, and how to load it to their site. Study these carefully. I learned how by relying on the Smashwords Style Guide, which is written in an easy-to-understand format. All style guides and instructions are free to download. Smashwords Style Guide, an Ebook by Mark Coker Instructions are largely similar, but there are some differences. For example, Amazon wants you to do the Table of Contents (required for most books) one way, and Smashwords another way. I would suggest you start with Amazon. It\u2019s easy and you can preview your book immediately. You need to preview to make sure it looks as you expect. I have prepared a (free) short course called Thinking through Self-Publishing. Lifelong Dreams There is a second course on the site with lots of practical how-to info on writing, publishing, and marketing ($29). However, you can learn what you need by studying free info at the sites. You can also go to my blog index, where you will see lots of how-to articles. All those are free! Index Sometimes it will seem like a lot of info to absorb, but you can do it. If you get frustrated by something, take a break and come back to it. One final point. You only get one chance to make a first impression. Do not publish your first draft of your book! Put it in a drawer and come back to it a bit later so you can be a cold reader. Ask others for comments, but do remember, all choices are yours. If you can, pay for an editor. Good luck!! Elaine L. Orr www.elaineorr.com ",
