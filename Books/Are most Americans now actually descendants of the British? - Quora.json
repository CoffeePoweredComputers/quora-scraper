            "answer_text": "Most White Americans with older family roots will have some ancestry from the British Isles. But, it depends on what you mean by \"British.\" Is a Welsh-speaking ancestor that migrated from Wales in the 1800s \"British?\" Are Scottish or Northern Irish that came in the 1700s \"British?\"  In any event, regardless of your definition, a large percentage of White Americans will often come from a mix of old and newer immigrant/settler stock. And even in families that maintain they \"are\" such-and-such ethnicity, they are often quite mixed with various northern European backgrounds. So, even in families that say, \"We are totally German\" or \"We are all Scot-Irish,' usually a detailed tree will show branches, particularly along various maternal lines, that are all over the European map. The few exceptions are those with very recent immigrant lines, or those that maintained insular marriage patterns to a very unique and even uncommon degree.  I do a considerable amount of genealogy on White Americans because I research Cherokee blood myth claims, and almost invariably these family roots go back to old colonial stock and are completely European. There is usually a fair amount of British Isle and even English background in most of these families I research. Even if a particular surname is known to be Huguenot or German or whatever, the descendants that inherit that patrilineal name will have multiple generations of other ancestors that had been in the country for quite a while.  Genetic studies are showing that most White Americans are surprisingly unmixed, racially, even while they blended European ethnicities to a very large extent. The levels of Native American and African American admixture hardly even show up. And it is only thanks to a very small percentage of the White-identified population, with really low admixture levels, that an extremely minute degree of non-European blood shows up in the \"average\" White American genome. The vast majority of Whites have no ancestry other than European. ",

            "answer_text": "Most white Americans (US citizens) are of partial British Isles descent, and Americans of mostly British Isles descent probably make up the single largest \"ethnic group\" in the United States. It should be noted that a large portion of this group has been in the US for so long that they no longer identify as \"British American\" or some specific British Isles ethnicity, but simply \"American.\" This is certainly the case for the South and parts of New England.  British settlers formed the vast majority of the colonial population, and racist and Anglo-centric immigration policies favored British immigrants over other immigrants for quite a long time.  While the US would receive steady immigration from other areas of the world, and varying quantities depending on the period, this immigration was never enough to really displace or overtake the initial British \"founder\" population and the natural increase of their descendants. The only group that would come the closest to the number of \"British-Isles descent Americans\" would be the Germans. Even then, there is a wide gap between these two groups.  It is true that, nowadays, the British American group is largely under-counted and has, in some areas, married into other groups (especially other European immigrant groups). People will often identify with the background of more \"recent\" immigration. There are, however, still areas of the US, such as the South, New England, The Atlantic States, Parts of the Midwest (such as Ohio, Kansas, ect), parts of the West and Pacific Northwest (especially Utah), where people of majority British descent form the majority of the white population. They most certainly are not, in any sense of the word, \"rare.\"  Sources: Reynolds Farley, 'The New Census Question about Ancestry: What Did It Tell Us?', Demography, Vol. 28, No. 3 (August 1991), pp. 414, 421.

I have had customers that swore they were German because of some old story handed down down and found out that they were British. After working on family history for the last 10 years I can tell you that because the British were here first they created a base. Anyone migrating to America after that is going to marry into that base with some exceptions. My story is like a lot of Americans. My dad\u2019s name is Swanson. My dad always said we were Swedish because the name sounds like it is from Sweden. I took my dad\u2019s family all the way back to Virginia in 1645. Come to find out the Swanson\u2019s came from London, England as indentured servants. I took them back further to the 1500\u2019s. Still in England in the 1500s -no Swedish. I did a DNA test recently with ancestry.com. My ancestry was 65 % British, 7% Scandinavian and 22% Western European. I cannot find any records on these Western Europeans. So the DNA confirmed my research. Everyone I had taken back which is about 800 people were from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. On top of that my DNA on ancestry.com, will show you all the people that match your DNA type in America that has done the test. I have 900 pages so far of people that are related to me. They all have about the same DNA. A little more British or less British and a little more Western European in some areas but always some British. I bee this is mostly the makeup of white Americans with some exceptions. To tell you the truth a good portion of African Americans also have that makeup. Some Americans that know that they are English will usually not state that they are English American because it shows that you might be bragging or something so this is why most Americans will not say I\u2019m British American. It kind of sounds like duh.. of course so you will say you are of the ancestory that is a little more exotic and exciting. ",

            "answer_text": "After the 2000 the USA changed it's phrasing on government census forms. The catagory \"British\" and \"English\" were often neglected with the introduction of \"American\". Up until then the nation was overwhelmingly made up on paper of ethnic Britons. \"In the 1980 United States Census, over 49 million (49,598,035) Americans claimed English ancestry, at the time around 26.34% of the total population and largest reported group which, even today, would make them the largest ethnic group in the United States.\" Since then most white Americans now claim German ancestry. This has left statisticians perplexed. It's highly unlikely that this jump was possible in the last 18 years. Fashionable answers seem to be the culprit. Being British especially English to be more exacting is no longer in vogue, perhaps it doesn't conform to the national creation myth surrounding the Revolutionary War. With so much mixing especially within groups of common broad ethnic stock, such as \"European\", \"Latin\", \"African\", \"Native American\", \"Asian\" and so on, it appears that the British or English rooted families have a penchant to identify with the latest wave of admixture rather than the root. Even the founding fathers were overwhelmingly of not just British, but English extraction including Washington himself who received his military education fighting as a citizen of the British Empire as a proud colonial Englishman. Sources show us that the beginning of the revolution was less about breaking away at least at it's start and more about inclusion. \"Taxation without representation\". Parliamentary representation was supposed to be the given right of every British citizen. Washington's original recruitment posters read: \"In the service of the King Under the Pay of the Colony of Coneticutt\". This says a lot about how the population of the time culturally identified. It seems things got more extreme as more blood was shed. Benjamin Franklin's homes in London are still standing and can be visited. Today the most common Surnames in the USA are overwhelmingly British and again mostly English. Most Common Surnames [Last Names] in the United States (top 1000) As you move down the list a non-English name (Jones at no: 4 being arguably Welsh too) doesn't pop up until 18 and 19 with Garcia and Hernandez, then it's back to British names. There is an argument that some names were changed or Anglicised leading to a higher English sounding name count, but this was marginal. Yes there are Smith's who were originally Schmitt's and Miller's who were Mueler, etc, but again these are marginal comparatively. One can also see that the English based population was dominant culturally by weight of number, hence the reason these names were \"normalised\" at the time. There is a clear reason why despite the revolution there has always been a close relationship culturally and politically between the USA and the UK. They are quite literally kith and kin to one another. ",

The name coming down the male line so you can double any numbers to include females The 1790 Census estimate results indicate that people of British ancestry made up about 62% of the total population. At the 2000 Census 36.4 million Americans reported British ancestry. Most of the population who stated their ancestry as \"American\" are said to be of old colonial British stock  'British Americans are Americans whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in the United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland). People seldom use the term to describe themselves (1,172,050 chose it in the 2009 American Community Survey); it is primarily a demographic or historical research category. According to American Community Survey in 2009, Americans reporting British ancestry are 40,234,652, or 13.0% of the total U.S. population, a significant drop from the 1980 United States Census where 49,598,035 reported as having English ancestry and 61,311,449 reported as having British ancestry.[2] Using the self reported 2010 census figures British Americans are the second largest European ancestry group after German Americans. However, this figure is likely a serious undercount, as a large proportion of Americans of British descent have a tendency (since the introduction of a new 'American' category in the 2000 census) to identify as simply Americans ' British Americans  ",

The Mexican Cession in 1848 brought in large numbers of native American/Hispanic blended people who had been citizens of Mexico before. Large numbers of Asians were imported in the late 1800s\u2014Chinese to build the railroads across the country, Japanese to harvest sugar in Hawaii. The huge waves of immigrants from Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century brought in many more. Native Americans became American citizens in 1924 (before that they were considered citizens of their tribes). The USA has enormous Irish, Italian, Greek, and Polish communities. Significant numbers of Arabs have arrived in response to the troubles in the Middle East. Ask most Caucasian Americans where their family is from and they'll give you a long, muddled answer\u2014if they even know at all. Some of my ancestors were so poor that there are no good records. ",

For a start, it is the safest way to bring being Irish, Scottish, Welsh, English and other Crown Territories or British Overseas Territories together. Trump is half Scot, half German.  He is known to have invested heavily in his maternal ancestral home in Scotland, and visit every now and then. Mitt Romney's ancestors I believe were all British.   A close relative of the famed English painter, George Romney, I believe. Dick Cheney, like the rest of his ancestors have always been landed and titled characters, ever devoted to Crown, God and Country.  Problem then and now is no one has ever been able to point out what side of the religious bed is most preferable to them.  Catholic or Protestant, they are in it all. There are many more.  But that is America for you. ",

The ethnicity that most American's claim is German.  But I have to assume that many of them actually have some British relatives, even if when asked they give themselves the label of being German.   Honestly, this is such a touchy issue when you ask an American where their people come from being: 1: Most people honestly don't know much beyond their grandparents 2: Many people get offended if you claim to be Irish, German etc.  The Irish will mock the Irish-Americans saying you're not Irish, even if both your parents were born in Ireland 3: Conversely, if you claim to just be American people will mock you for not holding on to your history Basically, this is something that's deeply personal to Americans which is one of the ways that Americans define themselves.   But, despite the UK's proprietary feeling over the US, the US isn't a majority British anymore and as more time passes the less British the US will become.   ",

How can that be? Because a great majority of Americans are descendants of two or more nationalities.  First generation immigrants usually have only one ancestral nationality, second generation frequently have two, by the fourth generation almost all have two or more.

I would have thought there is not many pure British that survived all the different countries that took over/invaded most of Britain throughout our history dating back to the Romans and maybe even before that has not been documented. It is a point that I am sure most British would like to know hence the Genetic testing kits available. From what the advertisement for the testing kit has stated that the ones shown are not all British. So it is a really very interesting point you have made. I know I am not pure British unless it is just because I was born here and so were my parents, but that is as far as I go back. Prior to that I have ancestry from the Russian/Polish, but where they came from is another matter as no one really knows as most of the records of birth were destroyed during WW 2. The point being are any of us really British from the beginning of time? It was a point thought at one time that the true Brits were pushed and pushed and ended up in Wales. If this being the case then it is possible some can/maybe traced back to being true Brits, but who really knows? Your guess is as good as mine and that is only hearsay\u2026.Or is it? ",

A good number of black Americans, for example, have significant levels of white European ancestry.
