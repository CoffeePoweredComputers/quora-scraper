            "answer_text": "I travel a lot and have a 13\u2033 2018 Macbook Pro. I use it daily for business use. Its a lovely fast laptop. The programs used are Excel, Word, Google Calendar, Gmail and Maps. I am mostly doing job costing and require most of the above programs open at the same time. As the 13\u2033 laptop screen is too small to accommodate all of the above, I try to get around this by swiping across screens or squeezing two or three of the programs onto one screen. Neither option is ideal as I either am swiping back and forth which slows me down (especially if you get distracted and you forget the number you had just memorized) or I am squinting/readjusting apps in one screen. Another thing I have tried is bringing my Chromebook with me. I would have 2 laptops open and use the MacBook for the MS office work and the Chromebook for the internet work. It works well but it looks silly in public places. I have, as a result decided that I need a bigger screen. I have never had a 17\u2033 laptop and just bought the new (Q4) 2-in-1 2018 Dell Inspiron. I am hoping this laptop makes a difference and that I can lose the Chromebook or at least be way faster and more productive. If anyone is interested in hearing how it goes, I can report back later.

Forget to try to use them in airplanes, coffee houses or anywhere where people are crammed together, someone will bump into you. And I had Powerbooks and Macbooks pro when they were 17\u2033, loved them. I hated it when I had to go 15\u2033, learnt to like it and eventually love the form factor. I saw a 17\u2033 Macbook pro just a few months ago, WHAT A MONSTER. I would not buy such a machine today, no way no how. I would suggest against it. You need space on your desk and 17\u2033 is just crazy big. ",
