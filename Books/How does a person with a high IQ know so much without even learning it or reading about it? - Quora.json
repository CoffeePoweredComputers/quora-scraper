            "answer_text": "The short answer is: they don't. The long answer is that individuals with a high IQ often have a tool set for processing input and facts around them in ways that most people cannot. This allows them to 'guesstimate' and extrapolate to appear to possess greater knowledge with limited input. It's not QUITE a parlor trick, but it's pretty close, because deep diving into the topic would often trip them up. On the other hand, people with high IQ often, but not always, tend to retain a greater range of facts, and piece together seemingly unrelated details from various sources to create larger pictures. A random article in a magazine waiting at the doctors office, a few quick glimpses at some headlines during a google search, a few mentions from coworkers or snippets overheard on CNN while passing a TV, and maybe even a quick topic scan of a Wikipedia article. Each of these things may take only a few moments, but utilizing the same tools as described above, it is often simple to create a solid picture of a subject that might not be obvious to others.  Lastly, don't forget the subjective portion of this. People will listen to a person talk with authority and expertise on a seemingly complex subject; however, unless you are also an authority on this subject, there is really no way of knowing if the intelligent person is expressing expertise or just making it up as they go along. Often, if a person has been identified as having a high IQ or being deeply intelligent in a field that they ARE an expert in, there is a greater likelihood that people will accept their expertise in other topics at face value. The \"smart\" guy may not even know he's not an expert, because he believes he has pieced together an accurate understanding of the subject, but has only managed a cursory, incomplete, or sometimes completely incorrect picture.  In summary, sometimes they can put it together quickly as they go, sometimes they are able to glean it from unexpected and disparate sources, and sometimes they're just making it up as they go along.

            "answer_text": "We do read and we do learn, but we do it differently. When I teach people to become Superlearners, I normally start a course by explaining to my students how gifted learners read. Most school teachers teach their kids to read by following these rules: 1-Start at the beginning.2-Read every word - use your finger as a pointer.3-If you don\u2019t understand something, slow down and read it again until you do.4-Read the book chapter by chapter.5-Highlight important words and then write them out into your notebook. If there was ever a method that will make your learning boring, slow and harder, then that would be it. Your brain is a naturally fast reader and learner. What you need to do is work at speed, but use natural gaps and play, as well as \u2018sleeping on it\u2019 in between learning bouts to gain understanding. You also need to learn critical thinking and to cultivate an inter-change between these things. Now compare the above \u2018method\u2019 with what a gifted reader does: 1-Look over the front cover of the book, the back cover and the contents table and find the bit that interests you the most. 2-Decide what interests you the most about the book, Have a big question about it in mind.3-Read what interests you most first - don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get it.4-Notice key terms and words that jump out at you and using the contents list, go to those next. Dance in and around those areas, building understanding as you go. 5-Let some questions brew and play with some ideas; sleep on it.6-Go back and dip in and out some more, discuss with friends, ponder. 7-Go find the answers to your questions and start taking notes, be inclusive at this point. Don\u2019t exclude or judge anything. Find out what else you need to read to understand the topic better. 8-Consult with other writers/scientists for other perspectives. Sleep on it again.9-Start judging your notes and decide what to use in your learning. Re-orchestrate your learning (get some meta-learning from everything you read). 10-Do a supermindmap. There are also some major attitudinal diffferences between what a gifted learner does and someone who is not: a-A gifted learner will always be able to tell you what they do well and do not do well. Most non-gifted learners don\u2019t cultivate self-assessment and rely on their teachers to do this. They have a reduced or non-existent ability to second-position themselves and don\u2019t have a very good understanding of the importance of investing in how to learn.b-A gifted learner takes charge of their learning and exerts more control over it, rather than letting it control them. They will judiciously decide how much time a book is worth. A non-gifted learner doesn\u2019t do this - they let a book dictate to them how much time they spend on it, as if they needed to know every word by heart. c-A gifted learner does not worry about \u2018getting it\u2019. They know they will, and know how to play to their brain\u2019s strengths. They know how to study smart. The above study skills are things any so-called non-gifted kid or adult can learn (and it is not hard to learn either), but schools don\u2019t teach this to students.  When people come to me to learn how to use new study techniques, - to become what I call a REAL Superlearner \u2013 they are surprised by how much fun they are to learn. Fun and passion, or at least curiosity, are essential for learning because when you are having fun, learning becomes experiential, and if you have \u2018experienced\u2019 the learning, you never forget it. You also have to learn less (as in memorise) less. Anyone can be a Superlearner, whether gifted or not, but few understand what this really is. For example, there are a lot of courses out there, selling speedreading skills training and declaring that this skill will make you a Superlearner. It doesn\u2019t. I also teach speedreading along with other kinds of reading techniques, but speedreading does NOT make you a Superlearner. Speedreading merely teaches you to use the same (bog standard) reading technique that you learned in school only faster. To be a Superlearner, you have to actually learn to use your brain differently. It means leaving everything you knew or assumed about learning at the door and turning it on its head. ",
