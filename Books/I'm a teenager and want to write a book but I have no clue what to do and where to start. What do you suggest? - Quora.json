            "answer_text": "Sit down with the tools of your choosing, and write something. Anything. Doesn\u2019t have to be good. Doesn\u2019t have to be planned. Doesn\u2019t have to be with the intention that what\u2019s in front of you will be the novel you\u2019ll be writing. The first step towards writing a book is to write. When you start writing, you\u2019ll over time figure out what kind of writer you are: What themes you prefer writing about.What pace you write in.What kind of perspective you feel comfortable writing in.Whether you like planning and outlining before writing something, or just jumping in and go from there is more your jive (or perhaps you like writing seemingly simple things and then elaborate on them later).What tools you prefer writing with.Which pens, what kind of paper, of perhaps a phone or a computer.Snacks and whatnot while writing.Background noises, for instance music.Where you prefer writing.When you prefer writing.The first step towards writing something is to realise that perfection is horseshite. First drafts are horseshite. Once you realise this, getting from the intention to write to actual writing gets at least a little easier. Welcome to the jungle, kid. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing either. I don\u2019t know what to do with whatever plothole I come upon right away. I might not be using every character I add to the story, and some characters may be written into it after I\u2019ve finished the first draft. Grammatical discrepencies will be littered by the plenty, everywhere, regardless of whether I\u2019m okay or not in grammar altogether (I\u2019m not saying disregard it while you write - I\u2019m saying don\u2019t get a mental breakdown when you look back at what\u2019s written). But in order to get to the many questions, the cleanup, the insecurity, you need to write something worth feeling about. What comes next all relies on that first step being taken. So write something. Anything. ",

            "answer_text": "Start with training about the basics of writing. Learn proper sentence structure, grammar, spelling and then proceed to story structure, character development and plot. Practice by writing daily. After a while, you will want to study additional nuances of writing. You didn\u2019t say whether you want to write fiction or non-fiction. You may want to delve into screenplays, essays, or even blogging. Local schools and writing groups may be able to further your writing skills. Social media has a plethora of interest groups that can help. Try to find a mentor who will guide you and offer honest evaluations of your work. Writing conferences and seminars are a valuable source of lessons and will put you into direct contact with authors who are often willing to share their knowledge and experience. Do not, however, expect them to drop whatever they are doing afterwards to answer every question. They are trying to make a living. There are countless books available that will teach you to write. I recommend The Red Sneaker Series by William Bernhardt. His books divide the craft of writing into pertinent subjects with information that will help you begin your artistic journey. Each book is short and concise and has writing exercises at the end of each chapter. Learn to go back to what you\u2019ve written with a critical eye. On a closing note, you should read. It is not possible for a writer of any age to have the personal experience to write interesting stories with believable characters and situations. Reading will expose you to information that will enhance your writing. (Just be careful to not plagiarize other writers.) ",
