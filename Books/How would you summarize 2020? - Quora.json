I'm lone wolf so my circumstances was like can't bear anything and can't say to anyone.It's kinda look scary when I look to those days oh man I can't fucking believe that. somedays it feels like a hell of a dream when I wake up at morning.From now on still 3 months left for this year but one thing I learned the most from this pandemic is just live for today you can never predict what's going to happen tomorrow. It's always fuckin' different tomorrow. Just live as this is the last day of your life.People only care about you when you will died. That's a universal truth. So just love yourself. That's it.Last but not list Just do the things which make you happy.Until then just chill and be kind to each other:) Thank You:) Jash:) ",

            "answer_text": "I would summarize 2020 as the year the world turn their back against God. All the fighting, looting, the burning of cities, the killing of innocent people and children makes me think Satan is in control. That is not quite true because if that was the case we wouldn't be here. All believers and those that died believing in Christ would be in heaven. The Antichrist would be in control we are in the prelude to the change, because Jesus is coming for his church and the Antichrist is at the door knocking ready to come in as soon as the restrainer is gone. How can people think that Ordinary People can turn this world around? They can't without God and God will take revenge against the non-believers, demons, the Antichrist, the false prophet and Satan. That is what we are headed for Jesus is coming he's at the door with his hand on the knob. Who can withstand his judgment against an unbelieving world? No one but his people the Believers of Christ can withstand. Non-believers need to accept Christ as our Lord and savior and believe did he died on that cross for them to cover their sins. They need to repent, accept Christ, believe In Christ and his father surrender their soul to him. ",
