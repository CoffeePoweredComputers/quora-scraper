            "answer_text": "Before Jumping to unit-testing there are few steps I will recommend.These are all related to what you will read on internet while researching about your quest. It is hard to find good PHP developersQ:How do you determine good developers?A:They write secure code Problem:-How to write secure codes?Solution:- Learn PDO (PHP Data Objects) and stop using mysql_query and blah blah.-->Learn about filtering and sanitizing inputs and using built in function like htmlspecialchars and htmlspecialentities-->Secure your forms by using $_SERVER super global to post form rather than hard coding page name.Trust me these are only few security points later you can explore yourself. OOP is the wayProblem:-Biggest problem with any developer who learned PHP in procedural ways is wrapping their head around OOP , at least I had hard time doing that.Solution:- Pick a great book as it will force you to work through the codes. Build something in 100% OOP way even if you find it verbose. Learn a frameworkProblem:-I have read this thousand times on websites to learn a framework but the real problem is you will learn someone else's way to do things not PHP's way.Solution:- Now you are at the stage where it is time to learn design patterns, this will help you understand how frameworks are created and create one if you are confident enough(Please don't make it full fledged this is just to prepare you for frameworks written by others ).NOTE:-Frameworks are just to make development process easier and faster not for learning a technology Now some suggestion form my partBe an open minded personLearn other languages , its not good to be biased just because you know it better. Learning other language will help you in thinking differently at same problem, this is integral part of being a Programmer. In-spite of the fact that I have just completed stage two(OOP is the way) I am learning Python and soon will be picking up a python framework. Hope this helps :) ",
