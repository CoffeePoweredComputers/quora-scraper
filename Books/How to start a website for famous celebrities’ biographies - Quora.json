            "answer_text": "Step:1- Buy hosting and domain name with good verb potential.  Don't be stick on any one domain as you will not get your desirable domain. .Com should be your first choice. (You can buy domain from anywhere you want like GoDaddy and so, my recommendation is not to buy hosting from same company, for hosting prefer some other company like Bigrock and so.) Step:2- Connect your domain with the hosting.  Step:3- Install wordpress.  Step:4-. Install an attractive theme and required plugins.  Step:5- Add clousfare to your website (free) to protect your website from hackers and provide the free ssl certification, it'll convert your website from :http// to :https ( Decrease your loading time, although have lot of free features you can go through).  After doing mentioned 5 step your website is live. That's it. ",
