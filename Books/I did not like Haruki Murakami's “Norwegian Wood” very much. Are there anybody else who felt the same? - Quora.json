I didn\u2019t like it much, if at all - it\u2019s too depressive for me, the protagonist is bland and unlikeable, and there is no mysticism that I like in Murakami - but I still had to do my Master\u2019s thesis on it because no other book was at that time available in the four languages that I could study it for translation research.
