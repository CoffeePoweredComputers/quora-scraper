            "answer_text": "Q: How do I deal with a story that 95% of it takes place in a different language country and the protagonist speaks in it? Remember your narrator, and convey things in the way your narrator perceives and understands them. If the narrator understands the language, then \u201cin [language]\u201d might be mentioned to establish when there\u2019s a change in what a character is speaking, but a truly multilingual person can have conversations without realizing the language they\u2019re in, so it won\u2019t always matter. I have one narrator in a fantasy series who visits places where she doesn\u2019t know the language\u2014she frankly doesn\u2019t even know one of the two major languages of her home city. She can sometimes recognize the language that\u2019s being used, but in general, she makes assumptions or guesses from context. Sometimes that means characters communicate by gestures rather than words. Whereas another narrator, multilingual, knows a lot of languages (some of it\u2019s magic) and thus might sometimes take a moment to switch, but she in general navigates situations fine. (Even she, though, sometimes makes unwarranted assumptions, because I like my unreliable narrators.) You start with your narrator, then build from there. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s the Tolkien option: He\u2019s translating from Bilbo\u2019s account in Middle Earth language\u2026and adapting whatever needs adapting. You didn\u2019t think the hobbit spoke English, did you? In fact, Merry and Pippin aren\u2019t named Merry and Pippin (or Meriadoc and Peregrine) but names in their language with similar meanings. If your protagonist is also your point of view, you can just say once that he understands the different language and leave it all in English anyway, maybe adding a line about not-English speaker complimenting your protagonist\u2019s foreign language (or making fun of their accent, or correcting a mix-up - whatever works) here and there. There might be other options, but what you don\u2019t do is having 95% of your dialogue in a different language for the reader to scratch their head at. ",
