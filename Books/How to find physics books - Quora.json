            "answer_text": "I'm not exactly sure what level you're at as far as knowing physics is so I'll give a few suggestions. First, I get most of my physics books off Amazon because that's easiest for me but sometimes go to a book store to see what they have. A very nice little book is Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. This book uses no math and is just less than one hundred pages but provides brief and understandable explanations on the main topics in physics. I really enjoyed this book and read it in just a few days (you could probably read it in a day depending on how fast you read but I read pretty slowly). A book series that I love is the Theoretical Minimum. This series is written by theoretical physicist Leonard Susskind (he helped invent string theory). This series is based off of continuing studies lectures he has given with the same name. They are designed for people who are really curious about physics and want to learn the math but didn't major in physics in college so they don't have the background (or in my case, haven't gone to college yet). He teaches math along the way which is very helpful if you don't know it already. His first book is The Theoretical Minimum and covers classical mechanics (Newton\u2019s laws all the way through Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics) with a little bit of electrodynamics in the last chapter or so. There are a few typos here and there but errata can be found here so it's not much of an issue. His second book is Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum. This book references the first one every so often so even if you want to learn quantum mechanics, starting with classical mechanics is still best. His third book will be over special relativity and classical field theory and will come out this September. I'm super excited for it to come out and have already preordered my copy. These books are excellent introductions to doing advanced physics and I am a huge fan of them. Happy reading! P.S. I love the books\u2019 covers and how the little device gets more and more put together with each book! ",

You can also use either of University physics and Halliday/Resnick.which contain good theory, as well as exercises, and good applications. ",
