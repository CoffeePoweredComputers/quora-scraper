Daily study time :-Mon-Fri :- 10\u201311 hoursSat :- 13\u201314 hoursSun :- 8 hours Subjects should be divided in the following manner :- AccountsLawEthics & CommCostingFMDTIDTNow, Accounts, for the first time, start directly on 27th Oct\u2026this way it will be fresh for you during exams and you won\u2019t need a revision. You\u2019ll get 6 full days which are more than enough. (PM sums, RTP Nov 17, May 17, Nov 16) Law is bit easier compared to group 2 theory subjects so along with law take up Dt or IDT (whichever you find it easy). Similarly, ethics & communication should be accompanied with Dt or IDT whichever is remaining. Law+Tax should take 8 days and E&C + Tax should take 8 days. (Only and Only PM). Remember, theory should always be done in the morning. Costing and FM should be done by studying smartly. There is a hidden trend which you can easily find out by going through the past papers.Costing - 5 days (Only PM)FM - 5 days (Past papers+RTP)Theory - 1 day (Only PM) Assuming you\u2019ll start from 25th September, you have 37 days in your hand and I have given you a time table for 33 days\u2026remaining 4 days are buffer days\u2026which can be utilized wherever you feel like\u2026it totally depends on you. HOPE THIS IS ENOUGH TO HELP YOU CLEAR YOUR EXAMS.ALL THE BEST. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't intend to frighten you, but preparing IPCC in one month is tough task. You need to give your every second to the studies and give up every thing. you need to focus on following:1. As you have only one month, you need to plan your every minute. Detailed planning is required in such manner that after a month you have at least completed your syllabus.2. You need to evaluate which subject would require more time depending on your understanding and ability to learn. Those subject which would require more time, would give you less time for other subjects. 3. You need to focus on those chapters which are frequently asked and leave out all other topics which are not scoring. You cant cover all the topics in one month so only topics with highest mark weightage should be done first.4. Do practise manual only. As you don't have time, reading PM would be advisable. It contains most of the topics in few lines. 5. Don't repeat the question or read which are similar and repeating in books. At times questions of same nature are asked frequently in books, you don't need to learn all those questions. Simply cross those questions and move ahead.6. lastly do RTP. Do it at any cost. it would help you in exams. At last, complete focus, determination to complete the subjects in month, confidence and faith in yourself would help you. The one month would be tough but if you can do it, you will find every effort of yours worth.! ",

This period should be used to revise the topics studied earlier and practice questions from Practice Manual and RTPs. At the maximum use can use the first week to cover up all the topics in which you are lagging behind, however, after that instead of taking up new topics it advisable to revise old topics and make short notes for thorough revision and practice. Preparing for a single group in a month\u2019s time isn\u2019t an impossible task, however, a lot of time has to spent with books day and night. ",

I guess if it is not ur first attempt then u hav already read out the syllabus previously. So this will be a type of revision for u. Accordingly u have 2 problem and 2 theory .In a day u can easily cover up 4 papers, 3 hrs each paper. For better concentration take the theory n problem papers alternatively.. All the best. Follow for more guidance and exam strategy!! ",
