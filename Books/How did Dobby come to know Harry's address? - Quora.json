            "answer_text": "Since voldemort fell it became common knowledge to all wizards that Harry Potter went to his aunt and uncles house . Enraged the death eaters might have tried to attempt to kill him first hand and discovered the place even though they weren't able to kill him because of lily potters sacrifice and dumbledores enchantments. So Lucius Malfoy being a death eaters himself must have heard Potter s location and have must dicussed in his house so dobby being a house elf of Malfoy s must have got the address from there ",

            "answer_text": "The magic of House Elves works differently from that of wizards. I\u2019m pretty sure Dobby did not know where Harry lived, in fact very few people did. The prevalent knowledge in the wizarding world at the time was that \u201che went to live with muggles\u201d without anybody knowing anything specific. It was, in my opinion, the sheer desire to meet and then protect Harry Potter that took Dobby to him, in spite of Harry not being his master. ",
