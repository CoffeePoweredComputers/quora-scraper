            "answer_text": "The Brain and Behaviour An Idiots Guide to Neuroscience is a good introductory text to a wide range of topics about the human brain, including how your senses work and what each part of the brain does. Please don\u2019t judge the book by its title, it was written specifically for people who are looking to study psychology/neuroscience at university. Behave by Robert Sapolsky is very good for the biological aspects of psychology. The author is a neuroendocrineologist (expert in how hormones affect the brain, and thus behaviour). The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins is great if you want to understand how the brain evolved, and how to explain human behaviours that seem to be at odds with survival of the fittest: e.g. homosexuality, alturism Science of Thinking Waking Up by Sam Harris is about debunking myths people have about consciousness, and about what you can learn about your mind by meditating. Thinking Fast and Slow was written by two nobel prize winning economists who catalogued the errors people make when making decisions and uncovered the rules of thumb the brain uses to make judgements about the world. It is one of the most important books of all time, which should be read by everyone - especially people interested in the mind. Rare and Strange Mental Illnesses The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat by Oliver Sacks is a book about people suffering from very strange neurological disorders. It\u2019s very interesting, well written, and accessible. Miscellaneous Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari is a book about how human life has changed over the past ten thousand years. It talks a lot about how the psychological differences between man and other animals allowed humans to achieve world domination. If you are interested in performing experiments, then Bad Science by Ben Goldacre is a good guide of how to avoid the common mistakes scientists and non-scientists alike make when interpreting scientific data. The author is a doctor, so focuses on medical examples. Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics is a similar text which uses more accessible topics to illustrate similar ideas. Note I will hopefully remember to update this once I\u2019ve had a little longer to think. If not, feel free to remind me by sending me a message. ",

            "answer_text": "An excellent book on personality disorders from the perspective of psychoanalysis is Psychoanalytic Diagnosis by Nancy McWilliams. She writes in a very accessible manner and makes psychoanalytical principles easy to understand. In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development by Carol Gilligan challenges the male-dominated theories of moral development in boys and girls. Many theories of psychological development assume that male characteristics are ideal and anything different (i.e., female) is considered lesser-than. The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat is not strictly a psychology book but is a collection of case histories of patients of the neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks. The stories vary from amusing to poignant, and illustrate how delicate and complicated the human brain is. Enjoy and good luck! ",
