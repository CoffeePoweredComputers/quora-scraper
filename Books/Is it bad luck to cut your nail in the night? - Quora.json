            "answer_text": "Well, it really depends on the day AND the nail - the two MUST be in sync; otherwise, disease, loss of employment, and relationship disaster will ensue: not in your lifetime, but in the even-number generations you leave behind. Unless, of course, if you are left-handed, then the above misfortunes will befall the odd-number generations that follow in your family tree. One of the biggest problems, as almost everybody knows, is that while you have twenty nails to trim, there are only seven days. As you may already have guessed, the trimming routine must follow a 140-day rotational cycle, but, as has been long noted by scientists, this does not apply to right-handed people who have, unfortunately, had exactly six digits amputated, then, the cycle is simplified down to two weeks. For some yet-unknown reason, left-handed individuals who have had six digits amputated must still revert to the 140-day rotational cycle UNLESS they were born with six fewer digits. But assuming you have all your fingers and toes, the next hurdle is to identify the number of each toe. One would think that toes would be numbered starting with the big toe of the right foot (#1), and increase successively through the smallest toe of the right foot (#5). This would mean that the big toe on the left foot would be #6, and the smallest toe on the left foot would be #10. That appears to make the most sense, but in reality, each toe must be measured individually. People who have a lifetime of wearing tight shoes may have bent toes. If this is the case triangulated maths must be employed to determine the actual length of the entire toe, rather than use an \u201cas-the-crow-flies\u201d approach, which is somewhat shorter than the actual length. The fingers present a slightly different problem as they need to be measured from the smallest to the largest, contra-laterally which usually means that the pinkie on the left hand would acquire #11. Now, assuming your body has normal proportioning, the left thumb would become #12, the ring finger #13, the index finger #14, and the middle finger #15. The pinkie on your right hand would become #16, the right thumb #17, the right ring finger #18, the right index finger #19, and the right middle finger #20. However, if your manual digits are grossly out of proportion and do not match the above, beginning with your left pinkie, assign it #11, the left ring finger #12, the left middle finger #13, the left index finger will become #14, and the left thumb is assigned #15. Counterintuitively, though, the numbering sequence must then continue to your right thumb (#16), your right index finger (#17), right middle finger (#18), right ring finger (#19), and finally, your right pinkie (#20). Before trimming, however, you must first determine the day of your birth. Regardless of its position during a normal Sunday-to-Saturday, your birthday will become Day #1, unless you are left-handed, in which case your birth day will become #7. With this bit of information, you can now begin trimming your nails with the firm knowledge that no misfortunes will fall on your family or yourself. Starting with day one, you must trim Nail #1 until an entire week has passed. Then on the next Day #1, you may trim nail #8 and so on until you have completed the 140-day cycle (working, of course, in the opposite direction sequentially if you are left-handed). The most obvious difficulty in this necessary routine is that all your nails will eventually have differing lengths, but this can be modified by the use of artificial nails. Another problem will occur during a leap year when the extra day will throw off your routine, but to ensure that you conform to the normal 140-day cycle, simply abstain from trimming any nails until the new cycle matches your birth day with the appropriate nail.

            "answer_text": "\u201cBad luck\u201d is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It isn't a power or a system that works outside of YOU - it's purely internal. If you do something YOU consider to be bad luck, whether cutting your nail at night, living at no. 13, walking under a ladder or crossing someone on the stairs, the next time something bad happens, you'll attribute it to the bad luck. It really doesn't matter if that thing was going to happen to you anyway. If you have the superstition, you are mired in the belief. Probably inescapably. And in your mind, bad things happen because of your bad luck. The real truth of the matter is you make them happen. ",
