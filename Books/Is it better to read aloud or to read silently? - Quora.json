            "answer_text": "I have to chuckle. The other day, while reading, I suddenly started reading aloud. To no one except my cats. They didn\u2019t run away, but I\u2019m sure they were rather perplexed by the sudden \u201cnoise\u201d coming from me and not that big, weird box on the stand (e.g., the TV). I have no idea what compelled me to read aloud. As I said, I was alone, so I wasn\u2019t reading to anyone. Quite frankly, it is, for me, much harder to read aloud. Some words I simply stumble over trying to pronounce, while reading them, I just see them, \u201csay them\u201d in my head, and move on. Also, reading aloud sometimes impacts my comprehension. There were passages I had to re-read (this was a non-fiction book), because I think I was just saying words at one point, not really thinking about what I was reading. I don\u2019t think one method is \u201cbetter\u201d than another. I would say it\u2019s personal preference, circumstances, and goals. If you are learning a new language, or learning to read, then reading aloud will probably help. If you know how to read and are reading in your native language, then there may not be an advantage, unless it helps with your comprehension or helps with any other goals (public speaking?). Also, if you are going to try reading out loud, and there are other people in the room, make sure they want to listen to what you are reading \u2014 or at least that they aren\u2019t surprised that you are going to start reading.

            "answer_text": "I will answer this question by explaining the structure of brain. Our brain understand something by seeing or hearing or feeling. But the information go to the hearing district, then to the sight district, finally to the cognitive district and we realize the information. So it means that the information from sight is faster to be known than from hearing. But IMO, if you read it loudly,  the information will arrive the cognitive district twice. (right through sight district first, and through hearing district to sight district second time )So it's better for you to remember. All in all, if you read for geting information, reading silently. It's effective. But if you want to remember the words, reading loudly would be better. ",
