            "answer_text": "That is actually false. Though most people who have even minor experience selling books on Amazon believe that listing with an ISBN number is imperative, I can assure you that it is not. If this were the case, it would be impossible to list all of the remarkable books still out there in the world that were printed before 1970. One example of this: George Orwell\u2019s 1984 - paperback edition - printed in 1949.  A short history of ISBNs In 1966, the U.K. book trade industry came together to implement a much needed universal method of organizing their plethora of books. Their solution \u2014 in 1967 the Stand Book Numbering system was implemented throughout the United Kingdom in hopes of all future print having unique number patterns. The SBN would prove to be successful and would go on to inspire I.S.O. (International Organization for Standardization) to make this an industry standard. In 1970, the committee passed the new ISBN or International Standard Book Number system and would make its way to over 150 countries, where ISBNs are still utilized today. On Amazon, you will often find that the ISBN is used in place of an \u201cASIN\u201d. This is not always the case, though. I\u2019ve sold thousands of books that never had an ISBN simply because they were printed long before ISBNs ever existed. These sales were all on Amazon. ",

            "answer_text": "When you set up your title(s) in Amazon KDP, you make the choice for them to assign the number. The example image below shows the step when this occurs. This is one of our existing titles, so it already has an ISBN. But as you see, you could choose \u201cGet a free KDP ISBN.\u201d When you do this, Amazon registers the book with Bowker (the official U.S. ISBN registry) and it will show in your Amazon listing as \u201cIndependently published.\u201d If you are publishing an ebook, then the step will be the same except that Amazon will assign an ASIN instead (Amazon Standard Identification Number).
