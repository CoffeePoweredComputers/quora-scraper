            "answer_text": "Amidst this hustling crowd and mind-boggling situations, I expect more than half of the population struggling hard to switch between tabs open in our head, trying to find the answers to the many questions that we have. Hoping to have a perfect solution to every problem. Ohayo, solitude. How are you today? Come, sit with me, and I will care for you. This is the need of the hour. Because life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you. I\u2019ve recently finished reading Ikigai and, I utterly loved the whole idea from where this book originates. A mysterious title which tempts me to question myself, What is my Ikigai? This Japanese concept translates to \u2013 \u2018a reason for being\u2018. There are many beautiful definitions quoted by the author but my favorite is \u2018a reason to jump out of bed every morning\u2019.\ud83c\udf38 This book envelopes every element of life which we all seem to be aware of, but always fail to implement in our life by giving ourselves vague excuses. Hector Garcia mentioned profound concepts about discovering the amalgamation of passion, talent, purpose, and something which the world will pay for. There is this philosophy of longevity drawn from a small Okinawa tribe in Japan. The absolute fact that most of the centenarians hail from this heavenly abode left me astounded. \u201cOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years\u201d. Well, this was the subtle answer to it. As we embark on a journey to find our ikigai, we are introduced to the part where it helps us find the meaning of being in the FLOW. Water moves; it is at its best when it flows fresh and doesn\u2019t stagnate. So is the case with Humans. Not insatiable hunger to achieve profound heights but a challenging situation acting as a driving force to move forward is what flow means. We see time moving fast because we are doing what we love.  In a nutshell, there is a subconscious flow in the interwoven words throughout the book. The true spirit of this book lies in its lucid language and beautiful analogies. There are snippets from prominent men that can hold onto your attention and will leave a deep impression on you. It will not only exercise your mind but also your psyche. NOTE \u2013 Let not worry wrinkle your forehead and fear crinkle your eyes. Direct it as a catalyst for change. Whatever you do, never retire. Live an unhurried life. \u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u3067\u3044\u3044\u304c\u306a ",

            "answer_text": "Rating:  I was reading \u201cIKIGAI\u201d and finished it yesterday, despite all the praise given I feel this is not worthy. I will share my thoughts and the reason why I didn\u2019t like the most hyped book. The book tries to explain the Japanese secret behind long and prosperous life; The IKIGAI which considered as the driving force of longevity in Japan. The Authors Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles kept the book short and portray this as a derivative of several interviews conducted across Okinawa or other places. Let\u2019s discuss the facts and content of the book. Since I heard a lot of praise about this book, I set an expectation for myself and purchased the hardcover copy rather going with kindle edition. By nature, I read a lot of books about self-improvement, Life\u2019s meaning or purpose searching so was excited about it. But in the midst of reading this book, I felt that it gives you an overview of IKIGAI in the first few chapters, afterwards, this only explains the longevity of Japanese. In between, it looks like an accumulation of Daily NewsPaper articles which is published in a book. For instance, it gives a brief about food habit but no detail just the observations. It tries to cover multiple topics like exercise, different forms but end up not satisfying due to very less explanation. Indeed the reader will have an understanding of IKIGAI but except that, it doesn\u2019t serve anything. If you want to know about IKIGAI then this should not be on your checklist. Of course, it has a couple of topics explaining the longevity, however, are not satisfactory due to lack of illustrations. The overall contents selection is good but the inclusion with less focus doesn\u2019t serve the purpose. If you are a new reader to this genre you may like it whereas for the frequent reader it\u2019s really hard to digest. Overall I will not recommend this to both new and frequent reader unless you just wanted to have an overall knowledge of IKIGAI. ",
