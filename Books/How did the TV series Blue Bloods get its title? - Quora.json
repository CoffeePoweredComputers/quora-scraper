            "answer_text": "Somebody (don't know who) came up with a clever play on words.  Members of the aristocracy are sometimes referred to as \"blue bloods.\" (See How did the term \"Blue Blood\" come about?) The word blue is used in many slang terms and slogans related to police. Backing the blue, the thin blue line, blue flu, blue lives matter, and so forth - referring to a police officer's blue uniform.  Nearly everybody in the Reagan family has a police career, and one could say they have \"blue\" in their blood. And with Frank as commissioner and his father as a former commissioner, the family could be considered the police aristocracy in New York.  Hence, Blue Bloods. Pretty good name. ",
