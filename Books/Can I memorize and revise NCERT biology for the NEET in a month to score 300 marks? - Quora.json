            "answer_text": "Every individual person has his/her own memorizing and cramming capability . Some can easily cram whole periodic table while some need mnemonics for every column. So, it depends individual to individual. Here\u2019s a trick I used when i was a student: I used the art of making mnemonics for every topic which was solely based for cramming and practiced a lot of questions every day which helped me in revising the same concept again and again and ultimately helped me in the examination. You can try out various study methods and use which works the best. Important topics to do in the last month: Physics \u2013 Mechanics, Optics, Thermodynamics and Nuclear Physics Chemistry \u2013 Mole Concept, General Organic Chemistry, Periodic Table, Chemical Bonding, Coordination Chemistry Biology- Ecology and Environment, Genetics, Cell Biology; Morphology, Reproduction and Physiology of Plants and Animals; Basics of Biotechnology And lastly, make proper notes of concepts that require regular revision. These could be mathematical formulae or important chemical reactions; basically, anything that is important and is expected to be remembered for the exam. These notes help you in your last minute preparation and helps you to quickly go through the concepts. If you stumble across any doubts while preparing, you can use Toppr which has a \u2018Doubts on Chat\u2019 facility which is a 24X7 doubt solving service that will help you. Start studying from now so you are well prepared by the time of the exam. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Don't revise NCERT with stress, just read the chapters as if you are reading some stories with some interest and every time you read a chapter, solve it's textbook questions or just read out the related topic again. Reading like a story means you don't have to memorize the lines, just make sure that you understand the meaning of each line. This way you will finish the 2 books within a week. That means, 4 times a month, which will be surely helpful. Good luck. :) ",

But you can never be sure about the total marks based on Ncert this year. My guess is somewhere between 60% - 70% and this percentage will keep on decreasing in the coming years. Ncert is still going to play a major role in the composition of Neet. Love & Luck!!! ",
