            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019d suggest that the device is going to end up being, for better of worse, something like Rolling Stock (See note below). I can\u2019t give you a \u201cbest\u201d answer, but I can suggest something. (I just purchased one of these, so I am also looking at a case.) Here goes: Amazon Kindle Fire HDX (3rd Gen) 32GB, Wi-Fi, 8.9 Black | eBayBelkin Kindle Keyboard Case for Fire HDX 8.9 (will fit 3rd and 4th generation) | eBayI have a 4th Gen unit. This is a lightweight setup and has the advantage of also lots of room for eTextBooks. A note here is that it can then hook up to a laptop/desktop in your dorm-room to transfer files that you are working on. Here are the advantages: Low overall priceSmall & lightweightThe Kindle & also a Kindle APP on your dorm computer means that you share the eTextBooks across systems. (Up to 5 Kindle/KindleApps may share one account.)If it gets lost, stolen, or damaged, it\u2019s not a huge loss (as in your main laptop just evaporated from your desk at the library while you were in the can with all of your schoolwork on it)!You then have money to buy a nice laptop and inexpensive color laser printer.My laptop example: Dell XPS 17 L702X Core i5-2410M 2.30 GHz 6GB RAM 500GB HDD NVIDIA GT 550M | eBayAn inexpensive Color Laser Printer (Mine\u2019s an older Dell 1350cmw)Here\u2019s the logic in the choices above: Moderately inexpensive tablet that can be later used as an eBook reader as well as display other content. The MS Word compatible APPs are real inexpensive.) Has, compared to a laptop, a really long battery life!A nice (somewhat inexpensive & older) gaming laptop that can be used as a lightweight base station for your school work. OK, it may not play the latest games, but, it should be OK for a lot of stuff. (Add an SSD and it\u2019ll perform even better.) The puppy that I have has two drive bays! Yup, two! So the original example above\u2019s 500GB HDD can be used as secondary storage w/ your OS & APPs on a fast SSD!The laser printer doesn\u2019t need to be a high performance unit, but should be inexpensive & do the job for four+ years.Total expenditure budget? ~$700 (USD) w/ only $125 (USD) out where it can be lost, stolen, or damaged.//Rolling Stock definition: Those graffiti covered, totally beat up, railroad cars you see on a looooooong freight train. //DISCLAIMER: I have a (once new) Dell 1350cnw laser printer; a Dell XPS L702X, and the 2014 AMAZON Kindle Fire HDX (referbed from AMAZON). I\u2019m considering buying that keyboard case I listed above.  SPECIAL NOTE: The above is what I would do if I was going to college next autumn and living in a dorm room. In my case, the really big tech item was an Olympia portable typewriter:  Just like this one. (Image from VTG 1960's Olympia SF Deluxe Ultra Portable Typewriter & Black Case W Germany | eBay) It cost way more then this in 1970 dollars. It was a sweet little machine. And I used it for four years. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, I\u2019d look into a used, like new, or off-lease Microsoft Surface 4 Pro, with the i5\u20134300U processor, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. With the detachable keyboard it makes for an excellent laptop and desktop, all for about $500\u2013550. Add-in a decent 128/256GB UHS-3 class micro sd into the rear slot and you\u2019re good for automatic backups when not in use. This model with these specs really are quite nice. A few other really decent models are the Dell E6410/6420/6430, or the Lenovo Thinkpad T410/420/430. With a decent i5 processor and 8GB of RAM or more, plus at least a 480GB SSD (ditch the regular hard drive, seriously), you can easily run BLueStacks on it so that you have full access to the Android platform and apps as well as the regular Windows 10 Pro 64 bit OS, or some Linux flavor that suits you. These last laptops can all be bought for as low as $150 and up to a max of about $250. Even if you have to increase the RAM and install an SSD, the prices for those parts is pretty low and common as well. If you want a touchscreen model, look into the E6330. ",
