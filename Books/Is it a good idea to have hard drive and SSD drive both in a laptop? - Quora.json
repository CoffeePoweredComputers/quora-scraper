            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a cheap way to get the best of both. You can have fast SSD for those things which need it, while having lots of cheap space for files which don\u2019t need quick access. E.g. if a program constantly needs to refer to small parts within a file, it\u2019s better to keep that on the SSD. Else you find that the seek times on HDD starts slowing the program down drastically. But if a file only ever gets read from beginning to end and it only ever needs to be read at some minimum rate, then the HDD is usually sufficient and you don\u2019t need the extra speed of the SSD - E.g. watching video means you need to read the file at between a few kB to MB per second (a HDD can easily handle that). It\u2019s marginally better to have one huge SSD equal to both sizes added together, but the cost would be many times more. Another aspect is power consumption. Here the SSD tends to use less energy while it\u2019s working. But if the files on the HDD is only rarely accessed it can be spun down or even put to sleep. Which means it could work just as frugally as a single large SSD could, depending on what you do with it. If you have the money then go for the larger SSD, else there\u2019s not a huge amount of reason to refrain from the HDD. The only real practical reason to not have a HDD is because it is less robust against shocks (e.g. dropping the laptop may break the HDD but the SSD is likely to still work). ",

            "answer_text": "If you have a laptop which can accomodate 2 drives, it is a very good idea. It allows good performance and large total capacity at moderate cost. Use the SSD to install the OS and all your applications. A 250GB SSD is plenty big enough for that. (Indeed, for Windows 7 and 8, I got by with 120GB for many years and still do on my Windows 10 desktop.) Use the disk to store voluminous data like video files (for which there is really no performance penalty either). Some programs use a fairly large database which they access frequently. Such databases should also be kept on the SSD. A good compromise for a laptop which can accommodate only one drive (common) is a hybrid drive, which provides a very large high-performance cache to a disk using an SSD. ",
