            "answer_text": "The internet and free trading are having a huge impact on the stock market. Many strategies will work in the current climate, but clearly the value of FAANG is growing much faster than the old blue chips. You grow wealth by increasing income while reducing expenses. Ideally, you are living in a small house or condo that you or your parents own, and your energy and communications footprint is economical as possible. You do not have expensive habits. You have multiple jobs and income streams. You can go all-in on FAANG plus Tesla, or you can invest in a pair of exchange traded funds. My suggestion would be ARKK, controlled by a visionary CEO, and QQQ, a computer-driven fund based off performance. The former is composed primarily of potentially disruptive companies at early stages of growth (with the exception of their large position in Tesla, bought years ago), while the latter is composed of the current kings of NASDAQ (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft). These funds spread your chips out to cover the maximum bases. ",

            "answer_text": "You may glean useful basic information from books but they will not make you very rich right now. Life is too complicated for that to happen. If someone did know how to make that happen, he will not be telling others in a book. Aim for a more modest goal. Own your home free of debt and have as much as you can in a professionally managed retirement account with modest fees. Amateur investors invariably fail in tough volatile times. It\u2019s never easy. Are you feeling lucky? ",

I don\u2019t know about the US but this book was huge in Canada. It gave simple common sense strategies to be a successful financially like the 10% solution. The Wealthy Barber Returns went into more detail about saving and investing. You need to remove temptation. Banks are in business to make a profit, not for the benefit of their customers. Credit cards are evil. You can\u2019t have everything you want. Save when you have the chance \u201c wealth flows from savings not income \u201c ",
