            "answer_text": "The answer: No! Napoleon isn\u2019t essentially an earlier Hitler. By the way, you can\u2019t compare Napoleon to Hitler; Napoleon was far more powerful and strongest than Hitler in my opinion. Isn\u2019t good enough when this kind of question exist? One is seen as the father of modern Europe. One is seen as the scourge of modern Europe. One is admired by many, one is hated and feared by the majority. With the publication in 1988 of Desmond Seward's Napoleon and Hitler. A comparative biography,the book slickly produced and written with enough references to appear serious at first glance, the author shows no caution beyond the introduction. And even there, although he initially reminds the reader that Churchill (in his memoirs) and Pieter Geyl (in Napoleon: for and against) dismissed any possible comparisons between the emperor and the F\u00fchrer, it is only to make brushing aside their reluctance that much easier later on. Seward attributes their caution to political motives in the former (best not upset the French) and a clearly defined hierarchy of hatred in the latter: Geyl certainly hated Napoleon, but he hated Hitler even more and it is essentially this that drove him to separate the two in terms of both regimes and ambitions. What follow are the central elements for his comparison: \u2013 Poor background and youthful ambition;\u2013 Continued thirst for power;\u2013 A coup d'\u00e9tat to achieve power;\u2013 The goal of, in the one case, creating a new France and, in the other, a new Germany;\u2013 The use of war to expand their influence;\u2013 A desire to conquer Europe;\u2013 A shared failure to conquer Russia;\u2013 Attempts to defeat Britain with a continental blockade;\u2013 Resistance to the regime: in Spain for Napoleon, in all the occupied territories for Hitler;\u2013 Downfall follows defeat by a coalition of countries;\u2013 The story comes to an end with their respective countries in ruins. But what\u2019s the difference between Napoleon and Hitler? David Geoffrey Chandler ,a foremost historian of Napoleonic warfare, wrote in 1973 that, \"Nothing could be more degrading to the former [Napoleon] and more flattering to the latter [Hitler]. The comparison is odious. On the whole Napoleon was inspired by a noble dream, wholly dissimilar from Hitler's ... Napoleon left great and lasting testimonies to his genius\u2014in codes of law and national identities which survive to the present day. Adolf Hitler left nothing but destruction.\" Even then, Napoleon were remembered by French people as their heroes while Hitler hated by Germans because of WW2 and the hatred of jews. However, what is amusing is there\u2019s other great differences that this question is debunked. Napoleon rose to power and His legacy was celebrated, kept expanding and was embraced throughout. Neither did he destroy Europe, nor France and all the works of his life continued even after his exile, and then death. Hitler on the other side was diabolic and cast aside. Europeans still feel the violent ridicule caused by Hitler. Obviously, I like Adolf Hitler a lot, but I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s greater than Napoleon. Sure, Napoleon had conquered almost all of the Europe but he didn\u2019t inspired Hitler to racial hatred towards minorities . In other words, Napoleon was a Proto-zionist when he support return of the Jews to the Holy Land. In contracts, Hitler killed millions of people including Chinese, Jews, Homosexuals, Slavs and other minorities. All of this but indeed, could help to explain why he was so very different from, say, a Napoleon who wanted to create a genuinely better Europe, or a Mussolini who tried to substitute a theatrical performance for hard reality. And in Hitler's criminal hands was the stark, dynamic power of a German people ready to march. While Napoleon gained power after the atrocities of post-French revolution, he\u2019s did a lot of good things to the french and the world such as legal reform and the abolition of serfdom. Overall, Napoleon isn\u2019t essentially an earlier Hitler. If you want to compare Napoleon to Hitler, just discuss with your friends.

            "answer_text": "One Soviet historian has stated that comparing Napoleon and Hitler is like comparing a conqueror to a marauder. In addition to the facts and comparison mentioned in other answers I would add some more comparisons ones to illustrate the point: In April 1814 knowing that everything is lost Napoleon has abdicated in order to avoid a further bloodshed saying that France has given him all he has asked for and he cannot ask for more. In similar circumstances Hitler has chosen to arm the 13 year olds and fight till the end. He has also said that if Germany is to lose the war then German nation is not good enough.British government has allowed Napoleon to take a small group of people to accompany him to St Helena island. Former emperor had to chose among dozens of people who volunteered to follow him to the place which is one of the most remote parts of the world even in 2018 let alone 1815. This is rather different from Hitler who had been largely abandoned at the time of defeat.Napoleon built bridges, roads, and applied better laws in conquered lands. Compare this to Third Reich\u2019s policies in occupied Europe.Although not perfect, Napoleon\u2019s economic policies were focused on economic development and creation of an economically stable and self sufficient state. Hitler\u2019s economic policies in 1933\u20131939 were entirely focused on war preparations. In fact, Nazi Germany had been heading towards bankruptcy in 1939 which had been avoided by the start of WWIIMemoirs of Third Reich leaders portray Hitler as a mentally unstable, inconsistent person with no real friends or loved ones. Memoirs of Napoleon\u2019s close ones portray a hardworking, organised person, a loving son and a forgiving (even too much) friend.Upon invading Poland Hitler issued an order to destroy certain paintings of Matejko (a well known Polish artist) which depicted Polish victory over Teutonic order in 15th and 16th century - \u201cPrussian Homage\u201d and \u201cBattle of Grunewald\u201d (luckily, both of them were hidden by the Poles). Napoleon would never fight with paintings, he would have considered them as a valuable asset and taken them to the Louvre.Hitler\u2019s habit of fighting a war was to attack suddenly without a proper war declaration. In most of the cases with Napoleon war was declared upon him by other powers.Napoleon was highly educated in various areas. Hitler wasn\u2019t even close to him in this aspect.The list can be continued on and on. Without a doubt, Napoleon was not a saint but comparing him to Hitler is an insult. I\u2019ll wrap up with another \u201cquote\u201d which I\u2019ve read many ears ago (not exact one, but very close one). Napoleon was not a cruel person, but did not hesitate to be cruel if there were no other options available. Hitler was genuinely cruel ",
