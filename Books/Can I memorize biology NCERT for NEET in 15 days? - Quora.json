            "answer_text": "Hi, I will quote Marshall Mathers here, \u201cYou can do anything you set your mind to\u201d So, following that memorising biology in 15 days can be done. But, let me bring you back to reality and taking you as a rational person, you should have started it earlier. The earlier the better. Now you have to put in double the efforts to do so. What I think you should do is, go get some online classes. Give them time, do the courses specifically developed for NEET and check out their video lectures on all the subjects. I will suggest you to opt for \u201cm-learning\u201d they will provide you all that you need to crack NEET. With more than 1100 hours of video lectures which have so detailed info. Go check them out on Google or search for their YouTube channel. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": " I don't think it's worth it to memorize biology. Because last 1 month should be given to practice and revision of all the chapters. Just memorizing the topics of bio will not help you much although you can do that. Also as you have already studies bio and other subjects why do you want to memorize it at this point. Just go in for revision of the topics. All the best ",
