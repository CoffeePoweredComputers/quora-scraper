            "answer_text": "NO The date given to you is estimated delivery date, not a guaranteed date. EDD (in short) is calculated with regards to normal delivery time taken to deliver a product to your doorstep. A lot of time, things don't happen in normal way which causes delay in delivery. But in most cases these aberration are taken into consideration while deciding EDD which is why the product reaches to you earlier than date notified. The factors that e-commerce companies consider while deciding dates are - Delivery distance (from hub, local collection center, etc)ConnectivityCourier partners availabilityCostE-commerce companies also work on the same principle as airline companies do. They always tell you the time after including loss of time due to unforeseen events and then they delight you by showing that they did everything on time. For eg - the flight time between Bhopal and Delhi is 1.5 hours and the distance is 700kms. We know that planes operate at 500\u2013900 kmph. Thus actual time should be less than an hour but if company says duration is less than 1 hour and flight lose time due to traffic or weather, then customers will be angry about wrong information about duration. In a nutshell, the EDD is not a perfect date for delivery. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It is normally always earlier than expected but, things happen. Delivery is not guaranteed 100 percent in any case ( whatever company). But, if we\u2019re talking about reliability of delivering products to the consumers, I would say, Amazon is one of the best there is in exceeding customer expectations. Of course, life happens and that\u2019s where the expectations fall below and it sucks if that small percentage happens to you just like it did with me. Have had items didn\u2019t arrive and wrong items at times. All you gotta do is contact the customer service in the website and 99.9% of the time, your concerns will be resolved. Goodluck and God bless ",

Not only do they deliver latest by the date they propose but 90% of the times, delivery is much much earlier and that\u2019s true delight :) Infact, we have subscribed to their Prime membership and so most of the times delivery is free and usually on the next day itself, worst case 2\u20133 days down (but still within proposed date) Only one observation I have had last two or three times -that their delivery partners (courier guys) sometimes fake a delivery attempt late in the evening (they say they tried to deliver without even bothering to ) which is detrimental to Amazon\u2019s brand image. Otherwise we are great fans and loyal Amazon Clients :-) ",

Amazon place and ship your orders on time but sometimes once the courier service receive the package, the delivery people cause additional nuisance by not delivering the product on time and updating the fake information that customer address was\u2019t located and hence the delivery will be attempted next day. I saw plenty of such cases while working as a CSR at Amazon. ",
