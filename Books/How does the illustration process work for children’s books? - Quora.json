            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve worked with many publishers and the general process is: the illustrator gets selected by the publisher and is sent the manuscript and a written brief. The illustrator (you) do a rough page layout with pencil sketches, you submit it and wait. You get feedback, adjust, resubmit and eventually go to artwork. You\u2019ll never meet the writer. However, that\u2019s not how I have done the majority of my books. I think the following rather unique process we use has contributed to the success of the series. In this case, there is one, sometimes two writers involved. Each write a complete story that has to fit with the requirements of the National Curriculum. When the manuscripts are approved (usually multiple books are written before the illustrator is involved) we meet up in the offices of the publisher. So that\u2019s the illustrator, the writer, the designer and sometimes a couple of people from editorial. Usually there are two writers and two illustrators (of which I\u2019m the second), no more. We meet up in a big conference room, drink coffee, catch up on family news and tell jokes before we start work. Each writer pairs up with the illustrator who is doing their book, and he (the two writers are both men) reads the book through, showing visual reference where necessary (\u201cI saw the castle looking like this\u201d or \u201cthis is the type of train used in the period the story is set in\u201d). The designer hands me a pile of page layouts with the text set but just a blank for the picture. On this I sketch each illustration in pencil. The other team are at the other end of the table doing the same thing. There\u2019s usually quite a lot of banter. We have all known each other for years and get on very well. We sometimes meet socially outside work. As I\u2019m sketching, the writer might say \u201cactually I saw this from another POV\u201d so I just re draw it. It\u2019s very easy to change stuff at this stage, and as there is a very convivial and relaxed atmosphere, I think that sense of fun finds its way into the pictures. I can think of many details and sub-plots that have appeared due to this process. There\u2019s often laughter and on occasions we (the illustrators) suggest something that the writer never thought of. After a break for lunch which the publisher provides in the same conference room (sometimes sandwiches, sometimes a much more upmarket lunch with wine if we want, served by waiters), we carry on. By the end of the day we have two 32-page books (or sometimes four or even six shorter books, two or more per illustrator) sketched out and pretty well agreed. These roughs are then checked by the people responsible for international sales, and usually a week or two later I get the green light to start artwork using the s/s copies I took on the day as my starting point. Occasionally there is a comment about the length of a skirt or not showing bare arms, but i am aware of the requirements of most cultures. After illustrating the artworks conventionally, I have them professionally scanned at high res, and then tweak/adjust/repair/add to them in Photoshop. When I\u2019m happy I upload them to the publisher. Occasionally there are further tweaks and adjustments, but not very often because of how closely we have worked. There is usually a deadline for the delivery of artwork but there is some flexibility. This is by far the best way I have ever worked. As far as I know we are unique in this process. I have no idea why, as it saves a lot of time, it\u2019s fun and it makes a better book. I can understand that sketching with other people watching and commenting is stressful for some illustrators, but I work very fast and really enjoy it, especially as the results are good. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have pointed out, I think it depends on the situation as well as the illustrator and publisher. I\u2019ve worked with traditional publishing houses like Simon & Schuster, Random House and HarperCollins. In most cases (I had to audition for the Harpercollins book as well as for illustrating Judy Blume\u2019s books with S&S), I\u2019m sent a manuscript and asked whether I\u2019d be interested in illustrating it. If I say yes, then I\u2019m sent a contract. For the publishers I\u2019ve worked for, I work directly with the art director , sometimes the art director AND the editor (but usually the feedback comes through the art director). There is usually an initial phonecall or email in which we (NOT the author) talk about any overall parameters, vision for the book, scheduling etc. but then they step back and let me have creative freedom. In almost all cases, the author did NOT have the opportunity to give feedback at each step of the sketch process. Or if they did, I didn\u2019t know \u2014- my feedback came from my art director and editor. There are usually at least one or two formal rounds of sketches and approvals before moving into the final art stage. Sometimes many more rounds! There is often a lot of \u201churry up and wait\u201d in the children\u2019s book illustration process, so I always advise new illustrators to keep that in mind when talking about scheduling. The one exception to the \u201cauthor does not give feedback throughout\u201d was when I illustrated reissues of Judy Blume\u2019s books for Atheneum/Simon & Schuster. Ms Blume had final approval over all aspects of the process, including choosing the illustrator. Even then, feedback came through the art director and editor, not directly from Ms. Blume. Side note: the few requests for changes that she sent were thoughtful and spot on (not micro-managey, as would be the tendency of some newbie picture book authors). But again\u2026.the process can vary, depending on the publisher and situation. I notice some other illustrators who have answered this question DO work directly with the author. \u2014- \u00a92020 Debbie Ridpath Ohi - Please do not share or reproduce my content without permission, thanks.
