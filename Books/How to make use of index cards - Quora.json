            "answer_text": "Index cards were likely more important to people before computers and phones with spreadsheets and databases. Index cards are still fairly easy to find, but the accessories for them, such as file boxes and tabbed dividers are no longer in every office and stationery store. If you want, you can still use them for keeping a calendar, a phone directory, a file of tasks, or a recipe file. Of course, index cards used to be the staple of library card catalogs. Spreadsheets and databases are more adept at most such tasks, with the added benefit of taking far less physical space and of being instantly and randomly searchable. (Card catalogs used to have multiple cards with cross-references for finding materials by title, author, and a variety of subjects.) I carry a few index cards so I don\u2019t have to tear pages out of my notebook just to give someone a note. I sometimes just write my contact information. Other times, I note down something I want to refer someone to, or something I want to remember. You could certainly use them as the basis for flash cards, or punch holes in them and bind them together with a cord, to make a notebook or calendar. Index cards can also be used as bookmarks, with or without notes. They\u2019re a good way to take notes from a library book without damaging it. Index cards, cut to size, can serve as the base for Artist Trading Cards. Folded in half, 3x5 cards make good little tents for place cards on tables, and for labeling foods brought to potluck gatherings. Here\u2019s a bunch more on Things You Can Do With an Index Card , and as usual, Pinterest has an assortment of crafts and practical things you can do with Index Cards. ",
