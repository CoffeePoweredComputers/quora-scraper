            "answer_text": "Well, the council of Nicea did not establish a fixed canon. It was not a goal of the council. It was not that very important to early Catholics, because they did not get their doctrines only from the Bible, but also from Christian traditions, which they believed they inherited from the first Christians, including the apostles. The first council that decided on a canon, and it was a canon the same as with today\u2019s Catholic church, was I think the council of Rome. But it was more a local council. So it was not considered binding on all Catholics. So in the east, the Catholics, who later became a distinct denomination after the split of the west with the east, so they became the Eastern Orthodox Christians, continued using an Old Testament with even more books. The thing was that the Septuagint translation of Old Testament had different versions, some had more books than others. So as a result Christians were not really united about what books belong in the Bible. For the Catholic church, the final binding decision on the canon was made at the Council of Trent. By that time, the Eastern Orthodox were already a distinct denomination from the Catholics, so the Catholic councils that occurred after the split of the west with the east, were of course not considered binding on the Eastern Orthodox. Luther of course started the Protestant Reformation, and he made a very different decision. He decided that the canon of the Old Testament should agree with the Jewish canon of the Bible. I don\u2019t know why he decided to agree with Judaism on this, rather than with traditional Christian beliefs, though he certainly decided that some of the Deuterocanonical books have some bad doctrines, that he did not like. Well, his views on the Old Testament became very popular, and were adopted by perhaps all Protestant churches, as well as many churches that are not considered Protestant, like for example the Mormon denominations. It is remarkable that Luther\u2019s decision to agree with Judaism became so popular, got adopted by so many denominations. ",

            "answer_text": "I understand why Protestants have less books in their Bible than Catholics, but why do Eastern Orthodox Christians have even more books in their Bible? Didn't the Council of Nicea establish a distinct Canon? Actually Nicea didn't quite establish a definitive canon: this is a story put about by Dan Brown. It did reject several writings which some proposed as possible additions to the New Testament. From memory this included the Apocalypse of Peter and perhaps The Shepherd of Hermas. But the issue is actually with the Old Testament, which is a good name for the Jewish canonical Tanakh as it's often called (containing the same books as the Protestant Old Testament) when taken together with various other writings only known until recently in Greek. The Greek version of this collection \u2014 Tanakh and additional Greek writings (Apocrypha) \u2014 is known as The Septuagint. The Septuagint didn't have a defined form. In fact it's probable that the second century heretic, Marcion, first got the idea of a defined canon. So Greek speaking Christians used whichever collection of Jewish scriptures that was available where they were. The Western church accepted what was commonly used in areas under Roman jurisdiction, in other areas, other collections were more popular. The Catholic Old Testament wasn't clearly defined until the Council of Trent, a reaction to the Protestant Reformation; in the fourth century, Jerome raised reservations about the secondary writings (referred to as Apocrypha by Protestants) and there was further debate on the topic in the time of Luther, who found at least one area of agreement with his opponent, Cardinal Cajetan, and that was that both didn't accept the canonicity of the western Apocrypha. Because of this lack of clarity over what actually constituted this apocryphal collection, the agreed basic content of the Bible is the New Testament plus the Tanakh, and the penumbra of other writings deemed canonical varies according to local and time-honoured habit \u2014 but habit, nevertheless.
