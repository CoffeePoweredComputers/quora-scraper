            "answer_text": "I originally wrote this answer for this question: Should white authors attempt to write or include people of color in their books considering that these authors have not experienced the struggles and dilemmas of a POC? But I think it applies to your story as well. Yes. White authors should include people of color in their books. Yes. White authors CAN and often do write good stories coming from POC perspective. No. White authors shouldn\u2019t write a story from the perspective of a POC character and the central struggle of the story is POC\u2019s personal experience of racism and their struggle against it. This applies to white male authors writing female characters and characters from minority/marginalized groups. For example: I\u2019m Chinese American. I can write a story about a group of friends fighting against evil monsters, and one of the characters who is a skilled swordswoman, loves ramen noodles, and can\u2019t stand reality shows, also happens to be black. Her identity isn\u2019t defined by her blackness. I can write a story about a young man suddenly transferred to a fantasy world and trying to survive there. The young man is nerdy, shy, but really good at strategy games, and wouldn\u2019t shut up about it. He might not be able to actually lead an army but man he can sure bullshit his way around the royal court. And it just so happens, the guy is a 15-year-old white boy from Texas. With research, I can tell a story about a Native American\u2019s struggle living in the Reservation from the perspective of me, an outside observer. That requires me to actually live in a reservation, to befriend Native Americans living there, and to really understand their plight. I can write this from my perspective as a Chinese American outsider. But I can not and should not write about a story about a Colombian refugee, and her journey following the caravan through the danger across the continent, to seek asylum in the US from the perspective of the said refugee. That\u2019s a story I cannot and should not tell, not from the perspective of a refugee. Such a story should only be told by a refugee who has experienced it. Similarly, I cannot and should not write a story about a poor black boy growing up in the Inner City, who has to struggle against racism, poverty, a broken family and gang violence. That\u2019s a story I have zero position to tell. And no amount of research would allow me to truly understand what it feels like to grow up in such an environment. Such a story should ONLY be told by people who have experienced it. And yes, before you ask, I can not and should not write a story from the perspective of a white single mother from rural Georgia, living in a trailer park, worked as a stripper, and her struggle to raise her two daughters against sexism, abuse, and poverty. In other words, you can write about a genius hacker who just so happens to be an Asian crossdressing hairstylist:  But Job\u2019s own story about how they come to be the way they are? That\u2019s a story only Job can tell. So in your case, with some intensive research, you can write about romances of someone from the LGBTQ community. If that someone is: already at peace with who they are and no longer struggle with their identity.The major conflicts of their romantic relations don't specifically revolve around them being non-straight.They live in a relatively openminded society, where discrimination is rare and doesn\u2019t cause too much distress.For example: You can write a gay man having a romantic relationship with another gay man if: both of them are out of the closet, are accepted by their friends and family.They live in New York or other more liberal cities that are more openminded and accepting of homosexuality.the major conflict of their relationship is universal for any love relationships: trust issue, insecurity, difficulty to communicate, etc., instead of something more specific for gay relationships, such as struggling with their sexuality, their identity as a gay man.In other words, you can write about gay romance, as long as the romance and character development doesn\u2019t revolve around their \u201cgayness\u201d. You can write about two people, in love, just so happen, they\u2019re gay. But, in our current social/political climate, it\u2019d be very very difficult to write a story about gay people without touching the discrimination they face. If you end up writing a romance story that devoid of current politics and larger social issues around us, the story might be criticized, quite rightfully, as tone-deaf and out of touch. So my advice? Write what you know. Write straight romance. Let LGBTQ people to tell their own stories. ",

            "answer_text": "Straight white male alert! Realistically, almost everything you do will offend at least someone. Some people really hate the color yellow for a shirt, right? Maybe ask yourself why you feel you need to write using LGBTQ characters. If you are doing it in good faith, then I think you probably have a good reason. But, you absolutely will offend someone, so you should definitely prepare yourself to deal with offending someone. You will not avoid offending everyone, especially if you are writing about experiences that you haven\u2019t directly observed. But, again, if you are acting in good faith, meaning that it is absolutely necessary for your characters to be LGBTQ because the story itself needs it, then hopefully the majority will be able to see your story as a story and not as something to potentially be upset about. tl;dr: You will offend someone. Guaranteed. Plan on it, and prepare for it. Be able to defend why you chose your story elements. If you don\u2019t have a good reason to be writing about LGBTQ and are just including that for superficial reasons, maybe reconsider that part of the story. ",
