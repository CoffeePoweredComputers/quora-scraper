            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my best answer, based on many years of working with my own son. First of all, \u201cschizophrenia\u201d is a diagnosis based on observation only. There are no medical tests. So, what exactly is being cured is the question. Until there is solid science behind the diagnosis, let\u2019s put the idea of cure aside. We are then left with thought and behavior. Someone\u2019s habitual thought patterns can manifest as what looks like an illness. (Remember: Schizophrenia is considered a \u201cthought disorder.\u201d Imagine you start to hear voices and experience visual hallucinations, and you try to explain in \u201cword saladese\u201d what is going on to a family member or friend. They can react in one of two ways. They can be horribly frightened, and try to \u201ccorrect\u201d your faulty logic, and rush you to a hospital where you\u2019ll be loaded up drugs and told that you have a \u201cdisease\u201d and are incurable. You are already frightened about what is happening to you, so their panic only causes you to panic further. Or, they can decide to no longer panic, and simply listen to you and reassure you that you are not mad, you are struggling to make sense of things that are happening to you, or whatever they can say that makes you feel good about yourself. From While Psychiatry Slept (Part II) - Mad In America Jung comments on this same idea in his introduction to John Perry\u2019s book The Self in Psychotic Process when he says: \u201cOne should not underrate the disastrous shock which patients undergo when they find themselves assailed by the intrusion of strange contents which they are unable to integrate. The mere fact that they have such ideas isolates them from their fellow women and men, and exposes them to irresistible panic, which often marks the outbreak of manifest psychosis. If, on the other hand, they meet with adequate understanding from their physician, they do not fall into panic because they are still understood by a human being and thus preserved from the disastrous shock of complete isolation.\u201d That\u2019s what talk therapy does. It discourages panic. There are some people who claim that talk therapy is useless for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but here\u2019s why, as a parent, I appreciate it. I haven\u2019t got the skills nor the amount of all-consuming energy needed to help my relative. I have learned how to speak with him and it works(!), but I\u2019ve got my own life to lead, and I can\u2019t be his therapist 24/7. He needs people to talk to, and for years, my son\u2019s psychotherapist was the only person who would listen. His friends all fell away, leaving him with a family that would often panic. Remember what I said in the second paragraph of this answer: Do not panic. In theory, a person wouldn\u2019t need a talk therapist if he or she has a well-trained social support system. In practice, well, we are all too human and families members really need to be all on the same page in knowing how best to support someone. We can unravel everything a therapist is trying to do if we are critical and impatient. We get tired. So, is there a cure for schizophrenia? There is no quick fix, but with time and a lot of good emotional support, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Schizophrenia is a \u201creal\u201d mental health illness that is noted for both positive symptoms and negative symptoms. \u201cPositive\u201d symptoms do not mean that these symptoms are \u201cgood for you\u201d per se. \u201cPositive\u201d symptoms simply mean that these symptoms are easily observed. They include hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations tend to be auditory in nature. People hear voices perceived to be coming from the outside, and not inside their heads. Usually, multiple voices are involved and can often be of both genders. Visual hallucinations are much more rare than auditory hallucinations. In terms of delusions, they tend to be persecutory or paranoid in nature, which are different than the grandiose delusions found in people suffering from a manic episode. There are also \u201cnegative\u201d symptoms of schizophrenia which include thought disorganization (where the person has trouble organizing his/her thoughts and as a result, when he/she speaks, it looks that the thoughts expressed are all over the place), amotivation, blunted affect (where the person\u2019s facial expression is not as natural and not as wide-ranged as otherwise normally be), issues with concentration and memory problems. Every person with schizophrenia may exhibit a different combination of the symptoms above. Therefore, there is some strong evidence behind that schizophrenia might not be such a homogenous illness as we traditionally believed to be. Instead the \u201ccategory\u201d of schizophrenia may contain subsets of conditions within that term. But that does not make the diagnosis not \u201creal.\u201d In terms of treatment, the main treatment for schizophrenia is anti-psychotics or neuroleptics. There has been an explosion of treatment in the past 10\u201315 years, which is good becauee we now have a lot of choices. The reason that having multiple choice is good is that everyone is different. I have seen cases where one does ok on risperidone (Risperdal), meaning 50% improved, but once switched to aripiprazole (Abilify), the improvement went to 75\u201380%! The opposite might be true for another person where aripiprazole (Abilify) just gives him/her agitation side effect without much relief, but once switched to risperidone (Risperdal), the person\u2019s suffering goes down and finds the latter to be calming and toning down the voices. In other words, only your physician can guide you to find the best treatment for your condition. Schizophrenia is now a very treatable condition. As for if schizophrenia can be \u201ccured,\u201d I don\u2019t like to use that word. Instead I like to say that with aggressive treatment and continuous effort on the part of the patients, schizophrenia can be controlled and can remain in remissions, so you can lead a long productive life. In the field of medicine, we rarely \u201ccure\u201d anything, save cutting out the appendix if you have appendicitis, or eradicating your pneumonia by giving you the correct antibiotics. Otherwise, in medicine, we don\u2019t \u201ccure\u201d sickle cell anemia, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, migraine, hypertension, high cholesterol, etc. etc. That list of conditions we don\u2019t even promise to cure goes on and on, forever. However with proper medication management, along with diet and lifestyle changes, we can keep those medical conditions (schizophrenia included) at bay and lead a long, productive life. But that does not mean there is no research done into curing various medical condition. Ultimately cure may lie in the use of genetic therapy which I am not very familiar with. You would probably need to alter one\u2019s genes permanently (across all cells in the body, or at least in the brain) in order to \u201ccure\u201d various medical conditions. One way is to introduce genetic fragments into your cells by using a toned down virus as a \u201cvehicle\u201d to intentionally infect your body\u2019s cells and inject man-made genetic materials to be incorporated into your cells\u2019 DNA.
