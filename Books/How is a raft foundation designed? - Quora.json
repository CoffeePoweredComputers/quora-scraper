            "answer_text": "The raft as a whole is to be analyzed in both directions and steel provided accordingly for both bending moment and shear force. In view of uncertainty of foundation reaction the steel in the tension zone is increased by 50% and half of it is provided in the compression zone. This is the traditional design. If more sophisticated analysis is available for foundation analysis this increase in steel can be minimized. I should be ensure that he soil below at least to a depth of half the width of raft is in good conditions. If water table is met with in this zone, the design needs to be modified accordingly. Please consult a lattest standard text book for further details. ",
