            "answer_text": "There is actually no definition of books when it comes to pages. We can define fictions or non-fictions based on how many lines are there. A binding can\u2019t be a book if i just has some pages.(e.g a diary).A diary has pages and you can write on it but it still can\u2019t be considered a book if it doesn\u2019t contain anything specific . There are children\u2019s books based on just so. Now a days we have electronic books,pdf. We don\u2019t have the criteria what is book or what is just a document. To conclude,it is not easy to define books on some simple criteria. ",

See the code list here ONIX codelists Issue 40 If it has pages (made of paper, foam, rag, cardboard, etc.) with a form of binding (glue, slide, stapled, etc), then that\u2019s a book. It\u2019s possibly easier to say what isn\u2019t a book \u2013 a pamphlet, a map \u2026 You can also optionally include electronic books in there.
