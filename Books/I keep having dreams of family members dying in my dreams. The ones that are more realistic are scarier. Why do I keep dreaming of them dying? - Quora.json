            "answer_text": "In dreams, other people are aspects of ourselves. When you dream of a family member and something seemingly bad happens to them, such as dying, ask yourself what part of him or her do you carry within you. The first thing that comes to mind is probably the most powerful. Their death in your dreams is most likely a symbol of the death of this characteristic or aspect of yourself. It usually symbolizes the ending of a phase in your life, the realization and release of something in your life, or behavior that you need to or are letting go of. It represents change and new beginning. Dreaming of someone\u2019s death does not mean that you want them to die. It is not a sign that they will die, are ill, or in danger. Our dreams are about out unconscious psyche and what is happening in our own life. Something is changing inside you. The old dies to make way for the new. Don\u2019t worry or feel guilty. Embrace the change. Your dream is revealing the significance of the change that is coming. The fact that it involves the powerful symbol of a loved one dying means that you need to pay attention and act as your own guide to the future. ",

They do not represent reality and dreaming of death is a positive thing. It means psychologically, that you have resolve an issue regarding your past.
