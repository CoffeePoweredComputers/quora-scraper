            "answer_text": "There is quite of bit of options to use for this. You could simply just look up the book followed by PDF and save it as a PDF to read. You could use overdrive and enter your library account and get rented books for about 30 days and not need to worry about turning it back in, as that is automatic. You would have to look around for some good websites, as most i have come across have little to no books, are scams, etc. Just be careful what you download, looking for actually books not scams. ",
