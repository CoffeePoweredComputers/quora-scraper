            "answer_text": "Most likely you don\u2019t like the books you\u2019ve tried to read. I remember trying to read over the years and I would never manage to finish anything. Then I went to the library and picked the thinnest books I could find. The unintentional consequence was that I was sort of reading wide! I found some bizarre stories and a few classics. Going for shorts books (a) boosted my confidence, (b) exposed me to things that no one would have ever recommended to me (c) totally changed what I imagined I like. I also use audiobooks unapologetically. The way I see it, books are just a vehicle for the content, the shape and make of the said vehicle doesn\u2019t matter as long as you get the content. Believe me, preventing yourself from getting the content because you\u2019d rather get through one medium or not at all is not worth it.  Also, these ideas have helped me get unblocked and prevented the words from getting blurry: No one cares.This is not a competition.There are no books you should read.If you think a book is great, you are correct.If you think a book is bad, you are correct.Your mind will change on re-reading.No one is the same, we bring our own worldview to the material.It takes however long it takes.This is not homework.This is a lifetime thing. Make it part of you.Relax.",

            "answer_text": "People tend to read books they enjoy or make a sustained investment into getting to know. It is part passion, discipline and sometimes, eventually, a habit. I wouldn\u2019t suggest viewing books as being read or finished, but rather as a continuum of perspective that can be understood through different context. As a person with ADHD, I\u2019m not actually interested in finishing anything except getting what I want. What becomes important is learning to choose your books. Some books are best read over a period of years, some in a few days, and some, you never will. ",
