            "answer_text": "Your concepts should be really really strong before touching this book. Me and my friend solved nearly 60\u201370% of this book and i can conclude that if you have ample time then only think to start this book as most of the problems in this book is very lengthy and time consuming. Don\u2019t get depressed if you are not able to get five questions in a row, its normal and if you are able to solve this book all by your own(in stipulated time) then you are Mathlete and there is high chances of you scoring above 90% in Jee Advanced(even 100%). This is the reason why this book is popular by the name \u201cThe Black Book\u201d in Kota. ",
