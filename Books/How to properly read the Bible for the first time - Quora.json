            "answer_text": "The fact you are even the smallest bit interested in reading proves that you recognize you have a spiritual need, sadly most do not (even some in religions). Hopefully you are reading it as you want to get to know God. The Psalms are very comforting as well as enlightening and when reading about the lives of ones like King David, we get to see that they made mistakes just as we do and the fact they feature in the bible is very heart warming because if the bible was not from God you can bet your life that the mistakes of Kings etc would not be in there. If you want to know about Jesus then the four gospels Matthew, Mark, Luke and John tell about his birth, life and death. Some start at Genesis and read through to Revelation which gives you all the history from the beginning, but if you know little of scripture then that is probably not the best way to do it, the bible is a hard book in places and maybe you should ask yourself some questions beforehand like what do you want to know and why? I would get a good study bible that has cross references in it and if possible a concordance. Are you seeking knowledge, truth or both? Believe me when I say there is a difference as I found out for myself. What do you intend to do with this knowledge once you have acquired it? Are you willing to act upon what you learn? Many do not. There are so many reasons that people decide to look into the bible and for many it is because they want answers to life\u2019s big questions: How did we get here? Why are we here? Is there a purpose to life? Why is there so much suffering? Why do we get sick grow old and die? Why is there so much crime? Why do people fight and war with one another? Is there any hope for a better future? What is the future for the earth? If you believe in God then that is admirable and if you really want to know him then that takes effort but you will not be disappointed and your efforts will not be in vain. Pray from your heart to God, through the name of Jesus his Son, as he is our mediator, and ask God to help you to find him and gain accurate knowledge of him and his purpose, he will help you by pouring out his holy spirit to open your spiritual eyes, he desires all people to live and invites all to come to him, so when reading a few verses ask yourself what it tells you about God and how it applies to you personally. Jesus said in Luke 11:9 \u201cSo I say to you, keep on asking,+ and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you.\u201d+ Hope that helps.

            "answer_text": "Here's how I was taught to read the Bible the first time, and it was amazing: Pick a gospel (Matthew, Mark, Luke or John), and read 1 chapter a day. Get your notebook out, and answer these 5 questions: What was Jesus (or the other people mentioned) doing?With or to whom was Jesus doing it?Why was he doing it?How can I imitate Jesus heart in that today?What questions do you have about what happened, or what was written?If the questions don't seem to apply or you can't figure it out, don't stress it, just move on and try the next chapter the next day. Next read Acts, Romans, and keep going in the New Testament. This will challenge anyone, even the seasoned Christian. I came to believe in Jesus and built my faith in God and the Bible doing this, and still go back to it 20 years later. Here's why it was amazing: as I tried this, I changed. Changed like for the better, and not just in small ways. It wasn't even like a New Year's resolution kind of change, either, it was gradual, and barely noticeable to me. It was, however, striking to those around me. I became more like Christ - which isn't as hard as it seems. If you're any kind of a selfish, arrogant, socially awkward goober with low-self esteem like I was, there's no nowhere to go but up! If you want to become more kind, loving, patient, pure-minded, serving, humble and giving, learn from the Master - and I don't mean me! If you want to know if the Bible is true or not, Jesus left us an simple way to figure it out: \u201cIf you hold to my teaching, then you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\u201d (John 8:31a\u201332, NIV, emphasis mine) Try to find a Christian whom you respect, and ask them to give you some guidance on it, maybe meeting with you regularly until you get going with it. If you can't find one, message me. Last thing: I'd be happy to offer some intro Bible studies to anyone interested. Please message me if you are. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible is a massive library of 66 books. It can be quite daunting to read it, at first. Few people are able to begin at Genesis and read through the whole 1189 chapters to Revelation 22 the first time they try it. I hope you have a Bible that is written in the language you speak. Translations like the New Living Translation or the Good News Bible are easier to understand than many other English Bibles. The New International Version and the Holman Christian Standard Bible [which will soon be available as the Christian Standard Bible, in an updated edition] are also reasonably easy to read. If you don\u2019t have copies of these, you can find them at A searchable online Bible in over 150 versions and 50 languages. It is a good idea to begin by reading the first chapters of the Bible in Genesis. You may soon find it overwhelming, and if so, put it aside and read another part of the Bible. I suggest you begin reading the short books of the Bible such as Mark [the shortest Gospel] 1 John and other short New Testament books like Jude and Philemon In the Old Testament, you could read a few psalms from the Book of Psalms, read the lovely story of Ruth and the story of Jonah. If you feel like you are getting the hang of it, read another Gospel, and then read Acts, the story of what happened after Jesus died and was resurrected. Then, you might like to tackle the whole New Testament. I\u2019m currently reading the whole Bible through for the fourteenth time and am thoroughly enjoying it. I hope you get hooked and keep reading and loving God\u2019s Word, and taking up its offer of putting your trust in Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. ",

            "answer_text": "Get a study Bible and/or Concordance. and find an affable group of informed people to study with. The study Bible\u2019s translation and organization will vary according to the faith and/or tradition you choose: e.g. Roman Catholic Bibles will contain more books which are considered divinely inspired versus Protestant bibles, and the titles of the books may differ slightly. In some historical translations, English-speaking Catholics will call Jonah \u201cJonas\u201d or Noah \u201cNoe\u201d, etc. The Book of Revelation in older Catholic translations will be called the Apocalypse of St John the Apostle. But don\u2019t get bogged down in sectarian disputes as to which Bible is authentic, such disputes are for fundamentalist philistines who have not studied the Bible\u2019s evolution in its complexity and richness. This brings me to my last point: in addition to a Study Bible, find an Bible Study group to read with. As with translations, Bible Study groups may follow a particular faith or tradition. I recommend a group led by an ordained minister from a mainline Protestant tradition from an accredited divinity school. (e.g. Doctor of Divinity from Harvard or a large university) Or, choose a Catholic group led by a priest or Franciscan. Or choose a liberal tradition which ordains women. The reason I recommend more educated biblical study groups is that you may get more tolerant, non-literal diverse readings of passages pertaining to things like homosexuality and sin. My experience with these Bible study groups run by ministers with minimal educational backgrounds from small, unaccredited bible colleges is that their readings are idiosyncratic and geared towards the agenda of the small church pastors whose interpretations are rigid, dogmatic and outright manipulative. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re new to reading the Bible you\u2019ll want to start with the following: Get a good Bible. You need a modern translation of the Bible that has helpful introductions to each book, maps and occasional charts, and ideally study notes. I recommend you go to your local bookstore and seek out a \u201cStudy Bible.\u201d NIV and NRSV are great translations. You\u2019ll find others as well.Decide what\u2019s important to you. Do you want to understand Christianity better? Then begin in the New Testament and move to the Old Testament later, perhaps using the cross-reference notes that you\u2019ll find in your study Bible. (For example, the Gospel of Matthew has countless Old Testament references throughout. You could begin with Matthew and when you get curious flip back to the Old Testament book that is quoted and go from there.) Do you want to understand the entire Biblical narrative better? Then I\u2019d suggest beginning with the New Testament Book of Acts, which has a number of long speeches that put the Old Testament in Context. Then switch back and read Genesis & Exodus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel, then 2 Samuel. You\u2019ll get the whole history that way.Finally, consider inviting a friend to join you in daily reading. That is, ask a friend to read the same passages as you each day, and meet once a week to talk about what you\u2019ve read. Ideally you would enlist 3\u20135 friends and you could all agree to do the same reading and discuss weekly. Scripture is meant to be interpreted. Thus, it gives a great payoff if people are willing to read and discuss together. You\u2019ll go much deeper through the eyes and insights of your friends.",

And yet that is one place where people often do not start when reading the Bible, and, consequently, it is the place they will never reach either. All over the world, there are people who have been in churches for many decades, and yet they have never encountered the Jesus of the four gospels, who is referred to in scripture as \u201cthe cornerstone which the builders rejected\u201d. His teachings are found in the four gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke & John. A collection of some of his best teachings can be found in just three chapters of Matthew (5, 6, & 7). Those three chapters end with a sobering story about people who would listen to that sermon and then not act on what Jesus said in it.

If you want to learn about Jesus, its one of the Gospels. If you are interested in Moses, its Exodus or Numbers or one of the Pentateuch. If you want poetry, Psalms. If you are wanting wisdom, Proverbs or Ecclesiates. I used to do weights training, and I found it quite helpful to have a training partner. I was always there at the appointed time. Make an Bible study appointment with a buddy, and study it together. Listen to your pastor. He should be good at explaining it. If you want some time with him, make an appointment. I always had time to discuss scriptures with parishioners. If you like, there are groups like Navigators and Bible Study Fellowship who exist to study the Bible more closely. If after a year you are still at sea, wanting a discipline, you probably can benefit from one of these hints. As to where to start, I always like John's gospel. But it is fun to read Paul also, or Torah or the wisdom books. Get some help with the history for Kings and Chronicles, and some expert help for Daniel. ",

            "answer_text": "Where do I start if I never read the Bible? If you never read the bible, the one thing you do not want is anybody\u2019s opinion about what it should say. So no \u201cstudy bibles\u201d, no commentaries, no tracts, no goofy preachers live or tv. Sit down by yourself with only a bible and read. It is not reliable to let people tell you what the bible says. Many people will make up stuff because they don't know what it says, and many will make up stuff because they wish it would not say what it says. You just have to read it for yourself. Read a chapter of Proverbs every day. Proverbs has 31 chapters so you can keep your place by just looking at a calendar. There is no religion or nothing in Proverbs and you don't have to believe anything. Just read to find wisdom. When you are comfortable with that, then read the bible from Romans to 2 Thessalonians over and over until you start to remember passages. That is the part that applies to Christians. In about three weeks of this study you will know more bible than the average seminary graduate. That is because seminary students study other people\u2019s opinions ABOUT the bible, rather than studying the bible. Of course there will be passages that you don\u2019t understand. When that happens, keep reading. It will usually be explained. If that doesn\u2019t work then write your question and put the paper in a safe place. Eventually God will send understanding and then you can retire the paper. ",

If you want to know what Jesus did when He first came you can read Matthew, Mark, Luke or John. These are 4 different accounts. Two are eyewitnesses and one was a doctor and the first one was a disciple. If you want to know how everything began then you read Genesis. If you want to know future events then you read the prophets and revelation. For wisdom you read the proverbs. For poetry and songs you read psalms. For Church history specifically the time immediately following Christ\u2019 departure you read acts. For education you would read Roman's until Hebrews. Hebrews is meant for deeper learning and study. John is meant for end of life and encouragement. Peter is for recovery and life lessons and preparations for the end of the world. The entire book from Genesis to Revelation is all about Jesus Christ. There are many other categories and themes that can be learned from the book. But in an open environment with atheists mocking i would specifically have you learn what King David said. \u201cThe fool has said in his heart that there is no God.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "On first reading the Bible, it is normal to interpret the verses \u201cliterally-physically\u201d. LESSON ON MORALITY AND BENEFIT FOR THE BODY 1. From the Ten Commandments: \u00b7 Exo 20:13 Thou shalt not kill. \u00b7 Exo 20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. \u00b7 Exo 20:15 Thou shalt not steal. 2. John the Baptist doubting Jesus Christ: Luk 7:22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.The result of the foregoing is RELIGIOSITY as we see Christianity today many sects and denominations. FOR A SERIOUS BIBLE READER, THE FOLLOWING IS THE GUIDE The primary purpose of the Bible is the \u201csalvation of the soul\u201d, and not the benefit of the body. However, this needs true and sincere \u201cspiritual humility\u201d as Jesus Christ said: \u00b7 Mat 18:3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Then your eyes will be \u201copened\u201d and see the following: \u00b7 Joh 6:63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life [spiritual not physical life]. \u00b7 2 Cor 4:18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. \u00b7 2 Cor 3:6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter [not literal but spiritual interpretation], but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. This is SPIRITUALITY that many Bible believers have \u201cnot seen\u201d. That is why Jesus Christ said: \u00b7 Mat_20:16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen. ",

There are people, places, plans and purposes. You don't need anyone pulling you by the nose, you don't need any special way to approach it as if it is an esoteric book that only the experienced can know. But I will only advice that you get away from the king James version, because of its achaic language. You can enjoy the Bible in almost any other version. Also determine to read a minimum number of chapters a day depending of how much time you want to devote to it. In addition, consider journaling. Writing focuses you understanding. I believe why you are reading is more important than how you are reading. The mind you bring to it will determine what you will get out of it. I set out to finish the reading the Bible within a year, reading four chapters a day, and that was exactly what I did some time ago. ",

My ten year old has read the Bible, King James Version, from cover to cover but I do not expect him to understand vast amounts of it. It is always good to read through it a couple of times before digging in to study it. You have to know what it says before you can understand it. That being said, if you are after a crash course to get up to speed on the basics I would recommend reading Genesis and the beginning chapters of Exodus up to and including Chapter 23. This will give you a little historical background so you have some reference of what the New Testament is speaking of. From there read Romans. Romans is a explanation and description of God\u2019s plan of salvation. If you remember what you read from verse to verse and chapter to chapter you should have little trouble grasping the information. After, I would read Hebrews and then start reading the whole New Testament. You will not understand Revelations but that does not matter now; read the Old Testament next, you will not understand it all, read it anyway. I wish you well in your desire to know God\u2019s word.

            "answer_text": "The Bible is a dangerous book if you are younger than 40 years old. Get a life first. The stories in the Bible are neither fiction nor history nor myth. It is a qabalistic work that hides a non-dualistic philosophy that can be used to create the life of your dreams. But to learn this philosophy can be destabilizing, to say the least. This philosophy also allows those in the know to brainwash vast numbers of people (around 3 billion by now) and hide the truth from them about themselves. Those in the know will downplay the meaning of the text, but the truth is, it is their source for techniques on mind control. The key to understanding the Bible is three-fold: 1. abandon all things you think you know about it - the Hebrew Bible (aka Old Testament) is unrelated to the New Testament addition, 2. learn the meaning of the Hebrew letters (see my profile for resources) and 3. read the texts in their original language (do not accept translations because they hide the original meaning by using subtleties to promote a theology of the translator\u2019s choice). If you read it without an understanding of ancient multilayered texts, but instead try to read it at face value, you risk being infected with a mind virus that will turn your life into turmoil. It will be the source of your worst nightmares for decades to come. For what it\u2019s worth, I speak from experience. ",

If you start with John, read 1, 2, 3 John as well, then go to Matthew, then Mark and Luke. Afterwards, read Acts and Romans, then Paul\u2019s letters to the churches in Greece. Read James, 1\u20132 Peter, and Jude. Then go to Genesis. Read about the beginnings of the Israelites (Exodus through Ruth). Read the Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel). If possible, while reading Daniel, read Revelation (they coincide). After this, read whatever\u2019s left. Read the History of the Israelites (1\u20132, Samuel, 1\u20132 Kings, 1\u20132 Chronicles). Read Esther and the other Prophets. Read Hebrews, then the poems/philosophy (Psalms, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes). Read Lamentations and Job. Save Song of Solomon for last.

Literally He speaks to us through this book and the scripture says His (Gods) ways are higher than mens ways. So the very first thing I would do is go to Him in prayer. I would ask Him for guidance and understanding, ask Him for help you realize what He is saying to you personally. Then I would open His word and I would start reading. I would meditate on what I read and see how it would apply to me. I would try to be brutally honest with myself.( God disciplines the ones He loves) Discipline is just correction of your way of thinking. Let His words and wisdom mold and cause you to become more in His ways, not in ours. Finally I would pray to Him often and thank Him for the opportunity of having a relationship with Him. Sorry I am so long winded. This subject and having a good relationship with Jehovah God touched my heart. Sometimes it is a cold dark place without God. ",

The Bible should be studied TOPICALLY with a good study guide to get the best from it. I recommend this one, but there are others. Some will reject this stating it is a Jehovah\u2019s Witness publication but almost every study guide is produced by one religious group or another. This can be obtained FREE of charge and downloaded at JW.ORG.  I also do NOT recommend the use of the King James Bible, the archaic language and sentence structure make it difficult to understand and get the correct meaning of many verses for the new student. I recommend the New American Standard Version, the New International Version, the International Standard Version or the New World Translation which can also be downloaded FREE of charge at the above website.

This Gospel is considered the most loved and easy to understand Gospel. But supplement with the first five books of the Old Testament - Genesis to Deuteronomy, to grasp a better understanding.Don't just read from a single book everyday; it's like only eating rice with no viands and water. At least three books a day will do, to make it more balanced.Use a reading plan. There are 30-day reading plans and mostly there are one-year. Use the reading plan that will give you a reading from at least two-three books a day. That will be more healthy.Enjoy reading the Bible! Be challenged and changed! ",

John is also great a explaining many concepts that are not listed in other places. All books add something to the story but all books leave something out. The epistles of Paul were written to correct problems that were occurring in the church. The people were baptized but not fully converted and were bring some their other beliefs with them that were not Christian. Get a good bible. I recommend the King James Version.

Better, they\u2019re free.The Infographic Bible[2] is incredible, and well worth the money. It\u2019s is chock-a-block with infographics on things I wouldn\u2019t even have considered about in the bible, such as comparing where and how Jesus healed people (cross-referenced with how many at a time), or different poses in prayer and worship. It has a really fresh way of distilling the over-arching story of the Bible.The Spoken Gospel[3] project releases Spoken Word book introductions. It sounds cheesy. But David Bowden is a fine craftsman and has really helped me understand the main themes and crucially how they point to Jesus. So far they\u2019ve done the Pentateuch and the Gospels.But as J.I Packer said in Knowing God. It is one thing to know about someone, but it is quite another to know them personally. Likewise the Bible. In order to get to know it, you need to read it for yourself. In doing so you get to rely on what it says for itself on its own terms. There are a great many tools and reading plans to help you get through it. But if you\u2019re going for the over-arching message, one in which you read a book at a time is best. There is no harm in reading swathes at a time. 1 Corinthians is arguably pretty long, 16 chapters, but it is a letter that was intended to be read as a whole. You can go back and study questions later. Keep a record of your questions. I do so on a Trello Board. Often your questions are answered by other parts of the Bible itself. Other questions can be answered in many ways: Got Questions[4] is well known and loved - you can ask your own. A good study bible is helpful. On a practical note, I do it on YouVersion, which means I can do so on my phone, tablet, laptop, anywhere I am. My preference is for plans which take me through the Old Testament before reaching the New Testament - God arranged it in a way that His revelation is progressive. In other words, start with Revelation and you\u2019ll miss a whole lot of information. Start with the Gospels, and you\u2019ll not fully understand the prophesies. McCheyne\u2019s plan, which ties Old and New Testaments together, is well loved by many but only good if you know what is happening in those passages to begin with. This year I\u2019ve followed a chronological plan, which has the same events from different books together. That\u2019s been useful to see how it ties together, but it got really choppy with some of the histories and the gospels. Next year I\u2019m going to do a book at a time. Drilling down and discovering what each verse says is crucially important too - and that is a life-time\u2019s work. It requires meditating on each verse bit by bit and asking questions of it. On this note I would absolutely recommend Dig Deeper by Nigel Benyen and Nigel Sachs.[5] It helps you know what kind of questions you should be asking! It is invaluable.

Luke was written to the Greeks and showed the humanity of Jesus. John was written to show the divinity of Jesus Christ as Lord and God.

I suggest starting with the teachings of Jesus in the 4 gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). The reason why is because the whole Bible\u2014 both the Old and the New Testaments point to Jesus and his teachings, and also because Jesus\u2019 teachings are the fulfillment of the rules in the Old Testament. If you are short on time, I suggest reading Jesus\u2019 famous Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5,6,and 7 because there are a lot of good teachings and wisdom there. As you read the teachings of Jesus, take Jesus literally and understand that what he said to his disciples was meant for all Christians. After all, disciples and Christians are the same thing (Acts 11:26). Try to apply his teachings to your life and literally do them. If you do, you\u2019ll get so much more out of your reading than theologians and church pastors! ",

The order of the books was chosen with some care, after all, by people who took the Bible very seriously. A friend of mine once recommended starting with Ezra and Nehemiah, since they record the historical events that came just before the canon of the Bible started being collected. Then you could read the rest in order. If you are interested in a particular religious topic, you would want to choose other parts. Life of Christ? Read the Gospels in any order. Christian theology and moral teaching? The Epistles. The Problem of Evil? The book of Job. And so on. ",

If your looking for a scholarly viewpoint (Study point) you should divide the Bible into different parts such as - Old Testament- Moses writings (Pentateuch or Torah) then go for the Prophet\u2019s (Nevi\u2019im) and at last go for Writings (Ketuvim). Remember that the Old Testament is very difficult to understand if you don\u2019t apply your mind and connect especially when you read Nevi\u2019im, I strongly suggest you should use several references and notes to understand several passages.New Testament- In terms of New Testaments the gospels are divided into 4 and then comes Pauline Literature. Start by reading the synoptic gospels ( Matthew,Mark,Luke) and then move to John and go for Paul, after Paul you may come up with other gospels such as James, Peter, Hebrews etc.In any way it depends on how you approach it, don\u2019t rush and if you don\u2019t understand a chapter then read it again until you get it.

And this is recorded in: Acts 8:26-35 Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, \u201cGo south to the road\u2014the desert road\u2014that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.\u201d So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake (which means \u201cqueen of the Ethiopians\u201d). This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah the prophet. The Spirit told Philip, \u201cGo to that chariot and stay near it.\u201d Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \u201cDo you understand what you are reading?\u201d Philip asked. \u201cHow can I,\u201d he said, \u201cunless someone explains it to me?\u201d So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.  This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading: \u201cHe was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.\u201d The eunuch asked Philip, \u201cTell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?\u201d Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.  Like the Ethiopian, it is difficult to understand the bible by yourself. What you need is to join a bible study, bring your bible, paper and pen - to explore its contents. There are bible studies conducted daily in the Church of Christ and I hope there is one near you. Normally these bible studies are conducted after 5 pm everyday.  ",

Genesis has perhaps the best story content, including a lot of subtleties that you will probably miss upon first reading. The Joseph narrative, which takes up about a fourth of the book, is unsurpassed in ancient literature. It stands on its own as a story without reference to any theological concerns. If you like sex and violence, you can\u2019t beat the Book of Judges. If you are more interested in philosophy, Ecclesiastes would be my first choice. Job is a profound book but very hard to understand. For poetry, the Psalms are a good bet. Also \u201cSong of Songs\u201d (aka \u201cSong of Solomon.\u201d) I would recommend that you avoid the King James version, which is a marvelous example of Renaissance prose but often hard to understand. Newer translations, besides being easier to read, also have the advantage of scholarship that was not available hundreds of years ago. You may want to look into some commentaries also, or an annotated Bible. Many texts should not be taken at face value. Since I am Jewish, I am not familiar enough with the NT to make any recommendations about it. I will leave that to Christians who respond to this post. ",

            "answer_text": "There are \u201cReading plans\u201d that people have created to help others read through the bible. Back to the Bible offers some different plans for different purposes and time lines. Personally, when I first became a believer, I just sort of let the spirit lead me if you will. And focused on the New Testament, finding the letters of Paul very useful to give me a good understanding of what the way was all about. If I knew your intent on reading the bible and your more about your faith, I could perhaps give you some better advice. I\u2019d for sure pray for guidance and trust in the lord in guiding you. http://shorelinechurch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NewBelieverReadingPlan-Feb2014a-Final.pdf First Steps For New Believers: Day 1 http://www.firstbible.org/resources/helpfullinks/Bible%20Reading%20Chart-%20New%20Believer.pdf There are some other examples of reading plans. My best advice is to pray, let the spirit lead you, and keep an open heart and mind. And remember, the Bible is a collection of letters and histories written by men. Men of strong faith who were inspired by God. And that God preserved these writing for us, to help teach and guide us in our faith. But the real importance is our personal relationship with God. And sharing that relationship, that love, with others. God bless you my friend and feel free to contact me directly at trkenney35@gmail.com ",

John 20:30-31 30 And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book; 31 but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name. You will find faith strengthened by reading John. A second recommendation is to read one chapter in Proverbs each day. They will impart wisdom and you will find great insight into daily issues in proverbs. Be blessed in your reading. ",

However about 3 years after i became born again, where i had previously prayed to be baptized in the holy spirit, and saw the appearance of an angelic like being in my bedroom, i began praying to know which church to Join, because i believed there was only one true church. the spirit of revelation came upon me, and i was taught doctrines that only the Church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints teaches. the restoration of the Church is found in the LDS church, and a person should argue against its doctrines. i say it is the first step to get baptized into this church and learn the words of God in modern revelation given through JOseph Smith, the prophet of the restoration. Jesus said in the first vision to not join any of them\u2026 they are all \u201cwrong\u201d\u2026 thus saith the Lord. ",

            "answer_text": "You may start with the following summary of the Core teachings of Christianity: Jesus taught that when we obey God and do good works; we will pass the test of this world and will become qualified to receive God\u2019s rewards in heaven In Matt 5:13-16, Jesus taught that the believers should act as the salt to protect against corruption and as a light to guide others to the truth The same is also written in mark 9:50 and Luke 14:34-35 In Matt 7:13-14, Jesus warned those who follow the majority \u201cEnter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it\u201d. Most people ignore that teachings and say, \u2018As long as I am with the majority, I should be fine\u2019, but they are wrong according to the teachings of Jesus in Luke 13:24-27, Matthew 7:13-14 In Matt 7:15-20, Jesus warned from the false teachers who mislead people; he advised us to identify them from their bad deeds. In Matthew 7:21-23 Jesus warned of the false teachers who claim to perform miracles; he advised that only the believers who obey will enter the kingdom of heaven. The same is also written in Luke 13:25-27 In Matthew 22:35-40, Jesus confirmed the teachings of the Old Testimony like Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 18:4-5 Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one\u2019s neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6 \u201cFor I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings\u201d. Luke 12:16-21 is a parable to warn most people who treasure for tomorrow while turning a blind eye to the hungry people we see everyday. John 12:25 warns those who like to \"live it up\" urging them to prepare for the eternal life. The same is also confirmed in Matthew 10:39 and Matthew 16:25 The same is also mentioned in Luke 9:23-25, Mark 8:34-35 Matthew 13:44 teaches us to give everything to obey so that we get God\u2019s rewards for the righteous James 4:1-5 also warns those who compete to enjoy the pleasures of this life Luke 6:27-36 and Matthew 5:38-42 set the high standard for wise dealing with others; such teachings would replace hatred by compassion and would transform earth into a paradise. Matthew 7:12 reminds us of the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d, the common ground wisdom taught by all wise teachers and prophets. Matthew 6:24 urges us to shift from the material life into a spiritual life. Matthew 12:50 teaches that the real family of the prophet are the obedient believers. \u201cFor whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother\u201d. Luke 6:46-48 teaches that solid faith foundations are based on obedience to the teachings. The same is also taught in John 14:15 and John 14:21 \u201cIf you love me, you will keep my commandments\u201d. John 14:21 \u201cThey who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them\u201d In Matthew 25:31-45 Jesus described the final judgment as being based on good works; he clarified that those who obey the law will be saved. Salvation is not based solely on belief and nothing else; salvation is not granted to those who merely profess acceptance of Jesus without actually performing kind or compassionate deeds. Jesus did not teach that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law; In Matthew 16:27 and John 5:29, Jesus has confirmed that God will reward each person according to his deeds; those are the basic teachings of the old testimony like the verses taught in Psalm 62:12, Ecclesiastes 12:14, and many other old testimony verses. Matthew 25:41-46 teach that when we give the poor, we give to God . James 2:14 and 2:17 teach that faith without works is dead.

So, it will be way profitable for you if you start reading the bible from the first four books of the New Testament. It\u2019s worth noting that what Jesus says in those books are what make/define a Christian, since Christians are disciples of Jesus. Once you understand and appreciate what Jesus taught in those books, practice them and then you should be in a better position to read and understand the whole bible. I hope this helps. ",

For example, once you have read Isaac\u2019s story from the beginning \u2014 with the displacement of Ishmael and the near-sacrifice \u2014 you can understand the character of Isaac through the rest of his life. He doesn\u2019t resist the native inhabitants of the land, but gives up his wells. He tries to avoid conflict. Thus when his younger son turns scoundrel, he doesn\u2019t know how to handle it. He has to be told by his scheming wife that it would be wiser for Jacob to leave. ",

Keep in mind that John chapter three is the central theme of the whole Bible. It is a good idea to read one chapter of Proverbs a day, that will make you wise if you do what it says. Come back around and read Matthew, Mark, and Luke as well, realizing that some of the stories are repeated in the gospels. Then if you like you can explore more of the O.T. It is filled with interesting stories, keep in mind that all those sacrifices were temporary until Jesus came to be the perfect sacrifice for sin. And it is very messy in there as well, with people doing a lot of killing for whatever reasons. How God dealt with Israel is a large topic there. ",

A great guide to approaching the Bible is Chuck Missler\u2019s \u201cLearn the Bible in 24 Hours\u201d (www.KHouse.org). ",

If you really want to understand it properly, you should study the following languages before : Biblical Hebrew (and grammar)Aramic. (Especially for the book of Daniel)Your next stage will be studying the Bible in its original language with basic Jewish commentators like Rashi - Wikipedia. Which will help you understand the simple meaning of the verses, though a bit Jewish inclined interpretation which you may ignore if you find it too inclined. You must learn the followings too: The historical background of the books you are reading.The geography and borders of the territories which were occupied by ancient nations in Israel and in its vicinity. And finally, you have to read the Bible several times in order to do cross correlation between different texts. Good luck! ",

Or you could purchase a Bible with commentary to understand the scripture better. Studying the Bible together with a friend or a church Bible study group is very beneficial too. Either way, we need strength and guidance from the scripture each and every day of our lives. More than reading, it is important to meditate and apply God\u2019s truth in our lives. I have found the SOAK method very useful for my Bible study. S stands for important scripture verses or verses that stand out, O stands for the objective of the scripture passage you read, A stands for the application (how one can apply the scripture in his/her life), K stands for Kneeling in prayer (Say or write a prayer requesting God to use the passage of scripture to change and make you more like Him). I hope this helps, my friend! ",

After that, The Bible is basically about humanity navigating the path between order and chaos (Moses, Noah, Job, Daniel etc), and the notion that Beings can always come back to what is Godly.
