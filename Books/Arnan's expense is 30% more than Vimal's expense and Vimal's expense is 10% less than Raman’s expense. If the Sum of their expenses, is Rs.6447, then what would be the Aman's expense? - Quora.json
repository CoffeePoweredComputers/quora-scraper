Vimal's expense is 10% less than Raman\u2019s expense 10% of x = 10/100 of x = 0.10x Thus Vimal\u2019s expenses will be x - 0.10x Arnan's expense is 30% more than Vimal's expense 30% of x - 0.10x = 30/100 \u00d7 (x - 0.10x) = 0.30 (x - 0.10x) Arman's expenses will be (x - 0.10x) + 0.30 (x - 0.10x) If the Sum of their expenses, is Rs.6447, then what would be the Aman's expense. x + (x - 0.10x) + (x - 0.10x) + 0.30 (x - 0.10x) = 6447 x + x - 0.10x + 0.90x + 0.30 \u00d7 0.90x = 6447 x + x - 0.10x + 0.90x + 0.27x = 6447 3.17x - 0.10x = 6447 3.07x = 6447 x = 6447 /3.07 x = \u20b92100 Thus Raman expenses will be \u20b9 2100 Vimal\u2019s expenses x - 0.10x = 2100 - 0.10 \u00d7 2100 = 2100 - 210 = \u20b91890 Arnan's expenses = 30% more than Vimal's exoenses = 1890 + 0.30 \u00d7 1890 = 1890 + 567 Thus Arnan's expenses are \u20b92457 Answer Arnan's expenses are \u20b92457 Let us check for correctness of answer by taking the sum of derived expenses \u20b92100 + \u20b91890 + \u20b92457 = \u20b96447 Means answer is correct.
