            "answer_text": "Logical thinking and modern knowledge will make you immediately realising that there is no need to interpret the Bible, it would be obvious to you that it is nothing but stories with absolutely no substance and definitely no place as a factual book in modern times. If the Bible was the true word of an almighty god that really loved and cared for humans, if the Bible was really needed to prevent humans from eternal torture in a hell, if the Bible was really so important for the well being of humans, don\u2019t you think an almighty god would not have made sure it is factual and to the point without the need to interpret it correctly? If you buy an appliance you expect the manual to be factual without riddles as to how to use the appliance, you don\u2019t expect to interpret what is written in there to be able to use the appliance, why would you expect an all important book like the Bible is made out to be to different? Why can\u2019t it simply be factual and to the point? Maybe it isn\u2019t because it is nothing but the imagination of a lot of sheepherders who had no idea of what makes the world go round? They decided what their god wanted and what not, therefor that god has so many human characteristics, is so envious and murderous. A god that smites people and animals left right and centre, ordered the killing of babies and innocent animals etc are really not any intelligent modern person\u2019s idea of goodness\u2026is it? ",

            "answer_text": "My take about this, we should not apply modern thinking to interpret the Bible. Why? Modern thinking may be influenced by human wisdom and modern ideologies, most often borne from personal beliefs and opinions, invented and promulgated by modern generation of people and youths. The Bible should be interpreted using God's never-changing principles. Modern or ancient, those principles never get old and they are always practical and effective, regardless of the time period involved. The principles of love, justice, mercy, etc\u2026never expire, and God's qualities and principles do not change. True, specific laws may change, but the principles behind each law will always stay. Therefore, to be able to interpret the Bible correctly, we should always consider God's qualities, thoughts, and feelings. ",
