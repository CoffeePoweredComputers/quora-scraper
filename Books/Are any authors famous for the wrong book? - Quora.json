            "answer_text": "This is a great question. Of all the books and authors I mention in this answer, I only feel passionately about the first one. The others are worthy of mention, however. J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings has been enjoyed by millions, in no small part thanks to Peter Jackson\u2019s excellent film adaptation of the work. His The Hobbit is also well known, again in no small part due to Jackson\u2019s (reasonable but sadly not exceptional, not that it is entirely his fault) film adaptation. As truly awesome and appealing as those books are, they are not Tolkien\u2019s best work, they are not the pinnacle of his high fantasy legendarium, and they are not why so many laypeople and scholars study his works to this day. No, that designation goes to The Silmarillion (and The Unfinished Tales, to some degree). While it is true that Tolkien\u2019s son, Christopher, played a big role in compiling and editing the mythopoeic tome, the original stories came from the father. Understandably, The Silmarillion lacks the mass appeal of The Lord of the Rings and cannot be appreciated by children like The Hobbit can, but it remains the greatest of Tolkien\u2019s works. Others will disagree but for me the Great American Novel is The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the only work of his most people know. Yet, in Fitzgerald\u2019s life the novel was met with considerable criticism and sold poorly. It was not until World War II, after Fitzgerald\u2019s death, that Gatsby became a household name. Perhaps Fitzgerald\u2019s most successful novel during his lifetime\u2014This Side of Paradise\u2014ought to be remembered; or maybe Tender Is The Night should be the one, as Fitzgerald himself considered it his best work. While I disagree with this, it is not entirely unreasonable. George Orwell is most famous for Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm\u2014both excellent books to be sure\u2014yet his essays are scarcely remembered. (Do essays count as books? Probably not, but I want to mention this one. I will avoid essays, poetry, etc. for now on.) Perhaps Politics and the English Language should be considered his magnum opus. It has the advantage of being much less interpretative than his books, which commentators sometime claim criticized socialism (rather than totalitarianism or Stalinism), an ideology Orwell supported. Charles Dickens\u2019 best remembered tales are Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, and A Christmas Carol, but they should probably be Great Expectations and A Tale or Two Cities\u2014especially A Tale of Two Cities. James Joyce is a polarizing figure. Most know of him and his Ulysses, which was voted the best novel of all time by the Modern Library[1] (Gatsby was second), but few have read his work and even fewer have enjoyed it. Ulysses is difficult to finish. The modernist tale represents an experiment of sorts, or at least the beginning of one. The end of that experiment is Joyce\u2019s impenetrable Finnegans Wake, perhaps his greatest work. John Steinbeck wrote many recognizable novels and novellas, but The Grapes of Wrath is certainly best remembered. While Of Mice and Men remains relatively well known, I consider it possibly the greatest of Steinbeck\u2019s works. Mark Twain is best known for either The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn or The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, I do not know which. Yet, his Gilded Age and Roughing It are also extraordinary. That Benjamin Franklin wrote an autobiography is well known, but few remember he wrote the famous Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack. Similarly, Thomas Jefferson penned The Declaration of Independence, yet nobody mentions his influential Notes on the State of Virginia. At least Madison is remembered for both the Constitution and the Federalist. Finally, there are several authors who wrote many good books, all of which are quite popular, any of which might be said to be underrepresented in sales or culture. Examples include Ernest Hemingway and his The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, The Old Man and the Sea, or even For Whom the Bell Tolls as well as Stephen King and his IT, The Shining, 11/22/63, Cujo, and more.

            "answer_text": "What a good question. I\u2019ll name a few: F.Scott Fitzgerald: He was already famous for his short stories and deservedly so, but he also got famous for This Side of Paradise, his first novel. Frankly, the book is a bore. His best book is The Beautiful and Damned, which came out in 1922, two years after This Side of Paradise. He published The Great Gatsby 3 years later in 1925, and most high school students now read the book. However, Tender Is The Night is a far better book. It came out in 1934, and shows us a mature Fitzgerald who would have written incredible novels if he only had lived (and dried out from his alcoholism). I love his stories, but his novels often are too derivative of his own experience. It works well in The Beautiful and Damned, but I was far less impressed with The Great Gatsby. Both novels have a Zelda like character in the female protagonist or antagonist\u2014however, the reader may look at it, but Gloria in Damned is almost tragic, while Daisy in Gatsby is the crush that one realizes is a waste of energy. I always felt This Side of Paradise and The Great Gatsby got too much attention, while a lot of people find Tender Is The Night to be a difficult read. Many don\u2019t even know of The Beautiful and Damned. F.Scott Fitzgerald was the rare writer who enjoyed fame in his time, but I wish he would get the credit he deserves for those two novels which I will defend as his best books.Toni Morrison: Beloved is a good book, but I think Sula is a better novel, along with The Bluest Eye. Toni Morrison was already famous when Beloved came out, and it is another book often assigned to high school students. I wouldn\u2019t assign The Bluest Eye to younger students and I might put \u201ctrigger warning\u201d for anyone who isn\u2019t familiar with the material. I think Sula is an incredible novel, but people generally don\u2019t mention it as they note Beloved more frequently. The Bluest Eye is a shattering book, and not for the faint of heart, but it is excellent.Ted Hughes: I am a big Ted Hughes fan. He enjoyed success with his first book of poetry, The Hawk and the Rain. I am the rare American fan who decided to get all his poetry books, which was not easy as I had to order them from Britain, with many out of print. He was known here in the States for the children\u2019s tale, The Iron Man, and for his failed marriage to Sylvia Plath. All I could find were collections of his poems, Crow (another famous book of his poems) and some of his translations like Tales From Ovid. Then Birthday Letters came out, his book of poetry about his marriage to Plath. Hughes knew he was dying, so he decided to publish this collection. It was the rare poetry book that made the best sellers list. However, it is not his best work, plus I felt like I was reading it for juicy details about Sylvia Plath instead of appreciating his poetic gift. I hate that book. In Britain, he is well known as a great poet and writer, as he edited anthologies of Emily Dickenson\u2019s poetry along with works of Shakespeare, wrote plays, children\u2019s stories as well as poetry. He is a prolific writer, so it is hard to choose, but my favorite books are Lupercal, Wodwo and Crow, with Lupercal as my favorite. He was fortunate to have a career, plus he was rightfully named as Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, but I wish he were more known in this country for his earliest poetry and his writings on poetry.",

            "answer_text": "Anthony Burgess is famous for A Clockwork Orange, mainly because it became a Stanley Kubrick film, and was visually shocking. I prefer his books Earthly Powers and The End of the World News, which are clever, satirical and entertaining. Dr Seuss is famous for The Cat in the Hat, and that is good for learning to read. Dr Seuss\u2019s Sleep Book, however, is far superior as a piece of writing. It is so hypnotic that it makes me drowsy just reading it to a child. The rhythm and cadences of the writing, the exotic vocabulary, the sheer silliness - marvellous. Douglas Adams is famous for The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and it is an excellent trilogy of five indeed. However, I think that Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency is his real masterpiece. The more I read it the more amazing I find it to be. It may seem simple, but do not be deceived. This is one of the cleverest works of literature ever created. It just hasn\u2019t been recognised fully yet. Kurt Vonnegut is famous for Slaughterhouse Five, and so he should be because it is an excellent book, although the subject matter is distressing in the extreme. Vonnegut has a light touch, and manages to write about his own horrific experiences in a fictionalised and even humorous way. Cat\u2019s Cradle was written at the time of the Cuban missile crisis, and I find it an even greater masterpiece, since it manages to portray the almost casual carelessness of the decisions which profoundly effect human lives on this fragile planet. Philip K. Dick is famous for Do Androids Dream of Elecric Sheep, which was made into the film Blade Runner. He is also famous for The Man in the High Tower, which has been made into a series by Amazon video. My favourite book of his is Valis, which is a strange tale of a man who seems to be on the verge of understanding something really important about the universe, and who is actually the author himself. In it he refers to himself as Horselover Fat (which is because the name \u201cPhilip\u201d means \u201clover of horse\u201d in Greek, and \u201cdicke\u201d means \u201cthick\u201d, hence \u201cfat\u201d in German). There is something so intimate about this story that I feel a deep affection for this sweet, vulnerable man every time I read it. Now that is clever. ",

            "answer_text": "James Dashner His most famous work is The Maze Trial trilogy: What more can be said about this great series, more than what a terrible movie adaptation has already shown, Am I right? Seriously though the BOOK series is great, and I highly recommend it, even if it does have some scrappy subplot romance triangle (which, if I\u2019m being honest did take a turn for the better after the second book). The newer and slightly less famous (but growing in popularity books) The Mortality Doctrine Series: Or as I like to call it the Eye of Minds Trilogy. (I\u2019m judging it\u2019s popularity based on how quickly it came into my school\u2019s library, which was about a year and a half after the first book\u2019s release). This series is awesome! I love the characters, I love the premise, I love the twists and turns, and I love all the mind-blowing it does! (Although it could have used a bit more) If you don\u2019t already know, The story focuses on a boy named Micheal who is a gamer in the world wide network known as the VirtNet. I\u2026. hmm\u2026. I can\u2019t really explain much else, as that would ruin many of the plot points, twists and turns, and a MAJOR mental melt in\u2026 the story\u2026 telling you even this is a bit spoiler-y. I\u2019ll move on now, sorry Now unto the lesser known of the three series I\u2019ve read of Dashner: The 13th Reality Series: (I say least well known because even though this is the oldest of the other series, it has an incomplete and out-of-order set at my library (books 1 and 4)). This Series is absolutely phenomenal! Now, I haven\u2019t quite read the series in a while (about 4\u20135 years) but the connections I felt to the characters, settings, main threats, side stories, and overall theme of it all has stuck with me immensely. The story revolves around a young boy, nicknamed Tick, who learns of the vastness of the 13 realities, and how important he is to it. I can\u2019t say much, as I am too prideful to go see the wiki, but there are some trippy details, explanations, settings, and characters all of which intertwine with the adventure of Tick. The main antagonist is the primary focus, with \u201cminor\u201d distractions trying to pull Tick away from what he has to do. These minor distractions of course spanning through dimensions, the books, and even once being the focus of almost the entirety of one of the books. Tick accidently does a thing that leads him to discover of the existence of other realities-> a small group of good interdemensional folk better inform him and are surprised by how he is important-> Tick joins their mission-> Looooots of interdemensional junk to go through to do what he needs to do-> eventually gets to where he has to go-> does the thing he needs to do Please bare with me, I know I am only giving the absolutely bare-boned skeletal abridged version of the Story, but I do so, only because I can\u2019t bring myself to ruin great details for you to discover yourself. Please, do yourself a favor and read this epic series! TL;DRJames Dashner made and is mostly known for: The Maze Runner Series, relatively new, made lots of bucks, has a movie. Pretty Darned Good. 7.8/10 James Dashner later made and is maybe also known for: The Mortality Doctrine Series, much newer, subjectively better, less popular, but Great. 8.2/10 James Dashner\u2019s lesser known series: The 13th Reality series, oldest of the three mentioned, Phenomenal, you should read it, and deserves more recognition, 8.9/10 sources: pics of google, My own experience reading all three of these book series, 10 1/2 books in total. Thanks for reading if you did. ",

            "answer_text": "Man! Some really great answers on here so far. I\u2019ll add my two cents just because I love literature: Gustave Flaubert - everyone\u2019s heard of Madame Bovary, but Salammbo is an astonishingly good, severely underrated and well-researched piece of historical fiction\u2026 and a nice little love story, to boot. It deserved much better treatment than Hollywood gave it. Kurt Vonnegut - I\u2019ve read every word he\u2019s put into print and while Slaughterhouse 5 and Breakfast of Champions are better recognized, I\u2019ve always thought Bluebeard and Sirens of Titan were his most heart-felt and meaningful books, respectively, while Player Piano was probably his best-written work and just a little bit terrifying as a cautionary tale that deserves mention alongside Bradbury\u2019s Fahrenheit 451 and Huxley\u2019s Brave New World. Gene Wolfe - my favorite American writer after Twain, Hemingway, Vonnegut and Alice Walker. Hardcore fantasy and SF fans know very well his Long Sun, Short Sun and Torturer series, which are all excellent, cover to cover (to cover to cover to cover, etc.). But he is an absolute magician, artist and puzzle master in Peace and The Fifth Head of Cerberus. I\u2019ll throw in The Devil In A Forest as well, because it\u2019s also deserving of better recognition, but maybe not quite on par with the aforementioned. Mark Helprin - best known for Winter\u2019s Tale, his Memoir From Ant-Proof Case is just a fantastic and deliriously fun read. I have no idea why he\u2019s not better known among modern American writers. Aldous Huxley - forget about Brave New World (just for a minute). Point Counterpoint is a brilliantly crafted, novel-length analogy and possibly the ideal example of Impressionist writing and modern British literature in general. This book should be required reading for every Fine Arts major, especially musicians. Sinclair Lewis - it\u2019s hard to say any Nobel Prize winner\u2019s works are under-appreciated\u2026 But here I go anyway. Lewis gained fame for Babbitt and Elmer Gantry, but Arrowsmith is a more touching and enduring story than either of those books. A must-read for every medical school student. Here\u2019s a bonus \u2014 just a really good book by a not very well known author: Minotaur by Benjamin Tammuz. Check it out if you can find it! READ. MORE. BOOKS! ",

            "answer_text": "Margaret Atwood. If you\u2019ve paid attention to what\u2019s been happening over the past year, you\u2019ve probably heard of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.  But my favorite book of hers (and one of the greatest books ever written) is Cat\u2019s Eye.  Compared to the success of Margaret Atwood\u2019s more popular novel, this one falls unbearably short. Cat\u2019s Eye is about an elderly woman named Elaine Ridley who is famous for her controversial paintings as she prepares for a show of her work looks back on her childhood memories. Elaine is haunted by the memories of Cordelia, her biggest frenemy (best friend/bully) from her school days. That complicated relationship affects how Elaine handles a lot of situations later in life. I definitely think that schools should be reading this one over The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Don\u2019t twist my words, Handmaid\u2019s Tale is a beautiful, amazing book. But I think that Cat\u2019s Eye has a lot more intricacy and depth hidden below its surface. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been waiting for this question my entire time on Quora. Alright folks, remember this franchise that turned into a movie beginning the fateful year of 2012? The ones everyone scoffed at yet ended up watching one way or another?  Stephanie Meyer was somewhat ridiculed the following years, and many failed to recognize her as a writer. However, she shaped up her writing skills and produced this 809-page mass of literature unprecedented to my expectations. Her new novel had such spectacular world-building. A chapter in and you felt completely engrossed, the protagonist being a stranger to humans. To her luck, she has one inside her head. What follows are questions about the value of a human life, and (of course) a love story. Many a person has stopped me right here, but I, for one, think love stories are extremely underrated. I appreciate a good one, but rarely find a captivating novel with one in it. If it doesn't seem like much, I can summarize it: it has concepts you think about months after you finished it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Stella Gibbons - most famous for Cold Comfort Farm, but many of her other books are better. I\u2019m inclined to think that Ursula Le Guin is famous for the whole wrong genre. Yes, some of her books are very good, but as a writer of novels and short stories she\u2019s very uneven, because she often lets her political message get in the way of the story to the point that it reads like an election pamphlet. But her poetry, which is barely known, is stunningly good. And - this one is very much a matter of personal taste, but brilliant though nearly all of Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld books are, I still love best one of his two early forays into pure SF, called The Dark Side of the Sun. Then there\u2019s Heinlein. He\u2019s famous for his gung-ho space opera SF, but he\u2019s also responsible for the theological fantasy-thriller The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag, which has to be one of the creepiest stories ever written. There are also Asimov\u2019s short stories Unto the Fourth Generation and The Ugly Little Boy, which are very different from - and far more subtle than - his usual stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, wow, great question, thanks for asking! I must answer because I am extremely passionate about a little known book written by a very famous author. It's called Joan of Arc and it's by Mark Twain. The books he is most famous for are awesome, profound and really worth reading at least twice but Joan of Arc is his masterpiece! He considered it his greatest work and it took at least 14 years to complete. He learned French just so he could go to France and research from original sources. Joan of Arc is one of the most illustrious, interesting, powerful and enlightened people in all of human history. Without her France would not exist! It\u2019s one of the most interesting stories ever and it\u2019s all true! Twain gives her the respect she deserves and because of this critics largely didn\u2019t like it. I think they were used to him being funny and of course he was a well-known critic of religion and especially the catholic church. This book was a labor of love for him and I didn\u2019t fit into what the world had come to expect of him. Also, Joan of Arc herself doesn\u2019t fit neatly into an atheistic \u201clogical\u201d view of the world and so some people think it\u2019s just best that we let her be. Sometimes scholars will argue that she was schizophrenic because you see, she heard voices. Turns out these voices told her what to do in order to finally end England\u2019s 100 year seige on France and she did it! A little illiterate peasant girl who didn\u2019t even know how to ride a horse. Wanna know how? Read the book! ",

            "answer_text": "My favourite writer, Sophie Kinsella, is famous for Confessions of a Shopaholic. Let me be honest, any other book she's written (under that name) is better than the shopaholic series. I love Can You Keep a Secret, Twenties Girl, I've Got Your Number\u2026 all of them. But I think the Shopaholic series is boring. It's gotten better over time, and I see how it's the one that became a series, because the story works as such, but I would rather read a Can You Keep a Secret series. I've read that book about ten times. On a side note, John Green is known for The Fault in our Stars, which was an absolutely terrible book. Looking for Alaska was better, though I still don't like him as a writer. Do you think any authors are famous for the wrong book? ",

            "answer_text": " Many years ago, I was driving to work in St. Louis when I heard a commercial on KMOX for a new book about a young attorney who found out about an ugly secret for the firm he worked for. If you guessed John Grisham\u2019s The Firm, you guessed correctly. A few days later, I devoured the book over a couple evenings while working on a bank audit in Cape Girardeau. Within a couple weeks, I was browsing my local Waldenbooks (remember them?) and found a stack of paperbacks for sale that had just arrived. His first book, A Time to Kill, had only sold a few thousand copies on its first printing (and probably only one). Thanks to his best selling The Firm, A Time to Kill was selling like hotcakes. When I finished A Time to Kill, I thought it was clearly the better book. Yes, The Firm was entertaining, but his first book seemed so real, maybe too real. ",

Michael Ende is famous, so far as he's famous at all, for The Neverending Story, because a successful film was based on it, but his Momo is one of the great masterpieces of children's books, of the kind that you need not be a child to appreciate. On a similar note, Astrid Lindgren is famous worldwide for the Pippi L\u00e5ngstrump (\u2018Longstocking'), but should be still more famous for the likes of Ronja R\u00f6vardotter; Br\u00f6derna Lejonhj\u00e4rta; and Mio, min Mio. Stephen R. Donaldson is best known for the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, but the Gap series is better, though even more brutal to read, which is very. The polemic nature of Richard Dawkins's The God Delusion may dissuade some readers from picking up excellent books like The Selfish Gene, The Extended Phenotype, and The Ancestor's Tale. The Word and the Void is better than Terry Brooks's better-known Shannara series. Maybe I'll come back and add to this later. ",

In my personal opinion the Lord Darcy books were mediocre and you could tell that he was just trying to create something that people would buy without putting too much thought into the work that he was creating.  The last series that he created before he passed was a series called the Gandalara Cycle. This series was unbelievably underrated for what it was. Garrett collaborated with his then wife Vicki Heydron to create this masterpiece of a world. They created an alternate future Earth that in most aspects could be possible. This concept is something that takes an alright science fiction novel to an amazing science fiction novel. The possibility that this may happen to us is what amazes me about this series. All of this started with a meteor striking a cruise ship in the modern times and then Ricardo found himself in an unknown world (Gandalara). The detail that goes into this series is amazing. This is one of those book series that I read every year because they just keep getting better every time that I read through the adventures of Ricardon.  ",

My favorite one is A Tale Of Two Cities, but he is famous for his book Great Expectations. That book is well-written as well, but is my least favorite in Dickens\u2019 Classics. Great Expectations has good expression, but the story is not as appealing as others. As a child, I thought that something was seriously off about the book and there were some loopholes in the plot, but I was soon assured that the plot had no problem; the story was not as good as others. I have my favorite characters in all of the Dickens\u2019 classics I\u2019ve read, but there is not a single character in Great Expectations whom I find slightly likable. I feel like A Tale Of Two Cities is the best classic I\u2019ve ever laid my eyes upon. Anyway, that\u2019s my opinion. No offence to Mr Dickens. ",

But CS Lewis also wrote something that will amaze and astound modern readers in a slim volume called The Abolition of Man. The Abolition of Man is nonfiction. It's essentially an extended argument against unchecked relativism and in favor of maintaining some sense of absolute truth. What astounded me when I read it was the prophetic nature of Lewis\u2019 writing. He wrote the book over seventy years ago, and he could see where Western Civilization was headed. In the year 2017, we have fulfilled his vision and more. What Lewis wrote as a warning, we can now read as an account of how we got to our current condition. ",

            "answer_text": "Colleen McCullough is best known for The Thorn Birds, but her best book is First Man in Rome and the Masters of Rome series that followed. It is a key compilation of research that puts her in dialogue with many historians of the Roman Republic and explains several theses very well in fictionalized history format. I just wish that all time periods could be covered with such fine detail given to both the political and figures of the time, and could be so magnificently written. CS Lewis is best known for the Narnia series, far from his best series. That award would have to go to his Space Trilogy, the first book of which is Out of the Silent Planet, and is much better written and involves much better worldbuilding than Narnia. Victor Hugo is best known for Les Miserables. However Quatrevingt-Treize (93) is much better written, even by contemporaries\u2019 admission. Anne McCaffery wrote Dragonriders of Pern (the book and the series). But the Acorna series is utterly magnificent. Jean Paul Marat is most known for his journalistic works around the French Revolution. However, he also wrote The Chains of Slavery in 1776, which earned him Benjamin Franklin\u2019s attention and compliments. He also wrote some amazing treatises on light and optical lens, and may have predicted lasers. Neal Stephenson is best known for SnowCrash, but his best books would have to be his later works. ",

But Earthly Powers, published in 1980, is Burgess\u2019 masterpiece. A doorstopper of a novel involving a gay octogenarian author who is related to the Pope by marriage. It is outrageously funny, incident filled, unreliably narrated, and awesomely entertaining. It also has one of the best gay narrators in all of fiction, written with sensitivity and insight by a heterosexual author. I've heard it used as a positive example of cultural appropriation. If you love reading, pick this one up. It's your reward. ",

            "answer_text": "Nassim Taleb, who wrote a book called The Black Swan, whose thesis is that life is full of unpredictable and extreme events that people unsuccessfully try to explain in retrospect. The book made his reputation and, because he was an options trader, catapulted him on business and public commentary shows all over the world and even earned him the sobriquet \u201cThe Black Swan.\u201d However, in my opinion this is his weakest book. His first book I read was Fooled by Randomness, about the illusion of causality that comes from survivorship bias and other sources(i.e. there are a lot of hedge fund billionaires we know of, but there are lot more people who founded hedge funds that went under, who we don\u2019t hear about), was much clearer and more entertaining. Compared to it, The Black Swan struck me as kind of wooden and repetitive. ",

            "answer_text": "This is quite an interesting question to come across, and I for one am surely not well read enough to have too much of an in-depth knowledge about this topic. Still, one name struck me in the head as soon as I read this question. Chetan Bhagat. And sadly it's not one wrong book he's known for, in my opinion, it's all of them!  From beautifying, glamorousing and fictionalizing student life to the plagarism of other people's experiences, this man has gone on from writing books about an encounter with god to the love lives of engineering students. One may call it trying to connect with the masses, or in my opinion, stereotyping your audiences. Almost all his writings resemble a bollywood flick, which is probably why his books are so readily transcribed as one. This might just be an individual perspective, but names like Five Point Someone, Half Girlfriend, The 3 Mistakes of My Life, etc. sound more like clickbait invites tempting you to look further just so that you get know what mistakes Mr. Bhagat made. Fortunately/Unfortunately the book isn't about that. I may have been a bit too critical about him, but from what I decipher, this man seems to have a narcissistic plight to gain maximum possible fame rather than an intent to spread knowledge and information. Why else would a writer enter the entertainment industry. It all seems too staged and scripted. Probably not the first to do so though. ",

I think \u2018The Inheritors\u2019 (about Neanderthal man) is even better. \u2018The Spire\u2019 (about the building of a medieval cathedral) is also excellent, and \u2018The Pyramid\u2019 (the closest he came to writing a \u2018conventional\u2019 novel, and which shows a perhaps unexpected sense of comedy) is much underrated. Come to think of it, the sea trilogy \u2018To the Ends of the Earth\u2019 (about a voyage from England to Australia in the early 19th century) is pretty damn good too. So he wasn\u2019t a one-trick pony (I must look up the origin of that phrase). ",

I thought \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d was good, but wondered why his new success hadn\u2019t gotten more attention drawn to \u201cTuf Voyaging\u201d, which was amazing. It starts with a strike team breaking into a spaceship known as \u201cthe plague star\u201d (actually, it\u2019s more horrifying than that), and it gets more interesting from there. It\u2019s about creative problem solving, the benefits of cats in star travel, and how myths get created and repeated. It\u2019s the book that cements a man best known for epic fantasy as the kind of sci fi writer that comes along a few times in a generation. If you like his writing, or don\u2019t and want to give him another chance, go read it. ",

Her well tuned sense of irony is allowed full rein in this book, her heroine is rather foolish, and the more you know about the gothic novels she\u2019 refers to, the funnier the book becomes. ",

Nowhere else does the work say anything other than this is the work of Louis de Conte, and that is to be trusted as accurate, and that it is freely redistributable (as translated into English out of the ancient French) out of the National Archives of France. UPDATE: I contacted (by email) the Director of Medieval Studies, at a leading University in the U.S., and she wrote me back saying that the work is Mark Twain\u2019s. Why Twain would have tried so hard to make his work appear to be the original work (memoirs) of an apostle of Joan of Arc, I can\u2019t fathom? Fooled me big time! I have quoted this work all over the internet as if it were legit. Perhaps this work of Twain\u2019s is where we get the adage, \u201cYou can\u2019t believe everything your read\u201d.  ",

That being said, I wouldn\u2019t say his most popular books are bad; Boxers/Saints is a really good duology, I just like his other books as well. Garth Nix also wrote the underrated Keys to the Kingdom series that was way more interesting than Sabriel, not to mention more interesting than his boring, over-hyped Newt\u2019s Emerald. Holly Black\u2019s Curse Worker books are also better than her Modern Faerie Tales and Spiderwick Chronicles, although The Coldest Girl in Coldtown is popular for a reason.  ",

Willa Cather's reputation seems to rest on that and My Antonia, but I honestly think her other novels from 1915\u20131935 are generally superior. Death Comes For the Archbishop, Shadows on the Rock, and The Professor\u2019s House all have interesting takes on North American, not just \u201cAmerican\u201d, history. Cather\u2019s psychological portraits can be gripping and realistic. Song of the Lark and Lucy Gayheart are both interesting meditations on creative women from small-town USA, a subject Cather knew something about. I hope to re-read and fill in any novels of hers that I haven\u2019t read in the next year or two. ",

The crowning Bran Mak Morn story, \u201cThe Worms of the Earth\u201d, is probably my single favourite Howard story.Howard also has some very good horror stories featuring the Cthulhu Mythos, such as \u201cThe Black Stone\u201d.",

The two topping my list are The Masque of the Red Death, or the Tell Tale Heart, which I feel truly bring out Poe's brilliance in macabre narratives. Then, there's also his novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym Oscar Wilde is best known for The Picture of Dorian Gray, a book I absolutely love. I, however, think his long poem The Ballard of Reading Gaol, tops Dorian Gray. ",

He is most (perhaps entirely) famous for Three Men in a Boat, but his second story of the same three men, this time on a cycling tour of Germany and Austro-Hungary, is just as funny and yet far more thought-provoking. In Three Men on the Bummel, published in 1899, he includes some general observations about German culture and society that are recognisable to this day. At the end, he remarks that the Germans are a good and noble people who will do very well as long as they have a good leader. What would happen should they get a bad one, he doesn\u2019t like to think. 40 years later, he was proved right. ",

His most well known book is Illuminatus (co-written with Robert Shea) and it is a tremendous psychedelic shaggy dog story, but I think his later work is better, particularly Cosmic Trigger 1, Quantum Psychology and especially Prometheus Rising. Wilson isnt as well known as the other authors mentioned here, but most of his books are being reprinted with new intros and commentaries. They are becoming familiar to a new generation despite him being dead over 10 years now. ",
