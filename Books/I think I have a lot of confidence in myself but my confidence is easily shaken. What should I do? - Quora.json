            "answer_text": "Ask yourself - what exactly makes you confident? Is it your appearance? Your mental abilities? Any special skill set? Or just your outgoing overall personality to strike up the attention of an audience? Then focus on why you are confident about what is making you feel confident. Because truly, the first \u2018rule\u2019 in being or feeling confident is having the ability to not being easily shaken, or stirred or fried by anyone's opinion of who you are and what they think about who you should be. Develop a sense and habit of wearing people loosely by realizing that everyone has an insecurity, almost everyone has a bad habit they wish they could rid themselves of, and everyone on this planet has at least one problem they don't have a solution to. We all need each other, and it will be worth it if you reminded yourself everyday, that we are all imperfect - and we all seeking to be better versions of who we are everyday by learning from our individual experiences. So my humble opinion? Love you. Accept you with all your imperfections, big and small, and always, always walk with your head upright. Look people in the eye and be determined about what you feel inside. Focus on you. Confidence is ignited by the flame of your drive to be happy. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A - I think I have a lot of confidence in myself but my confidence is easily shaken. What should I do? 1.\tKnow yourself. 2.\tDo what is best for your soul. 3.\tLeave the rest up to God. These rules are profoundly simple, yet more difficult than you can ever imagine. Many never come to fully understand even the first one. And try though you must, how do you do what is best for your soul, if you do not know yourself in the first place? Finally, leaving the rest up to God? To place yourself in God\u2019s Hand and accept His will over your own will? It would be easier to move a mountain for some people. And while these three rules are a process, they are also a simultaneous endeavor. It is not a matter of waiting to finish one to start the next. They are accomplished by hard work at all three at once and together, working in harmony. For more, read my book, Evidence of Falsehood: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M3MMP66 ",
