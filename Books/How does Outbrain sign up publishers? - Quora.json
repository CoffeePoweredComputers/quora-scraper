            "answer_text": "The old-fashioned way: they cleverly sell their services to the publisher.  Outbrain is one of several companies that offer pay-per-click services (ppc) to publishers. Every time a reader on a page clicks on an Outbrain link, the publisher gets a small fee.  Publishers love services such as Outbrain, as it's a simple and cost-effective way of filling up space on a page that would otherwise be wasted. Perhaps some page-design 101 is in order\u2026 Study after study has shown that a vast majority of Internet readers scan only the \"top\" of any given page, even if they have intentionally clicked on the link to the story. Ergo, real estate \"above the fold\", that is, the area that appears by default in your browser without you scrolling down, is very valuable.  Anything further down the page becomes less valuable, especially as advertising space. When we were redesigning our sites, we often referred to this area as \"Siberia\", and our metrics backed us up. In comes Outbrain (or in our case, IndustryBrains, a B2B ppc service). All the publisher has to do is plop in a simple java script (or j-query, depending on the platform), and Outbrain does the rest. Outbrain sells itself to publishers in two ways. In the first method, they emphasize the rise in inbound traffic from an Outbrain link. There are any number of click-bait farms that depend on Outbrain for their traffic. It helps when the headlines are written in a very \"click-baity\" style.  Outbrain also sells publishers on the idea that the vast areas of \"Siberia\" on any give page will be filled with revenue-generating content. It may be very small revenue in the particulars, but it can add up in the aggregate.  I personally both loathe Outbrain and admire it at the same time. I especially loathe the level to which the service will stoop to gather clicks. I however, admire their business model. ",
