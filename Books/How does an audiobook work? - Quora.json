            "answer_text": "The answer to all your questions is \u201cYes.\u201d There are abridged audiobooks and unabridged audiobooks. Some are acted out; some are read in an uninflected tone. Some have one narrator; others have several. You can tell who is speaking the same way you do when you read. The prose almost always tells you: John looked at Marsha. After a moment, she said \u201cwhat?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d He paused. Then he said, \u201cYou have a red mark on your nose.\u201d The first sentence tells us the names of the characters. You know Marsha is the first speaker, because the text says \u201cshe said.\u201d You know John is the second speaker, because the text says \u201che said.\u201d Even though there following line of dialogue has no attribution, you know the speaker must be Marsha, because the previous speaker was John. Many audiobook sites, such as audible.com, allow you to listen to a sample before purchase. So you can get a sense of how an individual book is narrated. ",

            "answer_text": "On the abridged issue, it depends on the audiobook. Some are abridged so that they fit within a couple of hours, some aren\u2019t and might run several hours. In every audiobook I\u2019ve heard, whether fiction or non fiction, the narrator isn\u2019t just reading like you would instructions on assembling a bookcase but engages in some vocal acting - inflections and pacing and timing of the voice to create a picture. It\u2019s generally not difficult to tell who is speaking, the same way it\u2019s not difficult to tell when reading a book; sometimes the narrator will use a slightly different voice from one character to another to differentiate.
