            "answer_text": "Can bookshelf speakers be mounted on a wall? Yes Will they sound good when mounted on a wall? Probably not. From my experience, when bookshelf speakers are mounted on the wall, there is vibration between the speaker and the wall and this distorts sound. I found the distortion unpleasant. With bookshelf speakers that aren\u2019t more than 5 kilos, you could consider mounting them on Acoustic isolation wall mounts but I haven\u2019t really tried it out. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Usually they will work fine that way, but having a flat surface directly behind them is going to boost some of the bass frequencies. For most listeners this would probably be okay. Critical listening requires more critical placement, but I haven\u2019t run into many critical listeners in the general public in these days of ear buds. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, some are even prepared for that, but most do not like to be too close to the wall. Now, what you want to look for are the ones without any ports on the back, since they need to \u201cbreathe\u201d. They will not sound right, when too close to a wall. ",
