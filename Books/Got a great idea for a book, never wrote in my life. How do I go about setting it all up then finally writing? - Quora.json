            "answer_text": "Do you mean you\u2019ve never written ANYTHING? Or just not a book? Because that makes a difference. Still, here is what I would suggest: Pick your beginning. Pick your ending. Now, what other ideas do you have within the main one? Organize them in a way that makes sense. I always take a school notebook and a pen/pencil, and I outline like I would a paper. To get from point A to point Z, what specific things need to happen? (see the numbered questions below that help you figure this out). For me, writing is very much like a roadtrip - I have \u2018destinations\u2019 that I know I need to get to to make the story move, but HOW I get there can be somewhat fluid. That\u2019s why having the outline is helpful, because you then have a map of what points you need to hit, with some wiggle room. This is how I navigate writing a story. Have a start point. Have an end point. Have definite points that must be reached inbetween. Also: are you starting from a character idea, or a world idea? In other words, what inspired you first? A character? Or a problem? Here are a few things that can help you structure your story: Who is your character?What is their greatest strength and greatest weakness? Now, what is the flipside? (how can their weakness sometimes help, and how can their strength sometimes inhibit?)What is the overarching problem? The MAIN problem?How does it affect your character?Why must THEY solve it? Or don\u2019t they? (Maybe the story is about them just surviving the problem that others solve.)What does your character WANT? Personally?What is the obstacle to it?How do they achieve it? Do they achieve it?What do they lose/suffer/sacrifice in the process?How is the overarching problem solved?What gets in the way and makes solving it risky, hard, or both?What is lost/sacrificed in the process of solving the main problem?Figure those things out, and you have an outline for a story. Also, find someone to talk to. My mom is my best mentor, advisor, girl friend, critic, and best friend. She is my \u2018rubber duck\u2019. If I\u2019m stuck, I call her up or video call and talk myself blue in the face, with her listening and asking questions that, as the author, I HAVE TO ANSWER. It\u2019s a huge help when I am out of ideas or have written myself into a corner. When it comes to writing itself, that is harder. People have many opinions on that. What books do you like the most? What is the style, or flavor, of that writing? Some people are very to the point, and others love to fill the pages with descriptions, or with rich language. When it comes to describing something: do it for context. Is it so we know how the character is feeling? Like, for example, you write about someone stepping outside onto their deck with a hot cup of coffee, and you fill half a page describing the morning light, the mist sparkling, the dew like diamonds, the scenery, the flowers, the buzzing bees\u2026 this could show the character\u2019s current mindset AND help the reader picture the environment in which they live and what the character likes (based on what they notice around them). Describing the character and what they wear and how they look? Don\u2019t do it every single time, but here and there it\u2019s okay, because it gives all those visual cues that we notice in real life, and it tells us something of the person. The person has green eyes? I notice eyes. Tell me! The person has naturally chubby cheeks that gives them a \u2018baby face\u2019? That\u2019s going to play into how other characters respond to them! The person is really tall or really short? That changes how they interact with their environment and the pros and cons/challenges they face. They love to read dark stories, stay up too late, watch risque shows, but also like to wear cute clothes and roses are their favorite? You\u2019ve got some complexity there that will explain misunderstandings later on with other people who assume one thing based on their appearance only to find out they\u2019re wrong. As for dialogue, mix it up with action - not like an action movie, but with nonverbal physical cues. People talk with their eyes, their expressions, their hand movements, their posture, the tilt or lift of their chin, the tone of their voice, the way they are smiling. They are doing things while they talk. They are moving. Almost-but-not-quite-lastly, read the book out loud as if you are recording for Audiobooks. I kid you not, this will help you more than anything. You\u2019ll hear the tone of it. You\u2019ll hear if the dialogue sounds like actual talking. You\u2019ll catch when something is just beautifully worded, or if it is all wrong and that sentence needs to be adjusted. Lastly-for-sure, have fun and love your story. If you don\u2019t enjoy it, then why are you writing it? There will be frustrating times, of course, and times you get so mad you\u2019re ready to delete it all and show that blasted story what for! HAH! But don\u2019t. Please. Write what you love. I LOVE my stories, because I write stories I want to read and can\u2019t find anywhere else. You can\u2019t go wrong with that. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cGot a great idea for a book, never wrote in my life. How do I go about setting it all up then finally writing?\u201d The great thing about writing is that you can start any time in your life. It\u2019s pretty much the same whenever you do it. There are two broadly different ways to start. One requires a bit of \u201csetting it up\u201d, the other doesn\u2019t. Both have this in common: first find something with which you are comfortable writing. It could be a pen and paper, it could be a pencil and an exercise book, it could be a desktop PC and a printer, it could be a pad\u2026 All it requires is that you don\u2019t have to sit there and think about the technicalities. You can just write. There is some evidence that writing in longhand helps many mental capacities: Three Ways That Handwriting With A Pen Positively Affects Your Brain Personally, I find a pen helps, but with writing, it\u2019s a case of \u201cif it doesn\u2019t suit you\u2014it doesn\u2019t\u201d. Try something else. Method 1 PLANNINGThis may be what you\u2019re thinking of as \u201csetting it all up\u201d. Many writers like to plan before they write. They write a short synopsis of their book, or a chapter by chapter outline. You can write on index cards and spread them on the floor to see everything at a glance. From this method, one tends to get a lot of notes and plans, and then perhaps you can start expanding the plan \u2014 find one area in the synopsis that you\u2019re sure you can expand, and work on that. Repeat until you have a book. It doesn\u2019t matter, actually, if it\u2019s for fiction or non fiction. (You didn\u2019t say.) It\u2019s a kind of fractal approach to a book \u2014 write a 100 word paragraph of the contents/story of your book. Write a 3 page synopsis. Expand to a chapter by chapter synopsis (maybe 100 word for each). Then begin where you like. Some like Chapter 1; some like whichever bit most grabs them at the moment. Two good books for strict planning are Jack Bickham\u2019s Scene and Structure, in Elements of Fiction Writing; and John Braine\u2019s Writing A Novel (oldie but goodie \u2014 beware, novels are now a lot longer than his 60,000 word limit. Try 80 to 100,000.) Elements of Fiction Writing The Braine is now retitled \u201cHow to Write A Novel\u201d, but is still the 1974 original: Written by John Braine, 1974 Edition, (Re-issue) Publisher: Methuen Publishing Ltd [Paperback]: Amazon.co.uk: John Braine: 8601417130476: Books Conflict, peril, resolution. They describe how this is what happens at the micro-level, so the reader is always wondering \u201cwhat next\u201d, and wanting to save \u201cX\u201d from peril. It actually works reasonably well for academic writing\u2014if you have the possible advantage of making your work a more pleasurable read, then why not? Methiod 2 INTUITIONYou\u2019ll find the word \u201cpantser\u201d used to describe this. Though frankly it makes me cringe. People who use it mean \u201cwriting by the seat of the pants\u201d. That isn\u2019t actually how I\u2019d describe it. (And you\u2019ll find your own way to describe how you work.) I prefer to think of it as finding the end of a piece of string. Intuition takes place at that point where, as you say, you have a great idea for a book. You look at the idea. Perhaps you only look at parts of it, to see what they will imply, all taken together. And then something in it really appeals to you \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the beginning, maybe it\u2019s a scene later on. It could be an idea of how two people look as they talk to each other. It could be a first line. It could be a splendid piece of action. That is the end of the piece of string. You tease it out of the ball of string by writing it down. What you write, you find, implies other things; you continue to write. You may get sudden bright ideas that change the whole emphasis, if it\u2019s a novel: you thought it was about X, but you\u2019re more interested in Y or Z. At this stage, you can afford to follow all those side routes. You never know where you\u2019ll find your bright ideas \u2014 but if you just sit down and write, with the story in mind, ideas will start coming out of the woodwork. The method of intuition sounds very woffly, but I promise you it isn\u2019t. You\u2019re living with the story in your head, and the act of writing it down forces your subconscious to produce ideas. Intuitive writers tend to be very different from one another, but Stephen King gives a good description of how he works: A Memoir of the Craft: Amazon.co.uk: King, Stephen: 9781444723250: Books \u201cAnd then finally writing\u2026\u201dThere\u2019s an old writing exercise, for when you\u2019re starting a period of writing and have no idea what you want to put down. Get a sheet of paper and a pencil, and for 20 minutes \u2014 by the clock \u2014 sit down and write. Even if you start with \u201cI don\u2019t know what to write\u201d repeated over and over, by the end of the session, a phrase, or a plot point, or a surprise, or a really cool description, or a chapter title\u2026 You may find any or all of them on the paper. Most writers I know use a combination of planning and intuition, perhaps leaning towards one way or the other. Some won\u2019t set foot into a novel without having a written \u201cmap\u201d that may end up longer than the novel itself. Some won\u2019t even try to plan the first draft, on the grounds that it will squash their intuition. Some do the planning between the first and second drafts, and not before. That\u2019s one of the most important things to remember. When you\u2019ve finished your novel, there\u2019s a 90% chance that what you have is a first draft. Which can be oddly comforting, when you realise whatever\u2019s wrong with it can be changed. You may be one of those writers who works on their novel bit by bit, not leaving each bit until it\u2019s polished and shining and complete. More likely, you finish your book \u2014 try it out on friends who can be guarenteed to tell you an honest opinion \u2014 and even before they get back to you, you realise that you left out ABC, and you don\u2019t need XYZ, and that really, your job is only half done. If you want a thought to cheer you up, try Tolkein. It\u2019s common knowledge that he got his first line out of nowhere[*] \u2014 \u201cIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit\u201d \u2014 and followed it by writing The Hobbit, and another book about hobbits, The Lord of the Rings. His son Christopher brought out the multi-volume History of Middle-Earth, which has much of interest. I forget which volume it is (VIII?), but one of them has the complete first draft of The Lord of the Rings in it. It\u2019s dreadful. Really. If you know the book, all I have to give you as an example is that, originally, Aragorn was a hobbit, named Trotter. So if one of the best selling writers of the 20th century can turn a novel completely around between first and second draft \u2014 well, why not any one of us?  [*] Nowhere. OK, you can call it the human subconscious. You can call it what the Greeks called it: a Muse \u2014 especially in those minutes where it feels like the words are being dictated through you. Personally, I look at those neurological studies where it seems that the brain takes decisions a micro-amount of time before it lets the conscious mind know. And the conscious mind thinks it took the decision. The human brain is weird, and the human ability to create story has been hard-wired into us, at least since ancient humans \u2014 indentical to us \u2014 acquired Behavioural Modernity, 50,000 years ago. So it\u2019s not surprising if creating a book is a combination of hard conscious work, and just \u201cletting it come\u201d. That, and \u2014 as American writer and activist Mary Heaton Vorse said in 1911 \u2014 applying the seat of the pants to the seat of the chair. ",

            "answer_text": "Easy Answer- get it down on paper or text file so you will have it available to you for when you DO write it. Then WRITE IT. Whenever you find ideas you\u2019d like to incorporate into the book, WRITE it down and put it into your file or text to make sure you find a way to get it together with the rest. Next, sit down in front of a computer, typewriter, or other device used for writing, (Pencil and paper anyone?) and decide the main points of the story you wish to tell. What ideas are you finding intriguing to tell, difficult to overcome? Will there be any technical situations that the telling of which may we'll hinge upon your knowledge of how they operate? For instance, if you\u2019re writing a novel in which an escalator fails, but it\u2019s set in the old west, you might want to do some research into the item. Hard Answer- Getting it down to an organized set of concepts and characters, or at least some semblance of the storyline is always a good start. NOW if you\u2019re one of those who like to outline every detail and set forth spreadsheets of the timeline and such, then do it. If you prefer letting things occur organically and seeing where your imagination takes it then DO IT! Whatever the process that works best for you, then DO IT! Like the Nike ad says\u201d JUST DO IT!\u201d I\u2019ve always said everybody has a book IN them, getting it OUT of them is the problem. My publishing company specializes in such matters with a niche market called IN YOUR OWN words. Here, we take whatever YOU say, write or put together, do minor editing for format and page continuity, put it together into a book form, and allow YOU to have it to do as you wish. A nominal fee is associated with that, to cover the time involved in the process. Nothing outrageous, simple editing, and proofreading. Now IF you want more, then Vanity press houses, like LuLu, Smashwords and the like are more than willing to SELL your services to make sure that what you wrote has some commercial value. WHERE you publish and how much effort you perform into its sales, marketing and distribution are entirely up to YOU form there. Now should you be worthy of a contact from one of the larger regularly publishing houses, then they will do much of that for you, but they also get a MUCH larger slice of the profits as well. Write it and try seeing who and what will be the best options for you when ready. Just remember that the more you do, either by yourself or with PAID professionals, it will tell in your sales and marketing of the piece in question. ",
