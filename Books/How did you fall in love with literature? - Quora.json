            "answer_text": "A simple answer to that is by reading. But reading is a journey and not a momentary act. My relationship with literature has had its peaks and valleys. During school, literature was something that I read and enjoyed for pleasure. I remember reading Anita Nair\u2019s Ladies Coupe in eighth grade. It was an epiphany for me, to realise the impact of a book on my existence. Reading has always inspired me to write, which felt like I was a part of the creative process. Needless to say, I chose to study literature in college. Studying literature is worlds apart from reading. If I were to compare the two, reading is like watching a story unravel from the keyhole of a door. Studying, on the other hand, is opening that door and forcing yourself within every palpitating nerve of the story. As a student of literature, we become a part of the creative process as much as the creators were, whether a couple of years ago or far off from centuries ago now lying dead in their graves. I wasn\u2019t aware of this world of Critical theories and Analytical Criticism I was entering when I opted for literature during my undergrad. It was tiring, and the bliss of a reader was nowhere to be found. It was as if all pleasure was sucked out of literature. As much as I abhorred this new found side of the literary world I decided to give it a chance. John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost came as a solace to my misery. I was deeply intrigued by the epic and found myself frequently perusing his books in the library in a desperate attempt to find anything more to the poem. I finally fell into the lure of research. I was already a step inside the door when I began my research. And just like that I taught myself to love literature again. I can never go back to being the distant reader I was back in school. For years my mind has been trained to read the white spaces more than the words on a page. The words merely act as a key to the iridescent treasure that lies beneath. It took some time but literature eventually found its way back into my bookshelf and this time with a lot more weight, in all its glory it made me fall in love with it again. ",

            "answer_text": "Slowly but surely. I'll be honest with you. It took a while but it has definitely stuck. I was never a bookworm. I was never someone who considered a career in literature. I knew I didn't want to be an engineer or a doctor. I wanted to be \u201csomething, anything\u201d, something different. But I didn't know what that could be. And then in 2013 I opened a door that I was being pushed through and a vortex of books flew right at me. And then it hit me. This could be it. Well it took more than a few books, it took a couple of semesters to settle in and then it took a year to accept that this is the path I'll be taking and now it's been 6 years past that door opening and here I find myself at home trying to \u201cmake it\". Trying to do something that means more than just making money, trying to be a part of something bigger. Reading is an escape but it's more of an exploration, of who I am, of what the world could be, of people I don't know, people I wish I met, worlds I wish existed. Doorways to heaven and hell opened and I haven't looked back ever since. (Well that's a lie. I've wandered off here and there only to come back home). That's how I fell in love. With literature. ",
