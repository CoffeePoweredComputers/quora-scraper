            "answer_text": "I will suggest this. If your title is shared by a TV series already you need a better title. TV titles can read like labels. LA Law. Chicago Fire. [Character] & [Other Character]. Friends. A play, like a book title, should engage someone on some emotional level. Of Mice & Men. 12 Angry Men (which is kind of a label, but evocative), A Raisin in the Sun. Glenngary Glen Ross. NOS4A2 (which was a novel before it became a series). A book and a play (or a musical) are unique beasts that deserve something more than a simple identifier. So I suggest that if a TV show already picked yours, you can do better. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no copyright in a title, so legally you can call it whatever you like. But you risk confusing your audience - if your play gets performances, are people going to think it is something to do with the drama series? Basically if you\u2019re able to write an entire play, then you\u2019re clever enough to think of a title for it that doesn\u2019t make all your hard work sound like it\u2019s something it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not the end of the world, but I wouldn\u2019t use a well-known title for one of my works. There\u2019s something a bit odd about it. ",
