Losing his parents in the tragic way that he did is what eventually led to him becoming a master detective and traveling the world to master 127 forms of martial arts so he could fight crime in Gotham. But his first night fighting crime didn't go according to plan. He had the skills, but criminals didn't fear him. That night after he came home, he sat in the living room of Wayne Manor and prayed that his father would show him a sign. Show him something that would scare the criminals in Gotham. Then suddenly a bat broke the window and flew into the house. That is what made Bruce choose to be Batman. He wanted the criminals to share his dred. Also just to be clear, playboy Bruce Wayne is the mask, Batman's who he really is. ",
