In the book, he is just overwhelmed by all the new wizard snacks he\u2019s never seen before and \u201cNot wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything\u201d. We know he got more than one of everything because he ends up with a pile of chocolate frogs and has plenty of everything else to share with Ron. But even in the movie, I think we\u2019re meant to understand that he only takes a bit of everything and doesn\u2019t empty the cart. The cart is meant to feed the entire train, Harry and Ron couldn\u2019t possibly eat that much. As a complete side note, how adorable is the line, \u201c\u2018Go on, have a pasty,\u2019 said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\u201d Harry is such a sweet child. ",
