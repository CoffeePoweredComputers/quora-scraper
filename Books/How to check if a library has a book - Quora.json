            "answer_text": "Faruque! You made me nostalgic by metioning library! It feels like ages since I visited one. But whenever I visit library, I seldom have any particular book(s) in my mind. So mostly I go through every possible rack and pick what is interesting. If I have a particular book in my mind, I definitely check the availability with the librarian first. I can't afford the wastage of time and the later frustration of knowing about the unavailability of the book.If that's not possible then there is another option in the libraries mostly now a days - a computer application about the catalog and status(availability) of the book. That's the second thing I check.If that is also not possible then the manual search through racks - mostly category wise and alphabetically. Depends on how its arranged in that particular library.That's it for now, hope you find your book! Happy Reading! ",

            "answer_text": "All books in a library are catalogued. All you need to is access the catalogue and search for the book. Many libraries have electronic catalogues that can be accessed online. However, I suspect that there are some libraries that still use card catalogues. To access them you will need to go to that specific library. You can also ask the librarian to help you find the book you want. Libraries also have inter-library loan systems. This means that if your library does not have the book you want, they will source it from another library for you. ",
