            "answer_text": "Most answers have advocated for EE or CE, though I am a CS student also interested in robotics, and I would not have chosen EE or CE if I were to do it over again. And I think there is really one major reason why. I simply couldn't care less if I learn about circuits, wiring, etc. If neccessary, I can learn everything I need from clubs, personal projects, or on the job. I just can't imagine paying to learn about this stuff. I think this stems from the fact that I care more about making robots do things rather than enabling them to do things. When it comes down to it the accademic crossover between CS and CE is learning C/C++, though CE majors only learn it for the purpose for things like microcontrollers, and micro-processing. So in the accademic world, CE majors are very limited in learning how to make robots do things, and focus more on enabling robots to do things. In contrast, CS majors learn nothing about how to enable robots to do things, but entirely on learning the concepts and strategies used in controlling, not only robots, but machines in general. Even to the extent of learning how to get a robot/machines to make statistical decisions on their own i.e AI, Machine learning, etc. So what does this mean after college? In the workfield it is fairly easy for a CE major to learn the tools used by CS majors, and it is fairly easy for a CS major to learn the tools used by CE majors. Though it will be harder for CE majors to learn how to design good, robust, software and it will be harder for a CS major to learn how to design good, robust hardware. So in the end, I would imagine, if you want to be top tier in controlling robots, then do CS, if you want to be top tier in enabling robots, then do CE or EE. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on whether you are more interested in the hardware side or software side. On the hardware side you also have mechanical vs electrical to choose from (though some universities now have combined mech+elec degrees called mechatronics). It doesn't mean if you choose CS you can't do any hardware, or that if you choose engineering you can't do any software, but it largely determines which side you want to focus on. Most robotics people I know are from engineering (electrical in particular). Electrical engineering also teaches you basic programming, and it's usually relatively easy to dig further if you want to, and many good electrical engineering departments now also offer some fairly advanced CS courses in things like computer vision. Switching from software to hardware is more difficult in my experience, but some people do that as well. ",
