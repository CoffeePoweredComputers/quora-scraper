            "answer_text": "I guess. Even I get this empty/depressive feeling for a while, mostly from watching new things. I think it\u2019s just a sign that it was a great movie. The earliest as well as still the hardest hitting and most memorable ones I can remember are when I watched Wall-E for the first time when I was 5 as well as Transformers (Bayverse). I\u2019m 16 now but they still hit me hard and I still love those movies. Some others are the Cars (original) which I rewatched years after I first watched it. Rewatching it later somehow had a bigger impact than the first time I watched it. Wreck It Ralph (original), Despicable Me 2, and The Lego Movie (original) also gave me the feeling the first time I watched them as well as The Emoji Movie surprisingly. Independence Day also hit me hard after the first time watching it as well as after having rewatched Avatar again for the first time 2 years ago. The most recent experiences were after watching Flight World War II a few weeks ago. It\u2019s a low budget film but I still enjoyed it. Just had this empty feeling for the rest of the day until it sort of faded away the next day. Another one was after I watched Cars 3 earlier this year as well as this time I was obsessed with Sonic Boom during the COVID-19 lockdown. Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation also gave me this feeling. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children also had this effect after watching it earlier this year. What hit me hardest lately though was after finishing this anime Angel Beats! last night. I haven\u2019t seen anything as hitting and sad as that in ages. The last ones I remember that hit me that hard are Independence Day, Armageddon, and Fortress. Since my family is always near me I wanted to hide my tears until I was alone. I\u2019ve been crying for ages after waking up in the middle of last night (and still am today) and even today I still have this empty/depressive feeling from it. Even Gate and Haifuri left me with this empty feeling for a while on me. They were mostly just funny but still special. Spirited Away, Your Name, and When Marnie Was There are also animes that hit me really hard. Even short clips seem to have this effect. K-ON! is another anime I\u2019ve been interested in with the only issue being I can\u2019t find it anywhere so I could only rely on short clips as well as these meme and explanation videos on YouTube which were enough to hit me hard after understanding what it was all about. The ending of Terminator 2 was also enough to hit me. World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles also hit me after watching a couple of clips from the movie as well as some clips from Saving Private Ryan. Same thing with Midway and Pearl Harbor. I just like to think of it as a sign that you just watched a great movie and it will be nostalgic later in your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I\u2019m not sure, but I can explain my situation. Recently I watched Pixars original movie Ratatouille for the first time. Sure I knew of the movie, but I had never fully sat down and watched it. When I decided to watch the movie it was really late into the night, which could also be a factor in the feeling I was left with. Along with the situation the world is in, which is a strong cause of anxiety and depression for many people (struggling or not).  As I watched the movie I didn\u2019t exactly feel any strong emotions. The most I would do was think about an embarrassing scene a few seconds after it happened. When I finally finished the movie I was left feeling empty. As if there was a hole left in my heart, I was reflecting on my life as if I were living a lie. The reasoning I could not put my finger on. I have been struggling with short depression periods for quite some time, but I had never felt so alone before. The silence was terrifying. So I have no explanation for if this is normal or an explanation to disprove its normality, but I thought I\u2019d give my experience on the topic. ",

            "answer_text": "Post movie depression syndrome occurs when we snap back to reality after watching a \u201cperfect\u201d movie. You became really engrossed in the movie, connected with the characters, compared the fantasy with your not so wonderful life and when the movie is over, you feel as though you're back to square one. I recently watched a Korean movie \u201cmy ID is Gangnam beauty\" and one of the characters resonated with me. Though recovery from the post movie depression may take time, the following could help fast recovery. Understand that movies are not real life. Perfect love stories, perfect realities don't exist. However, we could instead use the lessons from the movie to constructively to chart our life. Perhaps, it was a love story, how did the couple love each other unconditionally and what can you do to emulate such kind of behaviours in your love life. Think beyond yourself and see how you could emulate the \u201cperfect\" movie in your own reality.Sometimes, we may never be able to achieve what we see in movies, so get used to life and live it contentedly. Set your goals, set a plan, stick to it and pursue your dreams ethically.If it helps to write about the movie or talk about it, then do so. Play your favourite happy music, watch your favourite comedian, read up peoples opinions about the movie on forums or YouTube, hang out, plan for your work the following day, etc. My point is, don't think too much about the movie and get busy.",

When you watch the ending of a movie or a show which u loved the most, you come across the fact that the fantasy is now over and you have to get back to your not so exciting/adventurous life. It is just a feeling that twists your heart. We want to live a life just like our favorite characters who achieve everything and solve everything in the blink of an eye. There are different types of people, one type for whom it doesn't matter anything if everything goes on smoothly. And the other type who wants their life just like a fairy tale. Me and you probably belong to the second category and there is nothing wrong about it. once we stop watching fantasies and want to make something out of our life, you may be the one who actually makes a difference. come out of that fantasy and make your life astounding. don't let your mind be idle. Dream and work to achieve it.P.S: I am still working on it. So i actually can't suggest you how to come out of it. But give it a try your way. ",

While you are watching a movie you start to think all good things in the movie, but your continuity in thinking stops at a sad part of your life you start relating your life with it so it might be causing you stress and you feel depressed. Watch movies for your entertainment it is for you to learn something to enjoy some moment or to laugh a little sometimes to cry but for a reason. You should watch it and later just keep going, do not think about it too much because overthinking is one of the main reason for stress. ",
