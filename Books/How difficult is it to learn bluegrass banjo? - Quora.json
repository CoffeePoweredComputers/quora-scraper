            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not difficult but it\u2019s hard to play well. The open G-chord standard tuning makes it easy to strum and to play without worrying too much about where the next note might be. The banjo action is also quite light and playing loud is easy and fun. It\u2019s also a cruise for your left hand on the neck, in general. The rough part is getting your right-picking hand working like a machine gun. I found there were three main obstacles to be overcome by an aspiring player. The drone G-string has to be hit on the off-beat to get that syncopated sound. That takes a lot of practice and positioning of the the right thumb to sound right. It\u2019s very counter intuitive if you play guitar already. The second obstacle is that the banjo is a percussion instrument. In bluegrass getting and maintaining precise timing while doing triplet style picks separates you from advancing far. A metronome can be useful as well as playing along with recorded songs. But until you can keep time, you can\u2019t play the banjo, in my view. Third, you have to love playing - a lot and learning when _not_ to play as well is just as important. My tip is to play in jamalong bands. Watch the way competent banjo pickers chunk the tunes during their breaks. It\u2019s a natural lead instrument and requires grit and restraint and lots of practice until you can play it well. It\u2019s worth it, I find and a good banjo player is an asset to any band. Also the timing and ensemble work can be migrated to good acoustic guitar playing as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Playing Bluegrass banjo is only as hard as you make it out to be. If you learn by ear it will go A LOT faster and you\u2019ll be able to play with people much more quickly. Also if you confine yourself to rolls your learning will be diminished learn what the rolls are and what they sound like then apply them to the music. This is very hard for me to explain because I just \u201cdo it\u201d. Everyone learns differently but I find people that confine themselves to tab will never progress\u2026 ",
