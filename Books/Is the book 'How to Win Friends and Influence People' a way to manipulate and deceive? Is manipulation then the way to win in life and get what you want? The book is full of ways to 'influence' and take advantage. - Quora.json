            "answer_text": "I do not think that ideas presented in the book are intended to be \u201cdeceptions\u201d. They are just profound insights as to what is an effective method for working with all kinds of people, as opposed to the opposite or contrary modes of operation. Personally, I never bother with books like this anymore, having read it years ago It is a useful book because it teaches people how to engage others. I once knew a man who seemed to express the principles suggested in the book. He was a very humble man who could lead others and who could get other people to do things that needed to be done without deception. For example, his way to get someone to scrub out a toilet was to pick up his cleaning supplies, and with a great big smile on his face, he would get down on his hands and knees and show how the toilet could be cleaned. He would be smiling the whole time and scrubbing away, and he would say something like this. \u201cMaybe we could take our scrubbing brush (or whatever) and go at it like this and like that.\u201d He had a pleasant way of laughing and smiling while he did this that made you feel like he was just full of love for doing necessary jobs. Oh, yes, and sometimes he would sing songs from the movie musical \u201cMan of La Mancha\u201d. He used to sing the song \u201cKnight of the Woeful Countenance\u201d. I have not forgotten the example this man set for me. He was not someone you would necessarily notice. He had no special recognition, but his heart was full of so much love and respect for others that I will always remember him as one of my greatest teachers. At the same time, there were other men who held positions of greater authority, who could not work this way. They could be amusing and funny, but the had no real humility. So people can \u201cact\u201d in different ways; but not all are fully loving personalities. The book about \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d is just a book of general guidelines that allow a person to communicate in an effective way. If you want to see examples of \u201cdeception\u201d in modern life, for that you would consider the writings of sales \u201cguru\u201d Tom Robbins and others like him. ",
