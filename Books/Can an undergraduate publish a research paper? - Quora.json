            "answer_text": "Technically, anyone can publish a research paper. It is key to know that what you are publishing is a true reflection of your work and not something you are going to be embarrassed about later in your career. For example, if you plan on continuing this research into later years (older undergrad years, grad school, work, etc), maybe you should hold off and publish when you have spent more time and are truly an expert at the research. If you don\u2019t plan on continuing your research and you are confident in your paper, go for it! The best thing to do is consult with your professor or an advisor at your university. At the end of the day, it is your work and your decision with what to do with it, as long as you don\u2019t violate any university or lab policies. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "By doing a neat piece of research! Of course it helps if you are in an environment where faculty may advise/critique/ suggest journals. A mate of mine published a paper (on guillimot fledging) based solely on his own observations. I published (with several similar students) two ornithological papers, published when I was a graduate student, but the work was done when we were bachelors\u2019 students, and had no connection with our PhD studies (on snails). Actually, without digging through the archives, I think I have reviewed or edited a few papers stemming from undergraduate projects: usually, of course, with an advisor/supervisor as second author. Most bachelor\u2019s programmes (at least in Biology) involve a project. Some are very good ",

            "answer_text": "It is quite simple. You have to produce something worth reading, and write it up to the standard required by a refereed journal. (I have been a referee for several learned journals, and subject editor for one.) You don\u2019t need degrees or any formal qualifications. (Amateurs do it in a number of fields, such as botany, where they can literally do the research in fields.) Find a suitable journal and read some issues to see what they publish, and follow the guidelines for formatting etc. You must have some experience if you have something worth publishing. I would suggest you ask a friendly academic for help. ",

There are programs like the NSF REU and HHMI undergrad summer research programs that are meant to do this. ",
