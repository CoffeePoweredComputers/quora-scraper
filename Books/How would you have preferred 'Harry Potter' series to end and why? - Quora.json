To start with, much, much, much more death at the Battle of Hogwarts, including one of the trio. This is supposed to be the climactic battle of a super-destructive war against the ultimate bad guy, so the death count should reflect that. It should hurt. Instead, we get a few named-but-very-much-secondary-characters (George, Tonks, Lupin\u2026and that\u2019s about it) and a host of un-named ones or ones that are a half-step from being un-named (Colin Creevy, Lavender Brown - sorry, who are they? Oh, wait, no-one cares). So: Ron or Hermione (Hermione would probably hurt more, so she gets offed), Hagrid, McGonagall, Cho, Neville, and a couple more Weasleys - let\u2019s say Arthur, and Percy. For balance, we can kill off a few more of the villains: have Umbridge trampled to death by centaurs, have one or both Malfoy parents killed in the cross-fire. Then, rather than skipping directly to 19 years later, we drop in on Harry and the other characters at intervals leading up to that point: One year after, the grief still raw, the wounds still healing, Ron and the Weasleys not coping, the family ripped apart. The rebuilding of the wizard world barely begun, recriminations, arguments, what now? Five years after, Ron and Harry as Aurors helping to chase down the last of the Death Eaters, both attempting to cope with whatever the wizard equivalent of PTSD is. Ron with a burgeoning firewhisky problem, Harry treading rather too close to the line separating the bad guys from the good guys (using unforgivables to get his targets, being pulled up on it, not caring). But ending this chapter with glimmers of hope - Harry re-connecting with Ginny at a memorial service, Ron re-connecting with his family. Perhaps a confrontation with Draco that makes Harry realise that he\u2019s in danger of becoming the monster. Ten years on, building on this, life returning to normal. Marriages, births, new life helping to heal the wounds of the old. Then you\u2019ve earned your skip to 19 years and your \u2018all was well\u2019. Too dark\u2026? ",

            "answer_text": "I honestly can't think of anything off the top of my head\u2026 but I do think it would be interesting if some things with Snape Changed\u2026. Keep an open mind... Imagine if Snape was written with the same features, struck the same type of fear into students, everything about him was the same, but take away how rude he was to everyone all the time. Just making him a cold, quiet type that sulks around the halls of Hogwarts, black cape wisping behind him, paying no mind to anyone. Still the same Snape, just he only made rude or snarky comments in front of the Malfoy\u2019s, other prodoment slytherin house members or very specific characters. This was never explicitly pointed out by anyone, just written that way. He was never snarky towards Dumbledore, instead he just seemed as if though he was a shell of a man when they spoke. Later when we look into Snape's past, it shows that he hung around Mulciber & those kids in slytherin just because they\u2019re the only ones who seemed to accept him, made him feel like he was worth something. But he never actually planned on joining the Death Eaters, he just found Dark Arts fascinating. That (through some turn of events I haven't really given enough thought into) he joins the Death Eaters just to get inside knowledge on Dark Arts, maybe starting off as an agent for Dumbledore (maybe this happens when he gets news of Voldemort's plans for the Potters? idk, just not because he believes in Voldemort). We learn that the only reason he seems so cold and dead inside is because of a life of abuse and misery, topped off with that fact failed at saving his one true love. That he didn't just beg for Lily\u2019s life, that he begged for all the Potters to live, to keep Lily\u2019s happiness. That he never actually hated Harry for no good reason, he was tactfully treating him poorly in front of people who could report his behavior to Voldemort. That Snape was so sullen and secluded because the best way to keep up this double life was by not letting anyone in.. That he actually did care deeply and truly\u2026 Sometimes I think that writing Snape to something of this extent would have made his story even more heart wrenching. We all know \u2018the chapter that made us fall in love with Snape\u2019 but I think this would have made the fall even harder. To know he was actually all around good the whole time when we all thought he was evil. We would go back and re-read the books and it would register as a ah-ha moment. The only time we see Snape actually being mean is in the right place and time, when we thought Snape was an depraved, unnerving man, we now know the truth. We feel remorse for him. In more than just a \u2018he did the right thing because he loved Lily\u2019 way.. but in a \u2018he did the right thing because he was good all along and no one ever knew\u2019 type of way\u2026 BUT with that said Snape is amazing how he is now. All the Snarky comments, his sly sarcasm and hatred for everything and everyone makes him who he is. It would be very hard to write him to seem that way without actually being that way in the end. A lot\u2026 way too many.. amazing scenes from the book would have to be cut or re-written, so no, I\u2019m not saying \u201cThis is how it should have been\u201d Im just entertaining the idea of \u201cwhat if?\u2019\u2026 If anyone actually read this, what do you think?
