            "answer_text": "Real Estate is a longer term proposition that requires understanding of perceived market value, effective marketing and effective pinpointed negotiation skills. You're going to need money to start it, despite all these people who walk around talking NO MONEY DOWN. Unless you can be a supreme negotiator and convince both sides to come together on a no money solution. Flipping requires an active market and precise market knowledge. You want to know why so many people have horror property stories? They are lit for the cash and dont consider the market knowledge important until its too darn late and they are investing badly! To start a business with a view to making lots of money is a bad way to approach business. Make a business where what you do is good quality and a regular seller. And the money will come by itself. At 19 you want to be an instant millionaire and thats understandable. In fact the best thing to say in that arena is if you think you can do it WHY THE HECK NOT? Grab a goal sheet with you now at the top and you as a millionaire on the 365th day of this process. Split the effort into bite sized achievable goals. And methods as to how you will achieve it. Then prove everyone wrong and win. ",

            "answer_text": "Real estate investing requires starting capital. The more you have, the more you can make, the more you can loan, the more opportunities to buy you have because you\u2019re not so restricted by the value of the property itself, the more the whole thing snowballs up to the point where finding good pieces of real estate become much harder then working out the financing when it starts to slow down a bit again. It\u2019s a great thing if you are wealthy to start with. Starting a business is more risky, requires less in the way of starting capital, and has potentially higher returns and potentially higher losses. Since a good amount of starting capital is unlikely as a 18 year old unless you have a name worth it\u2019s weight in gold and/or funds inherited or gifted by someone (making you pretty much by definition wealthy already)\u2026 I\u2019d go with starting a business. That said, real estate in specific conditions can yield some really great returns without much investment, but this is normally a \u201climited opportunity\u201d thing like the, eg. housing crisis in the UK where you either got on the gravy train or time or it drove off in a few years.
