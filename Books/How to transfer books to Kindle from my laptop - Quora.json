            "answer_text": "It is a fairly simple process. What you will need to do is ensure a few things to begin with. First, please check that the books you wish to transfer to your Kindle device are in .mobi format. This is the only format that Kindle recognises or that is compatible with Kindle and is a must to read books on the device. Secondly, download a software called Send to Kindle from Amazon to your desktop/laptop. This software would allow you to transfer books to Kindle. Now, after you have performed these steps all you need to do is to select the ebook on your laptop and click the right mouse button. In the menu you will see Send to Kindle as an option, selecting this option will transfer the book to your Kindle device. The software will take a few seconds depending on the size of the file to upload the book on the server and then all you have to do is open your Kindle device and download the book there by using the sync option given in the device. On a side note if your ebooks are not in Mobi format then you may convert them by using any one of the many online ebook converters. The results aren't perfect but you will have your ebook ready to be read on Kindle. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you transfer a book from your computer to Kindle? You can do it with something like Windows Explorer or any other similar program that allows you to explore the files on your disk drives. But doing it this way tends to require a fair bit of knowledge about where files are stored, and where on your Kindle you want to create a file. It isn\u2019t really that difficult, but for most people, it is more than they want to learn. Fortunately, there is an Open Source free program called Calibre that takes care of most of those details. Once you\u2019ve installed the program, you use this to keep a book catalog of all of your books, as well as transferring them to/from your PC to whatever e-reader you have. The program is smart and customizable, you simply tell it what kind of e-reader you have, where you store your ebooks, and let it do its thing. I could go through all of the details, but why re-invent the wheel? Simply click on this Calibre User Manual link and follow the instructions. If you haven\u2019t already installed the latest version, you\u2019ll be given instructions on how to do so. I\u2019ve been using the program for about 15 years now, it has improved considerably over the time. It is easy to use and fairly intuitive. It simply works, making the drudgery of cataloging a fairly easy task. Best of all, it is FREE! (although there is a link should you choose to donate to the maintainer/author, and it would be appreciated) ",
