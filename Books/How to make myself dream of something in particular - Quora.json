            "answer_text": "Hello, yes there are ways to preprogram your brain to dream! One of the most common ways to do this is through lucid dreaming techniques, although this is not the only way. One of my personal favorite methods of dream incubation involves meditating upon and visualizing a specific scenario right before you fall asleep and then allowing your mind to drift off into that scenario thus creating a dream of it. Another method to try involves asking your subconscious to dream of a specific thing and then using affirmations such as \u2018I am dreaming of XYZ\u2019 immediately before falling asleep. Whether or not you remember the dream is debatable, but I have had personal success with these techniques! Good luck to you. ",

Don't be fooled about them, your subsconscious self is deceiving and will play with your emotions. The best approach is go to the person and show your I interest. ",
