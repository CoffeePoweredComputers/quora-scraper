            "answer_text": "Well The Hobbit is pretty much a prequel to LOTR in the same world, middle earth and same era. So pretty much all locations and characters are connected one way or another. I will try and give a short summary of the most notable onces. First things first. The one Ring. Introduced in the hobbit and acts as the major plot device in LOTR. The Hobbit tells the tale of how Bilbo came into possession of the Ring. This is the basis for the entire LOTR trilogy.  Bilbo. We find Bilbo alive and somewhat well in Rivendell in LOTR. Frodo the main character in LOTR is his nephew and heir. He inherited the Ring from Bilbo.  The dwarves. Gimli in the fellowship of the ring is the son of Gloin. Gloin is a member of the dwarves in league with Thorin Oakshield in the quest for mount Erebor.  Thorin Oakshield was the son of Thrain II, who had the last of the dwarven rings of power which was taken from him in Dol Guldur by Sauron. His father Thror was slain by the orc Azog. We meet Azog's son Bolg as a chieftain of the orcs in the battle of the five armies.  Dain Ironfoot, who ruled mount Erebor after the battle of the Five Armies, was still alive and kicking in LOTR, where he fought off the invade of orcs in the Battle of Dale allong side the men of Dale including Brand.  Balin, another member of Thorin's party, and Bibo's best dwarven friend, is the same Balin who's tomb was found in the mines of Moria by the fellowship. He took a host of dwarves from Erebor to Moria to try and reclaim Moria but failed. Mirkwood and the elves.King Thranduil is Legolas his father.  As far as events goes, the most notable one is where Gandalf left the party just before Mirkwood. In LOTR we learn that he's attending the white council to drive Sauron away from Dol Guldur.  Objects.Ocrist and Glamdring. In the hobbit we read how gandalf came into possesion of his sword Glamdring. Also Bilbo's sword Sting earns his name in the hobbit and he passes on the sword to Frodo in Rivendell along with his mithril vest, which he found in Smaug's treasurepile.  Also here are alot of recurring characters in the two books; Elrond, Gandalf, Gollum, etc. One of the few things that don't have a place in LOTR from The Hobbit is Beorn, the skinchanger. Although he is stated by Tolkien to be a man, he obviously has some qualities that usual men do not have. I'd say he's pretty unique.  Just a short summay, and by no means complete. There are many a more connections between the books, and i didnt describe most of them. But these were the most notable  from the top of my head, ",

            "answer_text": "Let's start with the obvious, the ring. The one ring is the object that Tolkien uses to tie his initial stories about Middle Earth together; Bilbo finds it, leaves it for Frodo and then Frodo meanders off on a quest to destroy it. Although it started of as simply a ring (and not the ring), it nevertheless plays an important role in both stories. It allows Bilbo to burgal, as Tolkien would say, and it's clearly the center of the Lord of the Rings story. Another set of obvious connections can be found in a set of major characters that appear directly in both stories: Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, Gollum, Gloin, and Elrond. All of them appear in both stories, though Gloin is only there for the briefest of moments as his lone appearance during the Lord of the Rings comes at the Council of Elrond. Both Bilbo's and Gollum's appearances in the two stories are relatively unaltered (i.e. their character doesn't change all that much from story to story).[1] Gandalf and Elrond, on the other hand, undergo a somewhat noticeable change in temperament. Both are much more whimsical and carefree throughout The Hobbit, while the story told during The Lord of the Rings forces them to display a much more serious temperament as they naturally fulfill leadership roles. Balin does enough to merit a role in both stories (albeit a relatively boring and dead one during The Fellowship of the Ring). The Eagles (to make it somewhat less general, the Lord of the Eagles appears in both books; saying \"the eagles\" is like saying goblins appear in both books, it is far too broad) also appear in both books, rescuing Bilbo and company from goblins (and participating in the Battle of the Five Armies) and turning up at the end of Return of the King to help Gandalf rescue Frodo and Sam from Mordor. Finally, Sauron appears in both stories; as the necromancer that Gandalf is concerned about during The Hobbit and as something that is altogether different during The Lord of the Rings. Much like Elrond, Rivendell, also undergoes a noticeable transformation. The Lord of the Rings doesn't display many hints of the Rivendell that Bilbo and the dwarves encounter in The Hobbit. Gone, for the most part, is the fancy-free nature; there isn't even a question that \"tra-la-la-lalye\" would seem out of place. Bilbo's gifts to Frodo, Sting and his mithril armor, are found in both books. The mithril armor was found in the Lonely Mountain, while Sting was found in a cahce of weapons along with Gandalf's sword, Glamdring. While on the subject of that cache, it makes sense to mention the trolls. Bilbo and company are captured by a trio of trolls in the midst of their adventure and Frodo and the other hobbits encounter the very same stone trolls on their way to Rivendell. Now, we're into some connections of lineage. Gloin and Gimli have the father-son connection between the books, as do King Thranduil and Legolas. Additionally, the Spiders of Mirkwood are descendents of Shelob, the spider Frodo and Sam encounter at Cirith Ungol. Finally, there are a handful of important characters that we meet throughout The Lord of the Rings that are alluded to in The Hobbit. Saruman, Galadriell, and Cirdan the Shipwright (also, presumably, Celeborn and, possibly, Glorfindel) are all members of The White Council, the group that Gandalf is involved with during the dealings with the Necromancer during The Hobbit. Like Stanley Pranoto, I'm sure this list is non-exhaustive, as it's comprised of things that I can remember off the top of my head (and I'll admit to not having read The Hobbit in a while). [1] Provided, of course, you use the Gollum from the revised edition of The Hobbit. If you look to compare Gollum from an earlier version of The Hobbit, you'll see a much darker character in The Lord of the Rings.
