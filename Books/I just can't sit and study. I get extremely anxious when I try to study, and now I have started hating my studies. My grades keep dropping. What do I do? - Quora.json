            "answer_text": "Well many times its only in your head and the cause is maybe the habits you might\u2019ve build up while you weren't studying. So now you're trying to break the habit, break the routine. First thing is to note down in your mind that, it'll take time. Everything takes time. You won't start concentrating 700% right after reading this answer. But someday you will. So here is first thing to do, calm down. That's right, don't takr any stress and just calm down. Second, believe in the limitless human potential, in simple words, understand that you aren't inferior (If you think you are the dumbest person). Third have a suble smile and lighten up your mood, things done in a rush won't help you, as I said before, it'll definitely take time. Anyons who says \u201cDo this and concentrate for 899 hours\u201d well thats 899% clickbait and they couldn't care less about you concentrating. Why am I saying this? Well because when you follow those things and trust me most of the time you will fail and end up feeling more bad about yourself. You lose the moment you doubt yourself. So its crucial to understand that it'll take time. Take deep breaths, clear your mind and think of possibile distractions. It could me primarily be your phone, social media. So you might think, ok I need to delete every social media and turn off the phone. Nope wrong. Phone is a part of us now, it's like a body part, you can't expect to remove your kidney and be normal. Its the truth, the phone a part of you. Trying to cut it out is simply stupid because even though it has cons, it has way foo many pros. Now social media, I always find people telling to \u201c make a better version of yourself \u201c or \u201c to become next Bi Gates\u201d delete your social media. Hell no. No. No. No. Social media is also a major part of our lives. The fact that you are giving it more importance is well, your fault. Social media is the place where everyone express themselves, we engage, we entertain ourselves. Our brain loves that. But we forget that anything in excess is toxic. Same way social media in excess is toxic. Just honestly try to cut down the time you spend on social media. When we use anything which entertain us, we stop thinking rationally. For example, you think of using quora for maybe 30 minutes but the clock hit 30 minutes and you are reading an amazing answer which will take maybe more 4 minutes, no harm. But after that four minutes, you end up engaging in other answers. So the key here is trying to become more conscious while doing things. Again there's no particular script to it. I can only say keep trying to become conscious and make rational decisions. Keep practicing, it's like learning to ride a bicycle. It just gets better with every try. Don't hate yourself just because you spent 60 millisecons more on a social media. Now this will help you in getting resistant to distractions, well because you know what you have to do. To start with studying, start small. Maybe a page. Don't make learning the entire Bible your first goal. Start with a page, then more and more. Try concentrating on a page. If you find that hard, then well go more small. Concentrate on a single sentence. Believe that that's the sentence you want to understand for now. Try to visualize and think over what is written. Simply reading it in inattentive manner will get you nowhere. Remember learning a sentence which you have understood is million times easier than putting efforts in remembering it. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a extremely simple solution for thisThe basic is that your mind don't like to study, it likes to do other stuffs which give you peace of mind preferably entertainment of some sort of or sleeping.So What you have to do Close all your books, and don't open it untill you are suure that you         wanna open it.In the meantime do what you like most , you like to watch movies , give it 2 days 3 days continuous movies, Do what you want but don't open books.DON'T SLEEP ALL THE TIME .Fix your time of sleep.If you get bored , be bored but don't open the book to kill the boredom.At the end of 5 or 6 days you are end with every entertainment activity and the only solution you have left is to study,then you can better concentrate on studies.About Getting extremely anxious, Dude its a serious problem if you get anxious just for studies then its okay, But if you get extremely anxious for every little thing then you are suffering from Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). What is GAD?All of us worry about things like health, money, or family problems. But people with GAD are extremely worried about these or other things, even when there is little or no reason to worry about them. They are very anxious about just getting through the day. They think things will always go badly. At times, worrying keeps people with GAD from doing everyday tasks.GAD develops slowly. It often starts during the teen years or young adulthood. Symptoms may get better or worse at different times, and often are worse during times of stress.People with GAD may visit a doctor many times before they find out they have this disorder. They ask their doctors to help them with headaches or trouble falling asleep, which can accompany GAD but they don\u2019t always get the help they need right away. It may take doctors some time to be sure that a person has GAD instead of something else.What causes GAD?GAD sometimes runs in families, but no one knows for sure why some people have it, while others don\u2019t. Researchers have found that several parts of the brain are involved in fear and anxiety. Research suggests that the extreme worries of GAD may be a way for a person to avoid or ignore some deeper concern. If the person deals with this concern, then the worries of GAD would also disappear. By learning more about fear and anxiety in the brain, scientists may be able to create better treatments. Researchers are also looking for ways in which stress and environmental factors may play a role.What are the signs and symptoms of GAD?A person with GAD may: Worry very much about everyday thingsHave trouble controlling their constant worriesKnow that they worry much more than they shouldHave trouble relaxingHave a hard time concentratingBe easily startledHave trouble falling asleep or staying asleepFeel tired all the timeHave headaches, muscle aches, stomach aches, or unexplained painsHave a hard time swallowingTremble or twitchBe irritable, sweat a lot, and feel light-headed or out of breathHave to go to the bathroom a lot.How is GAD treated?First, talk to your doctor about your symptoms. Your doctor should do an exam to make sure that an unrelated physical problem isn\u2019t causing the symptoms. The doctor may refer you to a mental health specialist.GAD is generally treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both.Psychotherapy. A type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is especially useful for treating GAD. It teaches a person different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations that help him or her feel less anxious and worried.Medication. Doctors also may prescribe medication to help treat GAD. Two types of medications are commonly used to treat GAD\u2014anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants. Anti-anxiety medications are powerful and there are different types. These side effects are usually not severe for most people, especially if the dose starts off low and is increased slowly over time.Antidepressants are used to treat depression, but they also are helpful for GAD. They may take several weeks to start working. These medications may cause side effects such as headache, nausea, or difficulty sleeping. These side effects are usually not a problem for most people, especially if the dose starts off low and is increased slowly over time. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you may have.It's important to know that although antidepressants can be safe and effective for many people, they may be risky for some, especially children, teens, and young adults. A \"black box\"\u2014the most serious type of warning that a prescription drug can have\u2014has been added to the labels of antidepressant medications. These labels warn people that antidepressants may cause some people to have suicidal thoughts or make suicide attempts. Anyone taking antidepressants should be monitored closely, especially when they first start treatment.Some people do better with CBT, while others do better with medication. Still others do best with a combination of the two. Talk with your doctor about the best treatment for you.What is it like to have GAD?\"I was worried all the time about everything. It didn't matter that there were no signs of problems, I just got upset. I was having trouble falling asleep at night, and I couldn't keep my mind focused at work. I felt angry at my family all the time.\"I saw my doctor and explained my constant worries. My doctor sent me to someone who knows about GAD. Now I am taking medicine and working with a counselor to cope better with my worries. I had to work hard, but I feel better. I'm glad I made that first call to my doctor.\" GAD information from National Institute of Mental HealthGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): When Worry Gets Out of Control ",
