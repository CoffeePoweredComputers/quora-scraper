            "answer_text": "It was a pre-planned work. From the morning, Nicholas had behaved in such a way as if he wanted to visit the gooseberry garden, so his aunt went on to guard the garden to prevent Nicholas from visiting. But the interesting part is that he never had any intention of visiting the gooseberry garden. By showing up purposely at the doors of the front garden with obvious stealth, he made his aunt guard the garden while he executed his plan to make his way into The Lumber Room. Using a chair, he took the key of the lumber room from a shelf in the library and unlocked the door with the key, with having a few days practice of opening a lock and there he was, inside The Lumber Room.
