            "answer_text": "For me, it has just been very hard on my family. And not in a way you probably think. Sure, my siblings and I have to stay home and can\u2019t play with friends now, just like every other kid, but now our parents are working even more, or were, I guess. Now it\u2019s just my mom, who is pregnant with twins. Great news! Except now so have 5 other siblings. On top of that, baby A won\u2019t flip, so she might have to do a c-section. My mom and dad aren\u2019t arguing as much, but they still argue (;-;). But, I also have been thinking of running away. Not because it sounds cool, hell no. It\u2019s a crazy dangerous world out there, even with the pandemic making some bad people stay inside, there will always be some bad people outside. I\u2019m running away for a few reasons, such as my sexuality not being accepted by anyone in my household (I\u2019m a pansexual female, and my mom [who also told 9 year old me that if I\u2019m ever lesbian, she\u2019ll kick me out] and little sister and older brother have shown signs of homophobia [my little brother has, too, but he\u2019s 7, he\u2019s just doing what the bigger kids are doing.]), and genuinely feeling an outcast in my house. I\u2019m not super afraid, I\u2019ve been planning for weeks. I\u2019m just scared of being alone in a dangerous world, and being killed too tbh. But, who knows. Maybe me running away to a new family will be the best decision I\u2019ll ever make. I hope everyone else has a good year, though. ",

            "answer_text": "This virus brought me back into a state of depression for like 1 day, about a year ago I got super depressed, because it was tough, my family didn\u2019t know how much simple jokes or names that were meant to be funny made me sad, I thought I wasn\u2019t gonna feel anything but sadness and all I can remember were all the bad and horrible things that they\u2019ve said and done to me, countless of times I\u2019ve thought of scenarios where I\u2019d done 1 of 3 things. Number one, I would try to find a way to fake my death and live my dream, away from them (this is where things go off the rails). Number two I would commit suicide, but I wouldn\u2019t make a normal one no, I wanted to make it real creepy to haunt as I slowly pass. Number three I would grab a knife and slowly slit the throats of everyone near name before taking my own life. So yeah that\u2019s all I got to say, I\u2019m doing great right now, the worst thing that could happen is if someone gets on by psychotic and very sadistic side, but no one can do that. I wish all a good day, we can get through this, except those who want to kill others, except them. :) ",
