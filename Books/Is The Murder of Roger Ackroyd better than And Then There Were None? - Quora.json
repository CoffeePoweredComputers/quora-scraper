            "answer_text": "Well, having read the two books - Murder of Roger Ackroyd and And Then There Were None , I have to say that these two books of Christie are pretty divergent. Murder of Roger Ackroyd belongs to the Poirot series of Agatha Christie with Hercules Poirot, the Belgian detective, as the investigator. I have read 15 books of Poirot series. Hercules Poirot is a method loving person and relies on his little grey cells. And Then There Were None is Christie's best selling novel world wide, but mind you it is neither part of Poirot series nor Miss Marple series. Actually speaking there isn't any of the two detective in And Then There Were None, so comparing it with Murder of Roger Ackroyd seems petty. In And Then There Were None every single person (including the culprit behind all murders) dies on the isolated island. The mystery of all the deaths is revealed through a letter left in a bottle that comes ashore. The letter was written by the murderer who, eventually after murdering everyone, commits suicide. In the letter the culprit explains how he murdered each and every person on the island. And Then There Were None is completely distant from Christie's usual style of writing. It seriously sends a chill down your spine. I am a great admirer of Christie's writing style especially when it comes to the narration of a person. I fall in love with her every time I read her books. No doubt Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a marvel of Christie, but if you ask me which one would I like to re-read it has to be And then there were None without a doubt! Christie herself stated that it was the most difficult book for her to write. I don't think anything else is to be mentioned henceforth.. Hope that help! Enjoy reading Agatha Christie :) ",

            "answer_text": "And Then There Were None is definitely the best book writen by Agatha Christie, and as described by her, the most difficult book to write. I read both the books after having read about a dozen books by her. This enabled me to pick up patterns and puzzles in her writings which could be used to identify the \u2018killer\u2019. While reading The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd, i recognized the murderer even before i reached the half way mark. That didn\u2019t make the rest of the story uninteresting, but the \u2018shock and surprise\u2019 element that awaits in the end of any AC book went missing. And Then There Were None on the other hand was a complete stunner. Right from the introductory poem, which formed the pattern of the murders, to the big revelatation in the end, the reader is kept glued to the book, challenged and defeated at every step. One might act triumphant at one stage to have found \u2018The One\u2019, only to be left disappointed by the next chapter.The plot is beautifully setup, with every character getting a backstory, which ultimately forms the backbone of the book. Having sold more than 100 million copies and by being the world\u2019s most sold mystery novel, And Then There Were None comfortably beats The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd, in all departments. ",
