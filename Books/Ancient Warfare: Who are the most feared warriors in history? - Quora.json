            "answer_text": "Some of the most feared warriors in history 1.Genghis Khan -   Between 1206 and his death in 1227, the Mongol leader Genghis Khan  conquered nearly 12 million square miles of territory\u2014more than any  individual in history. Along the way, he cut a ruthless path through  Asia and Europe that left untold millions dead, but he also modernized  Mongolian culture, embraced religious freedom and helped open contact  between East and West. Explore 10 facts about a great ruler who was  equal parts military genius, political statesman and bloodthirsty  terror.   He was responsible for the deaths of as many as 40 million people.While it\u2019s impossible to know for sure how many people perished during  the Mongol conquests, many historians put the number at somewhere around  40 million. Censuses from the Middle Ages show that the population of  China plummeted by tens of millions during the Khan\u2019s lifetime, and  scholars estimate that he may have killed a full three-fourths of  modern-day Iran\u2019s population during his war with the Khwarezmid Empire.  All told, the Mongols\u2019 attacks may have reduced the entire world  population by as much as 11 percent 2. Marcus Cassius Scaeva    Marcus Cassius Scaeva is probably the toughest Roman ever. He was a  decorated centurion in Caesar\u2019s army, who in his spare time, put his  life at risk training with professional gladiators.  During the Battle  of Dyrrhachium, fought between Julius Caesar and the army led by Gnaeus  Pompey, with the backing of the majority of the Roman Senate, Scaeva was  fighting in the front ranks as usual when he was shot in the eye.  The injury was severe, and would leave him permanently blind. Yet,  despite having a pretty bad case of arrow-shot-through-the-eye syndrome,  Marcus yelled a battle-cry, removed the arrow, and kept on fighting and  killing even more intensely. During the same battle, he was struck by  two more arrows (sources differ, but it is believed that one pierced his  throat and the other his knee), while hundreds of arrows bristled from  his shield. Marcus managed even under these conditions to hold the line  and keep fighting.  3. Melankomas Of Caria   Melankomas of Caria was an ancient boxer hailing from the area now  known as Turkey. Though it\u2019s not known if he ever held a sword, what we  do know is that he was never once touched by an opponent. An impressive  feat for a guy whose job is literally \u201cbeing punched in the face.\u201d  Melankomas\u2019 ability to guard his dome piece was legendary, with some  reports saying he could stand, completely still with his guard up for  two days at a time, presumably just to show the Grim Reaper what was up.By using a technique commonly known as \u201cbeing a cocky asshole,\u201d  Melankomas was the king of slipping punches. His entire tactic revolved  around deftly avoiding the blows of his competitors while maintaining an  iron defense. In his entire, undefeated career as a champion Olympic  boxer, Melankomas never threw a punch. Seemingly because he didn\u2019t need  to, since no one could touch him anyway.  4. Flamma -   Flamma, AKA \u201cThe Flame,\u201d was an ancient Roman gladiator, who knew the  importance of a bitchin\u2019 stage name, thousands of years before a guy  named Dwayne decided it\u2019d be cooler to call himself The Rock.Now the dream of almost every gladiator in history was to earn his  freedom, retire, and throw rocks at poor people. Note the use of the  word \u201calmost\u201d there, since Flamma only cared about one thing: fame.  Flamma earned his freedom four times! He vehemently refused to accept it  though, purely so he could keep stabbing people in the torso. Any way  you look at it, it takes pretty huge cojones to choose potentially being  stabbed to death over retirement. Kudos, Flamma.  5. Xiahou Dun    Xiahou Dun was not only a badass, but also a psycho of the highest  degree. This military general, who offered his services to warlord Cao  Cao in the late Eastern Han Dynasty, became a legend when, during a  battle in the late 190s, he was hit by a stray arrow and lost his left  eye.  In front of his amazed soldiers and his enemies alike, he pulled  out the arrow and swallowed his own eyeball. No one had ever seen anything like this ever before, and, fairly  enough, Dun was thereafter considered to be the ultimate badass of  China.   Following this incident, enemy armies were afflicted with fear  of \u201cBlind Xiahou, The One-Eyed Warrior.\u201d   6. Aristodemus   Aristodemus was one of the guys from the movie 300. In the film, he  was renamed Dilios, and was the guy who lost his eye and went back to  heroically rally the rest of the Spartan army. In reality, he was  shunned for refusing to die in battle like a man, when he lost his eye  due to a crippling infection. So the film got it half right.However, being disgraced lit a fire in Aristodemus\u2019 belly that could  only be quenched with the lung and brain matter of his enemies. In the  battle of Plataea, Aristodemus became a veritable whirlwind of death  when he embarked on a berserker-like suicide charge so ferociously  badass that the stubborn Spartans decided to posthumously forgive him,  and gave him a proper burial. Not bad for a guy with one eye and nothing  to lose.  7.  Cuauhtemoc  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tCuauhtemoc was elected as Emperor of the Aztecs while the city of  Tenochtitlan was being ransacked by Hernan Cort\u00e9s. Instead of fleeing,  Cuahtemoc decided to remain in the city, presumably because the massive  balls he had wouldn\u2019t fit through the front gate.  Upon assuming control  of his people, Cuauhtemoc promptly decided to make Cort\u00e9s\u2019 life as  difficult as possible, by turning his city into some type of Aztec  Stalingrad. Even after his city was racked by starvation, he tried to flee to the  countryside to get more soldiers  Even after being captured and  tortured, Cuauhtemoc refused to tell Cort\u00e9s or his men anything. Because  when you\u2019re the last representative of a great race of warrior people,  you can\u2019t flinch or cry on principle.  8.  Galvarino -   Galvarino, in a nutshell, was a the Chilean version of Wolverine, if  Wolverine was fueled by nothing but an intense hatred for everyone who  didn\u2019t have a gut full of knife wounds, and who strapped swords to the  stumps where his hands used to be.Galvarino totally did that. Maybe. You see, when he was  captured by Spaniards, they ordered his hands cut off so he could be an  example to his people. After Galvarino endured the torture without a  word, he was sent back to his people. This is where history gets fuzzy;  it\u2019s rumored that he then strapped knives to the stumps, and started  knife punching fools in the throat like it was a job. However, despite  this being approximately the most awesome thing in the history of  humankind, that fact is incredibly hard to find in any official document  related to his story.Still though, this was a guy who manned through having both of his  hands chopped off and, when asked what he wanted to do about it,  answered \u201ctear them apart with my teeth.\u201d Knife hands or not, that\u2019s  still one of the greatest lines ever uttered.  9. Agis III -    Chance are, you\u2019ve probably never heard of Agis III. Even though he  had one of the coolest last stands in the history of the recorded world,  Agis III is still widely forgotten by history, probably because he was  defeated another badass humbly known as Alexander the Great. Even though he was eventually defeated, Agis III ruled Sparta for  nine years, after the death of his father. He tried as hard as he could  to fight against the incoming menace that was Alexander the Great of  Macedonia, but wound up (like everyone else Alexander fought) on the  losing end. He fell in battle after being wounded several times to the  front of his body, then picked himself back up (bleeding heavily) and  held the pass by himself to give his men time to escape. People were so  afraid to come at him, this god of death on the battlefield, that he had  to be killed by a thrown javelin instead of a sword.  10. Count Roland  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tCount Roland is the unarguable response to all the nonsense about  French men not being courageous or capable fighters. The man was  literally unstoppable.  He was the best and first among the Twelve Peers  of Charlemagne. As we already know, Charlemagne was one of the greatest  generals of all time, and he picked the very best to surround him. That  alone made Roland a badass, but it pales in comparison to his deeds in  the Battle of Roncevaux Pass.  His heroism and incredible warrior skills during the fighting in the  Pyrenees in August of 778 made Roland an ultimate legend. Like a second  King Leonidas, Roland fought against thousands, having by his side at  one point only 300 of his men.  Even though Roland and every single one  of his Frankish warriors were finally killed, defeated by the Basques,  his last stand was so incredibly heroic that it was celebrated in the  11th century by one of the earliest surviving works of French  literature, the epic poem The Song of Roland.  11 Arminius -    Arminius was the very definition of a badass.  Also known as Hermann,  Arminius was a German tribal chief of Cherusci who gave the Romans the  beating of their lives.  The Roman Empire was still at its peak when  Arminius brutally smashed the Roman army at the Battle of Teutoburg  Forest, where he literally destroyed three Roman legions and their  auxiliaries.  Even though Arminius was eventually defeated (he was murdered by  rival Germanic chiefs), his victory was so impressive and so bloody,  that it had an incredibly long-term effect on both the ancient Germanic  tribes and on the Roman Empire.   The Roman Legions would never again  attempt to permanently conquer and hold Germania beyond the Rhine River.  12.  Lu Bu -    Lu Bu was the \u201cinvincible warrior\u201d from the Three Kingdoms period of  Ancient China, and one of the most feared and powerful warriors in the  history of the world.  Renowned and infamous throughout all of China,  the mere mention of his name was enough to send chills down the spine of  even the most veteran warriors.  Lu Bu was by all accounts a massive  man, possessing immense strength, mastery of archery and horsemanship  and incomparable hand-to-hand fighting prowess. Lu Bu was adopted into a noble family where he proved his worth on  the battlefield, but once the powerful warlord Dong Zhou offered him Red  Hare, the fastest horse in all of China, Lu Bu flipped out, chopped off  his adopted fathers head and began calling Dong Zhou papa. Paradise  didn\u2019t last for long, because when you\u2019re a maniacal killer who chops  his families heads off for horses, trouble seems to follow you. Lu Bu  began sleeping with Dong Zhou\u2019s most favorite and loved mistress, Diao  Chan. Apparently, sleeping with a woman he loved was one of Dong Zhou\u2019s  bug-a-boos, and he presumably freaked out on Lu Bu. Sadly, like all men  who attempt to yell at a treacherous killer, Dong Zhou ended up getting  his head cut off. Lu Bu then fled into the countryside with his own  personal army, and began killing pretty much anyone who shot him a look.    13  Miyamoto Musashi -    Miyamoto Musashi is without a doubt one of the finest swordsmen to  have ever lived. Over the course of his lifetime, Musashi, a samurai  from Japan, defeated over 60 people in life-or-death duels. These duels  were all against highly skilled warriors, and they ended highlander  style \u2013 there could only be one left alive at the end of each battle.  His first duel was perhaps the most remarkable, as he won it at the mere  age of twelve. His opponent was not only an adult, but a highly trained  samurai. To make the story even more bat-shit insane, his opponent had a  sharpened blade, while Musashi used a stick.From that point on, until he was twenty-nine years old, he fought in  over 60 more duels to the death and fought in six wars, often leading  his men into battle. This is why, although the number of duels fought  was 60, his total number of enemy kills is most likely much, much  higher. During all of this, he never received more than a scratch.  14  Tlahuicole    Despite having a name that was decided by throwing scrabble letters  to a sticky surface, Tlahucole didn\u2019t need people to be able pronounce  it. He only needed them to understand the concept of pure, unbridled  rage. Hailing from the equally-unpronounceable Tlaxcalan tribe,  Tlahuicole was a warrior of legendary stature. And I mean that quite  literally; the guy was so huge it\u2019s rumored that other, lesser men  couldn\u2019t even lift the weapons he used in battle.Though it\u2019s not clear how it happened,  Tlahuicole somehow ended up  living with an Aztec tribe, and realized that he could no longer go  home, since he\u2019d fraternized with the enemy. He asked the Aztec king for  a warrior\u2019s death, which he got and then some.  Tlahuicole was ordered  to stand on a giant stone platform while 8 of the Aztec\u2019s finest Eagle  Warriors attempted to kill him. Tlahuicole effortlessly slaughtered them  all, and injured an 20 additional men before he was killed. His heart  was immediately cut from his body where, according to legend that we  just made up, it exploded like a grenade.  15.  William Marshal \u2013 Knight Of Knights    William Marshal, also known as the Earl of Pembroke, is remembered by  history as one of the greatest knights to have ever lived. Now, a  knight is supposed to exemplify many qualities but the most important  one, by far, was the ability to murder-kill an enemy knight and steal  his shit.And that is was William did. Over and over and over and over again.  On his deathbed, the Earl noted to those nearby that he\u2019d bested at  least 500 other knights in one-on-one combat. Now you\u2019re probably  thinking that surely he could\u2019ve lied about that. Which is a good point,  but do remember that this was back in a time when people thought lying  made your penis fall off, so it\u2019s probably safe to assume he wasn\u2019t.  Besides, questioning his power is likely to earn you a mighty slap to  the mouth when you become a ghost, so don\u2019t bother.  16.  Yue Fei -    During his 20-year career kicking the shit out of anything and  everything in central China, soldier and 12th-century badass Yue Fei  personally fought in 126 battles, never lost a single engagement, rose  through the ranks from Private to Overall Commander of Imperial Forces,  invented a half-dozen styles of boxing and martial arts, and wrote a  bunch of flamingly-epic poetry about how he was going to drink the blood  of his slain enemies with a twist of lemon and then chase it with a  shot of Jager. Nowadays he is revered as a national hero of China, a paragon of  patriotic loyalty, and the ultimate symbol of honor, duty, and  face-obliterating medieval barbarian-quelling vengeance.  17.   Prince Rupert Of The Rhine -   Despite being born with a silver spoon in his mouth, more money than  you could force a servant to shake a stick at, and a hair cut that  wouldn\u2019t look out of place on a porn star, England\u2019s Prince Rupert had  only one dream: to join the military.Which he did, at age 14. Yep, at an age when most of us were still  trying to figure out how to beat Goro is Mortal Kombat, Rupert was  galavanting around Europe, slaughtering roundheads and capturing  whatever parts of England he damn well felt like. He actually kicked so  much ass that his enemies believed he had supernatural powers, when it  was pretty clear that he just really liked murder. 18. Khutulun -    Khutulun was the daughter of the Mongolian leader Kaidu, and the  niece of Kublai Khan. Khutulun was openly described as her father  Kaidu\u2019s favorite child, and was highly respected and adored by her  uncle, Kublai Khan. To put that into perspective, the most powerful man  in Asia and one of the most feared Emperors of all time thought she was  the sh*t.To further solidify her badass-ness, Khutulun was described by many,  including Marco Polo, as a superb warrior, horsewoman, and wrestler.  Being a Mongolian princess, she had many suitors. She told them that she  would marry them if they could defeat her in wrestling. If they didn\u2019t,  they would have to surrender a few of their horses. Khutulun received  nearly 10,000 horses by these means, and went on to train a horse army  so powerful it took over the world.Not really, but she probably could have. ",

            "answer_text": "For this, I will tell you a story\u2014a story about the most ferocious and deadly 21 warriors I have ever had the pleasure of studying. This is the modern Thermopylae, only better. It\u2019s lesser-known in the West because this battle did not involve Greeks\u2014it involved Indians. On September 12, 1897, twenty-one Sikh Indian soldiers would make a stand that would live on in history as one of the greatest battles ever fought.  The Battle of Saragarhi.  A bit of background The Sikhs were Indian warriors aligned with and under the command of the British. They were deadly, skilled, and ferocious in a fight.  In the 1890s, the British were trying to conquer Afganistan and it was becoming a severe challenge. As the Russians and Americans would learn, Afganistan is not a place easily conquered. A revolt breaks out towards the end of 1897 and Afgan tribesmen rally in the tens of thousands to the rebel banner. They begin to march towards British forts to push them out of their home. Soon a rebel army arrives at a series of British forts and the fight begins.   It\u2019s the morning of September 12, 1897, and the British see an army on the horizon. The British forces are locked away in Fort Lockhart and from there they see a massive army on the horizon\u2014numbering some 10,000-12,000. The British are dangerously outnumbered and they prepare for a siege. A signaling outpost some miles away, called Saragarhi, is manned by 21 Sikh warriors. The Sikhs are informed that an army numbering 10,000 is quickly approaching. The Sikhs request help, but the British inform them that they cannot assist, as they cannot leave the fort unguarded. The Sikhs could run or surrender\u2014the Afgan tribesmen would show them mercy. But the leader of these brave men, Ishar Singh, tells his men they will stay and fight. The board up the gate, get ammunition stockpiled, and prepare to defend their small compound from an overwhelming force. The Afgan army approaches and the fighting begins.  The Afghans send a massive charge to overwhelm the fort but disciplined and accurate rifle fire from the Sikh warriors is enough to break the charge and send the Afgan warriors running. A second charge appears. This time the Afghans come in even greater numbers. The Sikh fire is unable to break the enemy lines and before too long, the Afgan tribesmen are climbing over the walls. A tough melee fight ensues with rifle butts, swords, and bayonets. Again though the Sikhs hold, killing hundreds. They turn back the massive force and maintain control of the fort. By this point, the Afgan forces have taken significant losses, considering this is a lightly manned signaling post. But several Sikhs have died as well. Bhagwan Singh is the first to be killed in the fighting and his body is taken to the courtyard. Another warrior named Lal Singh is wounded and out of the fight. One thing to note\u2014this is all known not only from secondhand accounts but also the signalman, Gurmukh Singh. While all of this was happening he continued to send reports to the British at Fort Lockhart. Now the Sikhs are down to 18 fighters the battle continues.  The Afgan army offers terms of surrender. They offer wealth, safety, power, and whatever else the Sikhs could want if they will just lay down their arms. The Sikhs boldly refuse. The Afghans light fires to the hillside clouding everything in smoke. The signalman soon gets word that a formation of Afgan warriors is approaching the fort from the side, hidden by the smoke. It\u2019s too late\u2014the Afgan warriors are in the compound. Ishar Singh along with a few of his men charge the Afghans and another round of brutal hand-to-hand fighting breaks out inside the compound. The Sikhs are relentless and skilled, killing hundreds of attackers and holding their own despite being overwhelmed. The Afghan warriors keep coming, though, and the Sikhs are being worn down. Pretty soon the outer walls crumble and the Afghans capture that portion of the compound. Ishar Singh knows things are desperate. He orders his men back to the inner compound to mount a defense. He knows that if they turn their backs and run they will be cut down. In a moment of utter bravery, Ishar Singh orders his men back and then single-handedly charges the approaching Afghan army. He cuts down warrior after warrior with his sword and pistol, cutting through the ranks of the surprised Afgan army. After a few seconds, Ishar Singh is overwhelmed and killed\u2014but he has bought his men the time they needed to fall back.  The Sikhs are now defending their fallback point, but the situation is hopeless. The Afghans start chopping at the wooden gate with axes and swords. Before too long they break through and thousands of them come pouring into what remains of the compound. The Sikhs continue to fight bravely but hopelessly. At this point, the signalman Gurmukh Singh signals the British to ask permission to abandon his post and take up his rifle. The order is approved and he calmly puts away his signal gear, takes up his rifle, and fixes the bayonet. By now, he is the last living Sikh in the compound. The British look on as he moves to defend the door to the small building he was stationed in. The door breaks and enemy charges in. The British watch in awe as Gurmukh Singh cuts down one, then two, then three, and then finally eighteen Afghan warriors. The men retreat and Gurmukh Singh continues to hold the building. More charge in and he kills another twenty Afghans as the British cheer him on, watching his final battle from the fort using telescopes. Alone and cut off, Gurmukh Singh killed 40 ENEMY WARRIORS in only a few minutes. What a total and complete you-know-what. The Afghans are terrified by this. Unwilling to try and take the building again they set it on fire. As the building burns, Gurmukh Singh shouts his battle cry over and over again. \u201cBole so Nihal sat sri akal\u201d \u201cBole so Nihal sat sri akal\u201d \u201cBole so Nihal sat sri akal\u201d Shout aloud in ecstasy, true is the great timeless one.  The battle was over\u2014the compound was taken and the Sikhs had lost. Yet like Thermopylae and other hopeless battles, the deeds of these heroic and ferocious warriors live on in history as one of the great moments of bravery and valor. The 21 Sikhs had sold their lives at a high cost. While all 21 died, they took 1,400 enemy soldiers with them while injuring thousands more. Estimates from most sources list 600-1400 fatalities, with many more wounded. Either way, these 21 men took a heavy toll on their enemy. Every Sikh there that day killed 28-50 enemies. This is an insane feat and only shows how skilled and dedicated these men were. Instead of a paragraph about some thoughts I have, I think it only fitting to record the names of the brave 21 men so that we may all know their names as well as their timeless deeds.

            "answer_text": "Vlad the Impaler.  Vlad III spent much of his rule campaigning against the Ottoman Empire and its expansion. As the cognomen 'The Impaler' suggests, his practice of impaling his enemies is central to his historical reputation. During his lifetime, his reputation for excessive cruelty spread abroad, to Germany and elsewhere in Europe. The total number of his victims is estimated in the tens of thousands. The name of the vampire Count Dracula in Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula was inspired by Vlad's patronymic. Attila the Hun  Nearly conquered the late Roman Empire twice. Defeated dozens of roman legions with barbarian horseman. Shaka Zulu  He gathered the scattered barbarian Zulu tribes into a mighty nation. Through fierce training he forged one of the most powerful armies of Africa. With only primitive weapons he was able to forge tactics and strategies that were the match of modern empires of the 1800's. Hannibal of Carthage  He built up a massive mercanary army and defeated the Roman legions first in Gaul then exercised free reign in the Italian peninsula. He marched right up to the gates of Rome holding the entire empire in a state of paralyzing terror. Alexander the Great  While the west remembers him as the greatest conqueror in history, his legend in the middle east is of a devil. His march was feared by millions as his armies could only be stopped by his premature death. Blackbeard the Pirate  Though I don't think he counts as much as a good warrior because he didn't really serve anyone other than himself he was one of the most feared fighters on the high seas. And as a finale... The modern United States Navy S.E.A.L.  Why? Because at no other point in history has there been a single military unit capable of striking a surgically precise and massively lethal blow to any base, installation, unit or person anywhere on the entire planet. They are today's unit that instills fear and paranoia in every one of the United State's strategic enemies. Love them or hate them, you respect them.  Thanks for reading!

            "answer_text": "Some of the most famous people in history are those who are consideredgreat warriors, often (but not always) known for a particular battle. Here are ten of the greatest and most famous warriors in chronological order. 1. Leonidas I of Sparta (540-480 BC, reign 489-480 BC)  A hero-king of Sparta in Ancient Greece, also known as Leonidas the Brave, Leonidas I was the seventeenth king of Sparta from the Agiad line, and believed to be a direct descendant of Heracles \u2013 at least, that\u2019s how they explained his enormous strength and bravery! He is best known for leading the combined armies of the alliance of Greek city-states, around 7,000 men, against the Persians\u2019 second invasion in 480 BC at the Battle of Thermopylae, where the Greeks held off the massively larger Persian army (around 150,000) for a week before, betrayed by a local resident, they were defeated when the Persians outflanked them. Leonidas sent most of his army away then led the remainder, around 1,500 men, to guard the rear in one of histories great \u2018last stands\u2019. Leonidas and most of the remaining Greeks were killed but they succeeded in allowing the rest of the army to get away. The following year, a return engagement saw the Greeks soundly trouncing the Persians at the Battle of Plataea and ending their invasive tendencies once and for all. Well, at that time, anyway. 2. Alexander the Great (356-323 BC, reign 336-323 BC)  Alexander III of Macedon ruled his ancient Grecian state of Macedon for thirteen years, during which he built one of the ancient world\u2019s largest, albeit short-lived, empires and was one of the most successful military leaders in history, being undefeated in battle. He did have some benefits that probably helped get him started \u2013 he was tutored by Aristotle as a child, which will no doubt have given him exceptional abilities to think well, and he inherited from his father an already strong kingdom with a highly experienced army in place. Unfortunately, after his death his empire was torn apart again by civil wars that ended in a number of states ruled by the various surviving generals and Alexander\u2019s heirs. However, Alexander\u2019s legacy lives on \u2013 some 20 cities founded by him bore his name, notably Alexandria in Egypt; much of the Hellenistic civilisation grew out of his spreading Greek culture in the east, and his tactics are still taught in military academies around the world. 3. Hannibal Barca (247-183/2 BC)  Generally considered one of the greatest military leaders that ever lived, Carthaginian Hannibal was most famous for marching an army that included elephants over the Pyrenees and the Alps from Iberia into Italy at the beginning of the Second Punic war, and during the 15 years he occupied most of that country he converted many allies of Rome to his side by demonstrating his ability to determine strengths and weaknesses on both sides of a battle and direct the fighting towards his own strengths and his opponents\u2019 weaknesses. He was eventually defeated at the Battle of Zama by Scipio Africanus \u2013 because Scipio had studied Hannibal\u2019s tactics and used them against him! After the war Hannibal entered politics, but the reforms he succeeded in enacting were unpopular with the Carthaginian aristocracy and he fled into voluntary exile, where he remained until around 183/2, when he was betrayed to the Romans and poisoned himself rather than becoming their prisoner. 4. Spartacus (c 109-71 BC)  Spartacus, a Thracian gladiator, was one of five slave leaders who lead the uprising in the Third Servile War against the Roman Republic. Although details of his life are sketchy and surviving records often contradictory, all agree that he was (1) a former gladiator and (2) an exceptional military leader. Most agree that he fought as a Roman soldier but, having fallen from grace (perhaps by deserting) he was made into a slave and sent to be a gladiator, although some think he fought on the other side and was taken as a captive \u2026 then he plotted an escape with some other slaves and, although the plot was betrayed, succeeded in getting away, building an army and waging war on his erstwhile captors. His story has obviously caught the imaginations of many storytellers over the years, resulting in many films, books etc, but he and his fellow leaders have been portrayed as rather more altruistic than they actually were! According to the records that do exist, they committed plenty of atrocities themselves in the course of the fighting, and they never claimed to be trying to en 5. Gaius Julius Caesar (100-44 BC, reign 49-44 BC)  Best known as just Julius Caesar (both his father and grandfather were actually called Gaius Julius Caesar as well), this great Roman emperor was much more than just a military dictator who had an affair with the Egyptian Pharoah, Cleopatra. Among other things he was a great statesman who centralised the bureaucracy of his government and installed the Julian calendar on which was based the Gregorian calendar we use today, and also a notable author in the field of Latin prose. Unfortunately, of course, he never did actually resolve the political conflicts going on around him (he pardoned his enemies instead of getting rid of them \u2013 in retrospect apparently not a good idea) and as a result when things got so \u2018hot under the collar\u2019 that he was assassinated, around 60 people took part and he was stabbed 23 times. Interestingly, most reports say that he said nothing as it happened, with some claiming he said \u2018You too, child?\u2019 (in Greek) \u2013 but none claiming anything about Brutus. It\u2019s thought that Shakespeare perpetuated that one in his play simply because the phrase was popular when he wrote it! 6. Attila the Hun (?-453, reign 434-453)  Attila the Hun ruled the Huns from 434 till his death in 453, and was one of the Western and Eastern Roman Empire\u2019s most feared enemies. In Attila\u2019s time, his Hunnic Empire stretched from the Rhine river to the Ural, and the Danube to the Baltic Sea. The Bane of said Roman Empire\u2019s existence, he crossed the Danube twice to plunder the Balkans, crossed the Rhine to invade Gaul (modern-day France) and devastated the northern provinces of Italy; with the first he was defeated at Constantinople, the second at Aurelianum (now Orl\u00e9ans) and the third at Rome. The Romans were probably rather relieved that he died before he could try again with any of the other campaigns he had planned. 7. Saladin (1137/8-1193, reign 1174-1193)  Sal\u0101h ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb, known as Saladin, was the founder of his Ayyubid dynasty and first Sultan of Syria and Egypt. A kurdish muslim who led the muslim armies victoriously against the European Crusaders, at its height his empire included a large part of North Africa and a chunk of the Middle East, too. Born a commoner, he worked his way up the ranks of the government by military successes (helped by knowing the caliph, al-Adid). He became vizier, then on the caliph\u2019s death in 1171 he began to take over the government, at the same time personally leading major military campaigns that resulted in him being declared \u201cSultan of Egypt and Syria\u201d in 1175. Despite his warlike tendencies, his chivalrous and noble behaviour earned the respect even of the Christian Crusaders to whom he was a nemesis, and by the time he died he had given most of his wealth away to his subjects. 8. Richard the Lionheart  King of England for ten years, Richard I, known as the Lionheart, also ruled Normany, Aquitaine, Gascony, Cyprus, Anjou, Maine, Nantes and Brittany at various times (as Duke, Count, Lord or Overlord according to each area\u2019s preference). He led his own army from the age of sixteen, starting with putting down rebellions for his father and moving on to become the main Christian leader of the Third Crusade (against Saladin, see above). He was a pious hero who lived mainly in his dukedom in Aquitaine, France, using his kingdom merely as a source of money to support his armies, and he is one of the few English kings remembered mostly by a nickname rather than his number. 9. Genghis Khan (~1162-127, reign 1206-1227)  Genghis Khan was actually his title, not his name \u2013 he was born \u2018Temujin\u2019 \u2013 and he founded the Mongol Empire, later to become the largest empire ever known. He began by uniting a whole lot of northeastern Asia\u2019s nomadic tribes and then went on to conquer most of Eurasia, often helped by his habit of massacring the local people\u2019s wholesale. His sons and other descendants carried on what he had started, often including the massacres, thereby earning his empire a ferocious reputation. It is thought that, because of the size of his harem (around 2,000-3,000 women) and the fact that his sons had similar harems as rulers of their own kingdoms, around half of one percent of the entire current population of the earth may well be descended from this one man. 10. William Wallace (1270-1305)  Sir William Wallace was a landowner in Scotland who became \u2018Guardian of Scotland\u2019 and a great leader in the Scottish Independence Wars. He and Andrew Moray defeated the English at the 1297 Battle of Stirling Bridge, and he continued to lead Scottish armies against the English until he was captured in 1305 at Robroyston (near Glasgow) and hung, drawn and quartered by King Edward I in England for \u2018high treason\u2019. Since then he has become an icon, featuring in an epic poem (\u2018The Wallace\u2019 by Blind Harry, 15th Century), two literary works (by Sir Walter Scott and Jane Porter) and the 1995 Oscar-winning movie Braveheart, starring Mel Gibson \u2013 in a painted blue face.

            "answer_text": "To fully understand the most \u2018fearsome\u2019 warriors in the ancient world, you should probably understand each civilization for yourself, and make your own opinionated conclusion. The Romans Ever since their birth, the Romans have and most likely always will remain among some of the greatest warriors in all of history. However, one of their greatest feats were the Battle of Zama, in which the Romans won a decisive victory under Scipio Africanus. To understand how the Battle of Zama proves that the Romans were one of the best, you should understand how the Roman soldiers functioned. You had your everyday recruit, inexperienced, fresh, and typically peasants. Then, there was the middle class sort of soldier, which were usually lightly armed, could at least afford equipment, and usually semi-experienced. Then, there were the veterans. By far one of the greatest warriors ever, these men are perhaps the lone reason how the Romans managed to conquer most of the world. The legions mostly consisted of these veterans, making them nearly unstoppable from sheer experience and skill. Typically, the average legionary had strips of metal on their chest, red fabric shirts underneath, helmets designed to protect most of the head, and a standard legionary sword. These legions are perhaps the only reason why the Romans managed to dominate the Mediterranean, and win countless battles. By far, the Romans seem like the immediate runner up for 1st place, but what about other civilizations? The Persians Perhaps one of the greatest empires in history, the Persian warriors were, by definition, savagely collected warriors. Armed with short spears, light shields, and the incredibly dangerous composite bow, these Persians were incredible foot soldiers on the battle field. The Persians evolved mail armor, as well as the bronze helmet. They were incredibly advanced for their time, as they mastered the composite bow. What made the composite bow so deadly were the Persian fighting style, as well as the general quality of the bow itself. It usually was a combination of wood and other minerals. There are far other warriors, like the Spartans, the armies that served under Cao Cao, this is just a brief look over. You need to read into these themselves. I wrote this at school, so yeah. I hope this was helpful for how short it was! ",

            "answer_text": "If I have to choose I would choose Nepalese Gurkhas. During the 1800s they fought against east india company( british when they encroached India,)guns against khukuri(a type of knife), thousands against hundreds and still as a small country was able to protect their land against such a powerhouse. there are many legends about these warriors and the common thing between all was their patriotism, country before self. I get goosebumps reading their legends. During one of the war in Nalapani,even the woman and children played a vital role in it, it is recorded that women used to use their own body to cover the holes caused by the cannon and fought bravely against the british, if u have to name one of this legend, a well known figure would be Bhakti Thapa who at the age of 74 lead a troop of 400 hundred against thousands of british with guns and killed hundreds with khukuri(a type of knife)it is said he fought even when he was shot twice and finally died from a cannon shot at point blank range.There are many such heroic acts recorded in the history , They were even coined by the british as \u201c Bravest of the braves\u201d Moving foreword in the timeline, since the british couldn\u2019t defeat them they choose to work together with them, and during the second world war it prove their choice to be wise, field marshal Sam Manekshaw even said \u201c if a man ever says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or a gurkha\u201d. There are many legends of gurkhas during the second world war, some of the most famous one are of :Rifleman Lachhiman Gurung with only two others fought against 200 japanese who opened fire, they threw grenades at them which lachhiman caught at threw them back, when one of them exploded on his arm. His face, body, and right arm and leg were badly wounded still with his left arm shot at them killing 31 and defeating them. Bhanubhakta Gurung, who captured a bunker almost all by himself, under heavy fire from machine guns, grenades, mortars, and a sniper. The details, u should see for yourself, even action flims could loose against him. Rifleman Ganju Lama withstood a broken left wrist and wounds to his right hand and leg to take on three Japanese tanks in World War II. There are other fierce gurkha such as gaje ghale, Rambahadur Limbu etc which if your interested u should check it out. I found out about them during my English presentation where each had to do a country and I was tasked with Nepal. My respect for them have never been higher than it was when researching for their history. But the legends of gurkha\u2019s doesn\u2019t end there but even in this , modern era Nepalese have proven that the gurkhas blood still runs in them, In Afghanistan in 2010, Dipprasad Pun, single-handedly fought off 30 Taliban soldiers. the attackers came at the complex from all sides with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s. It took less than an hour for Pun to kill them all. The Gurkhas leave no man behind. When a squad of troops was ambushed out in the open in Afghanistan in 2008, one soldier, Yubraj Rai, was hit and fatally wounded. But Captain Gajendera Angdembe and Riflemen Dhan Gurung and Manju Gurung carried Rai across 325 feet of open ground under heavy fire. At one point, one of the soldiers resorted to using both his own rifle and Rai's rifle at the same time to return fire on the enemy. In 2011, 35-year-old retired Gurkha Bishnu Shrestha was riding a train in India when 40 robbers stopped the train and began stealing passengers' belongings. Still carrying his kukri knife, the Gurkha took on the robbers, themselves armed with knives, swords and pistols. Shrestha managed to kill three robbers and injure eight others, which persuaded the other robbers to flee. The retired soldier also saved another passenger from rape. I read a few interviews of retired old gurkha, some of the things they said: \u201cIt was better to die than be a coward.\u201d \u201cIn the chaos, I found myself all alone. I didn\u2019t know where other friends, commanding officers or senior officers went. I didn\u2019t know where to go and what to do at that time. Nobody dared to come where I was. All of them were dead. I then thought to myself that, rather than die later I will live for now. \u201c \u201cI still can\u2019t say that I hated my captors. They were just men. Some, like the Captain, were good men.\u201d The Gurkhas were know for being ferociously loyal, while stroked fear into their enemy with just a mention of their name. ",

            "answer_text": "    For me the most scary was The Islamic Assasins Order from Persia and Syria. Throughout their 300 years of existence, the Assassins managed to take out many Crusader leaders, sultans, viziers, and even two Caliphs.They terrorized the whole middle east .Taking many countries.Small highly effective, fanatic killing machine. They end came when they were trying to kill the great Khan of the mongol empire(They tried it 30 times and that is a reason why mongols were soo paranoid about security what marco polo and other travellers realized).The crusaders feared them so much that the assasin word was incorporated to the european languages. The mongols hords captured the fortress of the assasins leader -The Great Lord of the Mountain or called sometimes The Old Man and the assasins had to escape, sprayed ,regroup, came back and kicked out the overhelming mongols armies back. Mongols came back with they whole power and it was the end. The assasins left the mountain forever and became mercenaries etc . They were very scary ,secretive dudes .Imagine that for the most of the time of they existence nobody knew where was they main fortresse, nobody. The only thing what they were doing was just killing for islam and money. Sort of islamic ninja army. They inspired the assasin creed game.They loved operating in the night using unconventional methods of killing.There are legends that some of them ended up in japan and teached locals the secrets of the stealth killings.Actually they looked and worked just like ninjas but before ninjas appeard in japan. Al Queda and Isis took some inspiration from the assasins tactics (spraying terror and fear etc)but they are waay less succesfull and trained.    The Alamut castle the Assasins head quoter before and now. Northern Iran, veery high in the mountains ,very isolated and hard to access place. No better place for defence.There is just one tiny hidden path climbing the whole way up.It took the giant mongol army the whole winter to take it and the Assasin group was tiny and still most of them managed to escape .Everyone afraid Mongols but Mongols afraid the Assasins the most.

            "answer_text": "Every region, culture around the world has produced feared warriors and leaders in their history. This response may go long if I have to go through all of them and make a list of such warriors from different regions. So I apologize in advance if someone think there is sort of bias in my answer. The first in my list is Salah ad-Din Yusuf aka Saladin. Saladin was first Sultan of Egypt and Syria and founder of Ayyubid Dynasty. Saladin is best remembered in the history for snatching the victory in 3rd Crusade where he defeated the likes of Richard I of England, Phillip II of France and Fredrick I of Barbarosa and captured Jerusalem. Despite rivalry, both Richard I of England and Saladin maintained very formal and warm relation even in the battlefield. Saladan earned respect in both Islamic and Christian history due to his strong character and esteem values.  My other pick is Chandragupta Maurya, the greatest Indian king + warrior India has ever produced. He was student of Chanakya who played vital rule in his upbringing as a leader as well as warrior in Thakshashila. Chandragupta later conquered all big dynasties of Ancient India in his era and merged into his territory. Chandragupta was so powerful and ruthless where he defeated Greek King Seleucus I Nicator, regained some parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan in Ancient India which were captured during Alexander\u2019s invasion.  Here comes Ashoka, grandson of Chandragupta Maurya and one of my favorite king + warrior from Ancient India. He is best known in the history due to his ruthless behavior in the battlefield and hunger for success. He earned hard victory in the battle of Kalinga where over 150k soldiers/people were killed. During his reign, Mauryan Empire was one of the greatest in Ancient India and one of the largest in the world.  The next in my list is Rajendra Chola I of Chola Empire to whom I considered as one of the most influential King + warrior of his era who is largely forgotten. Chola Empire was considered to be one of the most powerful maritime empires of India. He included Sri Lanka, Maldives, Srivijaya (Malaysia), Southern Thailand and Indonesia in his territory. He gets the credit of spreading Hinduism in Southeast Asia.  Tariq ibn Ziyad, a Berber Commander who is best known for conquest of Hispania between 711\u2013718 A.D that led the foundation of Omayyad Dynasty. He was so fearless that he ordered his army to burn their boats at seashore of Gibraltor. The place of Gibraltor is Arabic acronym of \u201cJabal ul Tariq\u201d that was named after him.  Last but not least, Khalid Ibn Waleed one of my most favorite of all time. Khalid never lost a battle being a Commander. He was very lethal and never lost in single duels as well. Khalid is best remembered and led those Islamic forces who defeated Sassanids (Persian Empire) and Byzantines (Roman Empire) when both of them were one of the greatest empires of the world.  ~MAK Credits & References: Muhammad Aamir Khokhar's answer to Who is the greatest soldier in history?

            "answer_text": " Temujin aka Genghis Khan, \u201cI am the punishment of God...If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.\u201d The man who was probably responsible for more  deaths than any other historical figure in human history. The Mongol Empire is estimated  to have conquered 22% (33 Million Kilometres) of the world's land area. The British Empire at its  peak is estimated to have control of 22.3% (33.2 Million Kilometres) of the world land area. [7] The  British did this in the 17th century with far more advanced naval transportation, Cannons and Muskets. Genghis conquered the same in the 12th  century A.D with nothing but pure, unceasing hatred of humanity. He is estimated to have conquered 4 times the land mass as that of Alexander of Macedonia [1].    [5] * Genghis Khan died in the year 1227, the rest were conquered by his 3rd son \"\u00d6gedei Khan \" [6] His death toll was so high that he is estimated to have removed 700 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere by killing 40 million people in his lifetime. That is the same amount of carbon released in the atmosphere from global petrol use. The number of casualties inflicted by Genghis Khan and his band of murdering psychos is only rivaled by the death toll in World War 2 and the famine during the Mao Zedong regime. [2]. Since, the army of Genghis Khan was relatively small in comparison to the area that they conquered and not many could be left behind to garrison defensive troops to guard the city, they would regularly butcher the entire able-bodied male population of city except the highly skilled engineers and craftsmen. A few would be left alive to run to the next town to spread the tales of massacre. This psychological warfare tactic would ensure that many cities well aware of the Mongolian genocidal tendencies would surrender peacefully . This usually resulted in the ruler of the city and his family put to death and the civilian population spared. This, however was a very risky maneuver as the Mongols considered resistance by a single individual as sufficient cause for resistance and would revert back to their recreational mass murdering, mass plundering and mass rape. [4] \u201cThe  greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy, to drive him before you,  to see his cities reduced to ashes, to see those who love him shrouded  in tears, and to gather into your bosom his wives and daughters.\u201d [4] To put his unrelenting need for death, rape and pillaging in perspective, let us take the destruction of Nishapur in Persia (Modern day \"Iraq\"). Genghis Khan's favourite son-in-law \"Toquchar\" was killed by an arrow fired by a Nishapurian. His daughter was heart-broken and to soothe her raging heart, Genghis Khan being the loving, doting father that he was, ordered his son \"Tolui\" to raze the entire city to the ground, all of its 1.7 million inhabitants including the dogs, cats, cattle, pigs and goats put to the death. This too was not enough for his unhinged daughter, she wanted to make sure that no one was left alive, she wanted all the corpses beheaded and stacked like a Pyramid, this took almost ten days to accomplish. [3]    Not only was Genghis, a bonafide Grade \"A\" blood thirsty psycho, he was also unrivalled lover of women. Not content with mass butchering and plundering after overtaking a city, the Mongols would also indulge in their favourite pastime, mass rape. According to sources, as soon as a city was conquered, every beautiful women in the city would be rounded up and presented to the Khan to choose, the rest would be split between the soldiers to have their way. It is estimate that as much as 16 million people (0.5% of the world population) are descendants of him, according to a 2003 study. [3]  Timur, the founder of the Timurid dynasty and the great-great grandfather of Babur of the Mughal Empire were descendants of Genghis Khan. [5] * The accurate amount of death toll inflicted by the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan is fiercely debated by Historians. Some historians hold that the figures are highly exaggerated, some by the Mongols themselves to instill dread and fear into the enemies and future generations alike.

Whilst many people think he was a myth a seriously believe he was a real person, not a demi-god of course, he was not Sea-Godess Thetis\u2019 son, but still, he was a great warrior, just like Prince Hector and Odysseus and Eudoros his captain, one of the leaders of the Myrmidons and Ajax well both of them, and Menelaus, too. I believe Alexander the Great was a great warrior too, aspiring to be like his hero Achilles. Some recent warriors from the 16th century. Reading someone else\u2019s answer about a man who was a samurai and had his first victory at the age of 12 reminded me of a famous Hungarian poet and warrior who did the same: The scenario: the country is torn by the Ottoman and the Habsburg and poor Hungarians trying to defend their country from them, raids and fight are of everyday matter and this man was trained by his noble father from the age of 8 to be a warrior when out one day at the age of 12 he meets Turks who want to kill them and he challenges the Turk to a duel, at which he is laughed at, not long, for he kills the man and earns the respect of both Hungarians and Turks. His name is B\u00e1lint Balassi. Now that I am at our history I remembered another feared warrior B\u00e1lint T\u00f6r\u00f6k in Kuruc times, he was so feared by the Ottoman that he had to be deceived into a negotiation for his queen Isabella going there without arms, and taken captive to Constatinople until the end of his life, because they could not kill him or defeat him in normal battles.

Which the Greeks, Romans, Germans and other warriors had in abundance. However, for sheer fierceness, one would have to argue in favor of four distinctly different peoples and races. #1 would be the Vikings. A drugged up race of men called beserkers would cause people to flee for miles inland if just one of their \u201clongships\u201d were sighted off the coast. Not only were they huge and tall, but without any sense of mercy or compromise. #2 would be the Aztecs. A very fierce race seeking not just to kill but also to capture people and subject them to the most hideous means of torture and sacrifice. Their reputation alone caused many nearby peoples to greatly fear and despise them. no one in their right mind ever wanted to be captured or taken prisoner by Aztecs. #3 would be the Zulu warriors of Shaka Zulu. Wave after wave of these tall and fierce warriors would attack far superior armed British soldiers and not fail to advance despite terrific attrition. #4 would be the fast moving highly mobile horsemen of the Mongols. Men who were practically raised on their horses were known to completely destroy entire civilizations and cities that resisted them. The cruelty of the Mongols and their fierce renown often caused cities and armies to completely capitulate without any battle ever taking place. One could also make a sound argument for the Apache under the leadership of Geronimo. No American soldier ever wanted to get captured by them and had to always be willing to die in confronting these unbelievably clever and definitely mean native warriors of the American southwest. ",

(Sherden warrior. Painting by Christos Giannopoulos.) In many ways the story of the Sherdens mirrors that of the British army Gurkhas of our own times. Just like with the Gurkhas who were originally enemies of the British so were the Sherdens enemies of the Egyptians and just as it was with the British who finally defeated the Gurkhas in 1816 after an extremely heroic resistance the British impressed by the Gurkha fighting abilities and courage recruited them into their own army, so too was it with the Egyptians and Sherdens. Originally one of the Sea Peoples like the Philistines and Phoenicians who ravaged the Mediterranean like Vikings in centuries to come would ravage Europe. An inscription by Ramesses II (1279- 1213 BC) on a stele from Tanis which recorded one of the Sherden pirates' raids and subsequent defeat, speaks of the constant threat which they posed to Egypt's Mediterranean coasts: \u201cThe unruly Sherden whom no one had ever known how to combat, they came boldly sailing in their warships from the midst of the sea, none being able to withstand them.\u201d  (Egyptians in battle with Sherdens raiders, painting by Giuseppe Rava.) However though the Sherdens were defeated the Egyptians were so impressed by their courage and skill that Ramses II started to recruit Sherdens into the Egyptian army and in time the Sherdens would act as bodyguards for the pharaohs.  (Members of Ramesses II's Sherden personal guard in a relief in Abu Simbel.) Unfortunately though to the passage of 3,200 years of history little knowledge has come down to us about how the Sherdens were organized, trained and of their fighting style but to have impressed the Egyptians as they did they must have been formidable indeed. We can tell though what they looked like from wall paintings and carvings found on Egyptian buildings and steles.Even their origins are a mysterious, several places have been suggested from Anatolia to Greece and the ionian Islands.  One notable item of clothing were their helmets which made them conspicuous as their helmets with horns with a ball projecting from the middle were easily identifiable.  (Painting by Angus McBride)  (A reinactor dressed as a Sherden. These fearsome warriors were well equipped for the time, those swords were rare the axe type weapon was far more common. Though this man is barefoot, Sherdens most commonly wore sandals like the one pictured below)  ",

            "answer_text": "The Maniati, heirs to the Spartans. To illustrate this I\u2019ll relate a battle between hardened Ottoman soldiers and Maniati old men and women. During the Greek war of independence was fought the Battke of Diro. During the Battle of Vergas, Pasha Ibrahim decided to attack the Maniots from the rear. His plan was to send a small fleet with a 1500 soldiers to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which would cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas as well as demoralizing them. He would then be able to attack the Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. On the 23 June, he sent a small fleet carrying 1,500 to land at the Bay of Diros and to capture Areopolis. As they disembarked, at Diro, alarm bells summoned 300 women and old men who were harvesting the crops in the fields to the Bay. When the women and old men saw the invaders, they fell upon them with their scythes and other harvesting tools. The Egyptians were forced back to a fortified position on the beach where they could be supported by their ships. As the women and old men were besieging the Egyptians aid came from other villages. On the 26, the surviving Egyptians were rescued by Ibrahim's fleet from the beach and those who were not lucky had to swim to the ships or be killed by the Maniots. This battle was costly for Ibrahim as he lost 1,000 men. if the women and old men fought like that what did the men fight like? Like Spartans of old. A force of 2500 Maniati defended against an army of 7500 Ottomans. Once the defense was successful the Greeks actually attacked and drove Pasha Ibrahim and his army out of Mani. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I think it goes without saying that pinpointing one man as the most skilled warrior in the history of the world is very much impossible. Fact is that the greatest fighters and capable warriors were usually not the men we read about. We read about generals and kings, who although often active in combat and skilled because of their superior training, were likely not the killing machines you are looking for. Picking a warrior here is a very subjective thing indeed, but I\u2019ll offer you one of my favorite ones. There were many like him, but he achieved something special and that\u2019s why I think he deserves to be mentioned. He was in fact a very political figure and a man of great importance (which is why we are familiar with him). The man I speak of is Marcus Claudius Marcellus (268 - 208 BC). He was a Roman politician, a five time consul, and an exceeding military commander. He was active in the First and Second Punic War, and he was in charge of the attack that after a long siege finally brought Syracuse under Roman control. But what he is most famous for is the victory in the Battle of Clastidium (222 BC). The battle was a part of war between the Roman Republic and the Celtic tribes of northern Italy. In that battle Marcellus accomplished something that only two other men officially ever did during the life of the Western Roman State (which is roughly 1200 years). He managed to kill the enemy general (Viridomarus) in single combat and claim spolia opima, which was effectively the armour and gear of the slain general (luxurious and incredibly valuable, no doubt), while also the highest possible honorific title a general could attain. The only other two instances of this occuring date back to 752 BC when Romulus supposedly did the same in the war with Caeninenses and the second to an unspecified date during the 5th century BC in the time of the Roman Kingdom by Aulus Cornelius Cossus. This is of course only my opinion concerning the greatest warrior, but I really wanted to introduce a truly underappreciated Roman warrior, who more than proved himself to the Republic and the military world.

            "answer_text": "Have to agree with Amy Robinson the Mongol's had a pretty high fear factor. A surprising number of Persian and Central Asian cities surrendered without a fight just based on the Mongols reputation preceding them. Talk about street cred.  The success of Mongol tactics hinged on fear: to induce capitulation amongst enemy populations. Although perceived as being bloodthirsty, the Mongol strategy of \"surrender or die\" recognized that conquest by capitulation was more desirable than being forced to continually expend soldiers, food, and money to fight every army and sack every town and city along the campaign's route. The Mongols frequently faced states with armies and resources much greater than their own - and simply invading everyone was out of the question ... Thus whenever possible, by using the promise of wholesale slaughter as well as the deed, Mongol forces made efficient conquests ...  The linchpin of Mongol success was the widespread perception amongst their enemies, that they were facing an insurmountable juggernaut that could only be placated by surrender.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_under_the_Mongol_Empire ",

I cant find other soldiers that can compare to heroic bravery of Armenian fedayees.    I will tell you why. They were always OUTNUMBERED, they fought with lack of equipments, supplies etc. They fought against damn powerful Ottoman Empire.

            "answer_text": "Some of the answers posted here confuse warriors with commanders. A feared commander was not necessarily a feared warrior. Even more so since, historically, commanders of the Orient preferred to stay behind their troops, directing their movements, instead of getting into the heat of the fight in their first ranks. If we are talking about a truly feared commander/warrior, my first pick would be Prince Sviatoslav of Kiev (reign: 945 - 972). I won't go into extensive writing about him. Just check out a couple of good sources:Sviatoslav I of KievSviatoslav I of Kiev If we are talking about warriors in general, I would agree with those who picked up the Mongols and the Vikings. Both had a reputation for cruelty and were feared for that reason. In reality, the Vikings were truly fearless and much better warriors than the Mongols. Despite their small numbers, they pillaged and conquered great portions of land in Europe. By the way, Prince Sviatoslav of Kiev mentioned above was of the Viking descent. ",

            "answer_text": "The modern soldier, without a doubt.  Swedish soldiers on patrol in Afghanistan Throughout history, technology has been a vital part of warfare, and we, naturally, currently have the most dangerous weapons to date. Never in the history of the world have we had the means to kill as easily as now.  Swedish soldiers being instructed during the exercise Aurora 17 But it\u2019s not just about technology. It\u2019s also about teaching practices, command structures and culture. In modern armies, we have well educated and very specialized soldiers and officers fit for every job required to run million-men armies effectively, allowing units of all sizes to operate independently within their given orders. The few times something even remotely similar happened in history it has been seen as revolutionary and rarely replicated, and now it\u2019s a standard. I believe that if you took a high standard modern army from today and placed it at any time in history and gave it time to retrain to the weapons of that age, it would do amazing. Because we are scientific, rational and have such good organizational skills. ",

I\u2019ll recount one and you can find another nine here. 10 Stories That Prove Gurkhas Are the Fiercest Fighters on the Planet During the Second World War in Burma, Rifleman Lachhiman Gurung was given the duty to man, along with two of his comrades, the most important forward post of his regiment. Everything hinged off this position and he was made aware that the entire regiment relied on his unit holding this position for their complete defense to be maintained. Soon the Japanese attacked their outpost with a rain of Grenades. Each grenade that fell into his trench Rifleman Gurung picked up and threw back at the attacking Japanese. Soon one grenade dropped short and as he climbed up out of his position it exploded, seriously wounding his comrades and blowing parts of his right hand, leg and face away. The Japanese troops then tried to overrun his position through weight of numbers, but Rifleman Gurung calmly returned fire, continually reloading and firing with his left hand. Despite his wounds and the weight of numbers, Rifleman Gurung managed to remain at his post, holding off continuous frontal assaults by the Japanese until in shock they paused. When finally relieved, four hours later, his comrades counted 87 Japanese bodies in the vicinity, of which 31 were directly in front of Rifleman Gurung\u2019s position. He was awarded the highest decoration in the British Army, The Victoria Cross. ",

If the reports are true, he is the deadliest soldier in US history, and in the history of modern warfare. He has claimed to have killed 2,746 enemy soldiers during his time in the Middle East. 121 of these are said to be via sniping. He would count each person downed from their rifles sticking up and the visible bodies. There has been speculation as to the accuracy of these numbers, however; a lot coming from fellow soldiers who question his legitimacy. For instance, some of his kills may have been counted among suicide attacks. Regardless, the US soldier has seemingly unquestionably killed many, many enemies. Gurkha  Originally from Nepal, these reckless warriors caught the eye of the British Empire during the East India Company\u2019s invasion of Nepal in 1814. Impressed with their skill and courage, the British offered them the chance to fight for them. Gurkhas have since fought for numerous countries (including the United States) in multiple conflicts (including both World Wars). ",

            "answer_text": "depends on who you\u2019re talking about. Up until the 19th century warriors would\u2019ve very rarely been fearful of facing another warrior in combat more than any other one. Most people back then had a strong belief that this existence was merely a side note in their eternal life and they did not fear death like we do today. Second they lived by a code of honor that would\u2019ve forbade them from making what we would today consider a rational decision like running away. That said Atilla of the Huns was known to strike a real fear in the Germanic tribes east of the Rhine as well as the Romans in both the west and the east. You could make a real argument that Alexander III of Macedon(Alexander the Great) won most of his victories after Guagamela before they even started. Not until he ran into the Pauravans of the Punjab region of India, did he meet a foe that wasn\u2019t convinced they were going to lose before stepping on the field with Alexander. Hannibal of Carthage made Romans incredibly fearful. Marcus Scipio made Carthage tremble. the list goes on and I haven\u2019t even really gotten to the eastern side of the world. It is very hard to quantify fear. There have been tens of thousands of great warriors that instilled real panic in the populations they faced ",

The Roman legions between the 1st BC and the 2nd century AD were a ruthless war machine: the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar caused about 800,000 deaths among fighters and civilians.

Infantry. Without a doubt Maori. The taiaha was a fearsome weapon in the right hands. The Brits once sponsored an exhibition where a taiaha expert was matched against their army's best swordsmen. He won easily. Hampered mainly by their lack of metallurgy though. Cavalry. Here's where it gets a little blurry. I probably go for the Mongol warrior. But eventually he becomes a soldier. Similarly the European man at arms or knight. Eventually they became mostly mercenaries who fought for pay. I might put a word in for the Native North American, who someone described as the best light cavalry n the world \u2013 particularly if they had firearms. ",

The empire they created was vast and their control over it was unprecedented up to that point. The Maori of New Zealand displays prior to battle included facial gestures meant to promise to eat their vanquished foes, whether they actually did so is another matter, but if they did that would be very ferocious. One needs to recall that war is killing and escaping not being killed and people will use any means that they can find to do both. Usually it was people who felt the most vulnerable who fought the most ferociously. The small units that would strike small detachments of larger foes and retreat into sanctuaries often would leave no survivors and sometimes would dismember corpses to induce terror. ",

They were the finest light cavalry the world has ever known and in Texas the old men still call a moon so bright you could ride a pony at full gallop across the prairie a Comanche Moon. ",

Finally up to eight units formed the brigade of Gurkhas in the British army, fighting through two world wars and many actions before that. They also fought in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s. Gurkhas man a special unit of the Singapore police department. As the Japanese marched down through Malaya and the Malay Peninsula in World War II to capture British \u2018Fortress Singapore', Gurkhas were described by British soldiers who were there as going out at night behind Japanese lines with only a loin cloth like garment and their massive hacking style knife.

After the war was declared over by the United States in 1902, Sakay continued resistance and the following year became President of the Republic of Katagalugan. This guy fought and led guerilla armies against 2 world powers Spain and America.  With nothing but a combination of captured and crudely improvised weapons.  For 5 years US Army forces chased him all over Luzon Island, yet they never captured him.   While on the run General Sakay planned to kidnap President Theodore Roosevelt's daughter Alice Roosevelt Longworth, while she was visiting American troops in the Philippines.  In exchange for Philippine independence from US. In the end the American Colonial govt. had to lure him down from his mountain hideout by promising him amnesty and inclusion in the civilian government.  Only to have him arrested as a bandit and executed as a criminal.   ",

In terms of World War II, the German Army,SS, Fallschirmjager(paratroopers), Kriegsmarine(Navy), Royal Air Force, SAS, Soviet Army, and U.S. Army Rangers also come to mind. In later wars and conflicts I would pick the Israeli Army, Vietcong, North Vietnamese Army,Australian SAS, and Spetsnaz (Russian Special Forces).There are many others but these are the ones that come to mind.

They did so without any advantage in weaponry, numbers, technique, and with generals who were mediocre at best, simply bec ause man for man they were superior to their foes. As to the Mongols of Genghis Khan and the Macedonian Army of Alexander the Great, outside of being superb warriors, they had the advantage of superior organization and brilliant generals. Finally the GREATEST SOLDIERS the world has ever seen were the British , French and German soldiers who fought in World War one. Only they would have obeyed ,often foolish orders requiring them to advance into incredible curtains of fire, knowing it was almost certain death., and then remain in the trenches in the most abominable conditions for years out of a sense of duty, discipline and patriotism. Unfortunately they were lions led by donkeys. ",
