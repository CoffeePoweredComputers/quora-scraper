However, I see that the question I was originally asked was how much would I pay for the narration of a book, which is completely different. That would presumably mean turning a printed book into an audiobook. For those, I generally split the proceeds 50/50 with the reader; I\u2019m too cheap to pay anything up front, but Audible\u2019s ACX service is happy to do an even partnership. ",

The subject of paying for a book\u2019s summary is an entirely different subject. I paid nothing for the narration of my books. That is, nil, zip, $0.00. The publisher paid. I was paid for that publisher to license the rights to have my books narrated. ",
