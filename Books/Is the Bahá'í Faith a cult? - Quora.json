            "answer_text": "No. However, there is a problem with the concept of covenant-breaking, which no longer seems appropriate in the current context and has been used to silence any internal dissent within the Baha\u2019i Faith. Although the notion of covenant-breaking has produced some cult-like aspects in Baha\u2019i practice, a cult generally is hard to get out of. Leaving the Baha\u2019i Faith is easy. Nevertheless, for those who\u2019ve been forced out or forced into compliance concerning their silence on the many failures and abuses of the Baha\u2019i Administrative Order\u2014not horrible abuses like the cover-up of sexual abuse, but abuses of self-harming actions on part of the Administrative Order, itself, and the virtual coup of the liberal faction (often erroneously conceived as a conservative faction) within the Baha\u2019i Administrative Order \u2026 To be a Baha\u2019i and hold a position of influence in society at large, or within the Baha\u2019i Administration Order is to have to limit your thoughts to the party line, in just the same way as members of the Chinese Communist Party do. Now, having said that let me also concede that on the other hand threading the needle between the overt conformity of a political organization such as the CCP and the modern idolatry of worshiping at the altar of individual autonomy is a tricky business under the best of circumstances. Nevertheless, there are many events in recent Baha\u2019i history that suggest that out of fear of losing the appearance of cohesion\u2014Baha\u2019is are terrified of factionalism\u2014the Administrative Order has overreacted causing many of it\u2019s most prominent members to leave. This has also happened out of cronyism, conspiracy, and the prejudices of individual Persian Baha\u2019is. To be clear it doesn\u2019t appear that any of those involved necessarily have bad intentions, outside of simple self-interest. Nevertheless, in the effort to protect the faith it does appear that the very life is being strangled from it. Along these lines, it seems that there is something seriously wrong with how the Baha\u2019i Administrative Order has developed. All of the elected Universal House of Justice members now come from the same single Baha\u2019i institution, i.e. the International Teaching Center. What appears to have happened is that a culture of self-insular belief has caused the faith to stall, and anybody who speaks out about this within the Baha\u2019i faith is silenced (it may be that before the Baha\u2019i Faith starts growing again it will have to virtually collapse). In this sense then it does admittedly seem cult-like but only because it\u2019s a religion. Most people who say the Baha\u2019i Faith is a cult wouldn\u2019t say that the Democrat party in the U.S. or the CCP is a cult (although the latter literally is a cult)? This same process of the closing down of the diversity of thought can be seen in all them. In this sense, the danger of being declared a covenant-breaker (despite its 19th century, fundamentalist like language) is not any different than becoming a persona non grata in the modern Democratic party, you\u2019re going to lose a great many friends, acquaintances, business contacts and the like\u2014hell, it may even cost you your marriage. In China, you could be prosecuted for some made-up crime, jailed and sometimes although this rarely happens to politicians even executed. Along the lines of the last statement. the term cult also isn\u2019t necessarily pejorative. Again, the CCP is literally a cult\u2014alright bad example as that only reinforces the pejorative connotations. However, it\u2019s just that most cults in the modern era have had tended toward certain negative characteristics, so the term\u2019s usage has changed in some contexts to reflect this. However, this isn\u2019t as helpful as it might first appear when conceptualizing religious practices, as all religions really start out as cults. For example, Christianity was once a Jewish cult\u2014and Judaism, itself, literally began as the cult of Abraham (every one of Abraham\u2019s family including the servants had to be circumcised after Abraham). In a similar way, the Babi religion could be called an Islamic cult. At this point, some readers may wonder how I know so much about the Baha\u2019i Faith outside of just the study of religion more generally. Well, I\u2019ve had close relationships with a lot of Baha\u2019is over the course of my life that began with one particular very close Baha\u2019i friend in my youth. Now, this person is a very model of sober New England pragmatism. He\u2019s always been as mature and level headed as a person could be. However, I remember this one time in particular when I brought up Juan Cole, a very prominent former Baha\u2019i and secular academic. Now Juan Cole was never declared a covenant-breaker or otherwise officially censored by the Baha\u2019i Faith, but you wouldn\u2019t know that from my friend\u2019s irrational animosity towards the mere mentioning of his name. It\u2019s important to note here that according to Juan Cole, he was threatened with being declared a covenant-breaker because of his association with some other Baha\u2019is (none of them declared covenant breakers) and an incident I won\u2019t go in to but suffice to say for which there are many different perspectives about what actually happened, which lead to a censure of a \u201cgroup\u201d within the Baha\u2019i Faith, and so Cole voluntary left the faith. Although, the official statement of the National Spiritual Assembly of the U.S. is that Juan Cole was never threatened with being declared a covenant-breaker. Already this might very well sound too weird and cultish for a lot of people. This is what I\u2019ve meant by self-harming abuses above. Imagine, a Baha\u2019i Faith that never spoke of covenant-braking in any situation not directly involving Baha\u2019u\u2019llah\u2019s own family, but where maybe there was more externalized division? I bet such an organization would appear more attractive than does the current one. So what\u2019s the point? If one has ever had an experience like this with a Baha\u2019i one could be excused for feeling like there is something cult-like about the Baha\u2019i Faith. Nevertheless, I\u2019ve experienced the exact same emotional reaction from friends who are Democrats (or were just Bernie supporters) while attempting to speak positively about some of President Trump\u2019s policies (and some of these persons don\u2019t talk to me anymore). BTW, for many Baha\u2019is, the very act of mentioning above might be taken as a subversive act, an act of deliberate sabotage by attempting to sow division within the Baha\u2019i Faith. Outside of the fact, that I have no such intention, can you see the problem? It is the same problem that potentially could exist in any organization and often is on full display today as for example, we see it playing out on a national level today in the U.S. as both the Democrat and Republican parties accuse the other of deliberately attempting to obstruct the pursuit of justice. In other words, was the original investigation politically motivated and an investigation of the investigation now justified or is the investigation of the investigation really just the thing that\u2019s being politically motivated? What you personally believe is almost certainly influenced by more general political ideology than an of the actual facts. Ironically, the Baha\u2019i Faith touts itself as being immune to this, but as with so many things where a blind spot exists, often enough, boogymen are seen there instead. However, this doesn\u2019t make it a cult, but rather just an organization that projects a degree of paranoia into situations where legitimate disagreement exists, exactly because it feels these disagreements are a threat to it\u2014and in this case a very particular threat, i.e. the threat to reveal the fact that the Baha\u2019i Faith\u2019s image of a singular unity is actually an illusion, maintained in some cases through the overt suppression of any suggestion of disunity, which was, itself, justified in the name of unity. Still doesn\u2019t make it a cult though, and in fact, my answer in focusing on a particular issue may come across as unintentionally negative. There are negative aspects to every human organization, however, there are also some exceptionally positive an even uniquely positive things about the Baha\u2019i Faith (and other answers to this question have done a great job in illustrating them). Finally, despite whatever may be said of the Baha\u2019i Administrative Order in practice the life of Baha\u2019u\u2019llah was an incomparable testimony of his great spiritual realization, even among other religious figures like Jesus, Shakyamuni, Muhammad, Baha\u2019u\u2019llah stands out\u2014is the outstanding example. I would encourage every fair-minded person to read his writing and investigate his person. ",

            "answer_text": " Based on \"Combating Cult Mind Control\" by Steven Hassan*, here are the criteria for determining \"cults\": 1. How new members are found Dangerous Cults: With many cults, you don't get to know what you are getting into until after you have made a commitment Baha'i Faith: There are secrets but these secrets are not known to the poor, innocent, newly converted Baha'is. Common Baha'is don't really know that the Baha'i Elections (LSA) are fully managed by Counselors. The Elections results of the NSA are only declared after getting the approval of the Counselor who is responsible to the ITC. Please google for \"Pakistan Baha'i Election Fraud\", \"Baha'i Control on their Electoral System\", \"Baha'i Election fraud in India\". 2. How funding is obtained. Dangerous Cults: Commercial operations and/or mandatory donations (often large percentages) by members. Baha'i Faith: Has commercial businesses, businesses associations, huge property investments, heavy bank deposits. They collect money from poor Africans, Indians, Burmese, Nepalis, Pakistanis in the name of Community Banking and then use these funds for proselytizing. Also auctions are held of different used Clothing of Baha'i Leaders for fund raising. If they know about you having a lot of money, they (Especially Iranian Baha'is) will start motivating you to contribute to various Baha'i funds. They will also extract HUQUQULLAH (19% of your savings), this money is used for proselytization & maintaining Huge Gardens on Mount Carmel. Ask the Baha'is what they have done for the destitute of Congo and Sudan? Some of the fund is used for Pioneering purpose and it is allocated by the Counselors to its own people, sometimes exceeding 15000 US$ a year. There are huge financial scams in the Baha'i community. Just google to learn more, Search for Baha'i financial scams in Dubai, India, Italy, Pakistan, Africa, Iran etc. Recently a Saree (cultural dress worn by women in India) of Ruhiyyih Maxwell was auctioned to raise funds for Baha'i activities. 3. Charismatic central figure. Dangerous Cults: Cults usually have a central living figure who often lives on income from adherents. Thee Baha'i leaders in their respective times were getting money from their adherents. Especially from the American Baha'is. Even today the American Baha'is contribute millions of dollars to the present supreme institution the \"Universal House of Justice\". There are no clergies but there are Counselors and ABMs. The ABMs are religious Police just like the one in Saudi Arabia and the Counselors play the role of clergies - infact more than that off clergies. They are those conducting difficult and important lectures on the subjects such as Covenant, Huququllah, Covenant Breaking, Baha'i Elections, Ruhi 8 etc. These Counselors and ABMs are mostly paid huge amounts for their services. These amounts are called as \"Living Assistance\". Even the International Counselors are House of Justice members are paid huge amounts collected from the poors in the name of Huququllah. The grass-root volunteers (pioneers) from poor countries get approx 100US$ a month. 4. Investigation of truth Dangerous Cults: Members are often told that it is dangerous to investigate other religions. Baha'i Say: Baha'is are encouraged to investigate all religions, and to appreciate truth no matter where it is found. Totally Wrong. Baha'is are strictly not allowed to read the material of other Baha'i Sects. They are told to immediately delete all the emails received by the \"Critics\" or Baha'is of other denominations. Immediately handover the 'UNREAD' material received by other sects to the Baha'i Authorities (Counselors / ABMs). 5. Behavior control, as defined by Hassan. * Dangerous Cults: Persons may be told where to live, what to wear, or what (and how much) to eat. Sleep and freedom to travel or move about may be limited Baha'i Faith: Many Baha'is are Alcoholic (although officially it is prohibited in Baha'i Faith). Shoghi Effendi prohibited the Baha'is from keeping long hairs. There is no freedom of travel. Every now and then guidelines (or Orders?) are issued to the Baha'i from their infallible supreme body - where to travel and where not to travel. If the Baha'i Administration declares any fellow as a \"Covenant Breaker\" then other Baha'is are supposed to totally boycott / shun him even if he be your brother. The advice of UHJ to Baha'is\"There is no excuse for believers continuing to associate with ... and those who, knowing everything, still insist on doing so, should be shunned by their fellow-Bah\u00e1'\u00eds. The same applies to people who have left the Cause and associate with ...\" 6. Thought control as defined by Hassan. * Dangerous Cults: There is often use of \"thought-stopping\" techniques such as chanting or speaking in tongues for long periods of time, setting up a type of hypnotic atmosphere Baha'i Faith: The \"Ruhi Institute\" is specially meant to brainwash the newly converted. Read Ruhi Book 6 and 7 and learn yourself. And hypocrisy is the second name of Baha'i faith. See this 7. Emotional control, as defined by Hassan. * Dangerous Cults: Guilt and fear are often used to control members, including alternating praise and public humiliation or forced confession, and indoctrination against leaving the group. * Baha'i Faith: Exactly same here, Guilt and fear are often used to control members, including alternating praise and public humiliation (if you are critical of this cult) or forced confession, and indoctrination (Ruhi Curriculum) against leaving the group. Small mistakes are fined with the taking of \"Administrative Rights\" 8. What happens when people leave the religion Dangerous Cults: People who leave cults are often considered to be dangerous and are usually shunned Baha'i Faith: Exactly Same with the Baha'i Cult. Search the Phrase \"Non-association with Covenant-breakers\" and read the teachings of Baha'u'llah, Abdul Baha and Shoghi Effendi. \"BAHA'I FAITH IS ACTUALLY A CULT\" \"THE MOST HYPOCRITICAL CULT THAT WANTS TO ESTABLISH A NEW WORLD ORDER.\" * Steve Hassan is a Cult Expert ",
