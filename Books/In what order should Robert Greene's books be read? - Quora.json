            "answer_text": "Since Robert Greene\u2019s new book came out, titled The Laws of Human Nature here is a good order to read all of his books. 1 The Laws of Human Nature 2 Mastery 3 The 48 Laws of Power 4 The Art of Seduction 5 The 33 Strategies of War 6 The 50th Law I will say, this is pretty solid for me, as I am just currently reading his newest book- though it launched earlier this week- it could be said that you can flip The Art of Seduction and The 33 Strategies of War for another order to read. I\u2019m still going through his new book, which is massive, and I\u2019ve come to an understanding that the aspects of our nature need to be analyzed and deciphered early on. Learning about our nature will dramatically change your outlook on life and kindle certain tools for you to become more productive, calm, strategic, and free \u201cfrom all the emotional drama that needlessly drains you.\u201d This is why The Laws of Human Nature should be placed at the top of the reading order.

            "answer_text": "They are all self-contained. I would suggest reading the book versions over the kindle due to the annotations. Unless one subject particularly interests you, I would begin at the beginning 48 Laws of Power. It is the most widely read and a great introduction to Mr. Greene\u2019s style. Each book, and I have read them all multiple times, will open up many avenues of exploration. They can all serve as a guide to further, in depth, study of history and philosophy. The annotations offer interesting facts about the law, strategy, profile, etc. being discussed. Personally, as a completist, I recommend reading them in the order of publication. 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Strategies of War, and Mastery. The 50 Law (co-written with 50 Cent) though published in \u201809 could be read at any point after 48 Laws. I envy readers that are new to Robert Greene\u2019s work. They are all fantastic studies for the intellectually curious. Also, don\u2019t miss his upcoming The Laws of Human Behavior. ",
