            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no doubt that English grammar forms the basis for your knowledge of this foreign language. To my mind, one should practice English grammar from the very beginning of the language learning process. One of the most useful ways of practicing it is using specific books. I recommend these ones: 1.\tRound-Up (Pearson & Longman) This book is usually highly recommended by many teachers. It has 7 levels (from \u201cStarter\u201d to level 6). So, you have an opportunity to improve your English grammar skills step by step. I can\u2019t tell you what a useful book it is. Why? a lot of pictures which help you understand some complicated grammar issues;the colorful design of pages which makes you stay focused on grammar even if you don\u2019t like it;a good deal of humor: there are lots of funny jokes in the dialogues which are aimed to make your learning experience entertaining;a mix of different types of tasks: dialogues and tests, completing, rephrasing and rewriting the sentences, filling in the gaps and underlining the correct word;nice grammar explanations;idioms and phrasal verbs.2.\tOxford Practice Grammar This book is actually more serious than the previous one. Nevertheless, I like its structure. Having worked with this book, I can definitely say that the exercises are drafted in such a way as to make you practice the rules thoroughly. So, the effectiveness of your English grammar studying process depends on your efforts. Use the books I mentioned above and do your utmost! ",
