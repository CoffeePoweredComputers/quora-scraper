            "answer_text": "Well, there are many publishers out there but getting your book published true traditional Publications is not easy these days. In such a case the best option is to get your book published by self-publishers and cut down on the time and effort. You can dedicate that time to market your book. However, you need to be very careful while selecting the right self-publisher for your book as this industry is contaminated by fake publishers who just want to take money from you but not give quality services. There is only one such reliable self-publisher I have got so far for my books is Blue Hill Publications. They are honest and transparent and do justice to your book. Last Advice: Never go for too flashy self-publishers. ",
