            "answer_text": "Original Question: Is this sentence \"I'm sure to have done the work by tomorrow\" correct and referring to the future? Your construction would depend on what you\u2019re trying to communicate. If you\u2019re simply trying to convey your plan to finish the work tomorrow, you\u2019d use a future tense for the \u201cbe sure\u201d part and a past tense for the \u201chave done\u201d part:\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to have done the work by tomorrow.\u201dWhile this is correct grammatically, there is something wonky about having a future tense followed by past tense like this. It might sound more natural if you changed the \u201cdone\u201d part to be associated with the work instead:\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to have the work done by tomorrow.\u201dIn the first example, the confidence in getting the work done won\u2019t exist until the future. However, if your intent is to emphasize that your confidence in the work exists right now, the \u201cbe sure\u201d part should be present tense and the \u201chave done\u201d part would shift to the future:\u201cI\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll have done the work by tomorrow.\u201d",
