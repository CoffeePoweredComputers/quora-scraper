            "answer_text": "Because most Japanese family names are either derived from or identical to place names. Place names are often a natural feature, like a river, an island, a mountain, etc. that uses one character, and a modifying word, usually a single character, but sometimes two or more. Hayashi (woods) > Ko bayashi (little woods) Shima (island) > Naka jima (center island) Yama (mountain) > Ao yama (blue/green mountain) This is not a perfect fit, but it's the simplest explanation for an overall trend.
