            "answer_text": "I used to adore Harry Potter - my family all read it together, went to Harry Potter world as often as possible, and all of my friends knew their houses. I was a bit iffy about some of the character development towards the end, but overall I enjoyed it. They were good books about a bunch of kids going to wizard school. My main problem is what happened to those kids after they finished wizard boarding school. Harry has been fighting other people\u2019s wars since childhood. He was literally raised to be a sacrificial lamb, a pawn in another man\u2019s war. He clearly demonstrated an aptitude for teaching when he led Dumbledore\u2019s Army, and making him a teacher at Hogwarts (possibly DADA?) would have been a much better end to his character arc than becoming an Auror. He\u2019d finally be content, just another average wizard, rather than the Boy Who Lived, gone to fight yet another war. I have no problems with Hermione being Minister for Magic, but I feel that Ron would also, like Harry, be one to avoid a profession like \u2018Auror\u2019. His main focus during the war was his family (seen in the Salazar\u2019s Locket argument) and it would be better for him, as a character, to help out at Weasley\u2019s Wizard Wheezes with George, especially following Fred\u2019s death. Finally - and this is more a point of personal opinion than anything else - Harry should not have named his child \u2018Albus Severus\u2019. Albus? Okay, I can kind of get behind it. Dumbledore was Harry\u2019s mentor for the majority of his young life, even if he wasn\u2019t the hero that Harry always thought he was. But Severus? Severus? This is a man who, for pretty much all of Harry\u2019s memory, has abused his students, called Harry\u2019s own mother a slur, antagonised anyone who he disliked and essentially killed Harry\u2019s parents by telling Voldemort of the prophecy. Are you seriously telling me that Harry Potter, the boy with a moral code so strong that you couldn\u2019t break it if you tried, the boy who fought for others first, the boy who was prepared to die to save everyone else, would name his son after this man, just because \u201cOh, he loved Lily\u201d? Not on my watch, J K Rowling. If he just had to be named after a Slytherin, why not Regulus? It would be a nice homage to a man who, like Harry, was prepared to face death to save the wizarding world, and it would fit well with \u2018James Sirius Potter\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do you not like Harry Potter any more? I don't \u201cnot like Harry Potter anymore.\u201d I like the books just fine. I spent several years reading them, waiting for several of them, speculating about them, discussing them, writing about them \u2026 and then I finished and took a break. I still enjoy HP fanfiction, but I'm not really interested in reading books about the next generation, and I'm definitely not interested in reading JK's retcons of the old stories. I think the original books need to be left alone. Eventually I will reread the series again. HEY, I've read Jane Austen's six novels more times than I can even remember, and my copies of them are falling apart \u2026 literally. The books are annotated, highlighted to death, and rubberbanded to keep the pages from falling out! I can't bear to part with them. It has happened to a lot of books I love. I will say that I have changed the way I feel about some characters as my earlier impressions have mellowed and matured. I see a number of characters as less black-and-white and more grey. Anyway, I don't dislike the books. ",
