            "answer_text": "Since William Shakespeare is one of my all time favourites, not to mention a close competitor to God within the literary community, I am afraid I must disagree with the statement. Personally, I may show signs of an obvious bias because of the feminist within that glows with pride at some of his strong female characters. For example Beatrice, Much Ado About Nothing, Katherine, Taming the Shrew, Portia, Merchant of Venice, and Viola, Twelfth Night. However, in his defence, there is also Phoebe who falls pathetically in love with a man, who is actually a woman, categorical in his declaration that he could never love her, in As You Like It, Miranda, from The Tempest, who falls in love with the first man she sees who is not related to her. Within the purview of his writing, Shakespeare has explored every genre imaginable, Romeo and Juliet in romance, Comedy of Errors in comedy, Julius Caesar in politics, Hamlet in tragedy. Character trait exhibited by any human being. Iago, from Othello, being the ultimate villain across time and literature. Puck, the mischievous imp from A Midsummers\u2019 Night Dream, Cecilia, the loyal step-sister in As You Like It, Cordelia, the just daughter from King Lear, Shylock, the vengeful Jew in Merchant of Venice. The wit and humour of shakespeare remains unmatched even today, and it is a commonly used quote now \u201cEven when you think you aren\u2019t quoting Shakespeare you are\u201d It is hard to fully grasp that anyone could even consider him \u201cthe worst writer\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I say he was a pretty bad writer. His themes are repetitive and characters non-interesting. It's hard to find a single character that feels like a person to sympathize with because they're all just plot tools. And as far as his language and stories, Shakespeare doesn't age well. I mean, the first scene of Romeo and Juliet is of two soldiers saying that they would rape the women of the other family and make jokes about it. He makes characters the embodiment of an idea or quality rather than an actual person. Sure, he made them have flaws, but most of the time, if a character had a flaw of any sort, expect them to die around Act 3. ",
