            "answer_text": "How to Write the Perfect Sales Letter. Okay, let's get started! First, gather a few sales letters that grab your attention from your own mailbox. Give particular notice to the look, wording, and the way the information is organized. Keep those models in mind as you begin to write. Create a short, powerful headline. Center it on the page. Use large type, bold, or color\u2014something to set it apart from the body of the letter. Experiment also with a font that is different from the one used in the text. But remember these rules of design: no more than two fonts, and do not mix two serif fonts or two sans serif fonts. Try a combination of one serif font, such as Times New Roman, and one sans serif font, such as Arial. Start the body of the letter with a polite but personal tone. Example: \u201cDear . . .\u201d Use the potential customer's name. Talk to him or her as a friend. Ask a question that lists the greatest benefits of your offer. How will your product or service make your reader's life better? Why is your product or offer better than your competitor's? Example: \u201cHow would you like to receive (first benefit) and (second benefit)? Read on! This might be the most important letter you ever receive.\u201d Tip: DO NOT ask a question that can be answered with \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d You should control both the question and the answer! Answer the question in one or two sentences. Explain why your product or service is essential or special. Achieving a better quality of life is a universal theme. Examples: \u201cHere's why ...\u201d\u201cHere's how ...\u201dAddress doubts before your potential customer has a chance to think of them: Examples: \u201cSound too good to be true? I thought so when I first learned about . . .\u201d\u201cI know this sounds outrageous. I'd be skeptical too.\u201d\u201cDo these results sound unbelievable? I thought so too, but then ...\u201dGive a convincing answer: Examples: \u201cBut the more I learned about . . . , the more I knew that I should give it a try. Here's why you should too ...\u201d List three good reasons that demonstrate how your product will make the reader's life better, make him feel more secure, or motivate him to action. Keep the reasons short and powerful. Use statements that suggest positive results, facts, and figures. Examples: \u201cFour out of five doctors recommend ...\u201d\u201cResearch shows that no other company can . . . like we can.\u201d\u201cFour out of five customers agree that ...\u201cTip: Keep your vocabulary simple, short, and to the point. Now describe the special features and benefits of your product or service. A feature is something that makes your product or service extraordinary, essential or valuable. A feature describes what your product or service is or what it has. The benefit of the feature is what the feature will do for the reader. Bullet points are good to use here\u2014they draw the eye to this important section. Benefits sell while features often do not. Many sales letters list benefits only. Others list both features and benefits. Writers often make the mistake of listing features only. List three or five features with their special benefits. Feature 1\u2014Benefit 1Feature 2\u2014Benefit 2Feature 3\u2014Benefit 3Tip: Odd-numbered lists seem to work better than even-numbered lists. Ask and answer one final question to lead the reader into the finer points of the offer. You may expand upon the features and benefits that you included in your answer. Example: You may ask how we can possibly do all this? Here's how ...\u201d Endorsements sell because they establish credibility. List several short, enthusiastic testimonials that reinforce the features and benefits you have listed. Example: \u201cBut you don't have to take my word for it. Here's what our satisfied customers are saying.\u201d Shoot holes in your competitors' offers. Examples: \u201cNo one can match this offer.\u201d\u201cDo not buy this product elsewhere unless it has these features: One . . . Two . . . Three . . .\u201d\u201cSure, others will try to sell you a product of lesser quality, but can they offer you: One . . . Two . . . Three . . . ?\u201dCost-to-value ratio is enormous. Boldly state that your product or service has a real value of at least ten times the price. These value statements need to be clear and crisp, with not too many details. Perhaps your product can save valuable time, or make a huge difference in lifestyle, or replace another higher-priced product, etc. Examples: \u201cYou'll get over ten times your money's worth in value! Guaranteed!\u201d\u201cExtraordinary savings!\u201d (or quality, add-on products, longevity, warranty, etc. )\u201cWe offer you unbelievable quality for only one-tenth the usual price.\u201dSummarize. Briefly describe the complete product or service. You can remind the reader about the features and benefits, but don't list them. Rather, add several similar features and benefits and place a high value on them. Example: \u201cSo here's everything you get . . . Price and urgency. Make a stipulation, then repeat the offer: Example: \u201cIf you respond by (date), you pay only $______. That's right, for the price of two movie tickets and popcorn you pay only $______, if you respond by (date).\u201d If this letter is to create a lead, tell your prospect what he/she must do to contact you by a certain deadline. Be sure to make it easy to respond by including your business name, phone number, web site, etc. Ask the customer for all of the information you need, such as first and last names, phone number, address, etc. Make an optional request for the customer's email address so that you can send future offers by email as well. Premiums. Bundling a free bonus (a premium) for acting by the deadline is an excellent motivator. Be sure to give the bonus value\u2014as much or more than the purchase price is a good idea. If you don't have an idea for a premium, you can search the web for e-books or informational reports for which you can purchase reprint rights\u2014an excellent and inexpensive idea that has a high value margin. Example:\u201cOrder today and I'll send you . . . \u2014a $50 value! But remember, I am offering this free bonus for a limited time . . . so order now!\u201d No-risk guarantee. You've heard and read many assurances before. Examples: \u201cBuy completely at our own risk . . . \u201d\u201cYou pay nothing unless you are totally satisfied.\u201d\u201cThere is no risk with our complete satisfaction, money-back guarantee!\u201d\u201cNo questions asked. Simply return the product within 30 days and we'll refund your money in full.\u201dAdd the clincher. Example: \u201cRemember, you keep the free bonus(es). Even if you decide to take advantage of our No Risk, Total Satisfaction, Money-back Guarantee, the bonus(es) are yours to keep\u2014our gift(s) to you for simply trying our ...\u201d These are all good business tactics, but consider adding a postscript to restate an important benefit and reinforce the urgency of the offer. Don't forget the envelope: your all-important introduction! In order to get someone to open your envelope, you first need to get past the \u201cjunk mail\u201d perception! Use a teaser on the envelope\u2014a few words that imply a benefit. Examples: \u201cFree $50 gift offer enclosed.\u201d Use labels that express urgency. Examples: UrgentTime-SensitiveExpressHand DeliverOfficialUse real stamps. Real stamps attract more attention than metered mail and you have your choice of which books to buy at the post office. Tip: Don't but the reptile books of stamps with the pictures of poisonous snakes! Use a return address and choose the font carefully. Use a readable script font such as Andy that looks like you have hand-written the letter. Credibility sells. This is the first place that you sell yourself or your company. Some people include their personal photos. The absence of a return address sends a junk mailmessage. Use official-looking envelopes. Envelopes that appear to have been sent by a governmental agency are usually opened and read. Additional Sales Letter Tips: Price comes after the benefits. Unless you are offering a blowout bargain, and price is the main benefit of your offer, mention price afterdescribing the benefits.Sell the smallest units. If you are selling multiple units, then state, for example, \u201c$4.50 a box\u201d rather than \u201c$45 per carton\u201d to solicit the lowest amount of money. Accept charge cards if you are selling a high-priced item.Supplementary Brochure. An accompanying brochure could visually show the product or graphs research data described in the sales letter. Although a brochure adds cost to your mailing, studies show results jump markedly.Design. Keep the reader's eye moving by using several \u201ctricks of the trade.\u201dExamples: Vary paragraph widthsAdd personal notes using a script fontUse different colors to mark key phrasesYour turn! Now you write a sales letter that will sell your product and increase your profits! ",

            "answer_text": " I literally lost count how many sales letters and emails, landing pages, and similar, I've written, edited, rewritten, checked, adjusted, and read so far. So, what I've learned from this \"impressive\" experience? Socrates wasn't much of a writer, but he nailed it with his famous \"scio me nihil scire,\" or in plain English - I know that I know nothing about writing sales letters. Yet, there are some things I'm willing to share and discuss. Rest assured that they've proven themselves to be efficient and reliable. So, let's begin, shall we? From RUSSIA with love! I call it my RUSSIA writing rule: ReadableUnderstandableShortSimpleInnovativeActive I guess there's no need to explain in detail what each of these points means for your sales letter. Right? Here it is in a few words. First of all, you need a sales letter, which is both understandable to read and understand. You can Google the term \"readability\" to see for yourself how important it is. In addition, a killer sales letter is short and simple. Basically, we're talking about the same things, but you'll be surprised how many rocket-science-sales-letters are out there. Those letters aren't selling a thing, I'm positive about it. When it comes to the last two letters on my list, you need to be original (innovative) and spark some positive action (sales). Try walking in customer's/user's shoes, first! Here's my oldie goldie favorite. I never write \"blindly,\" meaning I like to try it myself, literally. This is how my wife was trying out some Korean face mask sheets when I was writing sales letters for them. I also like to install apps or software solutions in order to try them first-hand. Future and potential customers and users appreciate honesty and realism, which are coming out from your \"previously tested\" sales letter. Better to invest a little bit of time in tryouts, than to focus strictly on writing itself. At the end of the long sales day, words AREN'T selling, but the info you provide. Originality is original! Originality is priceless! Originality is uncompromising! Again, you may find this one to be categorized as \"needless to say,\" but there are so many look-alikes in the world of sales letters that it hurts. These letters are \"original\" in terms of Copyscape, but when it comes to structure and ideas, they're nothing more than rewritten and paraphrased copies. No matter how you put it and which words you use, trust me, you'll have better chances to attract someone's attention, if you're truly original. We've seen and read it all. There are no more surprises in this field. That's why any breath of fresh air is more than welcomed and properly rewarded. A sales letter's main purpose ISN'T to sell! Guess, this one doesn't make any sense at the first glance, but give it an extra thought. A sales letter is merely an invitation to talk, to share, to try, a first step of the long profitable walk. So, treat it as such. Don't oversell your own sales letter! Let it be relaxed and cheerful. Write a sales letter with no extra weight. You should write it as if you have to write at least a dozen more. Those letters written in the end-of-the-world or now-or-never style can be quite repulsive. Shock, but don't provoke! Be crazy, but know your limits! You've heard or read somewhere that \"shockers\" are the true winners. All you have to do is to shock people, and the next thing you know money starts falling from the sky. This may be true, but only in Hollywood. In the world of sales, if you're playing your \"shocking card\" wrongly, you're going to be ridiculed and shared all over the Net as a do-not-this example. We all want to attract other people's attention, but there are certain limits we should respect. You aren't writing a gossip column, but rather a professional sales letter. Honesty is the best sales letter writing policy! Again, your job isn't to sell, but only to write. That's why you need to be honest about you're offering. Every single word you write will be checked or even double-checked. People reading your sales letters will have plenty of time to evaluate them and even use them against you. What you read is what you'll probably get. This is how it should be done. This approach may seem like shooting your own leg strategy, but what you really need are customers and clients that really appreciate your products or services, rather than completely mislead people. Think about it. Play with the font, bold, and colors! It's very simple, but it's even more surprisingly efficient. It's too bad I'm a little bit too lazy right now to apply these in this article. Again, based on my experience, it's much better to look at the dancing letters than it is to be bored with an army of letters and words aligned in a perfect formation. Your sales letter shouldn't be a military parade for your words and letters. It should be more like a crazy party where every single word fights to attract attention and deliver a special message. Your tips suck! Yes, but this isn't entirely true. At least one of them should be of some use to your writing plans. This is my final tip with a catch. Put more than one sales letter in a single sales letter. Treat it as a missile carrying a couple of nuclear warheads. You don't expect all of them to succeed, but one will do the job. One point in this article will make you think it was worth reading. One point or a part of your sales letter will make sure your entire letter works. I'm reading, writing, and most importantly trying to improve all the time. The next time I sit down to write a killer sales letter, I may come up with a completely different set of tips. No move - No groove! Don't forget that! ",
