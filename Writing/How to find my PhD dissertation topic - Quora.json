            "answer_text": "Now because i am a PhD student. I can suggest something that might help. First of all, have an interest area which you feel is worth doing a PhD in the area. This is the most important. Second, discuss with people who are carrying out research in the same or similar area. Can be another PhD student, faculty, an industry professional. If you can manage to discuss with some big shots, nothing better! This will be of immense help. After this, you will have topic in mind, bu it will be vague for sure! But dont worry. Third, carry out an intense literature survey to chisel out the topic to find your PhD problem. I will tell you my experience in finding my PhD research topic. I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Delhi. I joined here on mid 2010 and I am almost at the stage of submitting. I have a journal publication in the Expert Systems with Applications journal and recently, I was awarded best paper prize at an international IEEE conference. Now here's my story. After completing my Masters in Biomedical Engineering from IIT KGP, I was highly motivated and interested to carry out further research and I joined IIT Delhi with high hopes. I had in my mind that i will be doing a PhD in topic related to biomedical engineering. This was my interest area. I was thinking at that i will do something related to neuroscience esp brain disorders. But i was not precise at that time. Then i discussed with people in my lab, other colleagues and most importantly, I discussed with doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIIMS). They were really helpful and I owe to them the most. Now the good thing about this discussion was that they were able to tell some real world practical problems (which is really hard to find even in peer-reviewed papers.) After the discussion i got the vague topic which i was talking about. The doctor suggested me about the growing number of cases of Parkinson's disease in India and it is a good topic to work on. After that i returned to my lab stated doing an intense literature survey. and then i selected my PhD topic. It was like early detection of Parkinson's disease through multimodal data analysis and machine learning. ",

Also, technical reports from Microsoft Research/ IBM etc.Try to pick up on future work suggested by authors, or on questions raised, or on questions you can raise based on their research. Have discussions with colleagues (grad students, enthusiasts, etc.)This will essentially take you to the edge of current research. This is vital. Pick 1-3 somewhat related topics/issues that are beyond the edge. (not just one)Immerse yourself in finding a way to solve these issues. If you solve 1/3, it could be your thesis. Additionally: Don't leave the main idea of the thesis to your advisor! His task is to guide you on the road you have taken. Which means he can tell you the limitations or pitfalls or potential of your idea, but you should probably not ask him to engender the idea.Publish: conferences/journals or even blogs. Let people know what you are thinking. Don't be worried of people stealing your idea. If its really good enough, you have to probably jam it down people's throats instead of being worried about them taking credit.",

On this site I have found not only interesting reviews of dissertations but also a compiled list of the best services that offer services in writing dissertations. I was really surprised about. Without thinking twice, I turned to one of the services, which seemed to me the best of the list, and these guys helped me to formulate the topic of my thesis. Also, they helped me with the writing of the list of literature for my dissertation. You may try it too. ",
