            "answer_text": "Laboratories have become pretty sophisticated, so it really is hard to beat an EtG test. But it is not impossible. You know that water is your friend, really. Start drinking as much as you can now, comfortably. Keep it up. Chugging it can stress your organs and not give the desired effect, which is to clear out the EtG metabolite and get your urine as dilute as possible.If you can\u2019t stand water, drink tea , Kool-aid or any other watered down drink you can tolerate a great deal of.Take creatine tablets as directed. (I am a body-builder, so I am used to creatine tablet short term loading, but don\u2019t try this unless under the supervision of a professional.) The object of taking the tablets as directed is to try to get enough creatine in you so that it will spill over into your urine as creatinine and avoid a diluted test. Some say this works and others say it does not. Some people do it to keep on the safe side; you can skip it if you like.Depending on how much alcohol you drink, it can be pretty hard to get rid of EtG within 36 hours before a test. Therefore, don\u2019t drink alcohol 36 hours before a test if you can avoid it. If you did, all is not lost- just follow the instructions as well as you can.Eat protein to increase your creatinine levels.Break a sweat in any way you can. Keep it comfortable, though.Some say steam rooms help, since alcohol is eliminated through skin pores.Two hours before you test, drink gatorade and try to have a meal. This is to help raise the specific gravity of your sample. Some say chicken broth works, too.Stay away from any hand sanitizers or food with alcohol in it.Take a multivitamin an hour before your test to make sure your sample is yellow.Never give first morning urine or urine you have been holding for more than 2 hours.Urinate out first before you give your sample; give it mid-stream.These are all general guidelines. I had to do EtG tests for an authority whose punishment would be worse for me than any police, court order or agency. That was my spouse. Good luck, all. ",
