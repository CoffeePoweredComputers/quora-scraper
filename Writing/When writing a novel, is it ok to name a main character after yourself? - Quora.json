Technically, yes, it\u2019s your story and it\u2019s perfectly fine to do what you will with it. If that means naming a main character after yourself, go for it\u2014this is especially okay if you\u2019re writing an autobiography, memoir, or some other piece of non-fiction involving yourself. In practice, however, naming a main character after yourself may not be the wisest thing. Some of the other answers have already hit on this, so I won\u2019t go too much into detail, but if you\u2019re naming a main character specifically after yourself\u2014not just giving it the same name\u2014you\u2019ll likely hold a certain fondness for the character and will therefore be particularly up in arms if someone were to critique him or her. However, there\u2019s more than just that reason for opting to name your character literally anything that isn\u2019t your name. When I see a book in the fiction section, and I see the author\u2019s name of that book on the cover of it, and inside the cover jacket, I see that the main character\u2019s name is that of the author, I tend to cringe. There\u2019s something naive about naming a main character after yourself, something that suggests that a vulnerability nobody asked to be there is present. Furthermore, when I see that an author has named his character after himself, I put the book down, because, to me at least, it suggests a lack of creativity, and in that book I would expect to find the author building himself up, trying to take away all of the flaws he has to make himself as perfect as possible, and a character without flaws is boring and not relatable. That\u2019s how I see it, at least. Overall, my advice to you would be to write whatever story you want to write, but if you can, I\u2019d definitely consider giving your main character a name that is not yours. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no rule that says you can\u2019t name a main character after yourself. If you\u2019re writing a novel, the predicament comes from people assuming that you are talking about yourself. More importantly, people will most likely think that the character traits, mannerisms, behaviors, habits, and actions described in the book are yours. It\u2019s one thing if it is, and you\u2019re fine with your readers knowing that about you. However, if you create a character with your name that has different traits and performs actions that are contradictory to how you really are, and people are going to confuse the character from you, then I would consider whether that could have an unintended effect. As a guideline, I don\u2019t use my or anyone\u2019s full names I know in a fictional novel because it becomes problematic later. If you\u2019re writing non-fiction, then so be it. But you really should look to use different names when creating a fictional universe. ",
