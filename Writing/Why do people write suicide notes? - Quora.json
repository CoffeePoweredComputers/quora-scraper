            "answer_text": "People who commit suicide they are may be emotionally weak. We don't know what's going on in their life may be they are going through some thoughts like \" What if the only way not to feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all forever..\". They are not able to talk to anyone because may be they are have a fear that they will get judge by them. So they end up writing a diary because at the end burying things inside your head and heart will end up bursting you. So when they see nothing can be done they just pour out everything and may be that's the reason they write suicide notes ",
