            "answer_text": "There are a ton of ways to get started writing conservative articles while in high school. Your school newspaper is a great place to start. If your school newspaper is anything like my school newspaper, they never have enough writers, and especially love well-researched pieces that get people talking. My sister-in-law won scholarship money from The American Legion Oratorical competition. A quick google search came up with a whole bunch of similar competitions. Find some essay contests, and start making submissions. You not only get your writing in front of some very prominent people that way, but you could earn money towards your college career as well. Talk to your high school English teacher. S/he may know of some more places you can send submissions, such as literary magazines that compile student submissions. You can write essays right here on Quora. This community might have a liberal bent to it (I know I do, personally) but it rewards answers that are well-researched and respectful. There are plenty of prominent conservative writers who have earned their Top Writer creds on this site. Practice voicing your opinions and constructing strong, logical arguments, and you\u2019ll get a real head-start on college essay writing. ",
