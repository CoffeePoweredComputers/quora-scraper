            "answer_text": "If you already know the topic, take time, prepare it nicely and learn it. If topic will be gicen on the spot, try to prepare on topics that are as per your education level. Mostly topics are related to currents affairs, your views about a certain situation, or maybe on climate issues, religious issues, issues of international importance\u2026. etc. The best way is to read newspapers. There is a saying \u201cRome was not built in a day\u201d, even though you don't win this essay competition, you mighy win the next, participation is more important. Also try reading novels, they are boring to me because i like pictures in books, but you can try. ",
