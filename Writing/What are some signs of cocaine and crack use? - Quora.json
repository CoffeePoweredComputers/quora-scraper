            "answer_text": "Snorted and smoking coke are two entirely different monsters. Snorting makes one feel like he\u2019s the center of attraction. Symptoms include excessive talking, lower jaw movement, teeth grinding and the ability to drink alcohol yet not get drunk. Crack on the other hand makes one very paranoid, scandalous due to the extreme urge to get more, un trustworthy, unreliable and always broke, followed by depression when coming down. Good luck and hope this helps. ",
