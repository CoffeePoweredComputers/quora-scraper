            "answer_text": "Q: How do you spell Hekate using the ancient Greek alphabet? The name is spelled \u1f19\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 in Ancient Greek alphabet; it is read Hek\u00e1t\u0113. Don\u2019t confuse the proper name \u1f19\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 and the word \u1f11\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 which means either \u201cworking at will\u201d or \u201cstake\u201d \u2014 they differ because the proper name has capital letter. Don\u2019t confuse the ancient Greek spelling \u1f19\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 and the modern form \u0395\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 \u2014 they differ because of the rough breathing diacritic mark at the beginning of the word. Also consider that in ancient Greece various dialects were spoken, so probably the goddess\u2019s name was changed in order to fit the dialect. The Doric-Aeolic form would be \u1f19\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u1fb1. ",
