            "answer_text": "Read the instructions. Make sure you understand what\u2019s required, from number of words, pages, or lines per page to the specific style (such as APA) that you\u2019re required to follow. Know if you\u2019re expected to include something specific, or if you\u2019re supposed to avoid doing something. Understand the topic or subject matter. Don\u2019t bluff. Then understand how you want to approach the topic. Are you arguing a specific point of view? Are you explaining some concept, or identifying a theme running through multiple works? Know how you\u2019re going to approach the topic, and then arrange your essay into logical sections that support the topic. Write grammatically. Your essay doesn\u2019t have to be overly formal or stilted. But it shouldn\u2019t be conversational, either (unless your instructor says it should be\u2026which is very unlikely). Check the obvious things like spelling, tense, subject-verb agreement, and so on. Nothing destroys the credibility of an academic essay more quickly than poor writing. If you have the time, take a break. Twenty four hours or more. Work on other things. Then come back to the essay and re-read it very carefully. Make corrections (in logic, in style, in grammar, and so on) as appropriate. ",

I strongly recommend combing through Quora answers to this and similar questions, there are scads of great answers for this topic. Good luck, and happy hunting! So, the characteristics on an essay (please see Tanya Campbell answer of July 2017 What are the characteristics of the perfect essay?)We often teach the \u201cRule of Five\u201d for paragraphs and essays: an academic paragraph has five sentences 1) And Intro Sentence 2) three supporting sentences 3) one Conclusion sentenceThe Academic Essay has five paragraphs 1) Intro Paragraph 2) three supporting paragraphs 3) one Conclusion paragraph (the conclusion has no new information)Note: An essay is \u201ccomprehensive\u201d that means that it completely covers the point.An essay is a discussion about just one main idea (typically found in one sentence somewhere, but usually in the introduction paragraph)An essay is written with descriptive language (meaning we show our reader something rather than tell her something)An Essay avoids writing in the second person (unless it is instructions for something)An Essay avoids passive voice (passive voice is intrinsically evil, as passive voice hides the subject of the sentence)An academic essay is free of slang, jargon, and idioms. (The meaning of slang terms changes over time and using slang also erodes the writer\u2019s credibility) Remember while writing: \u201cThe goal of academic writing is two-fold: First, tell the truth as clearly and as accurately as possible. And second, make a point \u201c Wanless ",
