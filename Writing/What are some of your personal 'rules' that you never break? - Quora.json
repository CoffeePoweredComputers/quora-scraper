            "answer_text": "I like to do things on my own . Not dependent on anyone for my work. Family is always a priority. Speak the truth even if it hurts the other person. Talk less with everyone. Do not expect even from your loved ones. Because expectations lead to conflicts. Be the source of happiness and don't find happiness in others. Find it in yourself. Because the other person is as empty as you. No one can make you happy if you yourself are not happy. Thank you ",
