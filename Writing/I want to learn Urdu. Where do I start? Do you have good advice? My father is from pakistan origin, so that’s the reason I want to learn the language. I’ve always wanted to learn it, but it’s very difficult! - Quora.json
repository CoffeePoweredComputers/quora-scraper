The soldiers in the sub continent spoke their respective languages, but whenever they interect with each other they introduce a new language known as Urdu. It is not a difficult language and you do not feel any difficulty to learn it. I must say that you should speak with your father. Try to use the urdu words instead of English. Watch the Urdu movies and Dramas as well. Inshanallah soon you will learn it. For any sort of Assistance I am available. Great Ideas ",
