            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll keep my answer short, for once. One, our school system usually sucks big time at teaching foreign langages. I know, I have worked as an english teacher for adults in a professionnal setting, all of them had studied english at school, some for more than 7 years, and most were all next to unable to make a simple, basic sentence. And that is without even taking the atrocious pronunciation issues into account\u2026 Two, french has a very narrow bandwidth, that stops at 1800 Mghz. English has a bandwidth that starts at 2000\u2026 a french ear is physically not built to hear english\u2026 and since your ear\u2019s ability is determined in infancy by what you hear, and babies typically learn from their parents, french parents simply pass on to their children that very narrow bandwidth, making them terrible at picking up english. Three, it usually is very hard for a french to learn english, because the pronunciation is downright outlandish (that \u201cth\u201d sound, that is the bane of most french, it has no equivalent in french). Yet some of us manage. Present company included. I learned english in about 4 months when I was 15, made it my major in college and graduated with a bachelor in english. All that with having spent a grand total of less than 30 days in english speaking countries in my whole life\u2026 But : I read in english, I watch movies, TV series, and occasionnaly the news, in english, and I listen to english pop and rock (the Beatles were my first teachers). I can also write in english, obviously\u2026 And I have this slight american accent that more than once had native english speakers assume I was american\u2026 And I have a 28 year old son who speaks a pretty good english himself. Sat him in front of his first english version movie at 7, never looked back, and voila. I believe any french can learn english. It just takes some time and (sometimes a lot !) work. And the will to do it ! Which may be what is lacking in the first place\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Because English sucks! But, let me disambiguate! Actually, it is not the whole language that sucks, it is the spelling system that sucks or, to be absolutely truthful, it is the spelling system at the vowel level that sucks, mainly! Still, its spelling system sure makes learning its language really difficult. Many might say that proper teaching could easily mitigate the issue. If you know the facts and the research, that kind of easy marketing will not wash. I will give you the facts and the research. I am not a tutor. I don\u2019t own a tutoring agency or some kind of software or website. The following is not half-truth. I give several serious references, not loose opinions. The spelling system is not the only reason why the French don\u2019t speak proper English, but it is a major contributor. I realise that this intro might not be the very best way to get upvotes, but it is not necessarily a national secret from what I read on Quora either. Sure, I could have used euphemisms and been more diplomatic. But, let\u2019s be frank. (Frank \u2026 French \u2026 get it?) It has been declared far from being optimal for 250 years and nothing has been done about it. It is all explained here[1]. Would we blame drivers for accidents if a car had thousands of faulty parts like faulty breaks (sorry \u2026 brakes) or malfunctioning wipers? I really wish I could be more gentle, but sometimes a little shock and awe is necessary. Doing the same thing and expecting different results is the definition of insanity, apparently. But, of course, that would be looked down upon! One cannot win, it seems! Are parents who shout after asking 3000 times to their children to clean their room bad? Of course, some English speakers have already muted or blocked me. Why shoot the messenger? I did not create the system (Johnson did) and I did not maintain it (Actually no one has and is, which is part of the problem.) I am just reporting the facts. The English spelling system at the vowel level (mainly) sucks. Do I have to say that I love English-speaking people, their culture, \u2026 ? It is not personal. It should not be. Btw, speakers of Germanic languages have a big edge since many words are the same and the pronunciation \u2014or the system\u2014 is more or less the same. They also have many good teachers who can serve as a model. Most Dutch speakers and teachers of Dutch in Belgium can speak English easily and can teach it easily, for instance. Germanic languages: (1) Afrikaans 2) Frisian 3) Dutch 4) Norwegian 5) Swedish 6) Danish 7) German 8) Faroese 9) Icelandic being the main one, but we could add Scots,\u2026 although some will classify it as a dialect. There are many other good reasons as well. Others have explained the other causes related to teaching, but it is easier to teach if you have teachers of a Germanic language. Maybe French people\u2019s love of books led them to believe that you could teach by opening books (which is very safe if you cannot speak it or are not a native speaker). Movies should be subtitled in France. There are some valid reasons as to why French people struggle with English. A lot of the words look like French words and so it is hard to fathom a different pronunciation. But, let\u2019s make no mistake about it, the most important reason French cannot speak English is the English spelling system at the vowel level is an embarrassment as a bona fide spelling system, that calling it a system is the greatest scam ever pulled. This takes it toll on the the Anglo-Saxon world too. It takes a lot more teacher hours or teacher (support) to teach and learn it. Taxpayers pay, if the government wants to give ALL its citizens (and their kids) a fighting chance. There are, as a result, many more diverse accents that exhibit more phonemic divergences in the anglosphere which is largely exacerbated by the lack of reforms and the lack of alignment between the spellings of vowel phonemes and the irregularity of those pairings (ie: exceptions). That is simply not the case in languages with shallow orthographies. They have had reforms and Spanish and French accents between their different dialects are by and large much more mutually intelligible. Even French, which looks a lot like English, has more predictability and most of the irregularities are confined to endings, which do not affect reading/decoding all that much and pronunciation, since there are simple rules that govern those silent letters (if followed by an e and its is a consonant don\u2019t say them.) Sure, Canadian French speaker from a small village will be hard to understand. This is largely caused by the way the Catholic church and the English made sure that the population should not receive a proper education. I would not be surprised if there were tacit agreements between the two groups, but I digress. In any case, accents are fast disappearing with \u2014hopefully\u2014more standard teaching. What we know is that English vowel spellings suck and here is a graphic that illustrates that in spades.  13 or so ways to spell one sound, the schwa, which happens to be the most frequent phoneme in the whole language! Wow! Check a few other phonemes and how many lines they have: 12, 11, 10, 9 for 4 others. WHO can actually predict how a NEW word is going to be pronounced by looking at its spelling? Short answer: NO ONE CAN. How do you expect people to know how to pronounce words if the letters used don\u2019t guide you how? If this was a joke, I would laugh, but it affect 1.5 billion people trying to learn this mess (incl. native speakers\u2019 children). Chinese who are used to memorizing everything might actually be okay with it! For details, follow the link given. English at the vowel level is a nightmare and it is unlike any other Western language. It makes sense when you know that they have not reformed their system in 250 years and that the way the system was created was based on a flawed premise: etymological VS phonemic spelling. BTW, some people are confusing proficiency and speaking abilities. Many French speakers can write and read English well:  I wonder why does Portugal speakers do markedly better than most Romance countries and quite well, even compare to Germans? HOWEVER, that is another question. We are speaking about \u2026 speaking. Footnotes[1] John Katt's answer to What are your most controversial or unpopular opinions?",
