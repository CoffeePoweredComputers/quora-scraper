            "answer_text": "Suppose you have written a great book. You put your heart and soul into it. You completely believe in the plot and you just know that it will be a huge success. So you publish the book. And then you wait. Days turn into months. Nothing happens. Barely anyone is even buying your book. The idea was brilliant, right? It should have become a bestseller by now. Then what is going wrong? Here, marketing comes into play. The thing is that there are millions of books getting published every year. So even if your book is the next big thing, it needs to come in front of people to claim its rightful status. Unless people see your book and know that it exists, how are they supposed to decide whether they want to buy it or not? The aim of book marketing is to bring your book in front of the audience who will probably like it and then buy it. Therefore, book marketing can either make or break your book. ",

            "answer_text": "The reality of the publishing world today is that it costs very little to publish a book, but it costs a great deal to get it in the faces of people who will pay for it. With the exception of those rare, truly viral reads, every work needs to be trumpeted if it is to be heard. Promoting a book can be fun - find your own way into the process. There are lots of sites that offer up interesting ideas for promotion. Try some. It\u2019s an entirely different job from writing, but it is equally needed. ",
