Would you write a video library management system in z80 machine code (not even assembly!)? I know someone who did. Programming languages are suited towards writing software to solve specific types of problems. I wouldn\u2019t write a database server in BASIC, or an arcade game in FORTRAN. Just as I have never unscrewed a screw with a hammer. ",
