Her husband (the antagonist, under an assumed name) died shortly after Dimmesdale did, and left Pearl a significant inheritance. Presumably, Pearl set up life on her own as an adult (probably in Europe), prompting Hester to go back to Boston now that Pearl no longer needed her (and likely too guilt-ridden to want to stay in Pearl\u2019s life once she was grown). ETA: Here\u2019s all the book has to say. Hester never told anyone the fate of Pearl, but - \u201cIn fine, the gossips of that day believed\u2014and Mr. Surveyor Pue, who made investigations a century later, believed\u2014and one of his recent successors in office, moreover, faithfully believes\u2014that Pearl was not only alive, but married, and happy, and mindful of her mother; and that she would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside.\u201d No one knew where, but she was one of the richest women in New England thanks to her inheritance, so she could have set herself up just about anywhere she pleased.
