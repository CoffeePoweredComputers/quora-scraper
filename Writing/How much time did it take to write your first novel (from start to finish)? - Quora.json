            "answer_text": "I started my first novel, Scorched Earth, in the summer of 1978, when I was 18 years of age. I began it in the summer and this carried right through my first year in college, when I was studying Film Production, and was completed at the end of the spring during 1979. It was a chore, but also an accomplishment and I didn\u2019t know anyone else, of my age, that wrote a novel. At any rate, it took me a considerably lot longer to fix and rewrite and I need to admit I finally properly reworked the book just last year. The core issue about this first novel is that I was flying that plane blind and with no lessons. I was under the false impression that writing was all about putting words on blank paper and not stopping till the words \u201cThe End!\u201d In other words, I wrote the book cold. This is never a good idea, and especially when a novel is as complex as my first one ended-up becoming. When I ventured into my second and third novels, just into my second and third years in college, I became smarter and designed my books. I left nothing to chance. I created every aspect of the story, and even amazed myself when I realized I knew exactly how many chapters I was needing to write my work, and how long each chapter was going to be. I think I hit upon how books are to be written because bother #2 and #3 were written over a 30 to 40 day period, for each one. It wasn\u2019t until last year that I got into publishing and I realized, that after leaving those books to the side for decades, that all needed serious rework. I therefore made the decision to not touch one aspect of story or character but only to fix the spelling, grammar, and style within each. I wrote all my old material on one of two Brother Typewriters, both of which were my sister\u2019s. One was a small portable and the other an electric. Sad to say, I destroyed both because I had written material which has been lost. In 1984 I was one of the first people I knew who got themselves a PC and I had a great program called EASY (by WordStar) which I used. It was almost WYSIWYG where you got printed exactly as how you typed it on the keyboard. It had one Font, but with large and small sizes and had a built-in Spell Checker. I loved it because it could do left, right, center and full justification. The only thing I didn\u2019t like is that it did not have a grammar checker. The professional word processor that was tops, at the time was WordPerfect 5.1, which actually was a pain in the butt to use until you got good at it. It also did not have a built-in grammar checker but you could link it to software called Grammatik. Anyway, once my worries for spelling and grammar were neutralized all I had to do was worry about the writing. Today, I rarely need the grammar checker (although I use one for a full check of my work), but I still do make errors with spelling - primarily because I hurry with my typing. There you have it \u2014 my first novel was begun in 1978 and was finally fully fixed and published in 2017. There\u2019s Nothing, like finishing something! ",

            "answer_text": "Well I would guess 6 months or more. As it was a children\u2019s story. I made copies then I visited the local 2nd and 3rd grade classes asked them to read it. Then I went back the following week. To get their input to the story. So the direct contact with my audience before I self-published it took some time but I got direct feedback from my audience. That was to me a great help. I did not just write it then went a head with it. Then, I had it illustrated, that took several weeks. Then place the illustrations in the proper places in the text. It takes a lot of time. Then I was running my own business as the same time. So I had many other things going on in my life at the time. I did not look at myself as an author at that time. It took many years later to realize I was an author. Writing was a part time hobby you could say. So time was not on my mind when it came to writing. Ever since then, time has not been a factor in my writings. So to me how long did it take to write my first story is hard for me to judge. Sorry about that. As far as time to write the story it took about 4 or 5 months, I would guess. I was not in a hurry. I had no publisher with a deadline etc. So the majority of my writings are not hurried. I take my time. I got over it many time to get it to say just the way i want it to say. Some times I may get an idea then find a place to put it in. To me a story is just that, a story of some experience or other you may have, perhaps it is unique. Then if that\u2019s the case writing is a lot simpler as you are telling a story from your own experience. A novel is mostly fiction, but in my case it was based on facts. You might find a way to reverse you presentation to your reader. So there can be a lot involved with writing a novel. I my case it was a Factual Fairy Tale I called it. Because it was a fairy tale based on many facts that I was able to find in the telling of the story. Any way, I would not let time be a major factor in your story. Take your time and let it develop. Say what it is you want to say in your own words. After all you are unique in this world. There is no one just like you. Or will there ever be anyone just like you! My advice to you if you want it, is listen to your heart then let it guide you in your writings. It will not lead you astray. Just one man\u2019s opinion. I hope this was helpful! Cheers! Bill ` ",
