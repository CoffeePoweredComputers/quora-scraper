Dear Professor Smith: Your work in the field of prison reform has had an important significance in our country. Its\u2019 impact has made a difference in the arenas of criminal justice and sentence reform for many of our citizens. You have many admirers at our national university and some of them are graduating on June 6, 2017. It would be an honor for both our university and our country if you would speak at that graduation. We will arrange a reception for you to meet our university, community and national leaders who will also be attending your speech. Additionally there will be a VIP luncheon with some of our most notable academic leaders. The university will pay for your travel and expenses as well as include your normal honorarium. You will be welcome to stay a few days and we would be happy to provide a guide to show you our beautiful country. If our invitation interests you, we suggest a Skype call to settle the details and arrangements. We look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely yours, ",
