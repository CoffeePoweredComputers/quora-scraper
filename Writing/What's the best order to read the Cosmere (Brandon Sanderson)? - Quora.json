            "answer_text": "I'd recommend this order, by Drew McCaffrey. It introduces all the characters properly. The timelines are in order wherever it is necessary. Some are put before certain books so that you can understand all crossovers and pick up on the Easter eggs. You won't miss out on any details this way. Mistborn Era 1 trilogyThe Final Empire, The Well of Ascension, Hero of Ages.Eleventh metal (novella)*ElantrisHope of Elantris (novella)*The Emperor's SoulWarbreakerThe e-book and pdf version of this is available for free on Sanderson's site too.White Sand (graphic novels)If you would like to read the prose version of White Sand, Sanderson gives the free draft through email to those who want. The link is available in his newsletter, if you subscribe to it.Shadows for Silence (novella)The Stormlight Archive seriesThe Way of Kings, Words of RadianceEdgedancer (novella)Sixth of the dusk (novella)Oathbringer (Stormlight book 3)Mistborn Era 2Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, The bands of MourningMistborn: Secret History (novella)Arcanum Unbounded essays*The starred novellas are not important, and you don't need to read them. Mistborn: Secret History is a very important novella. (Don't skip the others too.)  You can also start the Cosmere with Warbreaker or Elantris if you want to begin with standalones. Follow the order for all the other books though, so that you know all the characters. There are crossovers, major and minor, and you don't want to be lost when that happens. The White Sand prose is great btw, even if it isn't canon anymore. It\u2019s still pretty close, and there's more character development than in the graphic novels. Read it first, I'd suggest. Especially if you don't like graphic novels, like me. Lastly, watch out for Hoid! The world-hopper who appears in nearly every book (in disguise, of course). ",

            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t really a set order. I didn\u2019t know what the Cosmere was when I picked up Way of Kings as my first Sanderson book. In some ways, I\u2019m glad I started there because many readers would argue that is his best book. It definitely set the hook for me. It is not for everyone though. I would explicitly recommend not reading The Stormlight Archive first if you haven\u2019t read many books longer than 600 pages (each book in the TSA is 1100 - 1300 pages long). If looking for something a little lighter, I\u2019d recommend starting with Warbreaker. Warbreaker is a really good intro to Brandon and the Cosmere. It also represents a substantial upgrade in writing quality from Brandon\u2019s first book, Elantris (also Cosmere). Other thoughts? Don\u2019t read Mistborn Era 2 prior to Era 1 unless you\u2019re OK with some minor spoilers for Era 1. The trick is that Era 2 would actually be a great intro to both Sanderson and the Cosmere as that series is a bit lighter (both in feel and by page count) than either Mistborn Era 1 or The Stormlight Archive. The Cosmere also somewhat centers around Mistborn (Brandon has plans for writing 2 more Mistborn series or \u201ceras\u201d before completing the Cosmere collection. Read Elantris only after having sampled at least 2 of the other Cosmere worlds. Elantris is, IMO, not a particularly great book. It\u2019s certainly good for an author\u2019s first published novel, but it\u2019s not one that\u2019s going to give the reader a very good sampling of how Brandon has grown as a writer or much of a connection to the Cosmere.
