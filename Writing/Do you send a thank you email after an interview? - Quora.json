            "answer_text": "My opinion of this is that I would *only* do this if I *really really* thought I was the perfect fit for the job, the interviewers seemed to suggest I would be a good fit, and I *really really* wanted to get this job. Otherwise, if it\u2019s an average job, I figure that since 9/10 times the interviewers never give me any feedback on my performance in the interviewer, I wouldn\u2019t waste my time writing a thank card or email afterwards. I\u2019d make an exception to an interviewer who rejected me for a position and gave me details on why they rejected me afterwards. I would respond back to them with an e-mail thanking them for the constructive feedback, assuming the feedback was more than: \u201cwe didn\u2019t like you.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Should you send a thank you card or a thank you email after a job interview? Absolutely you should, but do not send cards or e-mails. Handwritten cards are hard to read. E-mails are bland and cold. They can be diverted to spam files, summarily deleted, blocked or bounced back. Never mind busy people at all levels must contend with legions of e-mails every day; your thank-you e-mail may not be read for days or may not be viewed altogether. Instead, work up, word process in good business letter form and mail thank-you letters. Along with expressing thanks for the interview, use your letter to reiterate and reinforce points you covered in your interview. Use your letter to raise and cover points you didn\u2019t have the opportunity to raise during the interview. Use your letter to express your excitement about the possibility of working for the employer and how you look forward to hearing from employer shortly. All of these things are impossible to cram onto a card. Besides, busy people are used to reading print instead of handwriting - you want your sentiments to be as legible as possible. Sending thank-yous in business letter form demonstrates understanding of business protocols. They provide another opportunity to sell communication abilities and provide a better opportunity to sell one\u2019s self than a card. ",

Are you interested in a position with a company that deals with the company you interviewed with? Send a thank you. A thank you costs you nothing (or at most the cost of stamp and paper), and shows you understand business etiquette, that you are interested (and didn\u2019t just interview because \u201cwhy not\u201d), and lays a small remembrance of you for potential future contacts with that business. Always send a thank you. ",
