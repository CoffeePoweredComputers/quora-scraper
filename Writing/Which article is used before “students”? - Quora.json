            "answer_text": "You can have a plural noun like \u2018students\u2019 with no article (\u2018zero article\u2019) when your sentence carries the meaning \u2018all students\u2019, as in \u201cStudents have one main job, and that is to study.\u201d Since you can\u2019t put \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018an\u2019 before a plural noun, you can\u2019t say \u201ca students\u201d in any situation. You could and would say \u2018the students\u2019 if the students you\u2019re talking about are known by the listener/reader. As in \u201cThe students in my class come from many other countries\u201d; because I\u2019m defining the students as the ones \u201cin my class\u201d, I use the definite article \u2018the\u2019. You could also use other determiners (not \u2018articles\u2019, specifically), such as \u2018some\u2019, \u2018any\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018all\u2019; these determiners are called \u2018quantifiers\u2019. Other determiners you could use include \u2018these\u2019 and \u2018those\u2019 (demonstrative determiners) and the possessives, like \u201cmy students\u201d, \u201cour students\u201d, (and \u201cyour\u201d, \u201chis\u201d, \u201cher\u201d, \u201ctheir\u201d, and \u201cwhose\u201d) I think the answer you\u2019re looking for though, is the.
