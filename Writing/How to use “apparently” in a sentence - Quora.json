Your example, \u201cApparently, I can\u2019t be responsible for everything\u201d is also sarcastic. It\u2019s something you\u2019d say if you had all the work dumped on you, everyone else went home, and came back the next morning wondering why it wasn\u2019t all done yet. \u201cApparently there was a bad storm on the east coast last night.\u201d Here, \u201capparently\u201d means that you\u2019ve heard there was a bad storm but it hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet. You could also say \u201cIt seems there was a bad storm on the east coast last night.\u201d \u201cSeem\u201d and \u201cappear\u201d are often interchangeable. But when you say \u201cA ghost appeared in front of me,\u201d \u201cappear\u201d is the only one that works. It doesn\u2019t mean \u201cillusion\u201d though. If you think it was one, you have to make that additionally clear. In this context \u201cappear\u201d means to materialize, or to take shape. \u201cSuddenly, the whole solution appeared in my mind.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Apparently is an adverb. Something which is apparent is something which can be seen (seen to be true). If you want to use apparently in a sentence, usually it is set off by a comma: Apparently, it is possible to carry an umbrella on the train. It is apparent (seen) because people can be observed on the train carrying umbrellas. It is also used when some indication can be seen that a certain fact is accurate - but you don\u2019t actually KNOW - so you say \u2018apparently\u2019 which explains that, as far as you know - having seen or understood something - a third unknown \u2018something\u2019 is true - but you don\u2019t know DIRECTLY - it is only APPARENTLY so - it appears to be so. Apparently, a poltergeist has been active in the locked library overnight (because items were moved or knocked over in a locked room). There may, of course, be a completely different reason, but (for the moment) a poltergeist seems (appears) to be the most likely explanation (until the hidden secret passage is discovered, that is).
