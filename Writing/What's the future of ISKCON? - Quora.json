            "answer_text": "like all things material, it will grow, expand and eventually wither away to obscurity. Nothing in this planet is permanent. The Gods which ancients worshiped today we have no idea or we have changed it completely. Its predicted that earth itself will become so hot that all living things will perish in 1000 years. Then there is always this risk of natural disasters and asteroids falling and destroying everything. Basically neither Krishna, nor Jesus nor Allah, nothing of it really matters. Science has shown that eventually everything is matter and energy changing one form to another and at times going to a black hole state of voidness to emerge back into a new universe again . So better to make most of present rather than wondering about future especially of religious organizations. ",

            "answer_text": "If ISKCON continues with service to human being as is being done now, the organisation will continue gloriously. Any Service oriented organisation can continue, if it continues on dharmic path. If the organisers or priests turn selfish, commit any adharmic activities, they will be evicted out, if only few numbers are involved. If they are in large numbers, then the organisation will perish. The strength of the Organisation is in the people involved in the organisation holding on to intended objectives and principles. ",
