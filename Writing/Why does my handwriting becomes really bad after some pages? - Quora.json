            "answer_text": " Dear Michael and Jasmine, You are not alone with this problem. I share it, bigtime, with hand cramps, unless I take sensible precautions. Handwriting is both an athletic and mental exercise, just like basketball or swimming or dancing is. Your entire personality is wrapped up in the lines you are inscribing on the surface (mostly on paper, but increasingly on iPro screens). Into those linear forms you are bringing the most sophisticated practices of your mentality (brains) and when what is being written describes deep thinking this exercise can be extremely tiring (like an hour of full-court basketball or dancing a full ballet). If you are not practiced enough, or are improperly situated in reference to the surface you are writing on, you will tire out sooner than later. Full force expression of your personality takes planning, practice and discipline to sustain. Among the most comfortable ways to handwrite is to be seated in a comfortable, straight-backed chair, at a desk where you can rest your forearm as you write. This isn\u2019t always possible, of course, but when you have a long stint of handwriting ahead, it\u2019s best to have a place where your body is more-or-less upright, you are using a writing instrument that you like (or love), the surface is clean and uncluttered, your back is as straight as you can get it (many people lean in and over their work; it\u2019s a hard habit to break, and it causes a lot of spinal pain). You might also try to write on unlined paper, which allows more room for your personality to play itself (you may even find yourself deciding to make sketches). If you are writing something which others are intended to read, then your stamina will fade after a while; even an hour without a break is a great long time to keep writing legibly because so much energy is consumed in the thinking process if it\u2019s being done correctly. One or two pages (depending on how big or small you write) is on the lower end of the scale, but with good equipment and good posture, you ought easily be able to quadruple that. After eight or so pages, take a break. Play some pool, shoot darts, run around the block, get your mind clear and calm, and then start writing again. Keep in mind that if you take good care of your personality, your handwriting will clearly reflect that care. For example, if you see that the dots over your i and j letters are sharp slashes and tics instead of little round dots, your impatience is getting the better of you and you may do what is required to calm down and concentrate. It\u2019s interesting that you choose to handwrite at all since so many people are entirely addicted to keyboards and some scorn script. Handwriting is now a tool of the rich and/or smart elite, not the keyboard-bound hoi polloi, who are mostly all thumbers. You are exceptional and if you continue down that less trod path, you may find greater accomplishment and enjoyment. Bravo! ",

Then again, it\u2019s impossible to tell precisely in your specific situation \u2014 I don\u2019t know you personally and have never seen you in action with a pen. But on balance of probability, it\u2019s your pen grip. Thanks for the A2A. Update:\u2014 This is what happens when schools have dropped penmanship as a taught school subject. (Penmanship is different from calligraphy, notwithstanding contrary opinions.) I belong to the last batch of pupils to have had penmanship lessons in school (taught under the aegis of English Language classes). The traditional handgrip is this:\u2014  (via Quora photo search) My handgrip is as the photo shows. My hands have no corns or calluses. I enjoy something of a reputation in my circle of people for being able to write for literally hours non-stop (and I do mean literally). I used to be a lawyer so extended writing was an occupational hazard. ",
