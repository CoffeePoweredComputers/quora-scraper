            "answer_text": "Contrary to what your teacher might tell you, the key to good writing is not to follow some rule or recipe that tells you exactly what to do. The key to good writing is to think of something interesting or useful to say, then say it. Content is king, every time. You can write an essay that has short paragraphs, or long ones. Match your style to your content, not the other way around. That said, general problems occur when writing especially long sentences or paragraphs, these being typically easy to identify once you reach the revision stage and begin to read your writing aloud; namely, that one's content gets harder to follow the more of it one attempts to stuff into a big long sentence such as this one \u2014 nonetheless that style did not prevent certain writers from becoming famous (for instance James Joyce, whose individual sentences could be pages long); personally I care little for this style, and your teacher will be delighted to have an easy excuse to mark you down (consider the difficulty inherent in a teacher's job; good writing is not something that is easily captured by rules or rubrics, yet fairness and consistency demand that when students come forth asking to know why they received the grade that they did, or why their own grade was lower than another student's, that the teacher be able to cite a system that was followed consistently throughout the grading process \u2014 hence the stereotype that teachers grade \u201crobotically\u201d \u2014 and ironically enough this very attempt at fairness often leads to the perception of unfairness) and taking all of this into consideration, the correct decision is usually to keep your sentences relatively short, and to use 3\u20135 of them per paragraph, and to have each paragraph represent a self-contained \u201cthought\u201d that is difficult to subdivide further. You can also write like this. Where each sentence is its own paragraph. You see this a lot on Quora. It's bad. It's. Really. Annoying. It reads like you're waiting for an applause after every line. Did I mention it's bad? It's grandstanding. It's obnoxious. It's insulting to the reader. It's repetitive. It's tiresome. It's so boring. Please don't do this. Have some respect. <Wild applause> ",

            "answer_text": "That all depends on how long the piece of string is. That is to say you need to set parameters. The first thing you need to consider is what type of essay you are writing. Is the essay academic? What is the purpose of the essay? what is the length of the essay?  Generally people go for the 5 paragraph method. this works well enough at 1000 words but breaks down above that. What they often mistake is that your essay has 5 sections not 5 paragraphs. A paragraph is a self enclosed thought or scene. A singular point if you will. These individual points are then put together to form the essay. So it depends on how long you are writing about a distinct point. This article explain quite nicely that the roughly 100-200 word length for a paragraph is not necessarily a strict guideline What's the Rule About Paragraph Length?. I would say that that is very good advice. Personally I use the paragraph (like most people do) to cover a single idea or concept as I said above. This means there can be a wide variety of lengths. I do try to keep a paragraph at 3/4 of a page at most otherwise that is likely a sign that I am rambling. Interestingly look at all of the answers that are written here. Do you notice something? they all use paragraphs. Some are shorter and some are longer but they contain individual concepts.  So to sum up. If you are looking at the 100-200 word rule a 1000 word essay would have 5-10, a 2000 word essay 10-20, and so on.  Do not confuse sections with paragraphs. Sections generally have header sin longer works but in essays you should be able to tell the difference by what is written. If you main point has three aspects then that second section (after the introduction) is probably going to have three paragraphs. Whether you leave gaps or indent or whatever your style guide says don't worry too much about having the right amount of paragraphs. ",
