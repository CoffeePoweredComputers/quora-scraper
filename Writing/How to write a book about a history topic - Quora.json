            "answer_text": "More than anything else you will need to know your topic as well as possible. I am not certain by your question if you are working on nonfiction or fiction, but I think my initial suggestion is the one to be followed. If you are writing nonfiction then it is seriously important that you know as much as possible, including little-known facts and details, and to make absolutely certain that you reference everything. There is little worse that can happen with nonfiction than some zealous historian out to prove your facts are dubious and therefore putting into question your conclusions. Considering fiction, as in a period piece, you need to really know the period you set your novel. The historical facts you might describe should be as accurate as possible, to lend realism to your story. Also, since your story will necessitate the need for players, you should get to know as much as possible about the way people spoke during that time. You do not want to start using modern slang and colloquialisms in your period piece that may be set 500 years into the past. If you are setting your time in 17th Century England you will need to know the English of the time. You could not even have two friends talking about going \u201cdowntown\u201d, for example, or commenting at some experience as \u201ccool\u201d. If you are highlighting women you are not likely to have a couple of girlfriends going out for a spa day, or even going to get some perms. When it comes to writing anything set in a historical context, the key is to not leave factual details to chance. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two approaches you can take to this: Textbook style and historical drama. The former is the kind that schools will absolutely love. If you give an accurate presentation of the facts in a comprehensive and organized manner, schools will buy it by the dozens. If you choose to write this kind, then simply familiar yourself with every nuance concerning your topic and write about them in a linear order, properly explaining obscure terms and topics. Writing a textbook, however, is fun only to a limited number of people, and reading a textbook is boring to just about every student forced to read it. Instead, you might be drawn to an alternative option: historical drama. This is a novel which is based upon historical events but tells them in the form of a story. Writing these you will often have to add to or subtract from history in order to create a story which is both complete and streamlined. You will likely have to create a lot of dialogue for yourself, since often a historical event was not perfectly recorded. I personally prefer the second approach, and I honestly hope to write a historical drama someday. However, it is ultimately up to you which kind you would prefer writing. ",
