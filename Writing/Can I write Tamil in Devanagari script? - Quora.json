            "answer_text": "You can certainly write Tamil using Northern (read it as Devanagari) letters. But probably you may make some approximations. There can be severe errors because Short and song vowels are not complete in Devanagari. Tamil does not distinguish voiced consonants and non voiced. The pronunciation is position dependant. For example, the word Mukam means face. The word is pronounced more like Muham rather than as Mukam or Mugham or Mukham. So when you write in Devanagari you may commit errors. Also considering the fact that the current script is well entrenched and will not serve the population. Many would consider such an attempt to be piggery and cultural http://userpation.It will not be successful. ",
