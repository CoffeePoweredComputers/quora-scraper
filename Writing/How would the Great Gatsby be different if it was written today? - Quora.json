            "answer_text": "When I gave that question as a test or essay assignment, I made certain my students knew what I was looking for. The markers of a strong answer are, among other possibilities: 1. The identities of the characters, as they relate to both the cultural context of the novel\u2019s setting and how they would relate to a 21st century setting 2. The differences in culture context between then and now as a parameter separate from the characters\u2019 identities 3. The artistic language used by the author at the time as it would be changed or perceived based on 21st century language. 4. A simple discussion of the changes in technology and how it would change the characters\u2019 actions between then and now. Depending on the nature of the assignment\u2014-full research paper, one paragraph short answer essay answer on a test, or a number of different formats between those two extremes, I would be looking for full development of one or more of those four parameters, along with additional insight provided by the student\u2019s personal reaction to the book. I would suggest to my students that they close with an evaluation of the timeless nature of the novel, good, bad, or neutral, in their opinion, supported with reasons from the text and/or their own experiences for that evaluation.

            "answer_text": "Today, Gatsby\u2019s relentless pursuit of Daisy would be regarded not as romantic, but as obsessive and creepy. I suppose you could use the plot by making Daisy an artist who has married her patron, and having Gatsby try to attract her attention by creating an artist\u2019s collective and non-profit along the Ghost Ship Oakland lines.
