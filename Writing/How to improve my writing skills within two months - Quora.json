            "answer_text": "Yes, take a writing course from a good trainer and do a lot of writing within the time e.g. doing your trainer's assignments, blogging, answering questions here on Quora etc. Your trainer could be a person, online course or an institution. An example of an online trainer that cost you nothing but provides excellent training include Khan Academy, ALISON etc. Those two mentioned here are really good. ALISON offers you several courses in writing, Literature and Journalism. I regularly study diverse disciplines including Computer Programming with them. It's for free. You only pay token for certificate if you need one. ",
