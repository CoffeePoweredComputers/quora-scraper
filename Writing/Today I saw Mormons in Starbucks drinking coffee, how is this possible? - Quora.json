            "answer_text": "Well like non Mormons they take a swallow and drink. How do you know they were LDS, how do you know they ordered coffee? How do you know they are active members who choose to obey that particular health related directive? It seems your making a bunch of assumptions. But lets play along and assume all your asumptions are correct. What do you mean how I this possible? Were you thinking they would burst into flames or turn into a frog? It\u2019s just a drink of really hot stimulants derived from beans. What were you expecting to happen? Pherahps you misunderstand Latter-day Saints beleifs in general. They are not slaves to some religious zealotry that would demand they die for braking its code. In fact the LDS church\u2019s most basic teachings after a belief in God the Father and his Son is also a belief in free agency, in making our own choices and deciding for ourselves what is right or wrong. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the phrase \u201cgive a man a fish and they eat for a day, teach them to fish and they eat fora lifetime\u201d Or \u201cteach children in good and correct principles and they will live them all their lives\u201d or \u201c teach a person correct principles and people will govern themselves\u201d. These ideas are not unlike the basic tenants of LDS teachings, that people who are free to make their own decisions and should also be responsible for their own actions. That most people are inherently good, and when taught good and sound principles as children will make wise choices as adults. Drinking coffee is not something we are allergic to or terrified of. We instead have been taught to strive (but are imperfect at) avoiding stimulants, illegal drugs, chemicals that are harmful for our bodies and excessive abuses of any substance, even things that are healthy can be bad you you when eaten or taken too much. So you might run into a LDS member who drinks coffee but thats a personal choice for whatever reason. Perhaps its an addiction, perhaps its prescribed, perhaps they drank it before joining the LDS church and struggle to break the habit. Or perhaps they were enjoying the fine Starbucks cocoaM ",

            "answer_text": "And you knew they were Mormons (members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) how? Or, if they were missionaries\u2014easily identifiable\u2014you knew they had ordered coffee how? They could have been drinking hot chocolate or some overpriced non-coffee concoction. But, hey, why would it surprise you that a person could fall short of ideals that they set for themselves? Do you think that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are perfect? We worship a perfect being, but we don\u2019t purport to be perfect.  I was a bishop\u2014I counseled members who struggled with far worse than coffee. It happens. We\u2019re human. And, how can you now use your knowledge that some people struggle with living up to high ideals to help society? Or, does it make you feel better when someone else fails? In which case, I suggest you need to spend more time at Church\u2014any Church. God will forgive whom He will forgive\u2014but we are commanded to forgive seventy times seven times\u2026 So even if this supposed coffee drinking is a personal affront to all you hold dear, the command is unmistakable: 21 \u00b6 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? 22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
