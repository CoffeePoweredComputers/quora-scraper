            "answer_text": "\u2018The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\u2019 by Agatha Christie is a stand-alone novel and is considered by most critics to be her masterpiece. In fact, almost all the novels of Agatha Christie are stand-alone and can be read in any order. However, it is advisable to read her novels as per year chronologically in order to better appreciate the evolution of her detective characters over the years. It also helps in understanding her style and skills in story development and climaxing. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Its a stand alone novel. All of Christie's books are stand alone novels. But its preferred that you read the novels chronologically by their release dates (or as per the order of books written on the back of the cover of every Christie book) to gain a good grip of Poirot or Marple\u2019s character development throughout her books. Cheers. ",
