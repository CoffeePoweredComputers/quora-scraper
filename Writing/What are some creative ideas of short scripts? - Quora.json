            "answer_text": "Depends on what genre you are or wanting to write for. You may want to attend film festivals and watch short films made by other filmmakers to give you a clear picture of what ideas are currently being explored for short films. If you ask me, think of something crazy and unique. Something that people will be confused at first, but will then later appreciate your talent, creativity and vision. To name a few ideas: Living life to the fullest despite a deadly disease or medical condition,Overcoming a phobia of some sort - like claustrophobia for instance,A seemingly odd fetish that other characters around the main lead have to contend with, or,Trying to save another character from him/their self.The list is just a guide, but it is entirely up to you to brainstorm other ideas for a short film. I\u2019d recommend using something has happened to you so profound, that it is worth telling a story about. ",
