            "answer_text": "In a draconian sense, the word \u2018author\u2019 is anyone who is credited with the genesis of a literary, prose work, be it a short story, novel, novella, comic book, script, play, etc. Regardless, being the imperfect organisms we are, our conventional perception of \u2018author\u2019 is somewhat tethered to selective or certain works of literature. Since definitions do get altered to suit the tides of understanding and interpretation, the general accreditation of \u2018author\u2019 is given to the person who is the writer of a novel, story and biographies. Those who blog are bloggers, who write articles are writers, and plays playwrights. The word \u2018writer\u2019 is universal in this regard, even furcating into the realm of poetry and song-writing. What we discern, taking history\u2019s testimony, is that people have rigidized the scope of utility of some words, and have instead standardised words of narrow temperament. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. I don\u2019t think people can call themselves authors \u2014 without being at least a little full of crap \u2014 until they have written a book. I have written one book, but I won\u2019t really feel comfortable calling myself an author until most of my income comes from my books. That\u2019s a high bar, though. Other people are pretty flexible about what type of writers can be called authors. One of my colleagues considers himself an author because he is the \u201cauthor\u201d of various articles. Based on this argument, any writer can also be an author. I don\u2019t agree with his view, but he is entitled to it, and there are other people who feel that way. ",
