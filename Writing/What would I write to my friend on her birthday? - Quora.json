            "answer_text": "well it depends on the kind of relationship ypu have with that friend of yours. I'll just pretend the type of relationship of you with her in points:- If she's your crush & you want to confess your feelings for her then start off with wishing her a very happy birthday & then start writing the things you like about her & then later on start mentioning things on how you got to learn because of her. then write about the beautiful movements you've spent with her (in brief) if any so that she may too be able to recall it & then she won't find it creepy & whatever you write it must be true because a girl knows when a boy is lying. And for god's sake Don't flirt or say i love you in the letter coz i believe those things are supposed to be said on face to face conversations. well that's the case later on. as for now. you can add a little sense of humour if you want to & then you should be fine. at this way if she rejects you, that way, then the least thing that will happen is that she will respect your feelings.As for a normal Friends case, start off with simple happy birthday + the nickname if you have any & then start writing about the things you've done together & start appreciating the things she had done for you & thank her for that. that way she will smile whole day because of you. who knows maybe she will fall for you.Last but not least remember, any girl will appreciate the kind words you've written them for. & it will be even more effective if you just hand them over the letter & wrote them in your won handwriting. even if your handwriting sucks. that way it'll highlight the hard work you've done for them. Thanks for reading this till now\u2026! Hope you write one hell of a letter for your friend..!",
