            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t do it. Many countries and companies have rules against nepotism- favors from relatives. We all know it happens, but it would not be a good idea to leave a paper trail of evidence. I would hope you have a good enough relationship with your uncle so he really could and would help you. If so, you should have a good enough relationship to talk to him on the phone. Call him on the phone, ask him about the best way to get a job where he currently works\u2014- don\u2019t just tell him you need a job there. This way you are not putting him on the spot in an uncomfortable and possibly illegal situation or one that at least violates company policy. Let him come up with his own ideas on helping you. If he is well enough connected, he might in fact be able to get you a job behind the scenes. At minimum he can probably tell you the inside scoop on the best way to apply and have a decent chance of hire for that particular company, saving you lots of wasted time. I would not write a letter telling him you \u201cneed\u201d employment there. You are putting him in a very uncomfortable situation, where he is being pressured to make a choice: put his own reputation and position on the line professionally or choose not to help extended family and it is being done in writing. A more informal approach would be to request his help- he can then choose the best way to use his knowledge and influence to help a relative in a way that will reflect his true confidence in your abilities and worthiness. If I personally had a niece or nephew go the letter route, I would likely see it as an attempt at coercion coming from a sense of entitlement, almost blackmail, and likely that relative would not have any chance of getting my support ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm. So much depends on how well you know your uncle - do you see him often? Have you ever met him? I also think that it\u2019s difficult to advise you without an understanding of your family\u2019s view on such things; for example, some families feel that there is an implied obligation to \u2018look after\u2019 each other - including providing employment for extended-family members, where possible. Is this the case with yours? And, then, What does your uncle do and where does he do it?Does he own a business or just have a position with a company/enterprise?How influential is his position?Are they recruiting at the moment?Do you have work experience he/that business can make use of - or don\u2019t you need any?Can he/his employers, afford to employ you?Will there be Visa/Work Permit issues?Do some research about his business/the business he works for. I\u2019d advise that you show him the same respect you would exhibit if you were applying for any other job. Find out about the product(s), service(s), markets and/or clients. If you really think you could be useful to him, then start there, with your letter: Dear Uncle ??, (As you know?) I have experience as a xxx and would really welcome the opportunity to work for you/your company as a xxx/in a xxx capacity. The skills and knowledge I would bring to this position are xxx and I think this could enhance the xxx aspect of your/your employer\u2019s business. I would dearly love to live and work in xxxx, and would be so grateful if you could see your way to employing me/recommending me for work/recruiting me. In fact, I would be willing to take whatever opening you/your employer might have, and that you think might be suitable for me. I am certain I would quickly prove my worth to your business - and I would so welcome the opportunity it would afford me. (As you know??) I am a hard worker and very conscientious. As evidence of this, I attach/enclose my CV. Thank you so much for any consideration you can give this application. With kindest regards (etc) xxxx Good luck! ",
