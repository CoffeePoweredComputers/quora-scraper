            "answer_text": "Ideally, and if writing is your trade, yes. In practice, the more frequently you feel the insatiable need to write, the better \u2014 whether that means twice a week, every second day, or every 2 hours. However, intent to write and thinking about it is often more important than the actual act of writing it down. As in any art, writing is something that is cultivated in the spirit and mind. As a first rule of thumb, I would say working on your writing spiritually/mentally daily (cultivating it) is the most important thing you can do, followed by practice in the act of actually writing your thoughts and imaginings down, planning, structuring, and expressing yourself richly in writing/editing \u2014 the latter skills developing gradually by your studying of your craft and in the practical experience of actually writing your thoughts down. Always remember that practice makes \u201cperfect\u201d, that your writing will never be flawless \u2014 only get better with practice \u2014 and that everyone needs to start somewhere. To quote Ernest Hemingway: \u201cDon\u2019t get discouraged because there\u2019s a lot of mechanical work to writing. There is, and you can\u2019t get out of it. I rewrote the first part of A Farewell to Arms at least fifty times. You\u2019ve got to work it over. The first draft of anything is shit. When you first start to write you get all the kick and the reader gets none, but after you learn to work it\u2019s your object to convey everything to the reader so that he remembers it not as a story he had read but something that happened to himself.\u201d The spirit is there, but the writing is lacking the right expression, formatting, and quality to effectively communicate the intent. Editing/revising helps to improve your written work, but the spirit/intent that formed that first draft is very much essential to your writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on an individual. But if u want me to suggest something then, it would definitely be writing everyday because after many days or years when you feel like u r alone and want an awesome company to be with then you can re- read ur answers and be shocked  about  the way u have evolved over the time. Its really ironic that nothing changes from day to day but when we look back ,everything changes. Same is the case with our thoughts. Day to day consequences make us grow. The way we look at the problem, the way we approach to the solution and the way we react to the problem changes regularly.Let me give u a small example. when a pen was initially taken into a space , they found that because of low gravity to less gravity, the ink would flow out of the refill.Then they started designing a refill which could be taken to the space and when taken, the ink wouldn't flow out. That was an open question then. Many people did research on it and then there was a small boy who suggested that let us use pencil (a thing which was already present). Isn't it great that the question was same for every 1 I.e. , from the scientists to a common man. But the way of approach to solve the problem differs.And there is a scientific reason that writing improves our thoughts and ideas. Just go for it and feel the difference after one month. ",
