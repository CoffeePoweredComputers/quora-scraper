            "answer_text": "To maximize your chances of successful stain removal, it is important to get to the stain before it has had a chance to set in. So try and get to work removing the stain as soon as you possibly can. There are a couple of ways to do this: If it\u2019s a wet ink stain, first lightly dab at the stain so you soak up the ink without letting it spread. After the stain dries, dab alcohol on to it and then dab the reverse of the stained fabric with a paper towel so that it soaks up the alcohol, along with the ink that it is dislodged by the alcohol. Keep using fresh paper towels to mop up more and more and more of the stain. Tip \u2013 in a pinch, hair spray can also work.A hand sanitizer (these are typically alcohol based) will help do the trick as well. Soak the stain in this and then wash the garment in the hottest water that the care instructions allow. Also add bleach to your wash (again check the instructions) and then air dry your clothing. Repeat process if required.For printer ink spills on white fabric, chlorine bleach in cold water typically works well. For colored clothing, use a dilute mixture of ammonia detergent, again in cold water.Tip \u2013 use cold water and not hot; do not mix chlorine bleach and ammonia. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You can use rubbing alcohol for the purpose. Dip a clean cotton swab into rubbing alcohol. Dab at the soaked up ink mark with it. Repeat this each time with a fresh cotton swab. Use another fresh cotton swab into cold water to remove the alcohol from the fabric. ",
