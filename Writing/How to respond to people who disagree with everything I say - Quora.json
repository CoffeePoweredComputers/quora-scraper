            "answer_text": "My brain quickly tries to justify why I\u2019m right and everyone else is wrong. Traffic comes right to mind. I want to go, efficiently and quickly. I don\u2019t talk or look at my phone when I\u2019m driving . I concentrate on just driving and every car around me and want to always drive 5\u201310 mph over speed limits. I think my idea or interpretation of driving is what\u2019s different than seemingly everyone else. Driving is just transportation to a destination I want to be at. If I\u2019m not where I am I\u2019m wasting time so I want to get to where I\u2019m going as quickly (and relatively safely) as possible. If everyone thought this way I believe everyone would drive with more attention and efficiency. But most people don\u2019t. It sucks for me. So my brain will conclude that everyone else is inept, distracted, and purposely slowing my commute which I perceive as a borderline personal attack. Unfortunately I can not shake this thinking. I\u2019m 41 and have driven everyday since I was 16. I\u2019ve tried so many different ways to change my mindset, even distract myself, music, audiobooks, breathing, counting, etc and nothing in my mind changes. So when I disagree with what most people think or do is get mad, frustrated, and convince myself that everyone else sucks. Not a cool way to be so I suppose I\u2019ll keep on meditating (not whilest driving) and hopefully become more patient and accepting like I have with other aspects of my life. Thank you for reading.

            "answer_text": "If someone disagrees with you you should make sure you listen to exactly what they\u2019re saying, rather than what you think they\u2019re saying. Too many times people end up arguing with their own assumptions. It\u2019s best you repeat what they said and ask them to confirm that\u2019s what they meant: \u201dSo, you\u2019re saying that the egg came before the chicken because the chicken had to come from somewhere, is that right?\u201d The other thing you should do is stay calm and respectful, even if your opponent is not. Two people shouting at each other achieves nothing but that, and you\u2019ll find if you stay consistently calm, your opponent is more likely to stay calm too. If the way your opponent decided to argue with you is through logical fallacies, in other words, they put words in your mouth, do your best to make your original points over and over again and don\u2019t start discussing what they claim you\u2019ve said: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say we should completely ban wearing hats. I just think that we should ban hat wearing on Sundays. The complete ban isn\u2019t something I proposed.\u201d Lastly, remember that someone disagreeing with you isn\u2019t a personal attack on you. It\u2019s possible to disagree with someone\u2019s opinion and not think them stupid or uneducated, or indeed have any judgement about their character. ",
