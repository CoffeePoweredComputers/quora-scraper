            "answer_text": "You just need to search for content writers on social media like Facebook , join some FB groups and post your question there and good content writers would approach you and they will quote their price for each and every post. You can have a word with them and finalize your price as you will get many content writers who will ask you from RS,200 to RS,1000. Some content writers charge high amount as their content is very good as compared to others . You just need to talk to all of them and find the right one as per your Niche and your requirement. Beware, there are many content writers who are real cheaters. The take the money first and would never show up. I have seen some content writers who just copy paste others conent and sell it for low price and earn good money. So make sure that you finalize a good content writer. Even IAM a content writer and I always give half of the content first and charge half the money and then I give the remaining content and ask for the remaining half. Because there are many cheaters so I would suggest you to be an a safer side always. If you have any doubts then you can always approach me. Dhanush ",
