            "answer_text": "She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie, Cocaine She's a lying bitch, and she is sooooooo good at it, always promises more but always gives a little less. It's the nature of the bitch. I'd do it till gone or till I was so fucking crazed that I couldn't get a needle in my arm to save my life. And that's probably exactly what it did, because my blood was so fucking messed up that it would coagulate as soon as I drew it into the syringe. It was acidic and it was probably ready to clot and throw one right to my lungs, or heart, or my brain, but I still didn't want to stop. I hated to snort it so when I couldn't shoot it anymore and ruined a pile trying to shoot it one more time, it was over til I passed out and did it again the next day when my eyes were open. I finally ruined my veins, or at least the ones I was willing to shoot up in, and I thought that the relationship was over, then the bitch showed back up as a rock. I could smoke her till she was gone and go back to where I knew she was hanging out till the owners of the house wouldn't let me come anymore that night. I waited till the next day and started the same routine. But unlike the needle, the pipe never quit and soon the money was tight. So tight that I spent my children's Christmas money for their presents, wrote $5000 in bad checks, searched the floor on my hands and knees for a rock that I just knew I had dropped, but it would never end. What I'm saying is, it never ends. None of us can control that bitch. The time will come when your board with sniffing it, and someone will just happen to have a rock or a needle. Never say never, because once you get a hit with the high that the needle or the pipe will give, you're going to wish you knew it long before. There is no rush, no orgasm, nothing that compares with the high you can get with the equipment over the nose. Regardless of whether you ever go that far, even your nose will wear out. But you'll never find that enough is enough. And what got you ripped the last couple few weeks will soon only be the beginning of the 48 hrs you just spent. It never ends and it's never enough. She don't lie, because she never promised you anything to begin with. Your hearing the same story from everyone and you're going to end up like the rest of us did, and we found out too, after all the warnings and the examples of those we knew that she don't lie, cause she's Cocaine.

            "answer_text": "Why? Because it feels amazing.. (and it\u2019s addictive) I\u2019ve done that. A lot. I tried for years to see, if maybe I could balance my usage, maybe if I just take once in a blue moon. Didn\u2019t work for me. Aaron Hitson is very right, this can only spiral downwards. It\u2019s gonna be really hard if you wanna kick it. Really hard. It\u2019s one of the absolute hardest things I\u2019ve done, but I\u2019d be dead otherwise. You binge coke because the drug is constructed that way. It\u2019s part of the addiction. You\u2019ll stay up days and nights for the whore in the white dress. ",
