Rather than learning how to take responsibility for his own learning, he will learn that Mom will do it for him. What kind of lesson is that? Many years ago, we had a parent who came in mad because her son got a \u201cC\u201d on his social studies report. She couldn\u2019t understand why, because she had written it, and Johnny should have gotten an \u201cA.\u201d Unfortunately, Mom wasn\u2019t an \u201cA\u201d student. Instead, Mom taught him that it is okay to turn in work done by someone else with his name on it, and he never got to complete the assignment. As teachers, we work with students to develop their skills and assess their learning. We are not teaching Mom how to write a report or complete an assignment. We want parents to help as part of the learning team, but doing an assignment for their child teaches him nothing, not about the topic, not about researching and organizing thoughts, not about constructing a well-written, informative paper, and most of all, not about the satisfaction of taking on a responsibility and completing it. Why would you want to undermine your child\u2019s education by taking a learning opportunity away from him? He can\u2019t learn by proxy. You had your chance to to get an education. Rather than worry about getting into trouble for doing assignment and risk getting him a poor grade, let him do the learning and have the satisfaction of doing the best job he can. ",

Even if you dumb down the report, the teacher probably knows what you did, anyway. She knows what your kid sounds like, and she knows what questions to ask to determine whether your kid read the book. Will you, as a parent, suffer school policy consequences? Probably not. But you haven't done your kid a favor. ",

My first suggestion is that you need to talk to the teacher. I have had parents who helped their child with a book report because of certain learning disabilities. I was very thankful for their help and it was arranged prior to the report being due. I had parents write book reports with their children in pre-school!! The book was read to the child and the child dictated his report to the parent(s) and that worked well. It all depends on the circumstances\u2026 AGAIN! Talk to your child\u2019s teacher!!! ",
