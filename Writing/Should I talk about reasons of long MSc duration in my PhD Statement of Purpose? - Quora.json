            "answer_text": "Not important at all. The most important thing when doing a sop is to demonstrate to the admission board or committee that you are actually capable of handling the graduate work duties required of a grad student. The fact that you completed your MSc is a big statement even if it take you longer than most people take. But you can rest assured that this is not going to be of any concern to the admission committee and you are probably going to get admission if you meet the set requirements by the college. You may mention this reason perhaps during an interview and only if you are asked. http://www.statementofpurposephd.com/statement-of-purpose-phd-economics/ ",
