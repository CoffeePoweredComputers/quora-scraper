            "answer_text": "Hi, my name is Ella. I'm standing in a mirror admiring my lovely ethnic brown skin and curly black hair and the tilt of my eyes. I go downstairs and eat an ethnic breakfast, full of biracial spicy food that white people can't eat. After that, I get ready to go live a day as a person of color. On the train, I sit on the train, thinking about my biracial heritage and the ethnic personality of my curly hair. All I think about is how biracial I am and how much white people have oppressed me. My hobbies are being biracial and eating the spicy ethnic food that white people can't eat. I might pop up later in the story to help the white main character, who is one of the few white people who isn\u2019t blistering racist, even though they're really condescending. You get the idea? The same thing applies to writing any type of character whose experience isn't familiar to you. Don't make their personality revolve around their perceived otherness. Please please please actually flesh out your POC character. If you only have a POC character just for the sake of diVeRsiTy\u2026. don't bother. It's really upsetting when it's obvious that an author has an Asian/Black/Hispanic/gay/any minority character just for the sake of pandering to a certain audience, and the character is just a cut-out of the author's stereotype. If the white characters can have complex motivations and peronalities and desires and interests, why can't a Black female character be something other than \u2018sassy'? Why does a gay male character have to be the stereotypical flamboyant GBF? Is your Chinese character merely interested in making dumplings because they're so Chinese? Is your Muslim character only interested in building a caliphate (someone actually wrote a fantasy novel about the caliphate thing)? Seriously. As a biracial Black person, my experiences and my life and my heritage are not there for you to exoticize because you want to be \u2018diverse'. Make a character who happens to be insert minority. Their personality shouldn't revolve around their ethnic, racial, gender, religious, or sexual background. Because that's not the way it works in real life either. Happy writing! ",
