            "answer_text": "It is, as others have said, to teach you to present \u2018arguments\u2019 in a logical, coherent and consistent fashion; not some mindless diatribe. However, why do we educate the young in the way that we do? Essay writing is but one tool in our drive to educate. We could educate you in: how to make a comfortable dwelling in a cave; how to hunt large herbivores without being killed yourself; how to make fire with three sticks and a piece of string; how to spot the \u2018above ground\u2019 manifestations of edible tubers. However, we do not. We educate you with a combination of 400 year old physics, literature so old that it has passed into the \u2018out of copyright\u2019 zone, mathematics so easy a child of three could manage it and history so anodyne as to be worthless. We do this to spark interest as well as providing the tools you may need in the modern world. If but one percent of the children we educate become physicists, chemists, historians, mathematicians, economists, doctors, dentists (I would include lawyers but . . .), is that not justification enough for you having to write an essay? Universal education did not happen before the twentieth century; you should think yourself lucky that you get to write an essay. Most people prior did not have the oppurtunity. ",

            "answer_text": "The process that you take in writing an essay helps with critical thinking. It\u2019s just that most schools don\u2019t just blatantly say this. Writing an essay can also give you a view that you haven\u2019t had before. It can completely change your whole perception of an object. It takes a lot of effort to write a good essay so it could also help with organization of paragraphs and your use of rhetoric. ",
