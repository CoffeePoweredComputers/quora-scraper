The students for whom the English language is not a native language, it\u2019s hard to come up with persuasive essays. These are usually international students and although they might have good enough English to understand the teaching or to write an exam, but when compared to the native English speaking students, the quality of writing of international students isn\u2019t the greatest in most of the cases. The second category of the students who use the writing services, students doing jobs, usually don\u2019t find enough time to write essays required in the schools. To cope up with the work and studying, these students utilize the writing services to their effect. The third kind of students who use these services, lazy ones, do not just get excited by the idea of writing.
