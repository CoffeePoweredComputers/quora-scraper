            "answer_text": "Buildings and properties are usually owned by someone even if they look abandoned so it would be trespassing at the very least, worse if you have to break in. If the last owner died without heirs or a will the state generally gets it by default even if they don\u2019t actually want it. Some properties stand empty for years while the owner waits for permission or financing to tear it down and build something new. Some stand empty because the owner has no use for it and hasn\u2019t been able to sell it. Societies are interested in knowing who owns what since you can levy a property tax on the owner, so it\u2019s hard to just abandon a building or property. I don\u2019t think I could do it as a private citizen, and if a company \u201cabandons \u201c it by passing it to some empty off-shore shell company (in order to evade the taxes) the shell company still technically owns the place. Until the IRS confiscates it for unpaid taxes\u2026 TLDR: yes, it would be illegal since the property is 99.9% sure to be owned by someone. Whether you\u2019ll ever get caught or anyone cares is another question. ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking as a former kid who couldn\u2019t resist exploring an abandoned building, there\u2019s a reason why these places have signs on or near them that say, \u201cNo Trespassing - Keep Out!\u201d Or even: \u201cDangerous!\u201d or \u201cUnsafe!\u201d Turns out, they actually do mean that. Even if no one \u201cowns\u201d a property, or even if it\u2019s abandoned, it\u2019s still under someone\u2019s care or authority - usually the city or county (in the U.S.) if it\u2019s an abandoned property. And, yes, it\u2019s illegal to go onto the premises. First, you can hurt yourself, easily, in an abandoned building. If it\u2019s dark, there might be a gaping hole in a floor that you could easily fall through without even seeing it. Abandoned buildings are full of broken glass, often, and all sorts of other hazards. They\u2019re also quirky. You can close a door and not be able to open it up to get out again. Then what? The real problem, though, is that people go into abandoned buildings and vandalize them, or they do something idiotic like start a fire. You\u2019d be surprised how many people don\u2019t realize you really shouldn\u2019t build an open fire in a building. I once managed a building, and one night all this smoke appeared. I found six homeless guys, in the basement, who had gathered up some wood down there and had started a fire. ",
