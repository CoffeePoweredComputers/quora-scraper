            "answer_text": "It's amazing to see the litany of questions on Quora about how to write business letters. Most types of general business correspondence can be found in those secretarial typewriting and shorthand workbooks published by the major secretarial course providers (Pitman's, Gregg's, Newline, etc). The workbooks have been the staple for training out generations of secretaries for more than 100 years. The samples and exercises contained in those workbooks give out the most usual and generally established phraseology used in general business correspondence. Those workbooks should be your first port of call -- and learn them through general exposure and familiarity. Protip:- The general rule of thumb in starting any piece of general business correspondence is to use the phrase \"I shall be most grateful if you would kindly...\" Start with that and the rest of what you want to say tends to fall into place quite naturally.
