            "answer_text": "You can never go wrong with reading. You'll always, always end up becoming better at something when you read, even if it is just identifying what you don't like to read.  And reading most certainly improves your vocabulary, familiarizes you with writing patterns and styles. So, go ahead and read. Read a lot. That said, I personally do not think reading contributes very much to speaking skill. I have friends and students who have a great hold over vocabulary and language, some who even write so beautifully, they make me proud and envious in turns, yet cannot articulate themselves in front of an audience. Some can't even strike a conversation of their own volition. (No, they aren't introverts. They speak just fine in their mother tongue) Speaking is a separate skill of using language because it isn't just vocabulary; it isn't just style; it isn't just grammar. Speaking is confidence.  You need to speak to become better at speaking. Speak. Do not fear. Do not hesitate. I know it's easier said than done but remember, even your worst embarrassment is only someone's momentary entertainment. When you become better at speaking, you can go floor them with your suave style and have the last laugh. Hope that helps. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, all reading is good for you but, when you read a novel you often read quickly. You run your eyes quickly over the page and don't always read for detail. Novelists know this and that's why their stories will often tell you the same pieces of information in different ways, they know you might miss something because you're not reading for specific information, you're reading for fun. IELTS reading exams are different. They expect you to be able to analyse texts in detail and do this quickly. Learn some techniques like skimming and scanning, there are some great tips from the British Council below   You can also try Richard L King's little book on IELTS reading - Teach Yourself IELTS Reading here https://www.amazon.co.uk/Teach-yourself-IELTS-Reading-Richard/dp/1517667593/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1467039392&sr=8-2&keywords=warmstone You could also try my first novel 'Warmstone' here https://www.amazon.co.uk/Warmstone-Chris-Speck/dp/1523843144/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1467039938&sr=8-1&keywords=warmstoneGood luck ",
