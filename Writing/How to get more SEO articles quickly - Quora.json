            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really want to spend more than 20 minutes a day on writing articles. And I spent no more than 20 minutes to write this article. I realize this is writing blasphemy. Internet marketing is powered by content, and content is king. But when I have a daily schedule to post on and a business to run, I don\u2019t have time to spend hours polishing every single blog post or writing 2,000-word articles. Writing quickly doesn\u2019t mean compromising on writing well, though. I\u2019ve got seven tips to get you in and out of that composition box in twenty minutes \u2013 without sacrificing quality. 1. Keep an idea list. When inspiration for a post strikes, scribble it down in a notebook or a word file. For many bloggers and content creators, finding the topic to write about takes up half the time. Keeping an idea list lets you leap in to a new post quickly when you\u2019re ready to write. 2. Let your ideas incubate. If you try to force yourself to come up with supporting information for your brilliant idea right away, it\u2019s going to take ages. Let that topic sit for a few days, though, and you can add new ideas as they occurs to you \u2013 and when you\u2019re ready to write, you\u2019ll already have all the supporting info you need. 3. Edit before you start You\u2019ve probably got twice as many ideas as you need at this point, so it\u2019s time to be brutal. Cut out any supporting idea that doesn\u2019t fit with the main topic of the article. Remember, we\u2019re talking about how to write an article in 20 minutes, not an epic. You can always use the ideas you don\u2019t need for later posts. 4. Use bullet points Bullet points, or numbered points like \u201c10 Ways to Get More Subscribers\u201d, can make writing an article a lot simpler in terms of organization because you no longer have to figure out transitions from one idea to the next. The great side benefit is that readers like lists; they\u2019re easier for the eye to follow. 5. Keep it short If you want to finish that article in 20 minutes, try to keep it under 500 words. Don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re skimping on quality content, either: this article is only about 500 words but it\u2019s chockfull of information. Make every word count and you\u2019ll save time without letting quality slip. 6. Come back later If you find that you\u2019re stuck, don\u2019t try to force the words to come. Save the article and work on something else for awhile. If inspiration strikes, open up that document again. You can even switch from one blog post to another, spending a few minutes on each as ideas comes to you. It\u2019s a huge time-saver. 7. Never save a good idea It\u2019s tempting, when you look through your list of ideas, to save the best ones for later because you think they\u2019ll be easier to write. You don\u2019t want to save time later, you want to save time now. Do the articles you know will come easily and make the most of that time. ",
