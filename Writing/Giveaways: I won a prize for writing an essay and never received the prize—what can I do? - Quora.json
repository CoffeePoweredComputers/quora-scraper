            "answer_text": "Did you contact the company directly? I would do so and ask when to expect your prize. I would mention something such as \"I would hate to think that these are not legitimate contests and would definitely feel the need to warn all of my social contacts and the public if I do not receive the prize I was promised\" If you still do not hear back (or do not receive your prize) use social media to warn others. Don't be afraid to speak out about your negative experience - just keep your voice professional! Tweet, Facebook, and blog about your negative experience. Post comments on their blogs. If you have quotes or images that show you as a winner - post those as well.  Keep pushing until you get the prize - or they quit hosting contests. One final thought - does the contest have any legal disclaimers attached to it? Be sure to read that as well... and if it is still online, print a copy for yourself should you decide to pursue further. If it is really a matter of principle, you could look into having a lawyer send the company a \"love letter\" on your behalf. Although that costs around $100. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn't appear any contractual obligation exists, so I don't think there is any legal recourse at your disposal. It is possible the person is just an airhead.  I don't see anywhere in your question details where the blogger has communicated to you that they intend to not honor the offer.  If it were me, I'd just be a squeeky wheel.  Keep emailing them until you get some type of response as to 1) when they intend to pay you or 2) if they have no intention of paying you. I'd be as diplomatic and friendly as you can, for as long as you can.  The person knows their responsibility and obligation.  No need to get nasty, unless you have exhausted all efforts to collect.  I would imagine they value their online reputation.  As a last resort, say you will have no other recourse to post your experience, if they refuse to pay. ",
