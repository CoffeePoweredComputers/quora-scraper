            "answer_text": "Good question.  There are many, but one of particular importance - and complexity - stands out. What is the optimum regulatory / market design framework to appropriately incentivize deployment of distributed energy resources (including PV, distributed energy storage, dynamic demand response, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency) while ensuring the continued reliability and safety of the electrical grid as a whole - at both the distribution and transmission system level? This should include regulated utility business models include the scope of their monopoly franchise and how they should generate shareholder returns; the role of 3rd parties in providing services to business, consumers, and utilities; rate design including renumeration for net excess energy production by consumers and businesses; consideration of physical constraints in the network including how to best allocate capital and incentivize the deployment of technology - by utilities or 3rd party providers - to alleviate those constraints; and how to ensure that constituencies which are less attractive for private entities to serve are nonetheless provided access to low cost, reliable, clean energy. For a start. Probably not exactly what you had in mind, but definitely fits your criteria and is a very hot topic right now.  ",

            "answer_text": "There has been some interesting work done regarding converting algea into usable energy. They proposed placing giant windmills off the Massachusetts coast near Hyannisport but the Kennedy's objected, very unsightly. Do you know that more birds are killed by windmills than by any other source. Do you know that Obama gave Solindra over a half a trillion dollars to develop a source of renewable energy and create shovel ready jobs. There went a half billion and guess what. Not one shovel ready job. They would have had better luck extracting methane gas from cow flatulence. ",
