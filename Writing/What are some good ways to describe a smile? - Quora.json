            "answer_text": "Some literary descriptions: His eyes sparkled. The corners of her eyes crinkled. He smirked. The corners of his mouth slid upwards.  Practical descriptions:A smile is the crinkle of the eyes, the upturn of the corners of the mouth, with or without baring the teeth, and the flexing of the muscles in the apples of one's cheeks. You can smile with your mouth, cheeks, eyes, or all three. It's best if all three are involved, especially the eyes.  And social descriptions:A smile is a facial indicator of good humor, a good mood, or happiness. A genuine smile uses mouth, cheeks, and eyes to draw from a shared experience like a joke told, a movie seen, or a conversation enjoyed. It can be a sweet gift from one human being to another--to your mother, your friend, your sweetheart. The mirror neurons in our brains are what makes us feel happy when we see someone else looking happy. Sharing a smile with a stranger is a gift, because it triggers these neurons and the associated happy brain chemicals. Smiling for a commercial, for a camera? The only time these smiles are genuine is when a happy memory or thought is called to mind and shared freely with those who will see its reproduction. The best actors feel like your friends as you watch them for this reason. Some people are skilled enough at faking it to make a smile seem genuine even when it's not, but these people are rare. ",
