(I know, shocking right, Im rusty considering I have not been writing anything at all for the last 6 months.) My advice is to avoid using the, and that. These words are literary glue. They do not add meaning and using too much of them will make your writing seem ungainly and fragmentary. You should try to write from an aloof, omniscient point of view so avoid using I, my or me. As an exercise, try constructing a paragraph or journal entry without using a single \u2018the\u2019. Instead, opt to use connective words like however, although, furthermore and while instead of THE. You will notice how much better your writing flows. What ever you do dont write \u2018in my opinion\u2019. Always aim to show, rather than tell. ",

This must be based on evidence from various sources that you quote and evaluate. In the final analysis it must surely then be necessary to use \u2018I\u2019 as in for example \u201cBased in the evidence given, my personal opinion is that\u2026.. and\u2026.. because\u2026.. and I believe that\u2026.. etc.\u201d ",
