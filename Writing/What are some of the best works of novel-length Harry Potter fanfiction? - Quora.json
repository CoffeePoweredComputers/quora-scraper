            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve browsed through many a FanFiction, but I generally only read a couple chapters before abandoning it. These are the ones I couldn\u2019t stop: *Looking back after I\u2019ve finished, I notice that none of these are really tailored for the younger crowd. Um\u2026 warning, adult content, I guess? **Dumbledore\u2019s Army and the Year of Darkness, Slaugh, A Peccatis: There are some weird issues surrounding this little (unfinished) trilogy that I don\u2019t fully understand, but there was a time when I enjoyed them very much. It follows Neville leading Dumbledore\u2019s Army, then graduating and becoming an Auror. DAYD is great in that if you like the first chapter you\u2019ll like the whole first one. There are scenes that might be overly graphic, there are scenes that might be overly goofy, there are scenes that might be too on the nose, and people say that it\u2019s sexist or something, I didn\u2019t notice anything too ridiculous but there\u2019s that. I still like it. Slaugh\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s crazy. Ridiculously dark, full of graphic themes, so on, but again, if you can make to the end, you probably liked it. A Peccatis? Not done, but what\u2019s there is, in my opinion, a very engaging mystery story that portrays how Aurors work better than anything else I\u2019ve read. The Life and Times: Definitely the best Marauder-Era story I\u2019ve ever read, and one of the better love stories, and that\u2019s not just counting FanFiction. The mains (James/Lily) are both done fantastically, but I should mention how amazing the original characters are as well. There are entire chapters devoted to OCs, and it doesn\u2019t feel like mush between the James/Lily stuff. The ending is a little clunky, but it works. On the Way to Greatness: Hands down best FanFiction I\u2019ve ever read. I\u2019m biased because it\u2019s about Harry being sorted into Slytherin and I\u2019m in Slytherin, but I digress. I\u2019ve made it through the whole thing two or three times. Instead of rewriting the entirety of every year, the author does one chapter for first year, two for second, three for third, etc. It really gets things moving to the more interesting (plot-wise) second half, but the first half is chock-full of development. He shows why Harry is basically a different person by the fifth year, just in time for the war with Voldemort to start. If I tried to explain everything I like about it, this would get too long, so I\u2019m just going to say that, out of the three, I most strongly encourage anyone to read this. Edit: **I\u2019m not going to pretend that this answer ever received a whole lot of attention, but if anyone ever does wade through some of the older stuff on this site, I feel like I should emphasize the \u201cweird issues\u201d I mentioned in my brief review of the DAYDverse. I don\u2019t know exactly what the author did, but a lot of people hate him, like really hate him now, to the point where I\u2019m a little surprised that no one has left a comment condemning him/the work. I\u2019ve had trouble tracking down a clear explanation of his transgressions, or I found one and forgot about it long ago; either way, I\u2019m not letting him or the opinions people have about him stop me from enjoying what I think is a good story (again, a lot of people have issues with it, but I read it a long time ago and I\u2019m a sucker for nostalgia). Pardon me, I\u2019m getting long-winded; the point is, all three of the stories have been deleted from FanFiction and I don\u2019t know of any other place you can find them. And so, the whole affair is ended rather anticlimactically (at least from my perspective). P.S. Seriously though, go read On the Way to Greatness. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s really hard to say, as it depends heavily on what kind of thing you are looking for. Are you looking for a romance? An action? A mystery? What characters do you want a focus on? What ships do you prefer? Do you prefer canon or AU? It\u2019s a good thing you\u2019ve got a ton of answers so far, as you can theoretically narrow it down to the answers that mention your preferences and sift through ones you want to read. But I went through a lot of the answers (by no means all of them), and was surprised to see that none of the ones that I favor made any of the lists (again, I didn\u2019t go through all of the answers, so I easily could\u2019ve missed someone who did list them). So, I will say ahead of time that I tend to prefer canon couples (I have a few favorites: Harry/Ginny and James/Lily) in fics that are strictly canonical. Genre is typically romance, but not entirely centered around the romance (as in, there\u2019s a plot other than the two characters getting together). Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince by RRFang Complete - This is an extremely well-written fic. I think the characterizations are spot on, and the romance is great. As the title suggests, it is the Half-Blood Prince (and The Deathly Hallows) told from Ginny\u2019s point of view. In the Words of Ginevra Molly Potter by thejealousone Complete - Similar to the one above it, but the entire series from Ginny\u2019s point of view. Also extremely well written. Ginny is a little overly powerful occasionally throughout the fic (in my opinion), but that\u2019s just a minor pet peeve of mine. And it doesn\u2019t really matter, because the fic is just so good. Those are really the only two fics that have ever drawn me in, start to finish, that are centered around the same timeline as the books. Future or post-war fics haven\u2019t ever been my cup of tea. Onto my favorite timeline, though: the Marauders! I\u2019ll Take it Shaken, Not Stirred and The Life and Times, both by Jewels5 Complete These are both stories about how Lily and James got over their differences and eventually fell in love. Both extremely well written, with fully fleshed out and 3-dimensional OCs. The first was written before DH, the second after, so the first doesn\u2019t involve Snape or James being a chaser or various other little things that weren\u2019t known at the time (though I actually prefer it, mainly because I prefer the OCs in it). These both avoid a lot of Lily/James story stereotypes (like every Maruader gets paired off with Lily\u2019s friends, or James is some stupid, love-sick boy put on the earth simply to pine after Lily, or the Marauders don\u2019t use their establishes nicknames but rather very girly versions [Prongsie, Paddy], etc.), which is a very good thing. Against the Moon by Spotlight Delight In Progress, temp Hiatus Often attempted, rarely done well, never finished (that I\u2019ve ever seen). The entirety of the Marauders time at Hogwarts. This is a fic centered on Lupin, starting with the train ride to Hogwarts (well, a prologue about him being bitten first) and theoretically going all the way through their years at Hogwarts. Can\u2019t know for sure, as it\u2019s still in progress, but that\u2019s what I assume. Could end sooner or go on further. I actually am not through to the most recent chapters myself. I\u2019m on chapter 71 currently, of 134 (so far). The fic is extremely well written, and is long. It doesn\u2019t fly through any part of the story. Everything is detailed. I will add a small complaint, which is that the characterizations aren\u2019t exactly as I\u2019ve always pictured. Sirius is shown to be a little too sensitive and is shown to be more fiercely loyal than James, which seems a bit incongruent to what we\u2019ve always heard. And Peter is shown to be rather stupid, which I feel is a common misconception about the character (he did become an Animagus, helped with the Marauders map, and blasted away 12 muggles with a single curse with his wand behind his back, after all), but overall it\u2019s very, very good so far. And everything else seems spot on, so either that\u2019s just how the author views them (it\u2019s her fic, so the characterizations are up to her anyway) or she plans to have them grow into what we know about them along the way. Either way, whether they change into what I\u2019ve always thought they were supposed to be like (again, that\u2019s just me; everyone has their own view) or they stay the way they are, the fic is just incredible. It\u2019s only a minor complaint, and it hasn\u2019t kept me from refusing to put this thing down. It is on a temporary hiatus as the author focuses on another fic at the moment, but she has updated her profile recently to assure everyone the fic will continue, and her most recent update to the story she is currently focusing on was yesterday, so she hasn\u2019t disappeared from the website either. Also, though it seems to be implied throughout the story, the author has confirmed this is not going to be a WolfStar fic, so if that\u2019s what you want, this isn\u2019t for you. And there you have it. I\u2019ve never looked at other FanFic websites, and unfortunately, good writers with good ideas seem to be few and far between on FanFiction.net (in my opinion), so I only have 5 to offer. But these are really, really good in my opinion, and if you like Harry/Ginny and/or the Marauders in general, I think you\u2019ll love them. ",
