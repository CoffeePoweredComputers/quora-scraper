            "answer_text": "I always believed it was bad form and against academic integrity when I was in college. Of course, a student with physical or mental impairment would require whatever accommodation they needed. In my mind, higher education isn\u2019t designed to teach you what to learn, but how to learn. To that end, composing sound and informative essays demonstrates a student\u2019s ability to apply how they have researched their topic and thought process. Researching a topic is a big task. Selective subtopics and critical thinking skills are imperative to writing a robust essay chock full of smooth transitions, format, facts, and appropriate citations. It\u2019s an academic\u2019s form of art, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of reading some masterpieces from my colleagues way back when. By having someone else write their essay, the student showcases their lack of learning how to learn. And remember: all rough drafts suck. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, as stated in the other answer, there are really bad consequences if anyone finds out, like your (or the person\u2019s who you wrote the essay for) admissions decision getting rescinded. It\u2019s not fair to other students applying. ",
