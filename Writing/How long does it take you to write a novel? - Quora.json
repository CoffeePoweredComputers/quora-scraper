            "answer_text": "I suppose every writer has his/her own way to build a book and therefore the time it takes to write a novella, which is a book anywhere from 90 pages to 200 pages in length. Taking into consideration that every real writer has at the very least a dozen stories swishing-around in their head at any given time, the writer first has to decide what story they wish to construct. My own experience is that I can write a novella averaging 120\u2013150 pages within 10 days. This is based on a couple of days to design the story (beginning, middle, and end), and all the necessary characters. The story includes how many chapters I will need to unfold the story and how long each will be. Each chapter would then be set-up with a beginning, a middle and an end (the end, of which will try to compel the reader into going into reading the next chapter). An outline for the entire book is composed, followed by outlines for every chapter. I then pick the easiest and quickest to write chapters to write first, in order to get them out of the way. The entire process of design to the first draft will take no more than a week. The next couple of days would be a concentrated re-read with repair of spelling, grammar, and style. The tenth day is usually making certain that the book formatting is correct and creating a cover\u2026both of which are uploaded for review before sale (this is if you are publishing on your own). You can develop your own design and how to churn-out material, and still offer a quality story, rather than pulp. However, if you secure a contract where you must produce pulp, then you will be able to do it without much trouble. I spend about 10 hours each day, and often I will miss meals and even washroom breaks. Missing meals occur since I am by myself and the time for making lunch, even a sandwich, cuts into the writing process. Ten hour writing days are also killers since I have a \u201cday job\u201d (night shift, actually which does allow me time to write) then half my day, at home, before I just have to get sleep to prepare to work my shift. On my days off, I try to spend every possible moment that I find, to write. I think, that if I could afford not to have a job, and was able to hire a cook/housekeeper, and ignored everyone who wished a chunk of my time, I could possibly write a novella within a week. There is a problem with this approach to writing and it is called \u201cburn-out!\u201d No matter how talented you are and what your level of stamina is, the average person would not be able to sustain such a writing schedule for any significant length of time. It is usually good to know that a short book can be written quickly but eventually your brain will just not want to cooperate. This is not writer\u2019s block it is the brain needing alternate stimulation. This alternate stimulation could be that laziness kicks-in and the brain outright refuses to be creative. The best way to overcome such problems is if you do spend two weeks writing a book, you will need to spend two weeks doing totally nothing. This part is tough if you have a hundred ideas for stories and your brain teases maybe ten stories out of you, then teases one more then shuts down. Again, this is not writer\u2019s block, this is a limitation that the brain is putting on the writer, in order to secure the health of the writer. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, dear, you probably won't like my answer in the short term.  How old?  I started writing when I was seven or eight.  I started working on a novel when I was 14 or 15. I finished a novel that had grown out of that one when I was 34.  About the only thing left relatively intact was the setting and the names and basic personalities of the two protagonists.  If you're interested, I post under my real name here and the book (and its sequel) is on Amazon.  It's called \"Strange Roads\".   As a self-published/Kindle  book, it's good.  No paid-for reviews, average 4.9 star rating.  The writing, if I say so myself, is well above the average \"indie\".   If I'd published the original version it would be terrible.  Heck, if I published the third or fourth version, it would be awful.  What became the final draft probably took about two years.  Before that, there was writing, rewriting, writing other things, workshopping, three creative writing courses in university (none of which worked on that novel directly, but all of which contributed), selling a completely different fantasy short story, graduate school, and several jobs.  It is a much better book with much more long-term potential than it would have been had I stuck with the version that it was in high school.  The sequel took much less time and the third book in the series should be quicker than that. How long will depend on how fast you write and how much you need to revise what you turn out the first time.  Whether or not it will get published traditionally will depend almost entirely on whether it's marketable (publishers have never given me a form rejection or a quality-based rejection--I've been told \"I enjoy your writing, but we don't know how we would market this.\")  Whether or not it flies as an indie novel depends on how much you want to market it yourself and how good it is.   There is a LOT of crap out there.  You need to stand out. ",
