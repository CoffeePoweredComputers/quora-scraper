            "answer_text": "I would change your question to \u201cthe poet,\u201d not the \u201cwriter.\u201d When Shakespeare actually arrived in London and began his work is problematic - but his first published poem was \u201cVenus and Adonis,\u201d\u2019 circa 1593. Some Shakespeare experts believe he was writing plays as early as 1589. I think most scholars of that era would point to Christopher Marlowe (1564\u20131593) as the revolutionary poet/dramatist whose use of dramatic blank verse was indeed \u201cdramatic\u201d and revolutionary. Dr. Faustus, Edward II, Tamburlaine (Part I better than II) Jew of Malta, The Massacre at Paris, Dido Queen of Carthage are his titles and more or less my personal ranking of Marlowe plays. All published after his death except Tamburlaine 1590. (Aside: Dr. Faustus to Goethe\u2019s Faust is a trip worth taking, by the by). I remember, as if it was yesterday -it was 1965 - my English Professor, an actor also, reading that last speech by Faustus. It just blew me away. Listening to a great actor perform that part was worth a million days in any class. But my Professor also showed how Marlowe was more a series of brilliant speeches and not so much drama in the way that Shakespeare could so much better unify the acting part with the speaking part. Let me repeat that critical statement: Shakespeare\u2019s characters create action through their speech in a totally unique, revolutionary way - that is his true genius - making speech unified with dramatic action. Speak, act out, the part of Faustus or Tamburlaine and then Lear or Hamlet at their most extreme moments and you should get the difference right away. Marlowe could certainly write really incredible poetry - but he was murdered 1593 and his future brilliant contributions to history were drained away like his life \u2014- (except those who believe his murder was faked and he was really the Shakespeare poet - which is not my thing at all. The writing styles were so different - no matter what the computers say). ",

            "answer_text": "Many ways to answer that, of course. Here\u2019s one: William Shakespeare is often held to be the greatest English writer of the Renaissance. One writer often held to be the greatest English writer of the preceding era, the Medieval, was Geoffrey Chaucer, whose most famous work was The Canterbury Tales. Indeed, Chaucer (1343\u20131400) is often called the Father of English Literature, and he was one of the first major English poets to write his works in English of the common people, rather than the French and Latin of the contemporary royal court and intelligentsia. He was also the first writer buried in the Poets\u2019 Corner at Westminster Abbey. Chaucer\u2019s writing had several significant parallels to Shakespeare\u2019s, though Chaucer did not write for actors on the stage. He wrote a very wide variety of characters, for example, and worked in a wide range of story types, from the quite dark to the rather silly. Like Shakespeare, Chaucer was a very important and highly influential crafter of verse, and he helped to establish in English verse a ten-syllable, heavily iambic line very similar to the five-stress iambic line Shakespeare later used in a great deal of his dialogue and all of this sonnets. Also like Shakespeare, Chaucer based a large number of his works on existing narratives and other sources. A little additional detail from the Wikipedia entry on Chaucer: \u201cChaucer also achieved fame in his lifetime as a philosopher and astronomer, composing the scientific A Treatise on the Astrolabe for his 10-year-old son Lewis. He maintained an active career in the civil service as a bureaucrat, courtier and diplomat. Among Chaucer's many other works are The Book of the Duchess, The House of Fame, The Legend of Good Women, and Troilus and Criseyde.\u201d Finally, if you want to show off a little to your highbrow friends, it may be useful to know that while Shakespeare wrote in what we now call Early Modern English, Chaucer wrote in what we now call Middle English, which being a couple of centuries older predictably strikes us today as even odder: Whan that Aprill, with his shoures sooteThe droghte of March hath perced to the rooteAnd bathed every veyne in swich licour,Of which vertu engendred is the flour;Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breethInspired hath in every holt and heethThe tendre croppes, and the yonge sonneHath in the Ram his halfe cours yronne,And smale foweles maken melodye,That slepen al the nyght with open y\u00eb(So priketh hem Nature in hir corages);Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimagesAnd palmeres for to seken straunge strondesTo ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes;And specially from every shires endeOf Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende,The hooly blisful martir for to sekeThat hem hath holpen, whan that they were seeke. For comparison, here\u2019s a modern translation of that: When April with his showers sweet with fruitThe drought of March has pierced unto the rootAnd bathed each vein with liquor that has powerTo generate therein and sire the flower;When Zephyr also has, with his sweet breath,Quickened again, in every holt and heath,The tender shoots and buds, and the young sunInto the Ram one half his course has run,And many little birds make melodyThat sleep through all the night with open eye(So Nature pricks them on to ramp and rage)\u2014Then do folk long to go on pilgrimage,And palmers to go seeking out strange strands,To distant shrines well known in sundry lands.And specially from every shire's endOf England to Canterbury they went,The holy blessed martyr there to seekWho helped them when they lay so ill and weak.
