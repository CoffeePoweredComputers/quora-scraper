            "answer_text": "First of all, the premise of the question is not entirely true. Many expensive pens are made with plastic or with premium materials such as celluloid or ebonite, which are very light in the hand. For various reasons, a majority of the premium offerings from established pen manufacturers do not incorporate much metal as a primary structural material, and most expensive pens do not go far over 25 to 30 grams. (For reference, a modern Montblanc 149 with brass piston threads is around 32 grams.) For one, it's simply hard to make a heavy pen that's well balanced and comfortable in the hand for long writing sessions. Conversely, you can find cheap Chinese pens with brass or stainless steel construction that are quite heavy, in the 25-gram range or more. Some of these are reasonably good beginner fountain pens, but many of the heavy Chinese pens are tacky and rather unbalanced. Now, it is true that many expensive pens incorporate a significant amount of metal. As others have stated, the added weight can add a feeling of heft, substance, and refinement. That is one pen design \"paradigm\" that you can find, but weight is not a defining characteristic of all or even most expensive fountain pens. Even if a maker is set out to design a rather hefty pen, at some point, it becomes impractical to add much more weight without adversely affecting balance, and I'm sure the marginal perception of prestige or value decreases significantly once you reach 30-gram territory. My heaviest pen is probably the all-metal Lamy Dialog 3. While it's a treat to hold in the hand for a few light notes or sketches, at almost 50 grams, it's quite tiring to use all day. But most of my pens are considerably lighter. I doubt that any of my most expensive dozen or so pens exceed 20 grams or so. ",

In my 450+ pen aggregation, I have some pens that approach $1K MSRP that are quite light in the hand...one--the Visconti Opera Typhoon LE comes to mind.  In the more moderate range...recently scored a late 1940s-early 1950s Parker 51 for $5. Cleaned it up, flushed it out, bought a proper cap for $10. Light and just a great writer-grade. On the heftier side...I have several ACME pens..all in the $100 range that are brass barrels and caps so they are, of course, heavier than the pens cited above. They are well balanced pens and are comfortable to use for extended periods. I suspect you have cheaply-made expensive pens and crappy cheap pens; suspect you need to contact me back-channel for some pen talk. Oh, by the way. Montblanc pens are crappy expensive pens. \"Precious Resin\" means \"plan on having this explode soon because MB has never figured out how to make a decent pen but have a great propaganda machine that can warp gullible people with more money than sense to buy cheap pens with Pelikan poop on the top tassie.\" ",
