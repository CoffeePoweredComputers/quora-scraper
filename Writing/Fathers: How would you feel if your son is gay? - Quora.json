            "answer_text": "I'm not a father (I'm about to be a mother though) but if my son turns out to be gay, honestly? It's not going to make even the slightest difference to how much i love and cherish him. My partner has admitted that he'd struggle with it\u2026 not because of any prejudice, but because he just doesn't understand male to male (or female to female, for that matter) sexual attraction. He's 100% heterosexual, and while he's got no problems with the gay community, he just doesn't \u201cget\u201d it, because that's not how he's hardwired. What he HAS admitted to however, is that he'd severely struggle with it if our son turns out to be gender fluid or trans; he struggles with the idea that gender and sex are two different concepts, and that one is genetic, the other mental. I personally have no problem with either concept, and I HOPE if the situation ever arises, that my partner will accept our child as is, and love him regardless. As long as our baby feels loved and cherished, desired, wanted, valued, and safe, that's really all that matters to me, in the end. ",

            "answer_text": "Pretty sad. It is hard to be a decent person in this world, hard to get ahead, even harder to do so when part of you is unacceptable for lot of people. So I would need to watch my child suffer more than parents of heterosexual people. If it is early discovery, in school, even worse, as I will understand that he will be often ridiculed and scorned about a thing he cannot change. All I could hope for is that he has a strong will to overcome these problems and not be damaged. ",
