            "answer_text": "Of course, we do. Though we may not hand-write it but many of us do write something for that someone special. Whether it be our crush, our love, or our boyfriend. We do write down our feelings though they might not be accepted but just for the sake of loving we write our feelings. Sometimes we know that the person that we are writing for might never read it but we still write that heartfelt letter. But, it\u2019s another feeling when that pen hits the paper and off we are describing our feelings for someone. Though not always is the letter written for that someone special. We write it for our friends, parents, family, and many other people. Personally I have written a few love letters. Many of them to my family members on their birthdays. Though none of them have read it but those were filled with memories. And there are many other letters that I have written not all of them were for my family though but all of them are really close to my heart. Many of the letters I have written are close to me and really special but I lost them and haven\u2019t written them again ever since but one day I will write them in a special diary which would only be read by me and others close to me. Lots of love, Simran Patel ",

Its 3:30 am and the wind is drifting me back the night when I fell in love with him and for the very first time I wrote to him. I decided to write to him again. (I use to write something daily for my love) I opened my diary and again dissolved him in the ink of each word I framed on the paper   (Entirely a piece of fiction) This is not for the first time I have written a letter to him but its one of the hundredth out of my aggitated nights when I try to forge a single face out of hundreds of faces. Though, I haven\u2019t seen him and don\u2019t have address to post those letters but sometimes I want to cup his face in my palm like the Oyester surrounding a pearl and entangle his hair in between my fingers. I wish to see him someday :) ;) Love ",

            "answer_text": " Nobody is a professor in the subject of love. However, trying to express the love for someone is not the easiest thing to do. Professing your love to the special one massively re-affirms the love for them. Words are certainly the most powerful and impactful tool to express or confess what you feel. Most of the people are not very confident while telling their feelings vocally to the one you love. That brings nervousness and awkwardness at times. However, the problem is that almost not everyone is so good with words that they can write efficiently to their loved ones. An effective way to express to express your love to your man is to write a love letter to him. Even if your man is not sensitive enough, it will still be very impactful for him. In order to leave him with tears of joy, you should surely try to write a love letter to him. Not only will it take your relationship to the next level, but it will also show him how much he really means to you. Trust me here, a small piece of paper is capable of showing the emotions that you vocally cannot do. If you will write a love letter to your man, your connection with them will deepen and moreover, he can cherish that memory for life. He can read it whenever he wants to. It will probably decrease the chances of a fight between you both. In bonus, you will get a burst of love which is absolutely worth it. #1. Ignore The Judgement Of Everyone Else And Yourself As an editor of yourself, keep writing even if you feel like tearing your love letter. You might criticize yourself, however, do not let yourself stop because of that. If you will listen to your cracky old brain, you will never be able to write something beautiful for your man. Listen to your pumped and unbiased soul for once and start writing without considering people\u2019s or your own perception for that matter. You need to ignore the professional writer within you and write whatever makes you think of him.  #2. Blend The Ingredients Of Love And Honesty Now it should be understood without even saying. Love letters are not like flowers or puppies. You need to be honest and express your love. Ladies, if you want that after reading your love letter, your man is filled with smiles, love, laughter and what not, tell them everything honestly. Your doubts, your concerns, your feelings, your dark thoughts, your fantasies and even your deepest secrets. You might not believe it before witnessing it that \u2018Love letters are life changing or relationship changing to be very precise. Pour all your heart and soul and don\u2019t worry, if you have been honest enough to do that, it will be certainly visible in the love letter.  read more : How to write Love Letters to your Man? ",

And I'm terrified to tell you. I'm terrified you will tell me you like me only as a friend. I'm terrified that the boundaries between us will destroy us. You make me smile. You talk to me, so lovingly and gently, you encourage me. You make me feel beautiful and special You are kind and patient. You are funny. You are good natured. You always know how to speak to me. You care about me. I don't even know if I deserve you. But I want to be good enough for you. Maybe you think I'm just doing this to rebel against my parents. I\u2019m not, but...I want to know what you think. Love, Your sweet friend ",
