            "answer_text": "Think of personas as the characters in your user stories - they are the people who will sue your product and your user story describes what they will see and hear, and the various ways they will react and what will happen when they do. It\u2019s important that personas be representative of your users, but be careful not to expose your personas with your customers. Personas are basically stereotypes of an amalgamation of various user characteristics, and we had some bad experience when someone told a user that they were like one of our personas, and the user took offence at being stereotyped that way.

            "answer_text": "User personas are a fictional representation of your users that help your teams understand who they\u2019re building for. When writing stories, you can use the persona as a point of reference to always keep in mind who you are building things for. One thing to remember is that personas are not static - they constantly change and evolve.

If you do this as a team exercise, personas may come handy, particularly if those were designed collectively: Create Personas with the Help of the Engineers. ",
