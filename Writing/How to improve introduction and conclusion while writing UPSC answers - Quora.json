            "answer_text": "Tips For Writing A Better Answer Two important factors decide the good outcome of your answer: one, understanding the question completely. Second, sticking to the word limit. To understand a question fully, one must know that a question has keywords. Every question has a \u2018topic\u2019 and a \u2018directive\u2019. For example, \u201d Gandhian strategy of non-violence and satyagraha had its own limitations\u201d. Examine. In the above question, the topic is \u2018limitations of Gandhian strategy of Non-violence and satyagraha\u2018 and the directive is \u2018Examine\u2018. If we give an \u2018explanation\u2019 to this answer how Gandhian strategy had limitations and how it affected Freedom struggle, the examiner is sure to give less than average marks. Instead, the directive points us towards a definite course of answering, here, \u2018examination\u2019 of the statement. So, what does \u2018Examine\u2019 precisely mean? Before we move to that, one should know that UPSC often gives many other directives in its questions and each demand a precise answer. Frequently used directives are, \u2018Examine\u2019, \u2018Comment\u2019, \u2018Analyze\u2019, \u2018 \u2018Evaluate\u2019, \u2018Discuss\u2019, \u2018Critically Examine\u2019, Critically Comment\u2019, \u2018Critically Analyze\u2019 and \u2018Assess\u2019. Examine and Critically ExamineWhen you are asked to examine, you have to probe deeper into the topic, get into details, and find out the causes or implications if any . In the case of above question on Gandhi\u2019s strategy, you have to probe the details of his strategy, find that if it really had limitations and provide a balanced view. All within a given word limit. When asked to \u2018critically examine\u2018, as in the following question, \u201cIn the context of the growing demands for the ban of endosulfan in the country,\u2019critically examine\u2018 the issues involved.What, in your view, should be done in the matter?\u201d (2012, Paper-I) In this question, you have to probe in detail two aspects: one, good and bad of Endosulfan. Second, implications of its ban. And arrive at an unbiased conclusion. When \u2018critically\u2019 is suffixed or prefixed to a directive, all you need to do is look at the good and bad of something and give a fair judgement. Comment and Critically CommentThe directive \u2018comment\u2019 is usually followed by a statement made by some famous personality, or taken out from a famous book. When you are asked to comment, you have to pick main points and give your \u2018opinion\u2019 on them based on evidences or arguments stemming from your wide reading. Your opinion may be for or against, but you must back your argument with evidences. These types of question offer you a chance to consolidate your reading of different subjects to justify your opinion. Example, \u201cThere is an urgent need for the Planning commission to revise the chapter on health in the 12th Five year Plan document\u201d. Comment (GS-I 2012, UPSC) Your answer to this question must contain your opinion backed by certain evidences. If you agree with the statement, first mention what are the shortcomings in the chapter on health and offer your opinion in the form of suggestions backed by data from certain reports or committees. Critically comment is also forming opinion on main points but in the end you have to provide a fair judgement. Example, Critically comment on the extent, scope and implications of Non Communicable Diseases in India. To this question most of us tend to provide facts on extent, scope and implications, but it demands a fair opinion from our part based on evidences. Here one can form an opinion on how dire the situation is and how costly it can prove to health and wealth of the people and nation. Analyze and Critically AnalyzeWhen asked to analyze, you have to examine methodically the structure or nature of the topic by separating it into component parts and present them as a whole in a summary. When you are asked to analyze, you have to examine each part of the problem. It is a broader term than \u2018Examine\u2019. Example, \u201cConflicts in Indian society are not so much social as they are economic in nature\u201d. Analyze. This question though appears confusing, if broken into component parts, i.e, into conflicts arising out of social factors and economic factors, and then examining (probing deeply) the nature of each part, it becomes easy to conclude your answer. (In this question, \u2018economic nature\u2019 mentioned is nothing other than \u2018development\u2019 \u2013 whose lack is the root of major conflicts in our society these days) Critically Analyze: You need to conclude with a fair judgement, after analyzing the nature of each component part and interrelationship between them. Example: \u201cAnalyze critically the interlinkages between the Convention on Biodiversity and FAO treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.\u201d As critical analysis of this question involves separate examination of COB and FAO Treaty and the examination of their inter-relationship \u2013 if both are in harmony with each other or there is any conflict between them (they are in harmony). Observe the word \u2018interlinkages\u2019 in the question itself. EvaluateWhen you are asked to evaluate, you have to pass a sound judgement about the truth of the given statement in the question or the topic based on evidences. You have to appraise the worth of the statement in question. There is scope for forming a personal opinion here. Example, Has the RTI made a noticeable impact on our governance system?Evaluate. While answering this question, you have to, based on evidence, appraise whether the RTI act has really made an impact on governance and give your opinion on the issue. source Tips For Writing Better Answers In UPSC Main Examination - INSIGHTS ",
