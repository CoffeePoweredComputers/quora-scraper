Serious discussions about personal issues should not be happening in writing. But they do, unfortunately. I sometimes include statements for context that are not at issue, but from time to time the other correspondent (usually the one who brought up some serious subject in the first place!) will read any such setting statement I include as some counter-assault, forgetting that I don't even want to have that discussion, I will provide as much clarity as I can. I have never figured out how\u2014HOW!\u2014recalling the setting could be viewed as a counter-assault, but some people have the gift. As such, I have found efficiency in a well-placed emoji.

I\u2019ve had some fairly serious email interchanges over the years, so it\u2019s possible that I may have thrown in a :) to indicate a change of tone, but that\u2019s about it. In official, formal or professional correspondence, no, never ever. ",
