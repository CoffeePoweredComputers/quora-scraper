            "answer_text": "Most schools have jobs posted online and on a bulletin board at the district office. There are established ways for people to apply for these jobs. Have you already followed this course of action? If so, a letter to the principal informing him/her that you have done so would be appropriate. But to attempt to go around the normal process might not send a good message. I suggest you apply first, then write the letter. You could include a cover letter and a resume that is tailored specifically for the job you are seeking. Sending a photo along with the letter would also be helpful. Hand delivering the resume and letter might give you the opportunity to meet the principal in person. But, as I said, sending a letter and resume without first applying is not a good idea in my view of the situation. ",
