            "answer_text": "You do not need to be an expert to write on a topic. Essays tend to be more personal and reflective on a topic, rather than explicitly informative. It's a literary counterpoint to the research paper - whereas the latter is defined by constructing an argument based on fact and research, the former is more concerned with the author placing it into context of a greater set of abstract concepts.  One of the most acclaimed (arguably overrated) essayists of the past fifteen years was David Foster Wallace. You can read \"Consider the Lobster\" here for free: Consider the Lobster This was written for Gourmet magazine as a report on a local lobster festival, and becomes a meditation on food and ethics. While he takes care to provide citations for various factual assertions that he makes, keep in mind that Wallace was a writer, not a philosopher, biologist, culinarian, or animal behavioralist. What he was, though, was curious and a good writer; what this is is a literary piece exploring his understanding and thoughts around a topic that interested him, despite not being an expert. Now, how can you write something like this? I won't go into style and the nuts and bolts of writing. You should write about a subject you're familiar about and have put some thought into. Do some research into it and then construct a thesis based around it. Essays are less concerned with expert information than they are about ideas - they are intended to put forth an argument or stance regarding an issue or topic.  I would suggest reading some essays and looking into what kind of information they pull out, what they use, and how they write about it. ",
