Warning: This answer contains a use of vulgar language and words.  We left the place. Our scooters were running on the roads of Goa. Nikesh was driving, I was sitting on the back. He was fast, too fast that day. I was afraid of getting into an accident. Our scooty was running fast, it was overtaking vehicles one by one. We were fast too fast. I was thrilled of that speed, that rage of his. This speed was making me feel his rage. I knew he is anger. My fear of his rage, made me shout \"Bhaai! Dhree chala le.\"(Translation: Bro, drive slow.) He didn't hear it. I kind of knew that he ignored it or it was his anger who made him ignore my words. We passed the market. Our hotel was in a distant place. The road was empty now and dark too. He increased speed. It wasn't him, it was his rage who was driving that day. I was afraid I shouted \"Bhenchod dhire karle! Marne ka mann hai kya?\"(Translation: Dumbfuck! Slow the damn, scooty!) He didn't hear it again. What the fuck should I do? We are too fast. He isn't decreasing the speed. I shouted again, again and again. I felt we are gonna met an accident. I shouted again. My heart was beating faster than before. I felt fear. I punched him with my elbow on his back.  He felt it, and suddenly applied breaks. Our scooty skid. We were gonna fell but somehow he balanced. He lowered speed and stopped the scooty in between the road. The two friends also reached there. We got down and he pushed me away and bashed \"Bhenchod! tereko bharosa nahi hai kya merepe. Tu chala le, le.\"(Translation: Don't you trust my skills. You want to drive?) \"Mereko darr lag raha tha, laga gir jayenge. Tereko bola bhi toh dhire karne ko tune suna hi nahi.\" My voice was broken and heavy. (Translation: I was afraid. I thought we might get into an accident with this much speed. I told you so many times but you didn't responded to my voice. It was like you turned deaf.) \"Haan! to chal to raha tha. Itna hi darr lagta hai to gaand marane ko aaya tha hamare saath.\"(Translation: At least I was driving, you don't need to teach me. If you are this much afraid of speed then you should have stayed at hotel) He said to me, came forward and grabbed my collar. I slapped him out of rage. \"Dhang se chala raha tha tu? Chutiye jis tarah tu chala raha tha na, tu to marta hi, mereko bhi maarta. Bsdk 7000 ke chakkar me gaand phadwa deta\" I bashed him. (Translation: You weren't driving safely. With your driving we might have ended up at hospital) Nikesh came forward to punch me on my face. \"Chutiyo, ek dusre se hi ladoge kya?\" B shouted.(Translation: Idiots, why are you fighting with each other) Nikesh kneel and tears rolled down through his eyes, his palms were on his face, he cried and shouted \"Tereko kya pata, kitna bura laga jab usne bola baap ke paise udate hai hum. Sach hi kah raha tha kiske paise barbad kiye baap ke hi toh kiye\" (Translation: What do you know? How I felt when he said we dumped our dad's money for a girl). A and B came to him, I was still standing there, frozen. \"Sahi bol raha hai tu, ek number ke chutiye hai apan. papa ki mehnat ke paise yun ladki chodne ke liye uda ke aa gaye\" A said. (Translation: You're right! We are idiots. We dumped the money our dad earned just for sleeping with a girl). With this, they also started crying.  That day I saw three men crying in front of me. Usually, I hate crying, I hate seeing people crying but that day I didn't bash them. They cried, shouted for their families. I let them cry. Goa made them cry and that moment made them hate Goa. Goa wasn't fun for them anymore. They wiped faces, stood up. They didn't utter much and started scooties. I sat behind him. We reached the hotel and slept. I don't if they slept well that night but I am sure that night wasn't an easy one to pass.  2 days later! Nikesh- \"I have decided something!\" We all looked at him Me - \"What?\" Nikesh- \"I'll become an IAS and I'll get that girl out of that place\" Me - \"Hainn? Have you already fallen in love with her?\" Nikesh- \"This isn't love. It's gratitude. She made me feel safe, warm in that hell. I can not believe there was someone who could read my soul. She doesn't belong to that place. I'll get her out\" A - \"That's great! But what if you forgot all this?\" Nikesh - \"You're right! Roshan, I am assigning you a task. You always write something in that diary of yours. Write this incident, and when I became an IAS, you have to remind of this all.\" I smiled and said - \"Cool! Should I name it something? This incident I mean\" Nikesh - \"Yeah! Give it a title {{ not_decided }}\" Our train honked and we left Goa..........  A few hours later I saw Nikesh gazing out of the window. \"What happened? What are you thinking?\" I asked. \"I am thinking about her. Hey, what do you think, what kind of girl she would have been if she wasn't have been there?\" He asked to me. \"I think she would be have been turned out to be the one who would have played a major role in your life,\" I replied. \"What does that mean?\" He asked. \"You already know. Girlfriend, life partner, best friend, anything would work.\" I replied. He laughed and said \"Can't! She is way out of my league.\" \"I don't believe in leagues or other stuff, I believe in people and their personalities\" I replied. I don't know today when he will become an IAS, can he even become an IAS? What kind of beauty she was? She must be very beautiful and kind that she turned a brat to have a mature dream. Signing off! Roshan  Well, well, well! Finally, I completed what I had to write. I thought of many more conclusions and endings of the story and chose this one. I haven't given it a name yet, if you have one, then please give it one. Did you like it? The story, the ending, the conclusion. Suggestions are welcome. Is there something you would have changed, if you were the one who wrote it? I\u2019ll be waiting for your responses! ---That's all, Rest later! Your Senpai Nectar:) ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t fight. I just set boundaries. My best friend was invited with her husband, to a holiday meal. She hadn\u2019t called me for a week, which is highly unusual. We spoke EVERY day on the phone. I would email or call and leave a message as to what time I would pick them up. No answer. On the day of the dinner date still no answer. I was baffled, what to do? Then the phone rang, about noon or later, and she said \u201cHi..how are you (I had been very ill). We are at Magic Mountain.\u201d What? I could not believe it\u2026not cancelling our date nor any explanation. I asked her to come by when she could to pick up her Christmas gift, and when she did, I got no apology. Friendship ended, as I then recalled she treated me similarly; I had just over looked the many times. So that ended my calling her, etc. Sad, but I was wiser now that was similar to my childhood, so I subconsciously allowed others to treat me badly. Learned a great lesson. ",
