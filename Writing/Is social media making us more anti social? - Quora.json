            "answer_text": "Over the years social media has grown to be one of our primary methods of communication[1]. As social media continues to grow and people continue to move their lives onto online database, people are becoming more anti-social. Due to the ease of social media, millions of people have begun to move their interactions and conversations to the online world. For example, instead of catching up with an old friend or colleague in person over lunch, coffee, etc., people will simply text or message each other on social media platforms eliminating face to face interactions[2] . Furthermore, due to constant Facebook and Instagram profile updates, some people feel as if they are already caught up on the lives of their friends and feel no need to personally message them at all making them very anti-social. It seems as though instead of making an effort to verbally reconnect with old friends, people would rather sit at home on their technological devices and learn what their friends are up to through a social media platform. This perfectly illustrates how social media is making many people in our society more anti-social. Secondly, when individuals do chose to hang out or meet up with friends face to face, their conversations are often interrupted or cut short due to social media, thus making them more anti-social[3]. Think about it, have you ever been telling a friend or family member a story only to look up and see them sitting on their phone scrolling through their social media feeds or texting? Sadly, the answer for most people would be yes. When people do choose to hangout or catch up with friends they are no longer present in conversation due to social media and technology[4]. People will partially pay attention to the conversation being held in person while either having a completely separate conversation online through the use of social media or simply by just checking their social media feeds. This results in short conversations that lack the depth, importance, and interest proving that our society is becoming more anti-social. One of the very upsetting parts about this is that the constant use of social media, even when in the middle of a conversation, is becoming more and more widely accepted[5]. This constant interruption of using social media while in the middle of face to face interactions helps lead to the fact that the ability for individuals to have strong, focussed conversations, is slowly weakening at a rapid rate as we become more anti-social due to social media[6]. It has gotten to a point where teenagers will hangout in complete silence for long periods of time while they check their social media feeds, not saying a single word to their peers sitting in the same room. This clearly demonstrates how society is becoming much more anti-social due to social media. People simply need to make a more active effort to get out of their houses and meet up with others face to face to have good conversation and maintain connections rather than turning to social media platforms to do so. When doing so, it is vital that individuals remain present in conversation rather than constantly checking their phones to see updates on their social media platforms. This will help society break free from the anti-social bubble we are beginning to form around ourselves.

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. I know many people who are active on social media and most of them seem perfectly well-integrated to me. They combine social media with a healthy social life. However, this is just my experience. What I would say is that people have become conditioned to social media - in the sense that everywhere they go - they are virtually glued to their phone. This does strike me as anti-social behavior in that such people have a conditioned dependency - much like drug addicts. Furthermore, one of the perverse side-effects of social media is that it heavily promotes mob mentality - which is inherently anti-social. Because people are inclined to gravitate towards those who share similar opinions and beliefs - this disposition tends to reduce their capacity to think critically. Mob mentality is unfortunately embedded in our DNA. Because human beings are pack creatures who have always existed in small groups (not mass societies) - this was how we survived and still do. Research has shown that moving against the pack provokes the alarm circuits in our brain while conformity keeps us calm. So essentially, it\u2019s easier to fit in rather than stick out. This is where the dreaded phrase \u201cmob mentality\u201d comes from - which describes how people are influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors. Mob mentality is fundamentally anti-social and is rampant on social media in particular. Furthermore, neurobiologists have found that when people break off into groups, their brain produces chemicals that diminishes their normal thought pattern to a more primitive state. Which literally means people stop thinking when they\u2019re amalgamated into groups. An extreme example of such mob mentality was highlighted by \u201cDr Hannah Arendt\u201d who coined the phrase \u201cThe banality of evil\u201d. She controversially argues that what happened in Nazi Germany could largely be blamed on ordinary people conforming to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions\u201d. The underlying point here is that we need disagreements and debates to sharpen ourselves. Succumbing to conformity quashes growth - thereby creating stagnation in the process which brings upon it a sort of putrid rot. It makes you wonder how many past atrocities could have been averted and future acts of violence - if people thwarted away the herd mentality and started thinking for themselves. In my ideal world, social media wouldn\u2019t exist. Too much knowledge and information is a bad thing; too much circulation of news and gossip is a bad thing; too much of anything is a bad thing when it\u2019s on display for other people to see. Social media only promotes a busybody culture - from which the mob mentality emerges as a consequence. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Social media is indeed making us more anti-social. Our social skills are deteriorating at an increasing rate due to social media. \u201cSkills we use to communicate and interact with each other, both verbally and non-verbally, through gestures, body language and our personal appearance\u201d [1] are not being practiced enough due to the amount of time we dedicate to our gadgets, and specifically social media sites and applications. Due to the lack of face-to-face conversations we now hold, we are not developing the aforementioned social skills that help us connect with each other. \u201cBecause smart phones are so convenient, it is very easy for people to get distracted, which does not help our social skills.\u201d [2] All it takes to get on Facebook and other social apps is simply taking out our phones and we are automatically logged into the app of our choice at a touch. The effort of connecting to a dial-up internet modem is no longer a relevant issue. About 30 years ago is when Internet relay chats (IRC) were first used [3]. The main goal of this was to facilitate communication via text. Two individuals would use IRC to communicate with each other when they were away, but if they are meeting in-person, they would prioritize that interaction over any messages that were being received in their IRC. In today\u2019s day and age, social media apps and sites such as Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook are taking priority over face-to-face interactions. We often see individuals going on their phone to check their social apps while in the presence of other people. While it can be argued that social media makes it easier to organize group chats and plan group activities, if we are too busy showing our friends on snapchat what is happening, the questions arises if we really are enjoying the company of the friends that are currently present. In the absence of social media, we would make the effort to go to our friend/family member\u2019s house and truly enjoy their company. Due to the increasing usership of social media, the emotional intelligence of individuals is decreasing. It is much more difficult to \u201crecognize, understand and influence the emotions of others\u201d [4] over text versus in person. \u201cA recent study, published in the Journal of Organizational Behavior, by Ernest O\u2019Boyle Jr. at Virginia Commonwealth University, concludes that emotional intelligence is the strongest predictor of job performance. Numerous other studies have shown that high emotional intelligence boosts career success.\u201d [5] Therefore, not only is social media making us more anti-social, it can also negatively affect our job performance and professional lives. The Journal of Organizational Behavior by Lillian Eby is a recent study that states that \u201cnearly 3,000 scientific articles have been published on EQ since the concept was first introduced. These studies conclude that while EQ is mostly influenced by our early childhood experiences.\u201d [6] Thus, if we let social media affect us and degrade our emotional intelligence from an early age, it will be very difficult to improve it later on in life.

            "answer_text": "Social media can be seen as both a tool for attempting to maintain existing friendships as well as create new ones based on common interest. This is socially understood to be the main reason (at least that people say) they use much of social media, including platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and newer apps like Shapr. Though, obviously, from a critical perspective there are other reasons for use such as monetization, and general voyeurism. But at the same time, these platforms can be seen as creating a distancing affect that makes people communicate more through media, and less often in real physical space. Social media can actually have an alienating effect of making people see friendships, communicated by itemizations such as followers, likes, friends, etc., that they monitor in comparison to others [1]. Jealousy and feelings of inadequacy stemming from these issues, as well as other related self-consciousness issues from image, distance users\u2019 relationships to each other. Dr. Graham C.L. Davey wrote for Psychology Today about this phenomenon, finding that feelings of loneliness and anxiety were both created from using social media, but paradoxically also drive the need to compulsively use and check it. It is also connected to FOMO (fear of missing out), when taking into account that users feel a need to stay \u201cupdated\u201d on each other\u2019s lives, and that they may see events etc. that they were not invited to (ex: someone\u2019s wedding picture on Instagram, Facebook giving you the notification that your friends are attending an event near you tomorrow). Loneliness, though hard to quantify and outright identify, has been seen as steadily increasing in society [2]. Social media continues to market itself as a promising platform for social engagement, but will continue to paradoxically take time away from real relationships. But in terms of specific, smaller forms of social connection, social media can be helpful: invitations to events, sharing pictures with friends and family abroad, and maintaining a way to contact an acquaintance from the past. But there are limits, and dangerous consequences in overuse. It is no wonder Facebook has now mostly become inundated by posts of older generations. They are most likely the loneliest. https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-we-worry/201612/social-media-loneliness-and-anxiety-in-young-people2. http://fortune.com/2016/06/22/loneliness-is-a-modern-day-epidemic/ ",

            "answer_text": "According to me - Yes. Social media IS making us a little less social.Social networking is making us antisocial in many indirect and not so obvious ways. Yes it is true that it has given us ways to reach out to a larger set of people and redefined the way we interact with each other. It helped us to know about how different people think. Infact I could go on writing the good things about it but that's not the point. All these points look good only in writing. Ideally we should have become more and more socially connected as a result of social media but in reality I don't see that happening. Atleast not anywhere around myself. People are getting more and more addicted to screens. They are starting to believe that being 24x7 on the internet makes them connected to the outside world. Little do they realise that it only is consuming them and it's just their screens that is connected to other screens and not people. Wishing someone on their birthday has been reduced to just doing so on their Facebook walls or messaging them on Whatsapp. Gone are the days of wishing them in person let alone calling them on phone. This practice has become so common that its ridiculousness is hardly noticed. And this is just one of the examples of how socially disconnected it is making us. I think one of the reasons that people get easily glued to online social networking is the level of their openness on this platform. People are quite open and free to express their thoughts when it comes to doing it online. For instance it's easy for a guy to compliment a stranger of her beauty on the internet. But how many have the balls to step up and do that in person? Not even me to be frank. This is the difference between a real society and a virtual online society. I would like to quote a sentence that I had recently read in a blog: Get off social media. You can do without continuous pings about how perfect others\u2019 fake lives are going And this photo from 9gag sums it all:\u200b  \u200b\u200bFinally, as I had already said in the beginning, the social media is supossed to make us more and more connected but it's for us to decide which connections really do matter. P.S. please read my first post in my blog which is somewhat related to this context: Kunal Kishore's post in My blog 815Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "Although there are many benefits of social media (connecting with people you care about who live farther away, being able to see what is happening in your location), there are elements of social media that have the potential to make us more antisocial. Suler (2004) wrote about the disinhibition effect. There are six factors that can influence behavior online. I will only describe four because I think they are more relevant for antisocial behavior. Dissociative anonymity: when people\u2019s real identity is covered up by an email or username, there\u2019s less of a perceived risk of consequences for their online actions. People may become more likely to open up about their lives and express themselves more readily than they would if their boss or family could see what they were saying.Invisibility: being invisible in cyberspace gives people courage to do things they wouldn\u2019t normally do because no one can see them. This is particularly true of text-driven environments such as chatrooms or forums. This invisibility makes the disinhibition stronger because the actor won\u2019t see the judgmental faces of others and the other won\u2019t see how the actor is feeling as they are disclosing information or passing judgment.Asynchronicity: In real life, interactions with others are synchronous or happening at the same time. In contrast, people online can choose when they want to respond (in the same moment, days or weeks after the initial interaction). This disinhibits people\u2019s reactions, and online psychotherapist K. Munro (2003) says that there may be cases of \u201cemotional hit and run\u201d, where someone may leave a hostile or personal message and leave it behind. It\u2019s probably harder to insult someone in person because you have to see their feelings get hurt, but online you can opt-out.Minimization of status and authority: online, people have a relatively equal opportunity to state their opinion. In real life, an authority figure\u2019s status is known and your actions will have consequences (legally, socially, at work). The fear of being punished offline is greatly reduced when you go online - therefore, youre more likely to misbehave.I recommend reading the entire paper and having a look around for more literature. It\u2019s very interesting, and can tell you more about the motivations behind antisocial behavior online. ",

But you have to understand the science behind social media and why it keeps you hooked. Whenever you scroll through the picture of your friend or someone who is spending his time, living a lavish lifestyle, your brain kicks into thinking that I wish I could do that same thing. Isn\u2019t it? In other words, your brain releases chemicals like dopamine, serotonin and other neurotransmitters that give you temporary happiness.  So, to get that burst of happiness, again and again, we, scroll through social like a never-ending loop and wherever you restrict yourself from social media you feel lonely. Hence, social media don\u2019t make us lonely, the way we use it Does What is the solution then? if I ask you a question- Why Are you even on Quora? , What would be your answer ?. For those of you who know why they are on quora then congratulations, you are those rare percentage of people who are not getting distracted by this social jungle.But for those, who don\u2019t know why they are even in this platform, then the problem arises. Hence, Ending up wasting their time and resources.In the same way, Facebook, Instagram has a good side too- For those who know why they are using it. Just for the sake of posting pictures for likes and comment, is just getting that dopamine strike. The loop continues. Is Social Media making us Anti-social? It again comes down to one single principle- Why are you even using that platform. If you know it, you will have a certain time period to use it. If you would ask me, then I quit Facebook for around 2 years but again I have come back due to my business reasons, ads and all. and coming back to anti-social part- It happens only when we excessively get engaged in that loop as described above.

            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question. To understand the concept or to fathom the answer to this question, firstly let us perceive what does anti-social mean. Anti-social means \u2013 \u2018contrary to the laws and customs of society, in a way that causes annoyance and disapproval in others\u2019. There is also yet another meaning \u2013 \u2018not sociable or wanting the company of others\u2019. Am sure most of us would agree that it certainly isn\u2019t the former. Could be the latter. Though in earlier days, anti-social certainly meant \u2018contrary to the laws and customs of the society\u2019. Therefore, now let us look at the term anti-social in relation to Social Media as - \u2018not sociable or wanting to be in the company of others\u2019. How far is this true and what could be the reasons for the same? We should understand in earlier days, folks were not as busy as this generation. People nowadays just don\u2019t seem to have time for themselves, then imagine trying to find time for others. Even though there are plenty of electronic gadgets and appliances to make life easier and tasks quicker, yet we just don\u2019t have enough time. Another reason that we may not be in the company of their near and dear ones could be because of the responsibilities they are endowed with. In the earlier days too, humans went far and wide, but in those days people did not have very effective means of communication \u2013 like we do have these days. Anybody remember snail mail? If we look at all the inventions or discoveries in the world, we will realize that an inventor or a discoverer had humane reasons for bringing about a product or idea to the light of day. But there is always a blind side not perceived by them. For example a knife, there are plenty of good uses, but it has been put to wrong use too. So looking at social media in this light, these mediums have been brought into our existence for good use. But maybe it is not being used in the right sense. So we just cannot generalize life. There are good uses and not so good uses too. A glass half filled with water, is either half full or half empty. But we know that mobiles and now smartphones have changed our lives drastically. And apps are there to make life much easier. Take a leap of faith make an interesting app, make a difference in people\u2019s lives. You have app development firms to fulfill your dream. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, All -  Interesting question. Three issues here: Face-to-Face Social media handled well simply enhances our relationships and allows us to interact with people we otherwise would not even know exist or have any way to connect to.  I find that my online activity actually stimulates me into more face-to-face interactions, because the online interactions sharpen my ability to express myself. Quality versus Quantity This is only an issue for those people who think numbers are all important.  I know some folks who are not online who have many superficial relationships where they claim to \"know' someone based on a casual regular contact.  In my opinion, the most valuable way to establish online relationships is the same way you do it in the physical world - over time, carefully, with respect for the other person as an individual.   If you are just piling up \"body count\", you are not doing any of those things. Facilitation Absolutely, online networking allows for these connections.  I used to go to traditional workshops, conferences, and expositions where thousands of potential professional colleagues would congregate.  As an introvert, I would meet a few people, we might make a connection that resulted in ongoing contact, but the sheer complexiity of the events would work against that . . . and I seldom came anywhere near the larger lights of my professional world.  They were insulated from the masses. Not so in online networking.  I have established concrete relationships with some pretty well-known and accomplished folks this way.  The kicker:  Online media does not make us social or anti-social.  Each of us as an individual does that through our approach and our relative willingness to extend ourselves to other human beings to build a true relationship. ",

Sure if you define social as being face to face then of course it\u2019s making us more ant social. But is that really a problem? It\u2019s just old people who feel uncomfortable that a new generation has morphed the definition to suit their lifestyle and choices available to them. Just because kids don\u2019t do things the same way you did doesn\u2019t make it wrong. It\u2019s been going on since Adam was a pup. Social is social. Whether face to face or screen to screen. We are interacting and in fact \u2018meeting\u2019 more people and gaining greater insights into other people\u2019s lives than we ever have. We are learning more. I can\u2019t see how that is a bad thing. And let\u2019s get one thing straight. People still socialise face to face, just perhaps not as much. Big deal\u2026I\u2019ve seen them act just as stupidly whether it\u2019s on social media or in person. Kids or Adults. It\u2019s like saying that we don\u2019t commute anymore because your definition of commuting was riding around in a horse drawn cart. Well someone invented the engine so we have more options and do things differently. So what? The only thing that\u2019s changed is the definition. And like anything progress changes definitions constantly. There\u2019s good and bad. At least you can\u2019t get beaten up on Facebook can you? You can face to face. Bullying? It happens just as much either way. Bully\u2019s will always find a way to bully. Relax, the kids are alright, they\u2019ll work it out. . ",

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting topic. \u2018Social Media\u2019 and \u2018Anti-social\u2019 nearly act as antonym\u2019s, yet a common topic of discussion nowadays revolves around the proposition that platforms meant to engage our society in collaborative discussion (Social Media), actually cause distance and segregation. I assume the use of \u2018anti-social\u2019 presumes that humans aren\u2019t communicating offline as frequently as they once did. Personally, I believe that Humans aren\u2019t unwilling to communicate, however, how we communicate has changed drastically. Nonetheless, Research has stated that though Social Media usage has not been directly linked to increases in \u2018anti-social\u2019 behavior, it has shown correlations between people who use social media more often and those user\u2019s likelihood to report feeling socially isolated[i]. Specifically, \u201cpeople who spent more time on social media\u2014two hours a day or more\u2014had twice the odds of feeling socially isolated than people who spent less than half an hour a day on it\u201d[ii]. However, Elizabeth Miller of the University of Pittsburgh stated, \u201cWe do not yet know which came first\u2014the social media use or the perceived social isolation\u201d[iii]. This leads us to conclude that we cannot make any assumptions as to whether Social Media explicitly causes \u2018anti-social\u2019 behaviors. We can only speculate. The same study delved into possible reasons for feelings of social isolation. A largely theorized cause accredits people\u2019s behavioral tendency to compare themselves to other people. Comparing yourself to others on Social Media is not new to anyone, and can illicit a stronger psychological effect than most realize. Social Comparison is a widely used term and concept in consumer behavior and marketing strategy. The term refers to consumer\u2019s tendency to compare themselves to the people they surround themselves with. Marketer\u2019s use this concept to tailor and customize products/advertisements to satisfy consumers need for achievement. Why is this important? I want to emphasize that Social Comparison occurs in the absence of Social Media. However, Social media platforms can empower, and even justify Social Comparison. Ego padding, group coercion, self validation/gratification and echo chambers all existed prior to Social Media. Let's not pretend that Social Media is the problem; it's just an enabler. I do not believe that Social Media is making us \u2018anti-social\u2019, per se. Humans are more interconnected than ever before. Globalization of commerce was the tip of the iceberg. Now we experience the globalization of culture, communication, and interaction. I do, however, believe that a consequence of such interconnectedness is the expedited transcendence of pre-existing psychological phenomena. As I said before, issues like Social Comparison existed long before Social Media did. Social Media has simply made it easier for us to compare ourselves. In turn, humans will experience the negative effects at a larger and more prevalent rate.

            "answer_text": "The use of social media has proliferated within the last decade or so. About 80% of Americans claim they have a social media profile; 94% of teenagers check their social media accounts daily. You would assume that this helps us stay connected with one another on a more intimate level. Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. Think about all those times when you were in an awkward situation. What\u2019s you first reaction? You whip out your phone from your pocket and randomly start scrolling down through your contacts or checking aimlessly for notifications. Whether you\u2019re in a elevator, in a meeting, or even in a pub, you can\u2019t stand sitting next to a random person in fear of him or her initiating an uncomfortable conversation. By being on your phone, you\u2019re sending the body signal that you\u2019re busy and preoccupied at the moment with your device. Even if you aren\u2019t doing anything important, others assume you don\u2019t want to be talked to. Even in social events, people try to avoid talking to people that are on their phones. The thing with social media is it\u2019s fake. You can portray this false image of yourself and nobody would take a second glance. It\u2019s essentially a contest to see who\u2019s living the best life. In effect, people start comparing their lives to others and become depressed when they see their accomplishments aren\u2019t meeting the expectations of others. Also, I feel like when people are always posting updates about their lives, there\u2019s nothing to talk about it when they each other since they\u2019ve already informed the whole world. How a Conversation Would Go Between Teenagers Nowadays \u201cHey what did you do last weekend?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t you check my Instagram stories? I posted everything on there.\u201d \u201cOh yeah\u2026.\u201d(awkward pause desperately trying to figure out what to say next.) Of course there are some positive aspects about social media. Such as keeping long-distance relationships and spreading awareness on vital issues, or even advertising new businesses. In the end, it\u2019s essentially what you make out of it. But we can unanimously agree social media is not a confidence booster and definitely not increasing our social intelligence. ",

As in: Reducing the occurrence of physical social contacts and thus reducing the need for, and thereby causing a lack of social skills for face to face contacts.It is making some of us (a lot of us, it seems) more antisocial. We \u201csay\u201d things to other people on social media that we would never say to them in person. We are rude and all too often feel free to leave snarky and hateful comments on posts and topics, because we feel safely anonymous. Many people have been burned by this false sense of anonymity, especially politicians and employees everywhere.I speak from experience. I\u2019m an introvert and I love interacting in a written format, it gives me time to think and formulate my thoughts much better. I\u2019m awkward and uncomfortable in social situations, and also bored, because I don\u2019t enjoy the small talk. I am usually a kind and thoughtful person, but I find myself leaving witty and snarky comments on other peoples\u2019 posts to amuse myself and to dazzle the world with my wit. I have observed other people whom I know, to be a different kind of person when I see their comments on Facebook or wherever. I have one person in mind whom I know quite well to be a very thoughtful, kind, and intelligent man when face to face, be a complete troll online. It boggles my mind, and I have had to unfriend him in order to retain my affection and respect for him. And to be really honest, I am myself also often thoughtless and unkind when leaving comments. I have noticed it, and I\u2019m trying to stop it, but the perceived anonymity makes it very tempting! ",

            "answer_text": "There is a notion that social media, although labelled as a social platform, is making us increasingly anti-social, however, the accuracy of this statement depends on how you define social. There is an undeniable act of socializing on social media - it just consists of a different kind of socializing. Social media allows us to communicate with a larger group of people at once, and it should not be completely considered anti-social. It is not a question of becoming anti-social, but a change in the definition of social. In a way social media allows us to interact with people who share our interests and whom we may not have met without access to social media. In a Huffington Post article, Molly Reynolds writes that, \u2018Because of social media, we are able to connect with people that we would never have the opportunity to meet, simply because we are allowed access \u2014 instead of having to be in the right place at the right time.\u2019 [1] Social media is allowing us to meet people and therefore making us increasingly social in this sense. Although friendships may exist purely online, they may also develop into offline relationships that started thanks to the ability of social media to connect us with like-minded individuals. In an instance where someone may not be surrounded by like-minded people, social media may in fact serve as a social escape from one\u2019s isolation. Isolation can occur when someone is not surrounded by people with which they feel comfortable, and therefore, they may not want to partake in social activities. In these cases, social media may act as a social outlet for individuals to connect with people that share their interests and give them a place to socialize. When radio and television were introduced, there was a fear that these new technologies would make us anti-social, but instead they have become integrated into our social habits. Watching television or going to see a movie with friends is considered a social activity, and this can also be applied to the use of social media. Not only has social media become one of the main ways people communicate and make plans to meet up in person, but it allows long-distance friendships to succeed. In terms of socializing face to face with individuals, social media affects our attention span and therefore the amount of time we spend with friends and family, while not looking at our phones. Social media is altering the way we spend time with others. In 2015, CNBC released data from a study that showed that out of 3000 participants, \u2018\u2026 76 percent of females check social media platforms at least 10 times when out with friends, compared with 54 percent of males.\u2019 [2] This statistic does not necessarily mean that people are ignoring those around them when checking social media, but instead, that it has become integrated into how we spend time with others. The integration of social media into our social habits has altered the way that people spend time together and it is this integration that may be wrongly defined as people becoming more anti-social.

            "answer_text": "To begin with, here\u2019s Webster Dictionary\u2019s definition of the term antisocial : hostile or harmful to organized society. The word is also synonymous to antagonistic, offensive, and unacceptable. Let me being with the simplest, most obvious accomplishment of social media: It helps prolong long distance relationships. I\u2019m sure we all can relate to the fact that social media has been able to connect each and every one of us to many of our friends and family members all over the globe, regardless of their geographic locations or time zones. Unlike international calling systems, social media is free. As humans, being social creatures, when met with a means of communication that is, in most cases, effective, we plunged right into it to make a judicious use of it. Many social media platforms like Skype has been able to provide us with face-to-face communication, hence making relationships more \u201csocial\u201d and INTERACTIVE, as opposed to just absolutely losing contact with your peers altogether. Social media hence obliterates the divide of time and geography, creating a more networked society. Secondly, as mentioned before, we are social creatures. People feel the need for social interaction especially when sad, troubled, or stressed. But for some people, the idea of approaching someone and opening up to them, even if it is a family member, may seem quite daunting. This is where social media comes to play. In a study conducted by Professor Jonah Berger, it was found that sharing via tweets or Facebook posts, etc., can alleviate these concerns. This method of communication, unique to social media, allows people to reach out to a large audience without having to direct their message to any one person who might be annoyed or busy. As a result, the person posting may have REDUCED ANXIETY about initiating social interaction. Social media provides a platform to introverts, and people suffering from social anxiety, to express their views without the fear of being judged, as well as maintain their privacy and create a sense of anonymity. When these individuals, who are often left out or feel like out-castes in social situations, find someone they can relate to, and can connect with, they naturally feel more confident, amicable, and in all forms, SOCIAL. Most importantly, apart from social media being a great means of communication and interaction, and creating remnants of memories that can be easily revisited, it is also an essential tool towards revolutionizing society and its ideals. I\u2019d like you to pay close attention to some of the most searched questions on Google in 2017; how many refugees are there in the world, how to calm a dog during storm, how to help flood victims, refugees, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Syria, Paris, Las Vegas, Houston, Grenfell tower, Somalia, and the list goes on! THIS is anything BUT antagonistic. If it were not for social media, our attempts at making a difference in the lives of those victims would not have been as impactful, and neither would we have had the opportunity to be THIS responsive towards social evil. Go search up, on any social media platform, the impact of movies like Black Panther and Wonder Woman, of all the suppressed classes in the world. There are literally videos of women, children, men of all kinds, of all countries, of all races, CRYING in cinemas, so overwhelmed by the revolutionary changes in the cinematic industry. There have been cases of people PAYING for those who black people who could not afford to watch the movie Black Panther, because it is SO empowering, SO uplifting. Isn\u2019t that social? Movements like #Time\u2019sUp and #MeToo and ideas like \u2018Representation matters\u2019 have been able to reach a wide circle of people with the help of social media. Every single victim of rape, abuse, social injustice, etc., has been able to gain a strong voice through these networking apps. Being aware of the changes and happenings in society and the world does NOT make one hostile, harmful, unacceptable, offensive, or antagonistic to organized society, hence proving that notion wrong. In fact, it makes us more social, more connected, more aware, and most importantly, more human. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s pretty much difficult to answer that, as it all depends on your personal opinions and experiences. Communication through social media might not be simple and meaningful today like it used to be before, but social media has its own perks too. Mass socialization with sites like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and many dating websites has been made possible. And, these sites today have become necessity. The only drawback here is the fact that we aren\u2019t using these sites to do something meaningful. We often get under pressure to perform well in the virtual world, and that\u2019s when we start creating meaningless negativity around us. When relations get intertwined with social media, we fall into a space where our real social circle is pushed aside. We end up doing things without considering the repercussions. Nonetheless, with sites like Sagoon coming up, we can make the most out of our social media presence. After using the app, a little, I was able to understand that the app is designed to help people with building true connections, share useful experiences and earn while socializing. They have come up with this concept of social gifting as they are coming up with an option to earn while we socialize. Soon, Sagoon is launching a feature called \u201cSocial Smart Card\u201d, a digital card that will fulfil all the shopping and gifting needs of its users. Social Smart Card will let the users earn while they shop or redeem coupons!! I believe Sagoon is one of those platforms that can change the way we think about social media. And I am pretty sure, there are many other sites with some unique features, which can help you deal with social media pressure!!! Spending time on these sites would be much more helpful for you in the long run. You will be able to earn through them, there wouldn\u2019t be any negativity and you\u2019ll never be anti-social. Every social media platform is unique in its own way, it\u2019s just that you need to be careful with what you chose and how much time you spend using them! ",

            "answer_text": "IMHO, it does not. Nothing can actually make a social person unsocial. Probably, anti-social people can blame it on social media. A social person can very well create a group on social media for people with similar interests in a certain locality and organize meetups and meet new people. A social person who connects with an old friend after ages on social will certainly invite the friend to catch up and chat. Introverts who cannot get themselves to talk to people can actually benefit from social media as they can at least chat online without having face to face conversations. The even more shy ones at least get to view conversations of other people on social media and not feel super lonely in this world. Social media does not make us unsocial in any way and it helps people who have a problem with being social in some way or other to still connect with Homo sapiens from across the world. We must feel blessed to be a part of this era where social media is booming. ",

            "answer_text": "On the contrary, I think it gives those who don\u2019t like a lot of in-person contact, a reason to be *more* social, and gives the opportunity for a lot more socializing when it\u2019s something people will actually enjoy. I\u2019ve re-activated old friendships with people I hadn\u2019t seen in years, and probably would have never found again, let me know about activities that were going on, etc. Now I\u2019m about as anti-social a sumbitch as you\u2019re likely to ever encounter, most of the time - so my choice would be no interaction, if I had to get up and go out and spend an evening with anyone I wasn\u2019t sleeping with and didn\u2019t give birth to, on the kind of regular basis most people require to maintain a relationship if they\u2019re *not* Facebooking or whatever. But I can chat with people when I feel like it, and take them up on the occasional gathering that sounds like fun, when I get in the mood. I think it actually both increases socializing for those who would be hit or miss otherwise, and merely highlights the number and dedication of those who were antisocial to start with, when they show up occasionally on Facebook or Twitter or whatever.

            "answer_text": "Social media can supplement and enrich real-life relationships by enabling people to keep in touch, make plans, share, etc., and mediated communication enables those who are otherwise socially awkward to express themselves more freely and easily, and strips away prejudices based on age, gender, race, etc. We also establish relationships based on shared interests rather than proximity, and those invested in their virtual communities will tell you that meaningful relationships are maintained and cultivated via social media.  On the other hand, my students often report that attachment to one's 'device' often takes precedence to \"talking\" in situations when people are physically sharing the same space (roommates at home at the same time, students waiting together in a room, and so on). Would inviting your roommate to a party via Facebook while she is sitting in the next room be considered more anti-social than not? To what extent, if any, are devices being used as a crutch/security blanket and/or keeping people from experiencing the present moment more fully when others are close-by? Does obsession with our devices lead to less real life conversation? Does less real-life conversation necessarily mean more anti-socialism or a reduction in social skills?   Most of what we know about this is anecdotal and based on conjecture; we need more scientific research to answer questions about the advantages and pitfalls of CMC. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say no. From an outside perspective, especially from those in the older generations, it could easily seem that way because people spend time on their computers and phones rather than going out to meet friends face to face. However, this isn\u2019t necessarily a sign that people are becoming less social, but rather that socialization is evolving. The way we socialize is definitely changing, but I think that, as a world, we are actually getting more social. Social media have made it possible for us to make friends and share ideas with people we otherwise never would have encountered, and we can now have direct (and instantaneous) communication with the political leaders, authors, and celebrities that 50 years ago would have been totally out of reach. Before going to a new school or city, we can already know what life is like and what people do there. Before my freshman year of college, I became a member of a Facebook group and a GroupMe chat with everyone who lived in my dorm building. We were able to establish a bond with each other weeks before the first day of classes, and I am positive that there are many people who would have been more likely to keep to themselves and refrain from socializing without that preliminary step which made things much easier.

The use of Social Media makes us more social in the Social Media world but makes us less social in the real world. The people who are very active on the Social Media platforms are hardly social in the real world. There are some friends of mine , whenever I go to hang out with them they are always busy applying filters in their lives . Its hard to talk to them face to face but its very easy to DM them . I sometimes get so frustrated about the fact that they came with me to hangout and they are busy snap chatting their fake social life and then they write captions like \u201c Enjoying Life with Brijinder Singh at xyz location #YOLO\u201c Hell no ,You should write: \u201cEnjoying life with my Phone as usual at xyz location #fml \u201c. Now coming to the point I would say that social media is making you social in the Social World which is full of lies and showoff . You can approach to anyone on a Social Platform but you can\u2019t do the same in the real world. Due to social media most of the human race have stopped taking out quality time for their families , Friends and their loved ones. I would just like to say at the end that come out of the filters in which you are living and Enjoy life to the fullest . Live in the moment and not always try to capture it .

            "answer_text": "I actually think it can make you more social in many ways... for example one of the biggest uses of Facebook is self-promotion.  We want others to think that our lives are better than theirs, and sitting at home playing Farmville isn't going to make that happen. I'm willing to bet that many people have opted to go out on a Saturday night with friends to a happening bar or club at least partially to populate their feed with photos, check-ins and statuses with (seemingly) exciting details of their night, when truthfully they probably would have rathered stay in with a glass of wine and a movie. Aside from that, I've also found that facebook enables you to stay in touch (albeit in a very superficial, digital way) with a much wider circle of friends than you otherwise would have.  By being fed these snippets of their lives on a monthly, weekly or even daily basis, it feels as if you are keeping in touch.  This makes it much easier in the future to legitimately catch up with these people in person because it feels much less awkward. There are definitely people that I have caught up with for coffee, attended their birthday party, and even in one case their wedding purely due to the fact we kept in touch on facebook.

To see a family out for lunch or dinner, and each member in their own little insulated world, on their device, interacting with whichever social media they were on, smiling at the phone, laughing, no conversation to their family members, but amazingly, occasionally showing each other something on the device. That to me, is very sad. The art of conversation seems to be getting lost. And i am guilty of this too. My husband and i get home, eat dinner, during which I insist there be no social media, or devices used, and we sit, and talk, or maybe watch a favourite tv program, or movie. But after dinner, he sits ALL NIGHT watching YouTube videos, going on Facebook, looking for cars on Craigslist. I get very irritated, yet what can i say when i am equally as bad? I am taking care of my Facebook Groups, and answering questions on Quora. Sometimes i feel it\u2019s a cunning plan to separate people from each other in the real world, so they no longer remember, or ever knew in the first place, how to have a conversation. To chat. To listen, and reply. Whatever the longer term plan is, i know not, but it does separate us. I actually find it a little scary. ",

            "answer_text": "Did you know that 24 percent of people surveyed in a recent poll said that they had missed witnessing important moments because they were too busy trying to write about them on their favourite social network\u2026 while they were taking place? Ah, the irony. Of course, I\u2019ve addressed the more that you\u2019re on Twitter talking about what you\u2019re doing, then the less that you\u2019re actually doing it. Social media is amazing. It connects the world and empowers us all to make better decisions about our lives. 83 percent of shy and lonely survey respondents reported that platforms like Twitter and Facebook helped them make new friends, and 25 percent said that these channels had boosted their confidence. But if you take things too far it can come at a cost. The same rules apply: much like absinthe and KFC double downs, sure, go ahead and enjoy yourself, but it\u2019s important to keep everything in moderation. When you look at the numbers they\u2019re actually pretty frightening. Almost two in five people spend more time socialising online than they do face-to-face. Americans spend 441 minutes each and every month using Facebook on their mobile phones. This, of course, means they\u2019re Facebooking when they should probably be focusing on something else (you know, like driving, or the birth of their child). As the great Ferris Bueller once said, \u201cLife moves pretty fast. If you don\u2019t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of social. I think mobile is the root of the whole 'social media makes us less social' argument. These days, we tend to forgo real-life interaction for the safety of our mobile devices. From commuters to people at 'social' events trying to appear busy by burying themselves in their phone, I think there is a bit of a cause for concern. I don't mind people on their phones, but there's a fine line. For example, don't whip out your phone to see what your friend had for lunch in the middle of a real life conversation. The way we interact online creates unrealistic and distorted perceptions of what is social. All we see are everyones' human highlight reels on slideshow and it creates this almost artificial sense that we're all living perfect lives. We are not. Flip back to real life... now that is truly interesting. But perception does shape everything. The extent to which we are foregoing face-to-face for mobile companionship is a concern. I feel like we need more real faces... less Facebook. ",

            "answer_text": "We are all living in the digital age \u2013 where smartphone usage is rampant and people are mostly focused on their smartphone\u2019s screens. So is it safe to assume that social media is making us anti-social? Before I answer that question, let\u2019s first define the meaning of \u201canti-social\u201d. Dictionary.com says that when a person is anti-social, he/she is unwilling or unable to associate in a normal or unfriendly way. Meanwhile, Cambridge Dictionary defines it as someone who doesn\u2019t want to spend time with other people. With this, I think social media is NOT making us antisocial, just extremely distracted. Digital distraction occurs when people spend too much time on social media or other digital application that they tend to forget to socialize with other people face-to-face. Not that we don\u2019t want to spend time with other people, it\u2019s just we tend to focus more on our phones than people. For instance, people still do gatherings and lunch dates. However, what happens is that they still spend time with their phones than talking with people in front of them. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. People un-learn traditional, \u2018multi-layered\u2019 social skills. Social media is about texting, sending icons, sharing edited pictures or clicking \u2018like\u2019 buttons. There are no non-verbal cues to learn, no verbal skills to train. Social media is not a free socialization space, it\u2019s a business. They profit with you being online all the time. They use AI algorithms to track your behavior and feed your inbox with stuff you already like. This works well for ad agencies, but not for people, which end up isolated in their own cage of personal interests and bigotry. This is why so many teens are insecure about their looks or \u2018boring\u2019 lives: they follow profiles that promote their own obsessions, reinforcing how far they are from what\u2019s \u2018cool\u2019, \u2018hot\u2019 or \u2018fun\u2019 in their micro-world. Kids with low self-steem join groups of same people, sharing the same negative views, never getting a different perspective, only ditto heads. That\u2019s how normal people become addicts, rapists and school shooters. Social media lacks a \u2018negative feedback\u2019 loop that challenges people\u2019s beliefs and help them get a balance. Quora is a positive exception: I can ask whatever I want, people can answer whatever they want, we all get an unfiltered sample of opinions we are free to average. ",

In earlier times in 1990\u2032 there is no such thing much popular be like Mobiles phones and social media. People use to freely enjoy visiting each other's houses without any hesitation or permission even at their close relatives places because at that time there is no mobiles and advancement in technology, children also used to enjoy physical activities outside playing various games and most often they are more socially active . No doubt social media, technology and mobile phones have given us a freedom to get updated in seconds but also social media has made us unsocial because our social circle is virtually active always online but when we try to reach them physically they are not available . So, above is a clear example that social media and technology has turned us into a unsocial and slaves of technology. Kindest regards, Dhruv Jyoti ",

They either loose a lot of their social skills, or never get them in the first place. Yes it makes for more anti-social people. If you go anywhere that people gather, most of them are glued to their phone screens. Sometimes I think that they're interacting with the person next to them via the phone. Teens walking down the street, across the road, concentrating on the phone not on the road. Yep say what you like. Social media is a personal isolator. Yes you get to interact, but in a virtual reality way. ",

This means the person who has no friends in their school or neighborhood can now use social media to find a friend somewhere else. This means that someone can travel to another country and meet up with someone who has a similar hobby. I traveled to Hong Kong and connected with other photographers through Instagram. They were all really cool and they took me out to some nice spots to shoot that I wouldn\u2019t have been able to go to without that inside info. In this case, like it is for many others, social media acted as a gateway to in-person social interaction. We also have to consider that the definition of \u201csocial\u201d is changing and most of us still only consider it to be in-person interaction. Also, the telephone was viewed to make people \u201cless social\u201d as well because we no longer had to meet in person. Those who are seen as becoming anti-social from social media likely weren\u2019t all that social to begin with. Social media simply amplifies, it doesn\u2019t make someone social or anti-social. ",

            "answer_text": "I would use the term asocial here instead of antisocial. Antisocial behavior implies those behaviors that cause harm to people and property. Asocial behaviors are those behaviors that indicate lack of interest in socializing, which is what the question is referencing. I would not say social media is making us asocial. It's just making us socialize in different ways. The rewards that come along with coventional face-to-face socializing like getting to know new people, impressing them and making them like you is also there if you socialize electronically. Further, it's also easier to socialize online because of some advantages: Unlike conventional socializing where your first impression is on your appearance at that moment, in social media you can take your time to use the best picture or video that shows you in your peak physical attractiveness. Through this you give people the impression that that is how you usually look and that works to your advantage.Your social media profile also can be tweaked for likability. You can take the time to craft a near-perfect catchy description of yourself that reels people in and amazes them. In normal socialization you have to rely on your mind-mouth combination to work for you.In electronic socialization, you have time for repartees and comebacks. In conventional socialization, unless you have a quick mind, you don't have much time to impress people with comebacks.Through electronic socialization you can show the best parts of yourself to the world and leave out the bad ones.With these advantages, one would prefer using social media to socialize.

By the time my graduation was completed, some remained to be friend and some became acquaintance. This probably is kind of normal and happens everywhere. Now as most of us like to keep ourself connected to each other so we use Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp etc for this and this is how we keep seeing events or activities of others there. What deeply shock me is, those same people I was once friend with and were always active in having healthy discussion about political, religions facts, general human behavior etc are now seen sharing photos with quotes full of hatred. They think, saying few slogans make them patriotic but don\u2019t know anything about India\u2019s history about anything, not even struggle of our independence. They think following one person of one party make them nation lover and rest of the world becomes antinational for them. They believe that people from only one religion are real patriotic rest, people from east-end and north-end are not true Indians. They believe that feminism or patriarchy is equality. They actually believe that issue of partitioning a society on the basis of caste can be solved by asking for reservations in education institutes and job but not by asking for better environment to learn, grow and empower everyone. Basically they believe anything some propaganda driven people share with them crushing over the facts, playing with their sentiments and end up earning some furiosity toward each other. In short, they are piercing hatred in innocent minds.. And sadly \u201cthey sit around us\u201d  ",

Technology and social media is even changing the game of dating as seen in this article: The End of Courtship? for Millenials and the younger generations. I love social media and think it's great, but I do think that it adds a layer of anonymity that can be very hurtful when you think about social interaction, especially if you don't posses any real in person social skills. It offers a quick out and way to escape. I do think that it has enhanced community and social skills for some people who had a basis for in person social skills anyway. So social media is great, but it also complicates some social interaction. ",

But yaa social media are making us less involved socially.

People are having less contact physically with others. Even at home when we have to call our siblings or parents for lunch sitting next room we mostly make calls or text them.@ prayaas corps ",

Social media was invented so as to be in touch with people and to see what all they are upto but we have completely changed the purpose of it. Rather than living in real world we are into our social media account all the time. Rather than living life people are living for social media. We are always so engaged in our social media that we tend to ignore our real life. For an instance you can see in a room full of people everyone is busy using there phone, rather than talking face to face people find texting more comfortable. Humans are losing human interactions and thus making us anti social. Rather than socialising in real life we are so much involved in our social media that we tend to ignore people in real and that too without realizing. In social events too we tend to use our social media more than socialising. ",

For those who came of age before the internet (born in the seventies or earlier\u2026), the effect has been to improve their sociability. Before Facebook, we had largely lost track of each other. Now we are arranging to vacation with friends we haven\u2019t seen in decades. On the other hand, there are clear and pervasive problems with young people who grew up with social media. I suspect the difference is that I knew, from a very early age, that my specific interests and opinions were not generalized and therefore I was forced to find common ground with people as I found them. This means I had to learn to make small talk, and in the process, discovered that people different from me are actually quite interesting. Not in spite of those differences, but often because of them. If you can, with a Google search, tailor your friends to just those who exactly match your tastes and interests, then the reality is that everything is about you. You, and people like you are the most interesting people in the world, because other people exactly like you have confirmed this to be true. Pretty much a recipe for becoming anti-social and quite a few other personal and societal dysfunctions. ",

It felt fun, experimental, inclusive and kind of egalitarian - something that felt genuinely \"made by everyone\".  Probably on account of FB's novelty... this was many people's first experience of a social media platform.  And, by virtue of the way FB works, people were not taking their first steps into social media alone.  Their friends were with them. As FB's evolved... it seems to me that people's personality traits have come to shape the FB environment and interactions.  More extroverted types have come to predominate... while introverts have slipped into the background...  It now feels like there are distinct groups of Producers and Consumers...  That's OK... the extroverts can be fun / entertaining... but there can also - when things turn political - be a tendency towards grandstanding and using FB as a bully-pulpit... Instead of discussion, one sees someone assert a position and demand assent for it.  The 'LIKE' button reinforces this - and rather than promote engagement, it increasingly enables people to avoid it. Also... in my own circle of friends, I have seen FB / other social group interactions come to substitute for real life interactions.  Yes, relationships are dynamic - but I do wonder if FB, with its apparent interactions and 'ghost' relationships, has lulled us into letting the real things lapse... ",

In any case, I dont think its contribution is significant considering that my antisocial behavior began right around my first prolonged exposure to society without a protecting hand to shield. You know, \u201cSchool\u201d. I came into society wide eyed and accepting and found violence, lovers of domination and opportunistic clawing infantile beasts* who bloodlust with a facade of consideration and pleasantness. A mass of malformed mostly miserable meat-centric men and women for who the merest thought fleeting and ephemeral about another being but themself is lauded as empathy. I found my kin gulping pleasure so fast that they became numb to them and turn to needles in their veins as their course of action, kin who shrink from the prick of that needle or that confession or that mistake under the horror of being revealed as weak or unworthy yet still consume so ravenously that their stomachs cannot process quick enough to sate. Fat overflowing from neglected thought, from unrefined talent left fallow in exchange for fleeting baubles and faded warmth- even the fluid mess of fucking made of a distortion of the language of God spoken in making love. A fat that corrupts and cajoles and controls the flaccid, acrid smelling blobs that drool at the ring of a bell. About now you are probably thinking something like \u201cWow this guy sure has a fucked up view of people\u201d and adding at the end of that a little chuckle meant to deflate the potential of you ever finding truth in it. Thats fine, but hear me out. I came into society wide eyed and accepting and have told you what I found. The reason I find horror in it is not for what it is because if that were what it was meant to be then I would willingly, without pause, gladly become it. It is not what we are meant to be. You know because you have caught glimpses just as I have of that grandiose being which passes like a shadow from distant lightening, and in the blue afterglow fade you have seen a beauty which is indescribable, a grace which moves in harmony with all it surveys effortlessly. A beauty which contains the summits of human accomplishment and continues to rise unslowed by the threshold. You may not know, this beauty is in you, is in him and her and them and all those who have been deluded by the grind of machines made in blind assemblage whose purpose is only their own continuity\u2026 parasites, no, entire orders of parasites - mostly ones of our own making\u2026mostly. Unfettered we are Einstiens, Buddhas, Wagners, and Christs- we are the sum of awe, not the stigmatized word \u201cawesome\u201d** Still, despite this breath taking potential, we have made all of what you have seen thus far. No. Social media has not significantly contributed to my antisocial behaviors. *- No offense to beasts intended **- to demonstrate an example of how our language even has the vitrolic infection present, devaluing the concepts of beauty beyond that which is merely physical.

There's this stigma around social media and its usage, especially with teenagers today, but it does not necessarily replace any outdoor activities or gatherings in their lives. Teenagers still want to party. They want to go on road trips; they want to have deep conversations, go to the beach, and hang out with family and friends. Social media has not replaced any of these in their lives, and I don't think it has that much power. And that was made clear to us recently with the pandemic and the quarantine. This quarantine indeed showed us how social people are. And we can't also forget that social media gives us a lot of new means of communication; people are still considered social because they use it as a communication tool. And when it comes to younger children, I think that is the parents' responsibility at the end of the day and their decision of at what age they want their child to be exposed to social media, which is the later, the better.

Social access, availability, self-image, and much more are certainly bound up w social media use for many of us. In this sense, social media are pro social.  However if we take social to mean face to face interactions and encounters, for some, social media do sometimes seem to offer substitutes and mediating crutches of a sort. Interaction over tools is in some ways safer than face to face.  I do think that our dependence on social media -- when it is that -- makes the kind of togetherness and spontaneity of time and co-presence (which was so culturally productive in the 60s, for example) a much more remote possibility. And rarely nowadays do conversations unfold over hours, deepening and unwinding as only a good stretch of time can. ",

We use social networking sites and due to that we feel there is no point in meeting each other when we have to because we think we are already in touch. But we forget the pleasures and joy when we meet people in person than on social networking sites. These sites were made so that people from far away places can contact each other and also to get to know new people. But, we have completely changed the idea they were made for and use them in different way. So, Yup I Think Social Media Is Actually making us More And more anti-social. ",

The one person hung in their with me and sent me her pictures on my email but has stopped doing that. She doesn\u2019t really understand that is OK with me. But I did figure out that the reason she was so insistent to be on Facebook is because more people will SEE her and HER pictures. And I guess she gets likes from people. I do not know. She does not understand why anyone would not want that and that is OK with me, I do not expect anyone to understand me. These paid services are popular so that means people are getting what they want and if they are not there are other choices for us. ",

They expand and are filled out with more supposition and opinion. Rumor has been a constant presence in society I expect. Social media allows anyone to spread ill informed gossip. If you believe in anything such as pixies and fairies then you will find them on the internet. You can enter that echo chamber and have your delusions reinforced and supported. People are anti-social in a way, if you think about it with any logic. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t need societal rules to keep people together. They will always believe the bad about anyone they don\u2019t like. They will always deny or question the good of someone they don\u2019t like. As they will excuse the bad of anyone they do like.

One is also able to curate personal interests and news through social media. Conclusion: As Robert Scoble once said you are defined by who you follow not who follows you. So it's about what information you curate rather than how many people you Enmasse to be in your tribe. Unless you are a celebrity and its part of your job else social media relies on the users to expose themselves so they can target advertising. I have started a social media detox myself.

Have you ever tried to express something to someone close to you or expected an answer from a person with their eyes focused in a smartphone, tablet or computer? If you answered \"yes\" to this question, you have an idea of what I am talking about. And it's one of the main problems: there's proximity from a physical level, but everyone's quite disconnected. People became numbers in a profile, their perceptions of the world, ways of expressing themselves, much less true experiences and much more calculated actions to be posted online. Do you have friends in \"real life\"? Because even this term, \"real life\", doesn't make any sense when trying to set internet apart from our reality anymore. Our lives and daily routines are sunken in a sea of information, mostly irrelevant. To some of us, too hedonistic. In the 21th Century, everything we do, we do connected. Yet, by human valors, we are all distant from each other. So, yes. I deeply believe that internet give us the idea that everything's social, and it's easy to be fooled when easily there's more and more people entering our lives everyday. But our vicious ways of using it, many times thanks to social media and it's Illusions are, in a way, destroying society. ",

But then again, establishment of weaker, but more numerous, connections is facilitated by social media, especially social networks. It also helps in discovery of groups whose interests matches yours. We need a deep research on how much time devices actually take away from face to face interaction to definitely answer this question. ",

For example, I have meet friends of friends and we have been able to carry on however casual (via Facebook). Is that a substitute for \"real\" relationships? Probably not.  On the other hand, the mind is clay. It is purposely designed to adapt and conform. You are what you consume. If the mind learns that this is the nature of \"relationships\" then that's what the mind is going to do.  Bad? Good? I think it's probably too early to say.

Likewise, today I saw a new app that is really doing some crazy stuff to stand out from these big market players. And their philosophy seems so much reasonable to me. It\u2019s PipZib, yeah It is the new exciting social app. It says that \u201cpipzib is for those who have friends\u201d and it is very much true because you can upload on pipzib only when the majority of members like your post in a Zib(it\u2019s basically a group but with no admin or any authorities). and who don\u2019t have friends? Actually, when your post gets enough likes in a zib then it goes live and your followers can then see it. It is actually pretty interesting and exciting. I am curious about where it will head in the near future.

It is a universal platform that helps connect people across the globe, giving access to information worldwide and providing opportunities to understand and learn about the cultures and interests of different people. The concept was to interact and socialise leaving behind the stigmas of race, caste, creed etc. However in the modern landscape the platform of social media is being used for a variety of other purposes than its original use. Problems such as: \u00b7 Fake Identities \u00b7 Pseudo personalities \u00b7 Fake information \u00b7 Humiliation and widespread criticism of people on global platforms \u00b7 Online Entertainment that shuts down real life interactions \u00b7 Cyber crimes All these problems have made social interactions highly unsafe while simultaneously hindered people\u2019s ability to interact and socialise away from the virtual world. Thereby, limiting rather than increasing social interactions. However, the fault lies in the inappropriate use of social media by people and not of the platform itself. It is the people who must act responsibly while using these social platforms. ",

With the improvement in Technology, even the social channels are evolving with their customer base.

They would still have relationships and social circles outside the media. For them the social media is just an extension of their real world. However, for the people, who lack social skills and are introverts, social media could work both ways. Though such people might get even more withdrawn from real world, they would indeed get the opportunity to interact with the social media world without the fear of being judged. I believe concepts like 'social' are being redefined as we speak. It would take some time to even start guessing how the social equations would be in the coming years. ",

In that case you will start assuming that no body is agreeing with you or being part of your life. Where as the reality is that, they are bombarded with buzz feed and other viral content, which keeps them on site so that social site can make more money. In this way the less engagement create a false sense of one\u2019s worth. If you are getting high engagement then also, it is a sad story because they don\u2019t know your intimate moments. They don\u2019t know how tightly you hugged the other person when you found their sad story. They maybe engaged in what you are providing them, it can be your looks or something entertaining.
