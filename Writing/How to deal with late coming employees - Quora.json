            "answer_text": "I must say this a real concern. I myself is a late goer. But to be honest none of my leaders have ever problem with that. I definitely have to good leaders luckily always. But at the same time what matters is efficiency. And also if the later comer is able to finish their job on time and also ready for new tasks gradually or not. As long as that is happening, then you need to manage their late coming. Having said that I don't mean being late is good, but that should not be a judging point. You need to make it clear with the employees that coming late to work is still alright as long as they are not late to meetings. And also show required efficiency for rest of the day. And if you still want all to be online then create some kind of interest in them that they would like to come early. For example who comes early can leave early and office should be empty by 5:30/6 with no work getting impacted. You can go for a coffee with those come early then others will love to come early to join their supervisor for a coffee. Basic thing is try not to impose on them and make them feel that coming early is good for them and for the work environment as well. ",
