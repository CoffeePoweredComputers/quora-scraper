            "answer_text": "My original motivation comes from reading new and interesting articles\u2026..my first book, \u201cIn Search of the Spiritual Genome\u201d, came from reading about what scientists were saying about the discovery of man\u2019s physical DNA and genome mapping. One said \u201cWe have found the complete blueprint of man\u201d. As a Christian, I immediately thought to myself, \u201cHogwash! Man is both spiritual and physical. You have found only half of man\u2019s total blueprint\u201d. And away I went to discover man\u2019s Spiritual DNA/genome. My driving question was (and you need one of these to write anything) \u201cIf man receives physical DNA from his biological father and mother then why shouldn\u2019t he receive Spiritual DNA from his Spiritual Father (God)\u201d. Answer your question thoroughly. Expand it. Categorize it into chapters (things alike). Arrange your chapters, then come up with a title that will totally \u201chook\u201d the reader/buyer into having to find/know your answer. Always answer your driving question. The proof (saleability) is in the pudding (driving question and answer). Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "The only way I\u2019ve finished anything has been by setting a deadline. In school they were non negotiable, later I joined a critique group and committed to providing a draft for the next meeting. These days I have only a few set times during the week where I can write. I take advantage as I can. I have a colleague with a minimum word count she tries to hit, I think 200 a day. She gives herself a day off in a week, and her object is to chain as many days as possible to maintain a streak, which she documents. 200 isn\u2019t much, which makes it easily attainable and frequently stretches to higher counts.
