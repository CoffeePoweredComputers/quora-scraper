            "answer_text": "Are the character's eyes a special feature to him- or herself? Do they feature largely in his or her life story? Or, are they only \"different\" as viewed from a non-Asian perspective? The risk of \"sounding racist\" comes from viewing a minority person as The Other: homing in on their physical differences from what is assumed to be the \"norm\"taking one individual as being a representative of their entire raceMost Asians do not relate to their eye shape being a prominent part of their life history. Have you talked to a few of Asian people about their eyes, as you\u2019ve been creating this character? If the eye color and skin color are somehow integral to your character's development \u2014 then focus on events and interactions with other characters that are provoked by these salient distinctions. Pass on those all-too-familiar adjectives that come readily to mind. By the way: what is frequently assumed to be the \"Asian Eye\" isn't at all uniformly pervasive throughout Asia. In places such as Taiwan and regions of China, the much fussed-over epicanthic lid is actually in the minority. So, specifics matter. What kind of Asian are they? What is their personal identity (how they understand themselves), rather than race (which simplistic racial bucket other people stick them in)? Are they a Westerner who happens to be Asian, or a recent immigrant, or somewhere in between? That you haven't gotten more specific beyond just the top-level race label is indicative of a more important issue to tackle, than just what words you can use to tell your readers how \u201cAsian!\u201d their eyes strike other people not used to Asians.

            "answer_text": "I have found this thread funny. People are asking if one \u201chas to\u201d describe eyes? Well, why ever not? Does one shy away from describing eyes other than Asian? Or are all eye-descriptions to be banned in the name of cultural-sensitivity? Please read some literature and notice when eyes are described - along with mouths, noses, hair, ears, penises and so on. Some posters try to be useful by suggesting, \u2018why not just say they are Asian\u2019 or \u2018why not just call them Yamamoto?\u2019 Huh?? Do you think calling a man \u201cMr Jones\u201d is sufficient physical description of the man in question? Do all Mr Jones\u2019s look alike to you? And then we are offered either the cliche (almond) or the scientific (monolid). Heavens, are we trying to inspire the reader or kill them? I came here because I wanted to hear how others might use language in a creative way to depict something seen and felt by a character. Obviously I don\u2019t want to use a racist generalization such as \u2018slit-eyed,\u2019 but neither do I want to use a cliche or a scientific definition. Okay, \u2018almond-shaped . . . that may be a starting point. If that is your starting point but you don\u2019t wish to use that particular cliche, ask yourself what else looks like an almond? Find other descriptors, if \u2018almond\u2019 is how you think an eye is. Or, maybe the cliche is wrong from start to finish. Preferably, deal with a description in a specific way, not through a generalization. For instance, one could write of a specific non-Asian, white character, \u201cHis eyes were heavy, weary with a lifetime of taking orders. The lids slanted down each side as if they were endlessly repeating \u201cyes sir, no sir\u201d in the manner of a somnambulist. One couldn\u2019t say what color the irises may have been for they hadn\u2019t seen the light of day for many years, maybe not for a lifetime. But the puff of the man\u2019s cheeks pushed the lower lids up in such a way that what was left, the slit which for others was the window to their soul, was, in his case, more like the ellipse of a tarnished dessert spoon, unrevealing and uninviting.\u201d (just made up this) I mean, isn\u2019t the above better than just saying, \u2018his eyes were round?\u2019 Well, it so happens that in a story I am presently writing, one character is being introduced to a young woman who has yet to discover her part-Japanese ancestry. Her eyes are introduced early on as a clue to the later revelation (important to the story line). She has not got a Japanese name but a German name (via adopted parents) and I cannot give it away yet that she is part-Japanese. I am trying to \u201cdescribe\u201d not explain. I am trying to \u201cshow\u201d not tell. Make your descriptions count. Make them \u2018sexy.\u2019 To write is to imagine and to imagine is to create. Hey, you can always try swapping pistachio for almond, if that\u2019s not too nutty. But really, are Asian eyes almond-shaped? How about \u2018swallow-tailed?\u2019 Or, is it the real problem the writer is trying to generalize, trying to find a descriptor that marks a \u2018racial\u2019 difference rather than one that marks the specificity of the particular character? Why not, instead of trying to invent a new cliche, actually find a face that suits the character you are trying to describe (google is full of photos) and then clear your mind and stare at the eyes for a long while until something comes up? Stop thinking and feel your way into it. ",

            "answer_text": "Jeez, guys. Are we really living in a world where describing a character\u2019s physical traits is racist? I don\u2019t agree. Yes, I did once have a writer try to convince me that it wasnot necessary to mention a character was black. In fact he insisted vehemently that the color of the character\u2019s skin did not matter, because we are not racist any more and knowing his race will not impact how one reads the story, Of course it impacts how one reads the story. your reader is picturing the character in his mind and you need to give him the basic details he needs to do that. that said, you gave the character an asian name, so you don\u2019t have to describe Asian features to make the point about what race she is. If that\u2019s the only reason you wanted to describe Asian eyes, don\u2019t. But if another character is taking note of that particular feature, and he notices her asian qualities, don\u2019t shy away from a physical description.\u201cAlmond eyes\u201d is the fallback descriptive phrase for attractive eyes of an Asian shape. as for skin color\u2026.sorry, there is no \u201cAsian\u201d skin color. There are Asians with pale, delicate coloring, with golden skin, with bronze skin, with brown skin, and every shade in between. I had two Japanese students once in a stage makeup classe who used the base for Caucasian ingenues. Decide what color you want her skin to be and describe that. The standard adjective for someone with slightly dark, slightly golden skin is \u201colive\u201d. Asian hair iis a unique texture\u2014ask any hair stylist\u2014and using the phrase \u201cAsian hair\u201d is common among my aquaintances of Asian ancestry when they want to refer to that quality.

Will giving them a recognizably Japanese or Chinese name be enough to put the right image in the reader\u2019s head? You may not need to describe the eyes at all. You describe a character\u2019s eyes, or any other feature, if there is reason to do so. Does eye shape or color come into play in the story otherwise? You may recall that in the movie \u201cMemoirs of a Geisha,\u201d the main character\u2019s eyes were notable because they were not brown. Otherwise, they would not be a part of the story at all. Is your goal to make the image something that will also indicate the kind of visual impression the person makes, or to give your reader an accurate image of the character? If you are trying for either of those, eyes may not be the way to go. Something like four-fifths of the people in the world have brown eyes. Describing a character\u2019s eye color is mostly a way to distinguish white people. (Though some writers asking questions on Quora seem to think that it is a necessary part of introducing a character.) For your fiction, you need to use features that will make that person an individual, especially within his or her ethnic group (since ethnicity seems to be important to your story). Hairstyle might be more important, or shape of chin or nose. Perhaps the character is an Asian woman who uses makeup to accentuate her eyes. That might be worth describing. Or people find a man\u2019s eyes especially piercing. Write about eyes that way. Otherwise, focus on something else. Same with skin tone. Do you have a reason to describe it? If so, the fact that the person is Asian is irrelevant. You can find a wide variety of skin tones among people in Asia. Simply describe it when it becomes important to the story. ",

But it's an adjective many English-speaking readers will understand. Cliches have that advantage. Like other responders, I'm wondering why you need to describe this aspect of the person's eyes.

I would say go ahead full speed and describe the eyes in terms of meaning and character as has been said here.  If you were to have a black man as a character and the need arose to mention his skin wouldn't it be natural to describe it?
