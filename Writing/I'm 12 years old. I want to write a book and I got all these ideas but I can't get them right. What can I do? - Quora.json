            "answer_text": "I had that same problem when I was around 14. I had this brilliant ideas of what would be in a beautiful story but I didn't know how to write them down properly, it was lack of expressing skill that I missed. So I asked some people I thought who could help (I was in this literary club where kids would gather with some literature teachers and writers to help develop our skills) and the advice that I found ridiculous at the time was : read as much as you can . Followed by write as much as you can. What they were trying to say was that I should read as much as I can to develop my expressing skills and to observe styles and methods and vocabulary, i didn't like it cause that meant too much time wasted on reading when I could be writting. I liked the write as much as I could, but it was not going great. I was told I should write as much as I can even if it's wrong so I can make a habit of putting in words what I feel. Start from something small and simple and come back every day over that and change what I didn't find right. I was told back then that is very important to admit to myself the mistakes I made, to be brave enough to admit that something I wrote was not good and that I should work on modifying it or disregarg it till something better came out. So after my personal method failed, of sticking to my writing and being lacking to starting to read and copy styles and even words and started being curious on different genres and I realised I needed to fit my work into a genre, a style. So I started studying and writing and reading. Yeah, after 3 years I had my first published 2 pages creation. It was categorised by my mentor as neo-post-modernism. After that I kept writting but I couldn't find any lengthy work suitable enough so I switched to poetry and small nuvelas. My poetry was published and praised. But I wanted novel writting. Well, that's a whole new level of work. I am still working on that 10 years later, I really want to be good and not look like a one of those free books you can get from Amazon for your kindle. Follow the advice I was given and be patient and persistent. Results will come. ",
