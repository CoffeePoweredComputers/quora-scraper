            "answer_text": "When? You capitalise titles when they\u2019re printed on the outside book covers, the spine, or at the top of an essay or similar. Titles are titles. How to capitalise a title is another matter. You can have the traditional \u201ctitle case,\u201d which is in all capitals. You can have the traditional \u201cheadline case\u201d favoured by many North American newspapers (sometimes called \u201cdeck style\u201d by printing people). You can have the traditional \u201csentence case\u201d favoured mostly by UK publications and most British English users. Or you can even set the title completely in lowercase for special effect (such as the eccentric author E.E. Cummings did). Examples:\u2014 THIS TITLE IS IN TITLE CASEThis Title Is in Headline CaseThis title is in sentence case, as favoured by British publicationsthis title is completely in lowercaseThanks for the A2A. ",
