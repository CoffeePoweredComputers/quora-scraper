            "answer_text": "Terence Fletcher from movie Whiplash  He is the main antagonist of the 2014 Academy Award-winning music drama film Whiplash. He was portrayed by J.K. Simmons, who won the Academy Award for the role.  Terence Fletcher is an unforgivingly sadistic and true perfectionist who will do anything to push students past the limits expected of them. He is cruel Perfectionist manipulative abusive and psychopathic man who will verbally and physically abuse his students to no end in order to get the results he wants. Fletcher particularly takes interest in bullying Andrew Neiman (Protagonist) throughout the film. He throws chair on him Slaps him cruelly insults him Taunt him And mock him.  Let me explain the Character of Terence by Synopsis of the film. *Warning- Lots of Swearing ahead * After being accepted into the Shaffer Conservatory, 19-year-old jazz drummer named Andrew practices at night when Terence Fletcher walks into the room.   While Fletcher seems unimpressed from Andrew's audition, he still accepts him as his drum alternate.   While Fletcher seems polite to Andrew, it is clear that he knows how to manipulate emotions, as seen when he abuses and harasses several of the band's players. Eventually, he begins to make Andrew his target of abuse by throwing a chair at him for not following the tempo The rest of the class are silent as Fletcher slaps, shouts and mocks Andrew for not being confused with the tempo.   Andrew becomes so obsessed with impressing Fletcher, that he starts spending all of his spare time practicing .   When the main drummer misplaces his sheet music, Fletcher fires him at a local jazz competition and promotes Andrew. This promotion doesn't last for long, however, as Fletcher quickly replaces Andrew with a core drummer from his former class. Fletcher psychologically abuses Andrew to earn the role as main drummer.   After a week of practice, Fletcher tearfully reveals to Andrew's class that a former student of his, Sean Casey, was killed in a car accident the day previously and hailed Sean as a \"amazing musician\".  After becoming violent with the drummers' inability to follow the tempo correctly, Fletcher decides to let Andrew perform in the upcoming concert, as Andrew auditions the best double-time-swing.   After having trouble with the buses on route to the performance, Andrew rents the car but leaves his drumsticks behind. Fletcher finds out when Andrew arrives late for their rehearsal and kicks him out. While rushing back to the concert after picking up his drumsticks, Andrew's rental car is hit by a truck. Despite being bloody and breaking his left hand, Andrew decides to perform, only to repeatedly drop his drumstick mid-song and pass out due to exhaustion and his injured left hand. Fletcher tells Andrew that he is \"done\", causing Andrew to tackle and attack him in front of the audience and Andrew is dragged away from the stage swearing and cursing at Fletcher.   A few weeks after Andrew is expelled from Shaffer  his father contacts a lawyer representing the parents of Sean Casey. There, the lawyer reveals that Sean actually hanged himself after suffering severe anxiety and depression from joining Fletcher's class, most likely due to the abuse Fletcher had caused him. Due to Andrew Fletcher gets fired from Shaffer.  Months after the incident, Fletcher is performing in a club when he spots Andrew watching the performance. Afterwards, they have a drink and Fletcher explains that he pushes his students beyond what is expected of them, hoping that one of them would become the next great jazz musician. After supposedly explaining his own actions Fletcher reveals that he is conducting music festival concert and then invites Andrew to perform as his main drummer, an offer that Andrew quickly accepts.  In the festival, Andrew goes on stage when Fletcher approaches him and reveals he knew that Andrew was the student who got him fired.  Having trapped Andrew, Fletcher starts his band by beginning to play a song Andrew does not know and was not given the sheet music for.  Andrew struggles with the song and then runs offstage humiliated and is comforted by his father .  Then he go backs to stage and interrupts Fletcher's speech by playing \"Caravan\" from his class and leads the other performers to join him.  As the song plays, Fletcher is angered at being interrupted and for being beaten in his own game. Near the end of the song, however,   Fletcher realizes that Andrew might have the drive to become one of the greats, the one thing he hoped to find in just one student his entire career. Andrew finishes a jaw dropping and exhilarating drum solo to see Fletcher nodding and weeping in approval and Andrew returns with a smile, having finally impressed his teacher at last.    I tried very hard in putting matching images with part of the story. So I'm sorry if i failed to explain you the whole damn movie :p Anyway Whiplash is an amazing film, its easily one of the best low budget film ever made . It's perfect example of how a great film can be made with low budget, limited actors and less locations,all you need is AMAZING SCRIPT. The story is very simple but the way it was presented . It'll overwhelm you. J.K Simmons gave a stellar performance as a Terence Fletcher, truly the most terrifying antagonist in recent memory. I've hated this guy so much that when he appeared in Directors next film La la land .  I was like- \u201cwtf he is doing here\" Fun fact- I think J.K Simmons is born to destroy the career of Peter Parker in Spiderman  Andrew Neiman in Whiplash  And Sebastian Wilder in La La Land  Ignore Grammatical mistakes No Hard feelings:) ",

            "answer_text": "I just watched a movie that lead me to actually look up this question so that I could answer. That\u2019s how much I hated this character.  The woman above is Melissa Leo, a fabulous actress, who played Alice Ward in the movie The Fighter. You have probably seen it as it came out in 2010. I have no idea how true to life the character was but you have never seen a more driven, spiteful woman in your life. She was both the worst influence on her son, always butting in to his affairs, keeping him from growing up and taking control of his own life, keeping everyone around her down so that she could remain top of the family heap while at the same time absolutely certain that she was the best thing to ever happen to her son and everyone around her. She held the family together, she taught her girls right and wrong, she was a no-nonsense, go getter\u2026in her own mind. The fighter, played by Mark Wahlberg, finally gets his act together (by getting away from his family) and gets a trainer and financial manager. The manager and trainer agree that if they are going to be working with him as a boxer there is only ONE rule: Your brother and mother have to stay the hell away! And that was a great decision. After winning a few fights, his brother, played by Christian Bale, finally gets out of prison. He comes to see his brother training at the gym. THIS is the time his mother gathers together all of her 6 daughters, gets a cake made and goes TO THE GYM to welcome home the older brother! Talk about completely oblivious to the situation, thinking she is going to take charge and use her son\u2019s release from prison to finagle her way back into her younger son\u2019s boxing career. She really has to be seen to be believed. And I believed her. That is why I chose her over Darth Vader and Voldemort, over any other movie that was obviously fantasy: She was so real, and so devastating, and so manipulative, and so clueless as to her own character that every single time she showed up on screen I cringed. I cringed because I imagine there are lots and lots of mothers out there just like her. I couldn\u2019t help but cry when Micky Ward (The fighter) was trying to get his life together and mommy dearest shows up at his girlfriend\u2019s house with all her daughters to pressure him back into the family. Great movie that has to be seen to the end. You can\u2019t help rooting for Micky, while just loathing his mother. At least I couldn\u2019t. ",
