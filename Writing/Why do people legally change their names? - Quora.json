            "answer_text": "We've talked a lot about my name here on quora, so let's get the complete story. But first: I'm still not going to tell you my birth name, for privacy reasons. I hope you all respect that. Anyways, around the time I started in school, I started hating my name. I don't think I ever thought about it before then, but I remember loathing it in the first few grades. I tried to get my friends to call me anything else (including Jasmine, after my favourite Disney princess), but it never stuck. Around year seven or so, I got a friend who was totally invested in finding me an appropriate name. I don't remember how Hope came about (I vaguely remember watching Hope And Faith, a sitcom, and thinking that it was a nice name, but I don't remember if that's what started it), but I know this friend thought it was perfect. She and I were huge teases (that's another story, another trauma), and she told me \u201cHope is a perfect name for you, because you give the guys hope, and then you just turn around and leave\u201d - I don't really get how it makes it a perfect name, but that's what she said and I liked the name, so. What you need to realise, is that I was clinically depressed pretty much from the first grade until maybe a year or two ago. I was suicidal for a long time, I remember contemplating it on the playground during recess. I didn't have many friends, and I blamed myself for that. I don't think I thought I'd ever be loved. So in an attempt to change identity, \u201ckill\u201d myself metaphorically, become someone else, I shed my name like a poorly fitting layer of skin. I told people (and myself) that I needed a more international name if I wanted to make it big in the world. Whether that was an attempt to run away from home without actually doing so, is debatable (but it's a debate that is winnable). For a while, during a bad period of my life, I responded aggressively when people called me by my original name. Perhaps I didn't want to be reminded. Now I just glare. It does the trick, too, but without people thinking of me as a serial killer.* I knew I'd legally change my name whenever I got the chance. I did so about a year ago. I was nervous about it, because although it's not necessarily a permanent change, it's a significant one. But everyone knows me as Hope now (safe from my family, which knows about the name but doesn't call me by it). My parents shook their heads, my dad tried to get me to change my mind, but it was no use. Sometimes I still go by my original name, so I haven't completely killed her off, but in almost all situations I go as Hope. Feel free to interpretend. I doubt most name changes goes about like mine did, but this is my story. I did it because I felt a need to be someone else. Of course, as Shakespeare famously said: \u201cwhat is in a name?\u201d and all that, I am now an extension of whom I used to be, not a different person at all. Changing my name wasn't a magic switch for me. It just meant having to remind people, and correct people (like yesterday when I graduated and they mispronounced my name during the ceremony). *I never killed anyone, but I did do the whole Don't Fuck With Me-scene. It's cringy. Why do people change names? ",

            "answer_text": "Both of those answers apply.  People have different reasons for changing their names.  For performers especially, standing out from the crowd (and being original-- thus easier to find in 'google searches' like Kateryna mentioned) is one motivation, as is being easily remembered.   Some are hard to pronounce (this is a concern if you are trying to market directly to an American audience).  Many artists who have very \"ethnic sounding\" names have opted for more \"American-sounding\" names; \"Norah Jones\" comes to mind-- nee \"Geethali Norah Jones Shankar\"-- but there are many in this category.  It's about making it easier to more people to connect with the artist, and ultimately to sell more product (in this case music).   Some names are awkward for other reasons, ie.: they have 'embarrassing linguistic connotations' (there is brilliant SNL sketch about a fella named \"Colonel Angus\" that illustrates this point quite hilariously..).   There is also the issue of privacy; some might not be so keen on having everyone and everything in their private life revealed (or having their professional/personal work revealed to those in their private lives), and so working under a stage name is a kind of disguise.  For controversial artists and writers, this isn't such a bad idea.  For any kind of writer or performer who has a 'day job' in another capacity (or is hoping to get one, ever..), realizing their employer will likely do a search on them at any point (and find God-knows-what), even better idea.  People who have fled abusive situations will sometimes change their names in order to avoid being found by their abuser in the future.  So you see, a fake name offers a kind of protection for the person who adopted it. Then there are those who hate their parents and will change their name in a final effort to completely break ties and all association with them (as I am considering presently-- just haven't decided on a new name yet!).   And yes the most obvious reason-- as Anon said-- that one might simply not like their name and would prefer something else, some new meaning.   Personally I love the idea of reinvention, a fresh start, of making up the meaning of our lives as we go along, rather than just blindly accepting (and sticking with) what was given to us at birth (one of the few matters we were never consulted on, and one that has a fairly strong impact on how we are perceived in the world.)  I don't think there's anything weird about that.  I even think it's fun.  Although it can be a little confusing for the other people in your life for sure... Oh well! ",
