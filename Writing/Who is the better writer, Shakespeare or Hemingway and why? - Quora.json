            "answer_text": "Shakespeare, of course. Hemingway isn\u2019t even the best American novelist of his generation; Fitzgerald is. No novel of Hemingway\u2019s has the canonical status of The Great Gatsby. Hemingway\u2019s minimalist style was quite influential for some time, but I think it fair to say that its moment has passed, and, absent that distinctive style, there is little else. I am tempted to quote his contemporary Gertrude Stein\u2019s comment on Oakland, and apply it to Hemingway: \u201cThere\u2019s no there there.\u201d Shakespeare, by contrast, is one of the indisputably great writers of world literature, the author of some of the finest and most enduring plays ever written. Unlike Hemingway, Shakespeare mastered a range of styles, from the extremely ornate to the astonishingly simple. One great line in Henry V, in Henry\u2019s St. Crispin\u2019s day speech, is textually simple, but rhetorically complex: This story shall the good man teach his son; And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, From this day to the ending of the world, But we in it shall be remember'd; Only one two-syllable word, \u201cending\u201d, but what a rhetorical expansion, from a single day to the very limits of time! There\u2019s so much more to be said; but it would be superfluous. There really isn\u2019t any comparison to be made. ",

            "answer_text": "Shakespeare has stood the test of time, perhaps even the test of rhyme. We hear more about his works and some of us appreciate not having to pass exams based on these, like we did when in School. I wasn\u2019t fascinated by Shakespeare. I read a book that simplified some of the plays and found that helpful. I bought a beautifully-bound book of sonnets and wasn\u2019t exactly overwhelmed by these. Even so, I was pleased that such a collection of sonnets was produced in such style. I\u2019ve never been motivated to watch any play in a film or on TV. That\u2019s just the way I am about my preferences, as I\u2019d rather read modern poets than ancient rhymes and monologues. If others are fascinated by Shakespeare, then that\u2019s their choice. As a poet, I\u2019m more likely to create poetry than to read it as written by others. Even so, I found it useful to register on a poetry review website here: thewritersite.world I wonder how Shakespeare\u2019s poems would have been reviewed if the Internet existed in his generation.
