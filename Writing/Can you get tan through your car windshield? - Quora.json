            "answer_text": "The majority of people I have come in contact with in my career as a make-up artist have always assumed they were safe from the ravages of the sun once they were in their car. Although it is true you cannot get burned or get that tan you have been wanting (if you want a tan, use the spray on services and a great bronzer, I mean, sun cancer!?) you CAN get sun damage through your car windshield and windows. Let me explain. The suns rays are made up of UVA, UVB and UVC. The UVC rays are of no consequence to us as they get absorbed into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Transparent glass absorbs all of the UVB rays which is what causes the aforementioned sought after tans and not so much burns. BUT the majority of the UVA rays pass through which are what cause the sun damage, especially over time, so I am looking at you, you people who sit in traffic and have long commutes. Even if you have that intermittent exposure to the sun it builds up over time and yes, even on those cloudy days, we should all be wearing sun screen. So, not to make you paranoid, but skin cancer is real, and who wants those pesky dark spots on their face that show sun damage? Plus um, wrinkles ladies? ",
