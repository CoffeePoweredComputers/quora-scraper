            "answer_text": "Suppose You have something I would like to have. Let\u2019s assign this thing a value V1 to you and a value V1\u2032 to me, should I acquire it. To get that from you, I have to offer something to you for which you would give that up. Let\u2019s assign this thing value V2 to me and value V2\u2032 to you should you obtain it. The only way I would agree to give you what I have to get what you have is if V1\u2032 > V2. Likewise, the only way you will give to me what you have in exchange for what I have is if V2\u2032 > V1. No one exchanges what they have to get less value to them than what they already have. (Not counting for charity, but we\u2019re talking normal economic activity.) So that being the case, given that we agree to the exchange, it must be the case that V1\u2032 > V2, I have more value after the exchange than before, and V2\u2032 > V1, you have more value after the exchange than before the exchange. If either was not true, the person for whom it is not true would simply walk away and not exchange. The only way for such an exchange to take place where both is not true if for force to be applied to compel the person for whom that is not true to be made to make an exchange for which they are worse off. Now, suppose you produce 50,000 units of a thing and you sell them all and you keep $1 from each sale. You now have $50,000 and 50,000 have gained the benefit of your product to enrich their lives. Obviously - or they would not have given up that money they had to get your product. They obviously wanted your product more than the money it took to buy it. Now suppose you increase production to 100 million units. You sell them all and keep 50 cents from each sale. You now have $50 million. But 100 million people have now gained the benefit of your product. \u201cInequality\u201d has increased, but vastly more people are now better off than before for their ability to obtain that product. The way to visualize how this works it with a rubber band or a balloon. Put some marks on the rubber band or the balloon. Pin one end of the rubber band and pull the other end of the rubber band or blow up the balloon. The points on the rubber band get farther apart - inequality increases. But, more importantly, ALL points on the rubber band move farther away from the pinned end - they are ALL farther away from poverty. Conversely, if you relax the rubber band or deflate the balloon, ALL points move closer to poverty. The question is, is it more important for all points on the rubber band to be close together even though that means ALL points are closer to poverty, or for all points an the rubber band to be as far away from poverty as possible even though points may be farther apart from each other?

            "answer_text": "The word \u201cprofit\u201d implies economic gain. You ask me to argue that one set of political beliefs will necessarily lead to a given outcome in economic terms. This is impossible, because of the essential inequality of politics and economics. I do not say that there are not relationships between political and economic systems. I do say that these relationships are not fixed or necessarily even similar in different circumstances. For example, a democratic (to some extent) political system might embrace capitalist economic principles, socialist principles, or both. I cannot sort out any theory to predict what the economic relationships might be in any given set of political and social circumstances. ",
