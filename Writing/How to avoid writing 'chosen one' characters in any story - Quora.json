            "answer_text": "How do you avoid writing them? Just\u2026don\u2019t write them. It\u2019s not inevitable that there has to be one. Let your characters have the characteristic they have because they worked to acquire them, not because fate has somehow dealt them a hand that blah blah blah. Maybe the whole point is that that character can\u2019t resolve the plot all on his or her ownio. Maybe the whole point is that the character has to learn to accept help. This, incidentally, is the plot of Howard Hawks\u2019s Rio Bravo, in which John Wayne\u2019s character behaves as though only he can fix the town until he realises that he can\u2019t do it by himself.

They\u2019re essentially in the wrong place at the wrong time and get caught up in their adventure. That\u2019s the opposite of \u201cchosen\u201d or \u201cdestined.\u201d I think of them as reluctant. Also, make sure your protagonists are flawed. Nothing fatal, but they\u2019re human (or in my case, alien) and they make mistakes. And your antagonists shouldn\u2019t be 100% evil either. You should be able to argue from the antagonist\u2019s perspective that what they\u2019re doing has some redeeming value to someone (maybe only themselves). ",
