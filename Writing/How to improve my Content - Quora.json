            "answer_text": "Your content should be something of ACTIONABLE VALUE solving a HARD problem. Or it should be ENTERTAINING. If its all three, you have hit a jackpot. Write about things you have experience in. Things you strongly believe in. Things that you tried and tested and experimented with. Things you live with, things that you love and passionate about. For example - the most time you spend time is with your mind. Can you look at how you think, what are your blind spots, what are your biases. You find an insight, wisdom, you apply on yourself and you see its changing your life. Your productivity is improving. Your life is becoming more happy. You can now write a story about how you went past a mental hurdle. You are a startup and you are recruiting. You have been doing this for sometime, where you made mistakes, learnt from it and then you achieved your goals of hiring. Now you can talk about it in a podcast, make a video of it. You are solving the pain that lot of young founders who do not know how to hire. Now if you make a youtube video where few of you act the problems faced in hiring in a humorous way then your content is more worth. Your content becomes more worthy as more people consume it. Not because you have more people and you can sell ad. Because now you have more people telling you what they liked in your content and how it helps them.

What kind of blogs do you click on and what kind you dont\u2019? Which you tube videos you watch and which you stop half way middle. Understand what makes you consume a content and what does not make you.Understand the mechanics of how a particular content works - why people click on a title and not on another. Try 2\u20133 different ways of putting title and images for your content and see which gets the maximum clik throught.You should consume good amount of good content to create good amount of good contentYou need to write a lot, Create a lot of videos. 100 content you create will give you 10 good content. That is how you improve your worth of your content. The more you create , the more quality stuff you will come out with.Make content creation as a daily job. You need to publish at least one article a day. One Video every 2 days. That will keep you in the process of creation. You will come across more insights this way.Read a lot. A lot. As much as you can on the subject.Build one follower a day. If you get one new subscriber or follower for every new article, you win.Don\u2019t get discouraged by number of people who are reading or viewing your content today. Have a attachment-detachment with the whole process. Give your full attempt when you create something. Then you just move on just like you leave bread crumbs for birds. You do not look back to see if any bird is actually eating the bread crumbs.Don\u2019t validate the worthiness content based on the number of following you have or likes you get. There are some amazing content which no one reads. People are strange that way. Just focus on PAIN / VALUE / ENTERTAINMENT.Help any one and every one - generally or specifically in the topics you write. You write about marketing, go help some one for free. Help a friend\u2019s website to get mire hits. Or if you create videos about system architecture, help a startup with architecture. Support your content with real life connections.
