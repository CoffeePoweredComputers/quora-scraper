            "answer_text": "How do I write a mail for requesting information? Properly addressing the letter is very important. The person who receives the letter wants to know at first glance why a stranger (you) contacted them. Catch the Recipient\u2019s Eye Authors like to know that you read their book. Professors like to know that you\u2019re interested in their research topics. Merchants like to know that you want to know more about their product. If you\u2019re writing an email, put this in the subject line. To demonstrate, I will use a random sample from Amazon, Oil & Gas Company Analysis: Upstream, Midstream and Downstream, January 12, 2015, by Alfonso Colombano. Email Subject Line: Your Book: Oil & Gas Company Analysis Body: Dear Sir, I am intrigued by [insert title of book, what intrigues you about the book and ask your question.] Obviously, your question must be directly related to something in his book. It may help with getting an answer if you briefly state the reason for your question, e.g. you\u2019re lobbying for a government campaign, or writing a term paper for environmental studies. Close with something along these lines: I await an answer. Thanks in advance. Sincerely, [your name] Letter Mail We used to learn this at about Grade 3 level in elementary school. Time have changed with the advent of the digital age. I\u2019m not sure how detailed info you need and will let you take or leave it as required. If you\u2019re writing for a company or school or other registered organization, use letterhead envelope and paper. Letterhead means pre-printed return name and address is on the paper and on the envelope. See samples. If your handwriting is good, that works for the body of the letter and address on the envelop. Typewritten is easier to read but not as intimate. Pick your choice. The body of the letter should be the same as in email. Be sure to include the following contact information: your mailing addressyour telephone number (cellphone or landline, not text message)email (optional but usually preferred)Numbers 2 & 3 often appear below the signature; Number 1 in the letterhead.. Use the letterhead samples as a guide for formatting your letter. Date of Writing Don\u2019t forget to include the date of writing in the letterhead, or somewhere in the \u201cheader\u201d area such as directly above the name of the recipient. Format to close your letter: Signature=handwritten name on line. Yours truly,/Sincerely, _____________ [your name typed or printed] Telephone number email Envelop Return address (your own mailing address) in top left hand corner. Address of person receiving letter on centre front face of envelop. Postage stamp on top right hand corner. Buy stamp at post office. Don\u2019t forget to: put your letter in the envelopseal the envelopmail the letter in the proper facility",
