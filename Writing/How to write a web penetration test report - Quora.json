            "answer_text": "Hi, A penetration test report should have the following(preferably in the order given): Cover Page: Explicitly stating that this report is confidential and should be viewed by authorized personnel only. Followed by name/logo of the company that did the pentest and the company for which test was done. Executive Summary: This is an important section. The people who make decisions in a company most of the times are interested in this section only. It should have clear mention of Scope, Timeline and Summary of Vulnerabilities found with their impact level. Use of graphs, tables and pictures is highly recommended. They help in conveying better.Vulnerabilities Section: In the last section you had to be precise, crisp and to-the-point and in this one you have to be elaborate and descriptive. This should contain Name of the Vulnerability, Description of the Vulnerability, Followed by the Consequences, Steps to Reproduce and finally how to Fix. Use screenshots in Steps to Reproduce section and in how to fix, make sure you give generic as well as steps specific to the website.As asked in comments, I've tried to elaborate a few terms: Scope: The reach/span of the security audit. Was it limited to an IP, URL, Network etc. If it was a URL, were sub-domains included? If yes, their URL.Timeline: When were the NDA and Authorization documents signed? When did actual audit start? When did the audit finish ? When were the reports handed over?Security Levels: Generally 'low', 'high', 'medium' denoted usually by green, yellow and red colors.We at Astra by Czar Securities, make sure that our reports are elaborate and understandable by both non-tech as well as tech-people. I hope this is what you were looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "Look at The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES). The penetration testing execution standard consists of seven (7) main sections. These cover everything related to a penetration test - from the initial communication and reasoning behind a pentest, through the intelligence gathering and threat modeling phases where testers are working behind the scenes in order to get a better understanding of the tested organization, through vulnerability research, exploitation and post exploitation, where the technical security expertise of the testers come to play and combine with the business understanding of the engagement, and finally to the reporting, which captures the entire process, in a manner that makes sense to the customer and provides the most value to it. Following are the main sections defined by the standard as the basis for penetration testing execution: Pre-engagement InteractionsIntelligence GatheringThreat ModelingVulnerability AnalysisExploitationPost ExploitationReportingPCI Recognizes PTES as a reference framework for Conducting Penetration Tests.
