            "answer_text": "There are several ways but they depend on your computer operating system, Apple or Windows. I have an Apple Mac, and to create an umlaut (\u00a8), I hold down the \u2018\u201doption\u201d key on the lower left and click (\u201cu\u201d). Then I type the letter that needs the umlaut (\u00e4). Do a quick internet search for your operating system and you\u2019ll get a list of alphabet \u201cwork-arounds.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s possible to get a German keyboard, but I think that typically means buying a computer in a German speaking country. And finally, there may be a \u201cswitch\u201d to change your keyboard to actually type with a German keyboard layout, but you would have to remember what changes and what doesn't. For example, you may still have an English-looking keyboard but if you type \u201cy\u201d it will come out \u201cz.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "On a keyboard or phone/tablet? Phone/tablet is easy, just keep pressing the letter you want an umlaut over and slide your finger to the wanted letter and release, same for the \u201cdouble s\u201d s=\u00df. On a keyboard for iPad: HOLD option and press \u201cu\u201d (option + u) then the letter you want the umlaut above. Double s: HOLD \u201coption\u201d and press \u201cs\u201d (option + s) = \u00df. On a Mac it depends on which language your keyboard is set up with, but it\u2019s fairly easy with an American keyboard, HOLD \u201coption\u201d as you press \u201cu\u201d (option + u), then enter a/o/u. For the double s: HOLD \u201coption\u201d and press \u201cs\u201d (option + s) = \u00df. For PC it\u2019s a little more tricky, but the unquestionably easiest thing to do is to set your keyboard to \u201cUS International\u201d in the settings menu under the Windows icon in the toolbar and: press \u201c then the letter you want an umlaut over. For a double s: HOLD RightAlt and press \u201cs\u201d (RightAlt + s) = \u00df. Hope that helped:) ",
