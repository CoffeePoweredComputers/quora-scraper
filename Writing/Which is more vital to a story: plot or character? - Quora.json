            "answer_text": "As stated by a few others, there is no absolute answer to this question. Either of the two would fail if the other is completely ignored. But since the question here is - which more vital? I'd say whatever helps you write better or read effortlessly.  You can think of it in terms of television series vs movies: A TV series gives ample time to build good characters in the first season, and then the series is carried on by them. Even if there are dips in the quality of story and plot loopholes, you tend to overlook them because you've come to love the characters. You feel for them, root for them and can't have enough of them. (Until you do have enough of them :)) NCIS, Bones, House, The Mentalist, Castle, etc are all character driven serials and all have done well for themselves. One just has to create a character that the people love to love or hate. The rest just follows. Anime/Cartoons/Comics/Manga follow the same theory. You can never have enough of Tom & Jerry, Batman vs Joker, Calvin & Hobbes, The Straw-hat pirates, etc. I watch/read anything these characters do. They are that awesome. Movies on the other hand, don't have the luxury to spend much time on character development. I mean, there have been brilliant characters in The Godfather, Forrest Gump, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, etc. but they all had even better story-lines. In two hours, you can't provide a detailed backstory or a complete character study. The story needs to convey that while carrying itself forward. The story has to be the hero there. Unless of course, you're making a movie/sequel on novels/comic-book. Now which is better - TV or Movies? My answer - To each his own. I love them both for varied reasons. Let's talk books: Sherlock Holmes, Perry Mason, Bartimaeus, Artemis Fowl, Gollum, Col. Mike Martin, Vlad Taltos, etc are all great characters. Probably that's why you see a few of them feature in alternate story lines/spin-offs too. You can't just read enough about them. The books they feature in, are highly entertaining too. Many blogs/articles that provide tips on writing suggest that before you start writing the story, draw the lead characters (if you can - on paper, or at least on you mind). Know everything about them - their strengths and weaknesses, their morality, etc. What would they do when they face a certain situation? Find the answers to all possible questions about them. Once you've done that, writing a story becomes a lot simpler. It becomes like writing a diary account of the character.  That said, there is a certain author out there who goes by the name of G.R.R. Martin. He defies all rules with his writing. It's not that he doesn't create brilliant characters, what he is, create brilliance in every character. And most of them die to give way to other awesome characters. What holds everything together is his masterful story telling and detailed plot. He doesn't believe in revolving the story around a character but believes that the story should take everyone in the story and those reading it on a roller coster ride. The story is the hero for him. The greatest of the master-pieces have always been the perfect balance of a story and character(s). The Jackal wouldn't be one of my all time fav. characters if it wasn't for the detailed story telling in The Day Of the Jackal.  Bottom-lineStart creating/writing/reading and the force will guide you. ",

            "answer_text": "Authors debate plot vs. character, as if the two were gladiators, waging war on the sands of the Coliseum in some winner-take-all death battle. Both sides of the debate claim a definitive superiority for their chosen gladiator, and for the most part, the battle splits nicely down the lines of literary and commercial fiction, the commercialists placing the emphasis on plot in the interest of producing \u201cpage turners,\u201d while the literati poke up their noses at the thought of anything so crude and artless. So who\u2019s right?  As in most conflicts, there is a conclusive answer. But, in this instance, it isn\u2019t an answer held by either set of extremists. Rather, it\u2019s the answer held by both. The simple fact is that fiction requires both plot and character to achieve its full potential. One could argue convincingly from both sides of the subject: 1) that stories originated from plot (first this happens, which then causes this to happen); or 2) that stories originated from character (this person did this and that person did that). But why bother with such an argument, when, by focusing on both facets, we can produce a story that contains both a riveting plot and a fascinating character?  It\u2019s unfortunate that many within the literary world have decided that stories must be either character stories or plot stories, when, in fact, the two are symbionts. It\u2019s very true that storytelling originally focused more on plot and has evolved over the years to put more emphasis on character. In his book Characters & Viewpoint  , Orson Scott Card elucidates:    Character stories really came into their own at the beginning of the twentieth century, and both the novelty and the extraordinary brilliance of some of the writers who worked with this story structure have led many critics and teachers to believe that only this kind of story can be \u201cgood.\u201d\u2026 Character stories have been so dominant that they have forced storytellers in the other traditions to pay more attention to characterization. Even though a story\u2026. is not about a transformation of character\u2026 the readers still expect to get to know the characters; and even when they don\u2019t expect it, they are willing to allow the author to devote a certain amount of attention to the character without regarding it as a digression. This is the fashion of our time, and you can\u2019t disregard it.  But neither can we disregard plot, as pointed out in Lev Grossman\u2019s article \u201cGood Novels Don\u2019t Have to Be Hard\u201d:    Where did this conspiracy come from in the first place\u2014the plot against plot? I blame the Modernists. Who were, I grant you, the single greatest crop of writers the novel has ever seen\u2026. But let\u2019s look back for a second at where the Modernists came from, and what exactly they did with the novel\u2026. One of the things they broke was plot. To the Modernists, stories were a distortion of real life. In real life stories don\u2019t tie up neatly. Events don\u2019t line up in a tidy sequence and mean the same things to everybody they happen to\u2026.  In writer\u2019s groups, writing forums, query letters, and agent interviews, we\u2019re often asked to pigeonhole our stories on one side or the other of the plot vs. character controversy. It\u2019s true that most writers, depending on the individual manner in which they approach inspiration and organization, put at least a slight emphasis on one or the other. And there is nothing wrong with this\u2014no matter where that emphasis lands. But this is no reason to focus on one to the exclusion of the other. Fiction is about balance\u2014in so many ways\u2014and certainly nowhere more so than in the matter of plot vs. character. Good writing should not be about pitting plot against character, but rather about finding the harmony between them. ",
