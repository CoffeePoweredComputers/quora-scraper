            "answer_text": "Finally you don't have to take the SAT essay, it is optional now! Some of you might feel happy about it; however, you must not forget that if you decide not to complete the essay component, you might lose on applying to some of the colleges requiring it. For SAT test takers scoring above 22 out of 24 is a really good SAT score to achieve. If you choose to take SAT with essay then you have an option to apply to more schools. Also note that the essay scores will always be sent along with your multiple choice test scores. Colleges and scholarship programs receive only the scores you will send them and you have a SAT score feature for that. Please note that the College Board does not release SAT test scores without student consent. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course..!! It is up to you, whether you wanna submit your SAT score with or without the essay. The reason being, every university has a different requirement. Some universities ask for the essay scores whereas others don\u2019t. To know the university requirement, I would suggest you, visit the official websites of your desired universities and check their admission policies and accordingly you can decide. So, submit your scores as per the university requirements otherwise, your application will not be viewed. I hope you got the answer. Note: I am associated with Achievers\u2019 Point. ",
