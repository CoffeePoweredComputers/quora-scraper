            "answer_text": "We have witnessed a lot of Mystery movies especially in the #Whodunit kind of Murder Suspense Genre.. But i would like to highlight my anticipation over an upcoming movie which might consist one of the Real life Murder Mystery happened in Tamizhnadu history.. Movie name: Ponniyin Selvan (2021) Mystery: Who killed Aditya Karikalan? Readers of Ponniyin Selvan should feel the chill over their spine by now while imagining the Magnum opus being directed by one of the able directors in India, Maniratnam. If all set well, the Suspense if promoted well should be the sole USP for this upcoming film especially people who had visualized this during their journey through the pages. With Vikram or Karthi, either one of them should be Aditya Karikalan as speculations cite Jayam Ravi would be Arulmozhi varman, hence i believe Karthi would make justice to the great elder brother character for a shorter but sound remark in the epic.. Let\u2019s see what the Ace director has to show us.. Expecting a visual extravaganza with Aishwarya Rai kind of Star ensemble for the prestigious project.. Guys, if you have any expectations over the movie pls comment it.. ",
