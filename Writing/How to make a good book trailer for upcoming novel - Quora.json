            "answer_text": "There are three templates you can use to create a book trailer regardless of your level of expertise when it comes to editing or video production. Try to keep your trailer\u2019s length to one to two minutes, keeping in mind that you risk losing your viewers\u2019 attention if you create anything longer. Also, longer book trailers can cost more time and money to create. Here are the 3 best types of book trailers: 1. Talking Head Videos Not a pro when it comes to videography? Fear not, there\u2019s always the talking head book trailer! Authors can speak directly into the camera as though they were having a one-on-one conversation with the viewer. These types of trailers are effective in that audiences love to actually see the author behind a book, particularly a self-help book, and tend to form an instant connection with them after watching them speak. Example: Job Escape Plan trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?  2. Presentation Videos Consider using a presentation tool such as Keynote or PowerPoint to showcase your book and what it\u2019s all about. Be sure to use engaging images and narrate the presentation with your own voice throughout, so as not to lose your viewer\u2019s interest. In order to create the video itself, you can record your screen using a screen capture tool. 3. Animated Videos Tell your book\u2019s story with the use of engaging animated graphics! Creating this type of book trailer will likely require the help of a professional video editor or motion graphic designer, although there are some funky free tools online that can create a video for you. These can be kind of silly, though, so be wary of of creating a video with stock animation and synthesized voiceovers. You may not have the effect you wanted! If you want to create a slick animated video, hire some experts. Our team at Happy Self Publishing specializes in this form of book trailers and can take care of everything from helping you record your voiceover narration to hiring external voiceover artists and putting together a complete attractive video.

            "answer_text": "I am a visual artist, and have designed book covers as well as created book trailers for promotional use for my current, and past clients. Most of the tips I am giving out come from my own experiences that worked for my customers. Some people might have different experiences, but these are strictly my own. It is not set in stone so please feel free to experiment with what works for you.  (The gif above is a sample trailer. You can click the link below this post to see the full version) The possibilities of crafting your book trailer to your liking is endless, but my biggest tip would be to keep it short, sweet, and to the point. People have really short attention spans so anything over 2 minutes may hurt your conversion rates. Lower conversion rates = loss in potential book sales!!! WE WANT SALES. If you can drive the main point of your story in 30 seconds without giving out the major plot twist or your entire story line then you have hit the sweet spot. Think of it as an enticing entree for your audience before serving their legendary meal (when they purchase your book of course!). Before you start I recommend getting to know other very successful book trailers, and reading the viewer\u2019s feedback (most trailers are on youtube due to it being such a large platform. The comments there are usually raw, and unfiltered so you really get to know the audience\u2019s take on it). This way you will get an idea of what your audience likes to see. Also play with your video editing software (imovie, movie maker, final cut, adobe premiere, avid, sony vegas, etc) until you feel comfortable enough to use it without feeling frustrated or confused. The more comfortable you are with your video editing software the quicker, and smoother the overall editing process will be. I posted an example book trailer at an author\u2019s forum as a tutorial for a question similar to yours, and had so much feedback that it turned into an entire blog post. I don\u2019t want this answer to turn into an epic so below is a more detailed version with more tips. You can find more details along with a sample book trailer I created here: TIPS | How to create, and edit a stunning book trailer I wish you much success! ",
