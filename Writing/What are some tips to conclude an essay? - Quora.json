            "answer_text": "Conclusions are often the most difficult part of an essay to write, and many writers feel that they have nothing left to say after having written the paper. A writer needs to keep in mind that the conclusion is often what a reader remembers best. Your conclusion should be the best part of your paper. A conclusion should stress the importance of the thesis statement,give the essay a sense of completeness, andleave a final impression on the reader.STRATEGIES FOR WRITING AN EFFECTIVE CONCLUSION One or more of the following strategies may help you write an effective conclusion. Play the \u201cSo What\u201d Game. If you\u2019re stuck and feel like your conclusion isn\u2019t saying anything new or interesting, ask a friend to read it with you. Whenever you make a statement from your conclusion, ask the friend to say, \u201cSo what?\u201d or \u201cWhy should anybody care?\u201d Then ponder that question and answer it. Return to the theme or themes in the introduction. This strategy brings the reader full circle. For example, if you begin by describing a scenario, you can end with the same scenario as proof that your essay is helpful in creating a new understanding. You may also refer to the introductory paragraph by using key words or parallel concepts and images that you also used in the introduction.Synthesize, don\u2019t summarize: Include a brief summary of the paper\u2019s main points, but don\u2019t simply repeat things that were in your paper. Instead, show your reader how the points you made and the support and examples you used fit together. Pull it all together.Include a provocative insight or quotation from the research or reading you did for your paper.Propose a course of action, a solution to an issue, or questions for further study. This can redirect your reader\u2019s thought process and help her to apply your info and ideas to her own life or to see the broader implications.Point to broader implications. For example, if your paper examines the Greensboro sit-ins or another event in the Civil Rights Movement, you could point out its impact on the Civil Rights Movement as a whole. A paper about the style of writer Virginia Woolf could point to her influence on other writers or on later feminists.The American essay writers are helps for students for making all verity of essay papers and projects in online.

            "answer_text": "The purpose of the essay's Conclusion is to paraphrase the main argument. It reminds the reader of the strengths of the argument: that is, it reiterates the most important evidence supporting the argument. Make sure, however, that your conclusion is not merely a repetitive summary as this reduces the impact of the argument you have developed in your essay. The conclusion provides a forum for you to persuasively and briefly restate your thesis given the reader has now been presented with all the information about the topic. Depending on the discipline you are writing in, the concluding paragraph may also contain a reflection on the evidence presented, or on the essay's thesis. The conclusion should match the introduction in terms of the ideas accessible and the argument put forward. Sometimes you will find that the process of writing has changed what you have argued and so it will be necessary to go back and reword the introduction. Finally, the conclusion is not the place in your essay to introduce new information or new ideas: these should be in the body of your essay. ",
