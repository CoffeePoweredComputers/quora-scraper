            "answer_text": "There are many jokes every year around the world about how pointless the New Years resolution making by those who need to broadcast it to everybody, those who need to, and others who heard of a great idea at a holiday party. Many times they are for breaking bad habits or creating new idealistic ones. The main reasons in very simple terms are: lack of progress seenlack of support in their point of viewfelt they were lied tonot worth the effortforgot much of the advice or readingWhile your case may be quite different than a New Years resolution, and I\u2019m sure it is, motivation truly is the biggest element in our brains in terms of pursuing our goals. How bad do you want it ? Can I accept that Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day ? How hard can I get hit, get back up, and keep moving forward ? Can I ignore the day to day noise in my life without having it distract me from my goals ? Do I believe in myself enough, or do I need to get a training partner (or mentor) in my corner that will push me harder than I already do myself ? On this last one, if the answer is yes I do need more help, then know that you are not alone with that problem. Up until this point for me it was being around many high achievers that always lifted me to do better, with some slipping of effort of course, but not until we fall do we sometimes admit that we need some help. You can almost consider it like starting a bob sled race with a long flat (or slight incline) beginning to the journey but once you get going you and your team can manage the ride easier than the start. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that you want to try and remember what worked in the process and what didn\u2019t, give thanks along the way and celebrate together, and keep doing the race over and over but adding or changing things for slight improvements. Sometimes you\u2019ll learn something ground breaking and you will forget this answer and never need it again. ",

            "answer_text": "First, you are not alone. In fact, you\u2019re in the overwhelming majority. So don\u2019t beat yourself up over it - changing is hard work, it\u2019s painful, and it\u2019s every day. Cut yourself some slack. Now, let\u2019s look at those plans and goals. Most plans and goals fail for two reasons: 1 - they\u2019re too vague. 2 - they\u2019re too big. Let\u2019s say you want to save more money. So your goal is to save money. That\u2019s big, and it\u2019s vague. And it\u2019s probably doomed to failure because of its enormity and vagueness. Instead, ask yourself: \u2018what one little thing can I do that won\u2019t be too difficult, that will help me realize my goal of saving more money?\u2019 If you\u2019re in the United States, I\u2019d suggest you start with your morning coffee. Many people stop at Starbuck\u2019s and pick up a coffee for around $5 to start their day. So your goal for this month would be \u201cI\u2019m going to make my morning coffee instead of picking up a Starbuck\u2019s coffee. I\u2019m going to do it every work day for the next month.\u201d That\u2019s it. Try that, make it a habit, and then next month, pick another small habit you can change that will save you a little more money. After a year, you\u2019ll have developed 12 habits that will save you a little bit more money every day, you\u2019ll have incorporated it into your daily routine, and your savings account will grow. Start small, stick to your one small change until it\u2019s routine and you do it automatically. Then move on to another small change. Good luck! ",
