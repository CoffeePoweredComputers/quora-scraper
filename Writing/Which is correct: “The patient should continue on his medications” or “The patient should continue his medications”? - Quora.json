            "answer_text": "Both the sentences are syntactically correct! The usage is different though! If you say : The patient should continue on his medications. This is can be a statement on the case sheet of an in-patient in a hospital. More an advice to the duty nurses. If you say: The patient should continue his medications A language in a discharge summary, basically advice to the patient directly. This is a subtle difference. Generally, these days, the sentences are used interchangeably! Cheers! Thank you Sara for the correction. It was an oversight. Thanks again. ",
