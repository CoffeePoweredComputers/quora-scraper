            "answer_text": "HiMy personal advice would be this: Start Online Business Tutorial, (if you don't like it, please continue reading)here are 9 good ways to make money from home:  1. Customer-service rep. Many companies, such as J. Crew, Express Jet, 1-800-flowers, and even theIRS, outsource customer-service operations to third-party companies who then hire home-based workers or \"agents\" to take calls and orders. When you call 1-800-flowers, you may be speaking with Rebecca Dooley, a retired police officer and employee of Alpine Access, a major call-center service. When you dialed the number, your call was automatically routed to Rebecca's spare bedroom in Colorado.Alpine Access currently employs more than 7,500 work-at-home customer-service agents who take in-bound calls (there's no outbound or cold calling) for dozens of companies. \"This works perfectly for me because I can set up my hours around my family's busy lifestyle,\" says Rebecca, who usually works 20 to 32 hours a week, depending on her schedule.While the typical hourly rate is about $9, Alpine Access agents who work more than 20 hours a week are eligible for benefits plus a 401k program when they have worked for over 1,000 hours. (Some companies consider their staff independent contractors, so they don't provide benefits.) 2. Telemarketer. To do this job, you need a pleasant voice and personality, and really thick skin\u2014you're bound to encounter some hostility. Still, it's a good way to earn income. Many large companies now outsource their cold-calling campaigns to third parties who hire home-based workers to place the calls. Telemarketers are typically paid by the hour, and they may earn incentives and commission based on performance.Companies hiring home-based workers include Telereach.com and Intrep.com. Apply on their websites. Keep in mind that a legitimate company will typically not require you to pay a fee to get information or leads, and will explain how to apply, exactly what is required and what to expect. 3. Online juror. Companies will pay you to sit on mock juries to give attorneys and other jury consultants feedback on cases they are currently handling. Think of these as focus groups. The cases are real, but your verdict will do little more than give those involved a prediction of how things might go. You can earn fees ranging from $5 to $60. Be sure to read all the disclaimers and details. 4. Survey TakingI'd pretty much ruled out survey taking as a legitimate way to earn money from home, but then I heard from Bonnie Alcala. She and her daughter Andrea Spain, an elementary-school substitute teacher, take surveys online for fun and a little profit. They are careful to avoid any scams by refusing to pay an upfront fee or other charge. Bonnie and Andrea pocket around $100 a month for spending two hours a week taking surveys, which gives each of them extra pin money. In addition, they collect all kinds of gift cards and other prizes. 5. Writer, Blogger, Editor, Proofreader. Everyone says you're a fantastic writer, so isn't it about time you got paid? Good writing is still in demand says Durst, especially for online content. For the best sites try JournalismJobs.com, About.com seeks \"Guides\" in a broad area of topics, and MediaBistro.com. For blogging jobs, try problogger.net. If you have experience as a freelance copy editor, writer or proofreader, go to editfast.com. Rates vary between $15 and $25 an hour. 6. Cyber Crafter. If you're a crafter in search of customers, the internet is your showcase, and not only at auction sites like eBay. DeWitt Young of ObviousFront.etsy.com Has had success turning her crafts into cash in cyberspace. She has a booth at Etsy.com's Craft Mall, an amazing place where more than 10,000 artisans and crafters offer their goods for sale.DeWitt turns salvaged parts from old TVs and VCRs into artsy necklaces, earrings and figures. Colleen Jordan uses 3D printing to create her necklaces called wearable planters. Don't be discouraged,Shapeways 3D printing company can get you started with their simple apps so you can easily customize your own designs with a click of a mouse, anything from a wedding band in rose gold, a vase in ceramic or your own bobble head printed in full color. All for the purpose of generating sales. 7. Online guide, expert. Do your friends look to you for advice on things you're passionate about, such as which car to buy, how to repair appliances or how to make a killer cheesecake? Whatever your area of expertise, if you are also a seasoned writer with an infectious enthusiasm for a particular topic, consider becoming an online expert guide. Guides are freelancers with an ability to communicate well and good grammar and spelling skills.For example, About.com guides write articles or reviews in their area of expertise. They earn no less than $725 a month, but some make more than $100,000 a year depending on year-over-year, page-view growth. Go to beaguide.about.com, where you'll find which areas of expertise are still open. (There are many!)Also try Chacha.com, a new search engine similar to Google and Yahoo, and click on \"Become a Guide\" for more information. At JustAnswer.com, users agree to pay for the answers to their questions. Guides are paid a percentage of the pre-negotiated price per answer and the number of accepted answers received. Go to Just Answer to find out how. 8. Virtual assistant. Many small-business owners and mid- to executive-level professionals need personal assistants, but can't afford a permanent position on the payroll. The solution? Hire people from remote locations to do their administrative work.Virtual assistants handle all kinds of administrative projects, including travel arrangements, event planning, correspondence and other support services that can be done remotely via e-mail and phone.Lynne Norris, who works out of her home in Pennsylvania (NorrisBusinessSolutions.com), says that rates for VAs run about $25 to $75 or more an hour, based on the types of services you provide. The startup costs are about $500 to $1,000, assuming you have an up-to-date computer and printer. Lynne loves the flexibility. \"My children are happy that I don't miss the important things in their lives.\" Check out the International Virtual Assistants Association (ivaa.org), or virtualassistantjobs.com andteamdoubleclick.com for more. 9. Online tutor, English as a second language instructor. If you have a college degree and the skills to tutor students online in math, science, English or social studies, this job may fit you perfectly. Go to Tutor.com\u2014tutors who work for the company and have passed their probationary period earn $10 to $14 an hour. According to Durst, \"Skype and other web interface tools are bringing English language instructors face-to-face with students from around the world.\" Try ispeakuspeak.com, openenglish.comto get started.

            "answer_text": "There are several ways to make money online as a side income. I was an engineer before I became a self-employed online earner. I was sick about my 9-to-5 job and I have tried several ways to make money online. Some worked and some not. Let me share with you what worked for me and what\u2019s my preferred way to make money online. When I saw your question, I was about to say taking survey online, but it is almost impossible to make a sustainable income by just filling online surveys. Hence, I go for the followings:- #1 Freelancing Freelancer.com is the most popular portal which allows you to bid on projects, there are lots of projects in freelancer. But as high as the projects, there are lots of bidders also which makes freelancer a tough platform to survive, but once you get good reviews its very easy to get projects. Apart from freelancer, there are other websites where you can do freelancing likeOdesk, Elance, Project4Hire, GetaCoder, and ThemeForest. ========================================== #2 Become an affiliate marketer This is not meant for short term income generation. There are college students making lucrative income by becoming an affiliate marketer. It requires some time and effort, but the money is good in the long run. You can always blog and monetize your website. If you are limited to a strict budget, it does not mean you can't start making income online. It is always possible to start an online business with very little money provided you have the right mentor, work attitude, and good plan. Let me break it down how you can become an affiliate marketer step-by-step:- Assuming you have not started anything yet and you are totally new to the world of blogging, let me run through with you the process of building a website that generates revenue. Before you earn money, you are going to first be focusing on creating your niche website and the working to get traffic to your website. Without a website, without content, and without traffic, the MONEY doesn't happen. Task #1: Understand the Make Money Process There are MANY different ways that you can earn money online and many different ways in which you can build an entire business. My preferred way is affiliate marketing - an automated (not fully) niche site that generate revenue. There are more than three billion internet users (the audience) and these people are looking (searching) for things all the time. They are looking for information and to buy products. That is where you are going to come in with your website and help these \"audiences\" by offering them information about what they are looking. You will be helping these people and earning revenue in the process. Task #2: Finding Your Niche Your online business should not feel like a day job. Earning money online should be fun, and it is fun. This all starts with choosing a niche that you are interested in and will enjoy working with. The more you enjoy doing something the less it feels like a job and the more productive you are going to be. Your niche could be anything, but at the core of your niche selection it should be something that you \"like\". Something you enjoy. Something you can talk about. Something you want to learn about. In the simplest form, a niche is really a group of people looking for stuff. When you select your niche, you want to avoid being too broad with your niche selection. What people fail to understand is the fact that there are millions of people looking for stuff online within what seems to be the smallest of niches, but they really are not. A few things that you should understand about niches are: (1) You are going to be writing content within your niche(2) You are going to be communicating within your niche(3) You are going to be choosing products to promote within your niche(4) You need to enjoy helping people within you niche.(5) Your first niche PROBABLY won't be your last (so don't worry about it being perfect)(6) Any niche can become a \"full time\" successful business Task #3: Build Your Website Having your own domain name is ideal and gives you a huge competitive advantage when it comes to succeeding online. For example, if you owned your own domain it would look something like this... yourwebsite(dot)com For example, if your niche was \"Macbook Air Cases\", your domain name would be: macbookaircases(dot)com And your website name would be: Macbook Air Cases You can use WordPress blog and host it on Bluehost. Task #4: Finding Ideas from Keywords You have likely heard the term \"keyword research\". This is the act of finding keyword phrases that are relevant to your niche and deciding whether or not it is appropriate to build content around that particular keyword. This is going to be the \u201croot\u201d of all your search engine optimization success, so we are going to be tackling keywords here before we get into creating content. A keyword is simply a word or phrase that people search for in the search engines. Every time you do a google search you are entering a \"keyword\" into the search box. Ultimately, the goal of your keyword research is to find keywords that you can get rankings in Google, Yahoo, and Bing with, all while attracting a relevant audience. You will be using the keywords that you find in this lesson to build content around. This will lead you to search engine rankings and traffic to your website! Each page you create will be targeting a keyword... 100 pages targeted 100 keywords = 100 potential Google rankings. This can and will lead to mass amounts of traffic and those that follow along with this training are going to see their traffic continue to go up with every \"keyword targeted\" page or post that they create on their website. Remember, Google and other search engines are around because of CONTENT and if you can deliver quality content (that targets low competition keywords), you will be able to get great rankings! The simplest way to do it is through Alphabet Soup Technique - Using Google Instant to Find Keywords. Well, it\u2019s a simple technique that you can use with a little help from Google. Actually, we\u2019ll be using the Google Instant feature that occurs automatically when searching for anything using the Google Search Bar. Have you every noticed that when you place a subject or question in Google search, that Google automatically populates your search menu with similar or related searches that you\u2019re looking for? For example, I type in \u201close body fat\u201d into the Google\u2019s search bar. Google Instant will automatically populate my search with the top search results that are similar to my keyword or keyword phrase. The way the Alphabet Soup Technique works is by.. 1.) Take your blog post topic or keywords that you would like to investigate, and put it into the Google search bar. 2.) Then add the letters of the alphabet, one at a time, and see what is actively being searched for on Google. You can also add a letter and go through the alphabet at the beginning of your keywords to see what Google Instant comes up with. Or you can use a question at the beginning of your keyword phrase starting with.. WhoHowWhatWhenor WhereThen you will see a whole new series of keyword phrases that you can potentially use as keywords for your next post on your website. Task #5: Create Quality Content Content is going to be the \"meat\" of your site. Content will be the difference between getting lots of traffic becoming an authoritative site, and you not seeing much in the way of results. Plain and simple, content leads to rankings in search engines and rankings are going to lead to your website traffic and revenue! Google, BING, & Yahoo LOVE Content! These are the top 3 search engines and make up over 98% of searches online. Want to know how you can leverage these search engines and get mad traffic to your site? The answer is: Quality content. The most important aspect of any content, whether it is text or video is that it is created with the reader in mind. Real people are reading this content so you want to deliver something that is relevant and interesting. When writing content you want to keep in mind that you are writing it for people, not just for Search Engines :) Being original, candid, and building your personal brand is the best way to succeed within any niche, so please make sure you do put some effort into creating your own content. There is nothing wrong with getting some concepts or ideas from elsewhere to incorporate in your page as this will save you time. Refrain however, from copying and pasting other people's work as you will lose ANY chance of ranking if you have duplicate content on your site. People are going to be navigating on our website, they are going to be reading our content, and they are going to be buying from us based on our recommendations. They are going to be engaging in discussions, they are going to be sharing our content on social networks, and they are going to be trusting us and our brand. Don\u2019t lose sight of this, I see it all the time where people get so lost in the process of what they are doing that they dehumanize their website to the point where no visitor would get any value. It is all about the EXPERIENCE you create. Task #6: Find Affiliate Programs to Promote Google \u2013 the easiest way to identify relevant affiliate programs, simply insert your keywords into the search engine and you may find products that suit your niche.AdSense Ads \u2013 many of the AdSense ads appearing beside Google search results, someone's blog, and even on your own blog are likely to be products with affiliate programs attached. It is sometimes worth checking out the ads (don't click the ads on your own blogs, you will be penalized) to find out the potential affiliate partners. Very often, you will be surprised to find some great affiliate programs that you might not know.Affiliate networks \u2013 there are quite a few affiliate networks around that list many affiliate programs. Most of these have search functions to allow you to type in keywords and find promotions relevant to your niche. Check out MarketLeverage, Clickbank, and Commission Junction.TIPS: I agree it is not easy to stand out on the market as there are millions of bloggers out there. However, it is still possible for a newbie to make a sustainable income online by choosing the right niche. For example, everyone is talking about virtual reality now. If you are interested in VR and you blog about, I believe there will be a huge potential in making good money from it. Note: Freefly VR offers affiliate program to earn commission.
