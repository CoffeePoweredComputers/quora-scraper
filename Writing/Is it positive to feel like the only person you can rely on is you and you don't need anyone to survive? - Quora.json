            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say it\u2019s partly dependent on your personality. I feel energized by other people, even though i\u2019m an introvert. It feels good to interact. Though I avoid interaction a lot based on bad experiences. So no matter how much i\u2019m hurt i\u2019m always gonna try again eventually because I get something out of having some sort of connection with someone. And I think that\u2019s something we as humans need. We need close friends. We need to feel nurtured and cared for and heard. At all ages. People suffer illness from simply neglect. I\u2019d say it\u2019s extremely reasonable to end up in that position where you only rely on yourself. If most of what you\u2019ve experienced with others is deep betrayals, then I\u2019d say it\u2019d be positive to only rely on yourself. I\u2019ve felt completely betrayed by people i\u2019d never expect to betray me. Members of the church, family members, thereapists, coworkers of two years or more, girlfriends, and lifelong friends. It\u2019s hard to have trust after that. Not sure if it even is wise. And it\u2019s frustrating because if i explain how i was betrayed, the person i\u2019m talking to tries to get me to be empathetic to the other person. Even though they don\u2019t even know that person. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t get any sympathy. So I mostly rely on myself. In some cases I keep certain connections in my life because the other person would try to trash my reputation if I were to leave. It\u2019s pretty toxic. At the end of the day you\u2019re the one who has to faces the consequences for all your decisions. It\u2019s something i\u2019ve been thinking about. If you rely on others for what decisions you make, you\u2019re putting the fate of your future in their hands. And they might not even be thinking carefully about the direction they\u2019ve pointed you. I try to be my own best friend. I try to think of the inner child within me who is so pure and deserves the best mentor and the most gentle treatment. ",

            "answer_text": "You don't NEED anyone else to survive. And it is incredibly positive to rely on yourself. If you were on an island alone and able to secure food and water, shelter \u2014 you wouldn't just die \ud83d\ude02 You would survive and rely on yourself daily. Anyone upset yet? \ud83d\ude0f A BIG however now. Would you thrive? Not really so much. You'd more simply just survive. It's important to understand clearly the distinction between survival and thriving. The people in our lives, the relationships we hold dear, the pains and gains we experience in our growth \u2014 that is a quality that enriches our survival, it brings life to life. Civilization would of never advanced if we hadn't collaborated and shared so much. It is our growth, both on micro and macro scales. It is also positive to understand indefinitely that you do not NEED these aspects to move forward. When you rely on you, you learn to not negotiate with negative people and experiences because if they aren't adding to your quality of life then they are deducting from it. If what you want is quality and they are not that, you don't need them. People stay in horrible situations for this reason; they feel they need and destroy theirselves in the process for that need. It only becomes self destructive if you utilize the perspective from an unhealthy state of mind, in which you put yourself on an island intentionally despite having the tools to build a bridge and a desire to cross back over it. The people in my life are a gift I cherish; they don't need me, not really. Their life would go on without me. But they choose to be a part of it despite it because I give them something beautiful, and they me. I had to earn that and continually earn that cause I work to keep it. Otherwise I'd just be on an empty island, surviving, not thriving. ",

Feeling like I need to hurt others, or get rid of others because I feel like I can survive alone-that\u2019s where we get into different territory. Those are also often the people who say \u201coh I can survive on my own!i don\u2019t need anyone!\u201d with that braggadocio kind of attitude and use it to justify their hurtful actions to others. Otherwise, people who are connected to that primal self, the one that is alone, the part of them that's connected to the first man that ever roamed the earth. in relationships with others ?amazing (perhaps somewhat ironically). You have a beautiful thing if you do feel like you don\u2019t need anyone to survive, and if you actually can survive without anyone. It means you never use people, you are there because you want to be. For me its made me rethink the purpose of relationships, and makes the relationships in my life like art. It\u2019s a deeper sense of self few reach. That said its also okay to be vulnerable, people do need to feel needed and i think we all have some measure of need. And if you can fulfill that more vulnerable aspect, without giving away your primal self. i hope that makes sense.x ",

            "answer_text": "No. This breeds a posture of self-reliance, and self-salvation, and self-judgement, and ultimately self-worship. However, the Bible does instruct to trust no man, but the LORD. This command is simple but the lines and boundaries therein are subtle. We must honor the fallen nature of man; that is our neighbors and ourselves. As fallen we are broken, and as we wouldn\u2019t rely on a broken clock for time, so too we shouldn\u2019t rely on others nor ourselves to navigate through this world and this life. We must therefore look to the One who authored and continues to author all of existence. The One who drew the boundaries of time and space itself. For He alone knows where we must go and what we must do. I understand that not everyone believes in God or knows if He truly exist, but I must share that as a man who once tasted great worldly success by following my own will and trusting my own understanding; as a man who did not know or believe in God, I was a ruin. Only when I searched for Him did I find, and I have never known such fullness of joy. Here is a scripture which has helped me numerous times: Proverbs 3:5\u20138 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; 6 In all your ways acknowledge Him,And He shall direct your paths. 7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and depart from evil. 8 It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones. I hope this helps brother. ",

But prove it for yourself, not at them. let other people help you and take their opinions and their advice into account but really ultimately the last decision is up to you/i. I always have a bunch of people weigh in on a decision because I like to take everybody\u2019s suggestion but truly I make the decision ultimately on my own. I do like having those people that I love and trust giving me their opinion though because it does help me make my decision even though ultimately my choice is my own. instead of surviving try living. it includes others. ugh barf right? keep trying! your not alone! lol hugs!

Many people strive to not need others, being self sufficient and independent is helpful in life because sometimes you may rely on people who will let you down. The only problem with this is that sometimes people who think they don\u2019t need anyone can stop trying with other people all together, they cut them out of their lives completely because they think they don\u2019t need them. This may work at first because you\u2019re independent! You don\u2019t need anyone! Until you come across something you can\u2019t fix on your own and you have no one to fall back on. It\u2019s not good to rely on other people all the time, but sometimes you will need help, and if you\u2019ve already cut ties with people who you thought you didn\u2019t need, you\u2019ll have no one to turn to. You may be able to do things on your own, but humans are social creatures by nature and in order to live comfortable lives, we need other people. Being independent is great, but it\u2019s also important to remember that needing help is not a negative, it\u2019s completely normal and sometimes people forget that. ",

If you\u2019re in a situation where that has to be the case, such as one being some sort of super duper secret operative who operates alone or the people in your life are 100%, irredeemably toxic, then I can see the merits. Of course, there are going to be situations where that isn\u2019t the case at all, but the mindset above could still be helpful. But I don\u2019t think most people live in a situation where that is necessary. True, it is helpful to be emotionally independent. But the mindset itself can lead to something worse. I\u2019ll talk about my own experience. At my last school, I had some\u2026 unhelpful\u2026 friends. At a certain point, I really prized the exact sentiment you outline. But then, I moved out of that mindset. Yet, I was able to develop better friends and more emotional independence. See the thing is, that mindset will lead you to pushing away people that matter. And that will lower your own emotional stability and independence. Thus, I\u2019d say that the mindset is unhelpful. In seeking emotional independence, I lost my way from it. And once I stopped using the mindset, I was able to move toward what I really wanted. ",

My parents couldn\u2019t speak much English so no one was really there to help me w/ any school work and all the rest. I was very self sufficient. In fact, I could not wait to get out of the house - my thoughts were serious about that age 12. So, I function just fine and don\u2019t really want to inconvenience anyone or have them go out of their way for me. It\u2019s not that I have any self worth issues, I just like keeping it simple. Course, you have to pay for those services - dog sitting, cab/Uber rides - whatever but I just prefer to play it close to the vest in that sense.

Nurture your relationships with friends and family. They are of value. ",

You'll have to rely on your water company to give you access to water. You'll have to rely on the grocery store to sell you food. And then there's that little problem of social interaction. You see, humans are a social species. We can go a long time without human interaction, but it takes it's toll on us to be entirely solitary. Being self-reliant is a fabulous way to temporarily overcome trauma and beging the process of regrouping. But you'll eventually have to trust someone for something.

Such believe that they are not enough, just as they are, and have to get ever-more power and/or riches to be OK. That never works, but they are not smart enough to change their beliefs and be content with what they already have.

Maybe you didn\u2019t get the help you much needed or desired. That self-protection mechanism has prevented you from break down. Now that you have grown up, it\u2019s fine to acknowledge that this is your current and past world view. It has served you well and you are ready to move on. You have grown wiser and will be able to tell whom to trust and rely on. Even if you get hurt, it\u2019s fine. You can take it and learn from that. Go ahead, make friends and have fun! ",

This has been my approach to life since childhood in that I was fortunate to develop a sense of self reliance, largely because , as I found, in adulthood most people, even the closet will let you down, this is a generalisation of course and often it may be due to factors outside of their control but many will agree with me on this. Also, I should point out that an additonal benefit of developing a robust sense of self in life was/is the confidence to chart my own course, in matters both large and small, rather than following the crowd. In fact people frequently commented on my willingness to go it alone if necessary, even an absence of fear to do my own thing. As they say, we come in to the world alone and leave the world alone. Please note I am not in any way minimising the tremendous enjoyment of being with others. ",

We all belong to different personality types, as determined by, for example, our date of birth. And some personality types would rely heavily on others to survive, while other personlity types, like you and myself, rely only on ourselves. And that is good and natural and normal. I am a Virgo, so by the way. But, we should have no illusions - life is sometimes so demading, that we just have to ask for- and greatfully accept, the help of others. That is why we should always treat other people with respect, even though we might feel we do not need them now or ever - because we never know when we might have to ask for help. In the meantime, you might find studying your own personality type a very interesting journey, on which you would get to meet the real wonderful you, and get to understand who and what you are, and why you are whom and what you are. Be your own best friend. ",

It means you know you\u2019re making the best choices for yourself. That you have the confidence to handle most of what will come at you in life. If you\u2019re bitter about it than you\u2019ve probably experienced family trauma of some form. For something like that consider getting therapy.

Who sowed the cotton in the fields, or made the chemicals and machines that make the fibres for them. Who provides the electricity for your home, to keep you warm? Who provided you with the computer that you sent this question from? Who designed the components, who sat at a computer working out where all the components will be situated on the printed circuit board? Who made your computers monitor, who delivered it to you? Where did the money come from to buy it? I guess it depends on your definition of survival though. Naked, alone,sat on a mountain top with no food or shelter, you won't last very long simply relying on yourself. Maybe perhaps, your expectations of others have been too high and you feel a bit thwarted by life. ",

But this must be rightly understood.It does not mean you cannot trust anyone,nor does it mean you have to be an island onto yourself.We are all all one,inseperabe from one another,bound by the living energy of Source. In practical terms,we need one another to co-create the experience and environment we desire.We do this with a clear understanding of the inviolability of our individuality,our spiritual space and personal responsibility for our lives.

Basically it is a pyramid under your feet; you need a few close ones, either family members & relatives or friends & acquaintances positioned with relative grading before reaching the ground level, meshing with base of pyramid. Why? Because there are situations where you are possibly alone and cannot do anything. It can be an accident (God forbid). It can be a serious health issue appearing suddenly. It may be fire engulfing house (forget fire department as they do their job). A sudden shock of circumstances can also result in cry for immediate help from someone. So on and so forth. You stay at the top of the pyramid any way. Thanks for reading my viewing this question. ",

He will place a complete stranger in your path who will do or say something that you've been looking for an answer for. He will put specially trained folks around to give you a lift up. And sometimes He will put people in your life to cheer you on. So you need those people. Always be open to helpers who guide & don't ask for anything. Be a helper yourself if you can. But you don't need people in your life that are anchors & will abandon you at the bottom of the ocean once you stop going places. Respect yourself & make others do the same.

Many people are self-reliant to a fault, putting far too much pressure on themselves. They bring self-reliance to a new level because they are unable to rely on anyone. Being able to rely on others for some things takes a lot of pressure and stress from us. Reliance on friends, mates and family can be very healthy and affirming. Sure, we may be able to survive on a desert island but does it make our lives better? It\u2019s human nature to be one part of a close, trusting, intimate, loving, forever couple because life is really too hard to do alone and it gives us things we simply cannot provide ourselves like encouragement, another\u2019s respect and someone who looks up to us, someone who needs us, someone to lift us up when life knocks us down.
