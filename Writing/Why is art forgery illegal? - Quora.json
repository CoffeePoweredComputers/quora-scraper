            "answer_text": "While you have unknowingly answered your own question in the last line, allow me first to take you through the finer points first. I am not an artist myself, but know enough of the arts (visual arts or performing arts) to know that looking at merely the service you are rendered, say in the form of a painting or a play or a recital, is a very myopic view to look at art and the corresponding artist's creation. Every piece of art is inspired from a particular source, be it natural or artificial, which then passes through some formative stages of cognition before they are conceptualized into the said art form. This cognitive conceptualization is unique for every individual and thus gives every creator an intellectual property right upon his own creation. As for inspiration from an art form is concerned, there's a lot of subjectivity in this issue, primarily because the cognitive conceptualization is not quantifiable- at least through modern methods of analysis. So whether a person is copying from another while incorporating minor changes, or whether he has merely been inspired and has come up with the creation all by himself, still remains an area of debate. What is definite however, is that every creator has property rights over his creation- and the reproduction of which without his permission must lead to penalty. A skilled copyist from Van Gogh must never be called the Van Gogh of this generation, because his work lacks the thinking that Van Gogh did behind creating something that he mindlessly produced a replica of.
