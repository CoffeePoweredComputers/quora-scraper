            "answer_text": "\u201cThere is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.\u201d So said Ernest Hemingway, who knew a thing or two about pouring one\u2019s \u00e9l\u00e9ment vital onto a blank page. I wholeheartedly agree with the late Mr. Hemingway in the sense that I don\u2019t think writing ever gets easier. I do think, however, that with focus and a bit of dedication, it\u2019s certainly possible to improve tremendously over time. Without further ado, here are three tips on how to write like your life depends on it.  1. Don\u2019t let your thoughts be limited by your vocabulary.  When I was in high school, I used to memorize SAT words. I had a list that I\u2019d pull from\u2014the 500 hardest, most commonly missed words. Aberration. Abeyance. Abject. Abstruse. Abnegation. It was all Greek to me at first. But after months of daily memorization, the words started to stick. I got really good at taking apart critical reading passages and contextualizing difficult words. Eventually my efforts paid off beyond my wildest dreams, and I ended up with a great score on the SAT. Beyond the immediate benefits of acing a test that required an extensive college-level vocabulary, I was now a high schooler with an extensive college-level vocabulary. This didn\u2019t earn me any cool points with the boys, but I could now read and understand more difficult material without having to look up all the words. That\u2019s when a golden nugget of insight hit me. I realized that all these words I\u2019d memorized weren\u2019t just \u201cSAT words.\u201d They were just words. Words that existed in the world. Words that literate people knew how to use, with flair. No more flipping through vocabulary flashcards as a dreaded chore. Every unfamiliar word I come across now is a precious learning opportunity. So next time you come across a word you don\u2019t know, don\u2019t skip over it. Remember that words are the foundation of your writerly bandwidth\u2014that you can only think as far as your vocabulary. Treat each new word like your new best friend. 2. Use reading as an excuse to hone your sense of beauty.  Whenever I read a phrase that really resonates with me\u2014a clever snippet from the New Yorker, a sly remark from Vice, a beautifully wrought metaphor in a book\u2014I always write it down. Doing this has not only made me a better reader, it\u2019s made me a better thinker. It forces me to critically examine how the information was presented. It cements interesting insights into my mind. It trains my brain for faster recall, giving me easy access to the best parts of everything I\u2019ve read. Perhaps most importantly, it hones my sense of beauty, so that I can recognize and appreciate good story-telling for what it is. I\u2019ll give you a line that I read recently, written by Milan Kundera in 1984.  He could have talked at length about how bothersome she found the music, about how she couldn\u2019t sleep at night, how it tortured her, how she couldn\u2019t escape. But why mince words? Why not have ten times the visceral effect on the reader by planting the image of a pack of bloodthirsty hounds, being sicked on its prey? That\u2019s the mark of a good writer\u2014elegance in simplicity. That\u2019s why we still read Milan Kundera today. Tricks like these are everywhere, as long as you care enough to seek them out. So while I absolutely agree that it\u2019s important to read a lot, it\u2019s a lot more important not to read blindly. Find writing that strikes a chord. Notice the aha! moments you experience, the little word-gasms you get from reading. And write them down. The more you seek out beauty in your reading material, the more you\u2019ll seek it out in the world at large. Eventually you\u2019ll hold your thinking to higher standards, and your writing will follow as an extension of your thoughts. 3. Understand that your writing needs a reason to exist.  This point is so important that I\u2019ll illustrate it with a ten-second fairy tale. Once upon a time there was a beautiful princess. She had rose-gold tresses, cerulean eyes, and a tiara encrusted with a thousand shimmering gems. Like all princesses from time immemorial, she also had the gentlest of dispositions and a heart of gold. But underneath all her glitter and grace she had an aching loneliness that nobody knew how to cure\u2014not the doctor, not Prince Charming, not the King or the Queen, not the fortune teller or the astrologist or the mystic, not even God Himself. Then one day, she was visited by a faraway philosopher. He gently takes her hand and asks, \u201cPrincess, why are you here?\u201d And the princess is quiet for a long, long time. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she finally muses. And with that, she dissolves into stardust and fades away. What the princess was missing all along was a reason for being. You\u2019ll notice that I never gave her one. I used her as a gimmick to practice my descriptive writing\u2014to prove a rhetorical point. I never thought about why she existed, who she was under the surface, or what made her tick. But nobody likes a careless creator. Even fairy tale princesses need a reason to exist. Purposeful creation is the secret ingredient behind every good story, something you need for the magic to work. Like love or sentimentality, you can\u2019t always pinpoint what it is, where it is, or why it\u2019s there. But when it\u2019s there, you just know. And in writing, as in life itself, when you have a reason for being, the rest will fall into place. You\u2019ll find a way to tell the stories closest to your heart. They\u2019ll come pouring out of you, fully formed. You\u2019ll be throwing everything you have into the darkness, hoping to land among the stars. After all, there is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter, and bleed. ",

            "answer_text": "Over the past 18 years after moving back to America, I transitioned myself from a \u201cdeer-in-a-headlights F.O.B. to a writer for Forbes, CNBC, Inc and now an Amazon bestselling author. Improving English writing takes time, effort, practice and when I mean practice, I mean DELIBERATE practice. At the age of 16, I moved back to the states from Korea. Prior to this, I did live in Minnesota quite briefly from the age of 2 to 9. During this time, my parents spoke mostly Korean at home so I wasn\u2019t introduced to a lot of English until I started Kindergarten. Here\u2019s a picture of me back in Korea right before my teenage years:  After a couple of years, we moved back to Korea and we stayed there until we moved back to the states when I was 16. It was at this time I realized my English was far below my peers and I was initially placed in an \u201cESL\u201d type class (We had a different name for this in our school) I even failed my college written-entrance exam as a freshman. It was at this time, I wanted to make a conscious effort to improve my English. My logic was if I wanted to become successful in business, I need to master English first. Thus, about 16 years ago I started to write in my journal. I would write in first, second, and third person and at times write as if I were my friends. Thinking like them and trying to learn their culture, helped me tremendously expedite my learning curve. I noticed there were also nuances that were difficult to understand in American culture. For example, in Korean humor there isn\u2019t much sarcasm or dry humor. It is very difficult to write or express oneself . The funny thing about language is that culture is always tied to language. And vice versa. Inasmuch, if you don\u2019t understand the language you won't truly understand the culture. If you don\u2019t understand the culture you won't truly understand the language. In college I would spend hours writing a journal or recording my speech. I also spent a tremendous amount of time watching the sitcom Friends over and over again. Sometimes I would dream that I was sitting at Central Perk with the rest of the crew. I was so dedicated that sometimes my grades would suffer. Watching sitcoms and understanding the culture allowed me to write in other people\u2019s perspective allowing me to become a much more dynamic writer. Additionally, to writing a journal and watching sitcoms, I would read a lot. I would read the same book multiple times and mark expressions and well put together phrases to adapt them into my writing. Today even as a journalist and writer, I still do the same. Phrases and expressions I appreciate, I would take screenshots of them on my phone/laptop or jot them down on my phone. Lastly, I would often voice record my thoughts. Different moods provide different thoughts, which provides different writing. If I am on vacation or even after a few drinks, I would rewrite the same story after saving the older version. Good writing draws people in by making an emotional connection and when you are in a different emotional state, your writing will be affected. As I was writing my book, The Outlier Approach, I would write and re-write parts of the book when I was in a \u201cdifferent emotional state\u201d and I would eventually trim out the best version for each story. This helped me write a bestselling book on Amazon. (The book talks in depth about my journey from Korean to American and my pursuit of the American Dream) To recap, these are the few things I would focus on: 1. Keep a journal \u2013 What started out my senior year in high school to overcome my language difficiencies became the greatest asset in my life. Before I wrote my book, I had a chance to go over 1000 pages of my journal not only did I laugh and cry at all the great memories but I was also astonished at how much I improved in English. Journaling allowed me to also become a much more empathetic person, a crucial skill to have in journaling in order to allow your reader to be able to relate to your story. Some of the journals I kept. In 2011, I went digital :) You can see my Korean name Hyun Seok (\ud604\uc11d) on the read diary.  2. Understand Culture \u2013 So much of communication is rooted in culture. When you are showing interest in someone\u2019s culture, you are saying \u201cI am curious about you\u201d and \u201cYou are interesting\u201d. Good writing starts with curiosity about the people and events around you and how they affect one another. If you are not curious about your surroundings, it is hard to create good writing. 3. Voice Record \u2013 Do you remember the last time you had the \u201cA-Ha!\u201d moment but forgot that next great idea that would change the world? Your voice recorder would not only be a great hedge to mitigate such risk, but a real-time journal you can scribe at your leisure. Use this as an advantage and an extension of your journals for great note taking and to flush out thoughts. 4. Grammar \u2013 Great writing is about great editing. I don\u2019t always pay 100% attention to grammar when I post on social media such as Quora or LinkedIn, but when it comes to major publications this is a completely different story. (I didn\u2019t get the nickname Grammar Police\u201d for no reason) You want your grammar to be impeccable. Misplaces modifiers, subject-verb errors, or run-ons, not only make your case much less credible but it can also confuse the reader when explaining your thoughts. The stronger your grammar, the more risk you can take in your writing because it will less ambiguous in nature. A great book is The Elements of Style by Strunk and White. I read the book 3 times and it helped quite a bit. In 18 years, I went from a F.O.B. disinterested in school because of my language limitations to now a contributor for major outlets such as Forbes, Inc, CNBC and bestselling author. I believe with the right mindset and the right approach, anyone can achieve the success I enjoyed. It will take time, patience, and deliberate but with the right mindset, I believe anyone can achieve what I have accomplished. ",
