            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, Her work has been called racist and sexist. I am only really familiar with the Famous Five books and based on that reading experience alone, I find it is not hard to see the accusations are not baseless. (Also I discovered afterwards that the editions that had come down to me were so censored that a great deal had been left out from the original versions. Earlier editions of the books are more shocking, even ones from as late as the 70s). The FF books specifically are informed by very narrow ideas of gender. There is a girl character in the books who pretends to be a boy because she believes you can only behave a certain way if you are a boy, not a girl. While there is nothing wrong with boys dressing like girls and vice versa, the problem here is the very narrow definitions for gender implied. While we are fighting against these notions even now in the 21st century, there is a strong implication in these books that being a boy IS better, more important, than being a girl. There is another girl character in the books who pretends to be a boy (there are actually four, excluding one of the main characters, that appear in the series in total) and there is a striking moment where she defers to a boy character much younger than herself in a difficult situation because he is a \u201creal boy\u201d and she \u201conly pretends\u201d to be one. There is no suggestion in the story that there is anything wrong with this. It should be said that it IS possible to interpret counters to these ideas in the books themselves, but I think the conservative position is dominant pretty much most of the time. For example, George, the girl who dresses like a boy, is an embodiment of a complex positioning of gender, and yet this character is the source of the most misogynistic comments in the series. She is only ever countered by Anne, (and only in certain matters) who is herself a near-Victorian feminine stereotype who wholeheartedly accepts the control her brothers wield over her (it is perhaps unclear whether this submissiveness is due to gender or that she is the youngest). Then there is the very strong nationalism, which, coming from a post-war context is perhaps understandable. However, as an example, a character does declare that saying that someone is very British is the best thing you can say about a person. There is also an unsettling moment when two fighter pilots are mistakenly believed to have died in an attempt to betray Britain and one of the five states flatly that they deserve death as traitors. There is a serene certainty around heavy ideas like this that is very troubling. Americans tend to be stereotyped as loud, touristy and mollycoddled. The good ones are generous and overly sentimental about their children and the bad ones oversleep and want to tear up British monuments and artifacts of cultural significance and ship them to America because\u2026they have no culture of their own I guess. However, other characters are quick to point out that \u201cnot all Americans are like that.\u201d Gypsies fare far worse. Gypsies appear in many more of the books than do Americans, and they range from the benevolent to the sinister. However, even when appearing as allies to the Five, they tend to be depicted as child-like and in some way culturally degraded. Julian is held up as admirable because he often takes on adults with his quick wit and wins, but it should be noted that the only adults Julian takes on in this way are of another class and/or race. Julian, a character that in many ways embodies order and the status quo, is subservient within the established hierarchy. All in all, the criticisms are not baseless, but I really think that where the problems with the stories are plain enough to be problematic, they also cease being influential. I cannot imagine many kids not seeing through them, and if they do not, they have bigger problems ",
