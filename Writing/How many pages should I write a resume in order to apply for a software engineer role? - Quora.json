            "answer_text": "Software engineer jobs can receive hundreds of resumes and the biggest mistake we see at The Onset is when an applicant\u2019s relevant experience is diluted by a heap of information around it. A ten-page long resume that goes into detail about every small-scale job or piece of technology used in the last 20 years will likely bore the reader and dilute your essential strengths. It\u2019s also important to understand the nature of the role you\u2019re applying for and the type of company and be as concise as you can. If you internalize exactly what an employer wants from a job posting, and show in your resume how your skills match what they\u2019re looking for, you\u2019ll be ahead of the pack. ",

            "answer_text": "With a resume, the general rule is 2 pages at the maximum. But whether it should be one page, 1 1/2 pages, 1 3/4 pages, etc all depends upon your overall background, wording of things, and the resume\u2019s layout. What you want to do is make sure that it impresses enough to get you an interview. If all it takes is 1 page, great! If you need to go to a second page, fine too. So as long as it\u2019s professional, looks good, and says what it needs to in order to impress, that\u2019s exactly what you want most of all. ",
