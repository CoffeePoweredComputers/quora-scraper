            "answer_text": "This has happened to me. It was my husband that actually did this. I went to unload the dryer and pulled out my sons pajama pants covered in ink. Upon further inspection I realized that all of the clothes in the dryer we covered in ink and so was the barrel of the dryer. My husband scrubbed the dryer for 2 hours and there was still some ink he couldn\u2019t get off. He tried a few different products but nothing got rid of the ink completely. You might want to try a Mr. Clean magic eraser, they didn\u2019t exist when this happened to me and you might actually be able to remove all of the ink. The next load of laundry I did was my sons baby clothes which were all light colours. I was nervous that the remaining ink would transfer to it clothes. Thankfully when I inspected all of his clothes there wasn\u2019t any ink on them at all. I hope this helps, good luck! ",
