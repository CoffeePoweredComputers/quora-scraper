            "answer_text": "Did you know that delivering content is actually hard work? It takes a scalable solution, a diverse set of locations, a great deal of bandwidth, and a strong engineering team to keep it all running. Content delivery networks (CDNs) are set up for exactly this purpose: to provide a service to content providers so that they don't have to deal with these issues themselves. A typical CDN will have a cage at each of the major Internet interconnects. In each of these cages, they will have a bank of servers and storage. An overall management network between these sites will distribute new content to each site so that they have effectively identical content. The CDN will interconnect with many of the Tier 1 ISPs so that they have direct access to that ISPs subscribers and those subscribers have direct access to the content. Content vendors then issue redirects from their front end web pages into the CDN that then delivers the actual content. ",

In order to do this your content is replicated over private fat pipes within the CDN to several points of presences where they will connect to the end users. Example:You are using a CDN service, however you are locate in Australia with large audiences in New Zealand. The CDN will replicate and monitor yoru content to a POP in New Zealand, if applicable. Suddenly interest and traffic in the UK gathers steam. Either automatically or through actionable notification, your content is now replicated to a POP in London and the users retrieve the content from there. ",
