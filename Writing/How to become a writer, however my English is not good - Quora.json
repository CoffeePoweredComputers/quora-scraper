            "answer_text": "If you write each day it means you do the same thing writers do, which means you can call yourself a writer. If you do something each day or almost each day, if it\u2019s a deliberate practice (you do it and you care about improving your skills, you analyse your mistakes and learn from them, you learn new stuff), you will improve with time, no doubt. When two years ago I started writing in English (not my first language) it would take me a lot more time than today to write a single post or answer on Quora. It was tedious! I had to look a lot of things up in a dictionary and still made a lot of mistakes (mistakes I didn\u2019t even notice). But I shared this stuff anyway. When I think about some of my early posts or answers in English I feel embarrassed. I picture people reading those posts and seeing all those silly mistakes. Ugh! Whenever I notice such blunder I immediately eliminate it so that at least new readers don\u2019t see them and can understand my point. I bet there are still plenty of them in my posts and answers. After almost two years of blogging in English daily (I started in January 2016) I feel way more confident, I make fewer mistakes (still make them but hope the ones I make nowadays are not that grave). Even if you suck at the beginning it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2018ll always suck. That\u2019s something people often don\u2019t understand (not only haters and internet trolls who tell you you should do something else - all people). Someone who is really bad at singing can get better at it with time and practice. Someone who is really bad at taking pictures can get better at it with time and practice. Someone who is really bad at writing can get better at it with time and practice. In other words, you can be very bad at singing today, but how about two years from now? Don\u2019t be easily dissuaded! Don\u2019t give up after the first attempts! Soon you\u2019ll get better at it. The belief (fact even) that you\u2019re bad at something should never be an obstacle to doing it, especially if that\u2019s what you enjoy doing. And most certainly people\u2019s opinions and stingy, hateful comments should never be a reason for you to quit. - Part of it appeared in Lukasz Laniecki's post in Diary of an artist Lukasz Laniecki's post in Diary of an artist ",

Both reading and writing will also help with your English. Take solace in the fact that there are many English-speaking people who write without good English. Of course, writing in your first language would be easier and could be translated to English. ",

The language and the art are cousins, not twins. ",
