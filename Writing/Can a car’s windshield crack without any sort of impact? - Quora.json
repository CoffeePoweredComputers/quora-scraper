            "answer_text": "Yes. It can happen because of body flex or from extremes of hot or cold but it\u2019s usually from an impact. I\u2019ve inspected 100\u2019s of windshields for this over the years and I don\u2019t remember ever finding one that didn\u2019t have an impact. They can be very hard to see, I usually felt them and would use the tip of a ball point pen to show the customer where the original impact was, it\u2019ll drop right into the divit even if it\u2019s hard to see.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Rapid condensation. If the glass is REALLY hot, like when the temperature is very high, the windows are all rolled up tight, and the sun is blazing on the glass; then, the glass temperature can reach as high as 170 F. At that moment, if cold rain falling from high altitude suddenly wets the glass; it can literally explode out of the car. Though it is EXTREMELY rare, I have seen it happen. More likely would be just a long single crack from side to side or from top to bottom. ",

Then wait until you go out to the truck, and your buddy says \u201cHoly shit, it's still freezing in here!\u201d, and then turns the defroster on full blast\u2026my good friend put six long cracks in the windshield of our old ranch truck doing just that.

I hd to fly out of town and upon my return found the windshield with a big crack through the center. The \u201ctechnician\u201d had installed the new windshield with the foam rubber sealer bunched up in one spot, putting the glass under stress. The hot sun then shining on that glass was enough to cause it to snap without \u201cany sort of impact\u201d! ",

Things like uneven heating, bending or twisting of the pane from stresses on the chassis. Even a slight nick along the edge of a pane can lead to cracking so keep your hard tools away from it. ",
