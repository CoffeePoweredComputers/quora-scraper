            "answer_text": "It was very difficult. Physics required a lot of extra knowledge. NCERT will not suffice. A few questions were much more complex than questions from Krotov and Irodov. So please be prepared for such questions. Chemistry was also on the difficult side. Biology: Most of the questions were out of NCERT. So prepare from books like Arihant and Truman\u2019s Biology. I guess overall the paper was difficult because of the fact that students got so much extra time to prepare due to the COVID 19 lockdown. (Jokes aside, this question can only be answered by time travelers or on 26th of July after the exam is done.) PS:If there is a time traveler in between us, please message me directly XD. ",
