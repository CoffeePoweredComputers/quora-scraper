            "answer_text": "Quite often the real reason is the manuscript is abjectly bad and the author is a terrible writer. There\u2019s no value in saying this to the author even if you feel it would in some way be \u2018good for them\u2019 to know that. You don\u2019t want to be the \u2018give up on your dreams\u2019 guy even if that would probably be for the best. Sometimes you might be tempted - in the spirit of being constructive - to mention that there\u2019s something specific wrong with it like the characters are flat or the plot needs work. These are things that could be fixed, but if you\u2019re rejecting it you\u2019ve made the calculation that it isn\u2019t really worth acquiring even if they were. A rejection that says \u2018I am rejecting this because I don\u2019t like x\u2019 invites a resubmission a week later, where the author now expects you\u2019ll want to acquire the book because they have fixed the issue you mentioned. Now you have to say \u2018well the other thing is\u2026\u2019 and you\u2019re basically editing a book you don\u2019t have rights in and don\u2019t really want, which is a waste of your time. Basically, a polite \u2018this isn\u2019t right for our list right now\u2019 involves a minimum of fuss and doesn\u2019t draw you in to long correspondences with no payoff. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the authors argue about it. Simple answer. I used to be the submissions editor for a small publisher who wanted to encourage new talent, and I made a point of telling authors what was wrong with their manuscripts, and what would make them publishable. I was doing exactly what you wanted, telling the author why the manuscript was being rejected and what they had to do to get it accepted. And virtually all the authors told me I was wrong. No, a cast of a hundred characters was not too much. No, it was necessary to start the story with a prologue set a million years in the past. No, the novel didn\u2019t need an ending, it was a deliberate cliff-hanger to encourage the reader to buy book two (as yet unwritten). No, their sparkly vegetarian vampires were not in the least like Twilight, the book was set in Alaska, totally different. I spent hours on each book, arguing with the authors about what was wrong that was causing it to be rejected. I think one rewrote as suggested and it was accepted. The rest either refused, or rewrote and offered the book to a different publisher. Basically, I wasted a lot of my time and got no return on it. ",
