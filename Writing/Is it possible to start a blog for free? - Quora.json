            "answer_text": " I know the popular answer is Wordpress or Blogger, but I think if you\u2019re not going to spend the money to actually own your domain, it\u2019s better to start on social media. If I was just getting started as a blogger and had zero dollars to invest, I\u2019d use Medium. It\u2019s free, which is what you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s also super easy. You don\u2019t have to do any design. Just open an account and write your first post. Voila! You can easy connect on Medium with friends you follow on Facebook and Twitter, which gives you a head start in the audience department. It\u2019s relatively easy to publish with a Medium publication, which puts you in front of a wider audience. Medium is designed to be super shareable, so even without much of an audience of your own, if you write well and write consistently, you\u2019ll have a chance of having a post gain some traction. I had a post get more than 80,000 views on Medium when I had fewer than 100 followers. You can add a free account at MailChimp to manage your email list and another one at Upscribe to make free forms to put in your Medium posts, to collect email addresses. I think it\u2019s way more important to own your email list than it is to own your blog. Here\u2019s the strategy I\u2019d use (it\u2019s the one I actually do use): Open an account at both Medium and Quora.Use Quora to explore blog topics. Check for questions in areas that interest you, that have some upvotes and followers. If people are paying attention and showing interest in a question, they\u2019ll pay attention when you write about it in a blog post.So, write about it in a blog post on Medium.Check out some Medium publications and submit your posts to them. Be patient and don\u2019t give up if your first attempts aren\u2019t successful. If you keep writing, eventually Medium publications will come to you and ask if they can publish your work.Write on Medium at least once a week. Three times a week is better.Answer a question a day on Quora. Crosspost your best answers to Medium.Add an Upscribe form to the bottom of every Medium post. Remember: building an email list of readers is your goal.Link to your Medium profile in your Quora profile.Email your list twice a month: once to share cool stuff you didn\u2019t write and once to share cool stuff you did. This is a good starter plan for how to use your email list. You might eventually get to where you\u2019re emailing more often. A weekly newsletter with links to your Medium posts isn\u2019t a bad idea.When you\u2019re ready to put a little money into your blogging, go with a blog where you own the domain. (So: yourblog(dot)com instead of yourblog(dot)wordpress or blogger(dot)com.)By this time, you\u2019ll have a better idea of who your audience is and what you want to write. Copy some of your best Medium posts to your new blog.Keep writing. Consistency is king.Good luck! Love,Shaunta P.S. Want to be a Ninja Writer? Start with this free 31 day challenge. ",

If You Want To Creat Free Blog Than Choose Blogger It Is Best Plateform For Blogers Step-by-step Guide to Creating a Free Blog on BlogSpot: To create your free BlogSpot blog site, head over to Blogger.com and login using your Google account. If you don\u2019t have a Google (gmail) account, you can create one for free. For a first time user, you will see an option to use the identity from your Google Plus profile, or you can use your limited BlogSpot profile. I recommend using your Google Plus profile. Once you are logged in, click on \u201cnew blog\u201d or click on this link to directly go there: Creat New Blog . Name your blog: The first thing you need to do is add a name and select your domain. I suggest you read \u201cHow To Select a Domain Name\u201d for additional information. Avoid using your personal name as the domain name, and instead use some generic domain name that you can brand later with a custom domain. You can then select a blog template (you can change it anytime), and click on \u201cCreate Blog\u201d.  Now your blog is created, but you are not done yet! There are a few settings that you need to set on your newly created BlogSpot blog to make it easy to use. You are now on the BlogSpot dashboard where you will see your blog\u2019s backend. From here you can go to \u201cSettings\u201d and make changes to Improve Your Blog visibility. Here is a screenshot of what you should be seeing:  From here you can click on \u201cPosts\u201d > \u201cNew post\u201d and start writing your very first blog post! But before you write your first post, I would recommend that you go to \u201cPages\u201d and create at least one \u201cAbout\u201d page describing who you are and what your blog is about. Most importantly, you should change your blog\u2019s template as the default one is generic and boring (in my opinion). that you can download and install on your blog. Alternatively, you can go to \u201cSettings\u201d > \u201cTemplate\u201d and change the template from there. On this page, you can also add a logo to the header of your BlogSpot blog, and add or remove various other features.  Once you have a few blog posts up and running, you can go to \u201cSettings\u201d > \u201cEarnings\u201d and enable Adsence for your blog. This will allow you to earn money from your free BlogSpot blog.  So your blog is almost ready and you can start writing posts. There are just a few more things I suggest you do. ",

            "answer_text": "If cost is the major consideration of your blogging project, then of course you have a lot of options these days. You have all of the free 3rd party public blogging sites, if you do a basic Google search: \u201cFree blogging sites\u201d you will discover these. Many famous and successful bloggers have started out in this way, plus of course you have a blogging area on your Quora account, you can set up your own blog and derive the SEO power of this site to be distributed. There are many options to write, and publish without needing to spend money on the WWW. But, as with most things, if you value the objectives of your blogging, you will obtain significantly better outcomes if you invest a little in good quality resources. Self hosted blogs are your own brand, and you can determine your own editorial policies! This whole area of the self-hosted, privately owned \u2018blog\u2019 is one that has the most power, because you are in fact building your own identity, your own presence. Back in the days of \u2018analog\u2019 publishing, it was enormously expensive and difficult to get your work, ideas, creations in front of a significant audience. Publishing was an exclusive, and highly regulated industry, because it has enormous influence over large numbers of people, the various markets for published content were served by distinctive and very powerful publishing \u2018houses\u2019, or organizations. With the WWW, or the internet as it is collectively known, we have the incredible opportunity of completely by-passing the legacy \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 of publishing. I don\u2019t think this aspect of \u2018blogging\u2019 is fully appreciated by a lot of people. Essentially, the industry of publishing has been eclipsed, disrupted, challenged, replaced, all of these terms refer to the internet as being the global \u2018middleman\u2019 for private publishers. It is like a mind-set proposition, if we can adjust our perspective to fully appreciate the global publishing house of the WWW we can see many opportunities and occasions for presenting unique, and very high quality writing, discussions of science, results of independent research, political ideas, social movements, inventions, critiques of policy, and commentaries of many different types. For writers, professional people, researchers, journalists, philosophers, artists, authors, drama writers, political pundits, columnists, editors, observers, writers of fiction, the entire spectrum of human involvement, blogging offers you a means to build your own particular publication. Blogging is an absurdly ineffective word. What we mean when we start describing blogging is an enormously dynamic, creative and intellectually vibrant culture. Having the opportunity to produce your own content, and have it distributed very widely, and to targeted audiences is a miraculous advancement in the field of publishing. We just haven\u2019t fully understood the scope of this opportunity yet. Or, I should say that the complete appreciation of the entire range of opportunities for publishers have not yet trickled down into the many nooks & crannies of society. It is clear that some people have fully grasped the occasion, and produce wonderful work. I see it as a part of my job, as an advocate, and champion of digital media to illuminate people about the potential they are missing out on, I develop high quality publications for talented, capable, involved people who seek to have their work presented and distributed. I guess I am a part of the new breed of publishing enablers. I provide the technical means, the support of this technology, the security and web \u2018fire-power\u2019, the practical means to produce and the creative support to promote, and syndicate. You have many different platforms, many different tools and frameworks with which to produce your content, and target a specific segment, your own audience. Nothing happens unless you begin, and once you begin it all becomes much clearer to you, you will wonder why you did not begin much sooner than you have. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, So you want to start a blog. That\u2019s great! Not only is blogging a great pastime, but with a blog you can express yourself in a unique way, help others with problems you\u2019ve overcome, establish yourself as an expert, and even make money. If you\u2019re new to blogging, I will give to you a fast, foolproof guide to starting a blog, without having to learn HTML or waste your time reading long, boring tutorials. In fact, over 9,500 people have already setup blogs using this guide written by Karen Evans! Here\u2019s 5 easy steps how to start a blog: Add posts and pagesStart growing your blogChoose a blogging platformRegister a domain name and hostingDesign your blogThe goal is to help you get started the right way. I\u2019ve found that many people make mistakes when starting a blog, sometimes resulting in them abandoning the project altogether. We don\u2019t want that to happen. I\u2019m going to walk you through the entire process of setting up your self-hosted blog, so you \u2018get it right the first time. Step 1: Choose the right blogging platform (WordPress) Before you can even start worrying about how your blog will look like, you\u2019ll need to choose your blogging platform.  There\u2019s a lot to choose from. You are able to create a blog with many different blogging platforms, such as WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger and more\u2026 However, given that there are over 72 million active users using WordPress today, it\u2019s clear which platform is the boss. Even my own blogs and sites are built with WordPress blogging platform. Here\u2019s why: It\u2019s FREE for everyone to use (including themes, layouts and add-ons that many other blogging platforms don\u2019t provide).It\u2019s super easy to set up.It\u2019s secure; WordPress is always updating their software and keeping everything sound and secure, so there\u2019s rarely a worry of having your blog come under hacking attacks. No wonder Facebook, NASA and even university blogs are using WordPress.It\u2019s HIGHLY customizable. There are hundreds of free themes and plugins that add more functionality to your blog, from contact and subscribe boxes to plugins that improve blog performance and more.While the other blogging platforms are generally all pretty OK, nothing in my opinion has ever come close to matching the freedom and customization options that WordPress offers. So without a doubt, go with WordPress. Especially when you are just starting out. Why you shouldn\u2019t create a blog on a free blogging platform Without a doubt, you need to self-host your WordPress blog. Think about it \u2013 what famous, successful blogger you know is using a free blogging website instead of their own domain name? It\u2019s not just that \u2013 free blogging platforms have other problems too \u2013 including\u2026 You don\u2019t control your content \u2013 the blogging platform does. They could shut you down any time, and for any reason.The web address of your blog will be long and hard to remember instead of a catchy, branded address you choose.You\u2019re not allowed to advertise on most free blogging platforms, making it much harder to ever make money from blogging.All of these limitations apply to the WordPress.com: Create a website or blog blogs. What you really want is to self-host a WordPress blog \u2013 it\u2019s the same software without all the limitations! If I were you, I\u2019d start with a self-hosted blog on my own domain from day one. Setting up a blog like this is WAY easier and less expensive than you think. Finding a domain name and web hosting provider To set up a self-hosted blog on your own domain name, you\u2019ll need two things: Domain name \u2013 This will be your personal blog address where people find you over and over again. For example Google\u2019s Domain is Google. Your new blog domain name will be http://www.YourBlogName.com, except you\u2019ll choose what\u2019s going to be behind YourNewBlog. The cost of a domain name is usually $10/year, but if you follow this guide all the way, I\u2019ll show you how to get one for much cheaper. Web hosting \u2013 This will be the home of your blog address and content that\u2019s on the blog. Without web hosting, you\u2019ll be unable to use your domain. Think of it as a computer hard drive that stores all your content on your blog (images, blog posts and so on). The cost of web hosting is usually somewhere between $2-5 per month. It\u2019s less than an XL coffee at Starbucks, so it won\u2019t break the bank. But it\u2019s an important investment to your blog success. Where should I get my domain name and hosting? When it comes to hosting, there are only two things that matter. Page load speed \u2013 The average amount of time (in seconds) it takes your blog to load.Uptime \u2013 99.9% isn\u2019t enough (it\u2019s 42 minutes of downtime per month). You should be aiming for 100%.There are hundreds of different web hosting providers. They all offer you a similar service (domain + hosting) with a similar price, but since I\u2019ve dealt with and monitored many famous and recommended web hosting companies like Bluehost, iPage, Godaddy etc\u2026 I now only use and recommend www.HostGator.com for domain names and web hosting. Why? Nothing has ever come close to HostGator in terms of blog load speed and uptime (see below): HostGator has great performance, they are easy to use and it\u2019s probably the best pick for beginners. However, you can always go with another web hosting as long as it\u2019s fast, reliable and offers unlimited storage & bandwidth. This helps you to avoid problems later on. Step 2: Set up a Blog on your own domain name (self-hosted WordPress) At the end of this step (2), you will have a fully working self-hosted WordPress blog on your own domain name! Sounds promising, huh? If for some odd reason you don\u2019t want to use HostGator, you can always choose another hosting provider. I can\u2019t promise they\u2019ll be that good, but the registration and the set up process should be some what similar. 1. Go to www.HostGator.com and then click \u201cStart Your WordPress Blog\u201d. 2. Pick a Domain name for your blog Already have a domain name?Just write it in the right box (I already own this domain) and keep moving to the next step by scrolling down a bit. How do I choose a good domain name? Choosing a bad domain name is one of the most common mistakes I see bloggers make. Be sure you choose a domain name that is\u2026 1. Easy to Remember \u2013 Don\u2019t choose a nonsense name, something tough to spell, or a long name full of dashes. 2. Unique and Descriptive \u2013 You want a name that reflects who you are and what you care about. Be creative and build an identity you\u2019re excited about! 3. Trustworthy \u2013 Domain extensions like \u201c.com\u201d, \u201c.org\u201d or \u201c.net\u201d are the most popular, with \u201c.com\u201d being the one most people think of first. Try to avoid crazy extensions like \u201c.rocks\u201d or \u201c.biz\u201d, as these are less commonly used, tougher to remember and not as trusted. Type the domain name you want to use in the box, then click \u201cnext\u201d. If the name is available, you\u2019ll be able to claim it. If it\u2019s not available, choose another one. If the name you want isn\u2019t available, HostGator will show you some alternatives that are similar \u2013 or you can punch in a new name and try again. I\u2019d suggest you to use something that ends with .com, .net or .org 3. Choose your blog hosting plan I recommend the \u201cHatchling\u201d plan for now \u2013 you can always upgrade later if you decide you want more advanced features, but you get more than enough with the Hatchling. 4. Complete your registration Once you\u2019ve chosen Hatchling plan and found a name you like that\u2019s available, you\u2019ll need to register it by putting in your contact and billing information. You\u2019ll also have a chance to customize your package a bit. This is a chance to save some more money, so don\u2019t skip it! Apply discount code \u201cSTARTBLOG\u201d I would take a look at each of these additional services to see if you want any of them. I don\u2019t believe they are necessary for you at this stage. 5. Log in to your new account and install WordPress blog It may take a few minutes for HostGator to register your account, so be patient. You should get a confirmation email when your account is ready. Once you\u2019ve logged in to your control panel (all the information you need for that should be on your inbox) , it\u2019s time to install WordPress. Thankfully, this takes just one click! Log-in to your Hostgator control panelAt the top click \u201cGet Started With WordPress Today\u201dIf WordPress isn\u2019t there for some reason, scroll down a little bit on the control panel and click on \u201cQuick Install\u201d under the Software & Services section. Look at the top of the page, in the left sidebar section for WordPress.Once clicked, you\u2019ll be automatically transferred to http://Mojomarketplace.com \u2013 don\u2019t panic, this is just a site that helps HostGator install platforms (like WordPress). You should immediately see a screen where you\u2019re offered to \u201cInstall\u201d or \u201cImport\u201d WordPress.Click \u201cInstall\u201d to get to the next step. When you\u2019re finished, \u201cInstall WordPress\u201d. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll see a loading bar at the top of your page that will eventually tell you that your WordPress blog has been installed and you\u2019ll see your log-in credentials. 6. Log in in and check out your new blog Once the installation completes, you\u2019ll get an email that shares your login information, including an \u201cAdmin URL\u201d. (In case you missed that notification bar) To log in to your blog, click the admin URL. If you forget this URL, it\u2019s simply http://www.yourblog.com/wp-admin (where \u201cyourblog\u201d is your domain name). Congratulations \u2013 you now know how to make a blog using WordPress. You\u2019ve installed WordPress and set up your blog, all on your own! As you can see, it was really easy and straightforward. Step 3: Designing your blog In this section, I\u2019ll show you some WordPress blog basics, including: Changing your blog\u2019s designInstalling new plugins/featuresMaking your blog search engine friendlyIf you\u2019ve set up your blog, you\u2019re now ready to start using WordPress and customizing your blog. Remember: You can log in to your blog by going to http://www.yourblog.com/wp-admin/ and using the credentials you set up with HostGator or any other hosting company you used. Changing Your Blog\u2019s Design (Themes & Layouts) WordPress blogging platform uses design templates called \u201cThemes\u201d to figure out how your site should look. Changing your blog\u2019s layout and design is as simple as installing a new theme. There are over 2,000 professionally designed, fully-customizable and free themes to choose from \u2013 so you\u2019ve got a lot of options. If you want to see premium themes and designs like the Genesis Framework, head over to Website Templates & Themes from ThemeForest Here\u2019s how to find and install a theme you love: When you log in for the first time, you\u2019ll see a dashboard or admin panel: Mouse-over the \u201cAppearance\u201d tab in the WordPress sidebar, then click on \u201cThemes\u201d. On the next screen, you\u2019ll see several themes are already installed. If you don\u2019t like those, click the \u201cAdd New\u201d button at the top, or the great big \u201cAdd New\u201d square to start searching for a theme. Now, you\u2019ll see tabs where you\u2019ll find featured, popular and brand new themes, as well as a \u201cFeature Filter\u201d and search bar. I really like the \u201cFeature Filter\u201d option, because you can choose themes in certain color schemes, select specific layouts and even choose themes with built-in advanced features. Just choose the options you want, then click \u201cApply Filters\u201d on the left hand side. If you\u2019re finding this challenging, just search by keyword \u2013 there\u2019s no wrong way! When you\u2019ve found a theme you like, click \u201cInstall\u201d. You\u2019re nearly done! Once the theme has been installed, all that\u2019s left to do is click \u201cActivate\u201d on the next screen: Configuring your blog to be search engine friendly There are some things you\u2019d need to do to make your blog more search engine friendly. Search engines do not like two things: 1. Ugly and clumsy URL-s In order to change your links to a more cleaner, click on the \u201cSettings\u201d -> \u201cPermalinks\u201d and use the following settings: 2. Spam comments \u2013 Unfortunately, lots of people want to leave automate spam comments on your blog. They do that for couple of reasons \u2013 to get people from your blog to their blog and to advertise their services/products. To avoid that, make sure you moderate your comments. Here\u2019s how to do that: Go to \u201cSettings\u201d -> \u201cDiscussion\u201d and tick those two options.  Step 4: Adding/Writing Blog Posts and Pages By now you should have fully working WordPress blog on your own domain name. You should also have a custom blog theme that fits with your blog\u2019s topic. Congratulations \u2013 you\u2019ve done a LOT and I\u2019m proud that you\u2019ve managed to get so far. In the LAST step, I\u2019ll show you how to write your first blog post and share some tips for writing blog posts.In this section, I\u2019ll show you\u2026 How to write a post inside WordPressHow to add images, links and format textSome quick tips and tricks for writing great contentUsing WordPress to Blog Adding a New Post To add a new blog post, click the \u201cPosts\u201d section on the left hand side-menu, then click on \u201cAdd New\u201d. On the next screen, you\u2019ll see something like this:  You can add the title to your blog post in the top field, and your content goes in the big text box below the title. You can save your draft or publish your content live by using the box menu on the far right of the page. You can even schedule the post to be published later \u2013 or make the post private so only friends can see it.  Once published, your new post can be found in the \u201cAll Posts\u201d section of the \u201cPosts\u201d tab, so you can edit it any time. Let\u2019s take a quick look at some things you can do to spruce up your post: Adding Images To add an image to your post, click the \u201cAdd Media\u201d button right above the lower content field. Tip: Before you click \u201cAdd Media\u201d, be sure you\u2019ve left your cursor inside of your blog post where you want the image to show up. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to move it later on.  Next, click the \u201cUpload Files\u201d tab on the screen that pops up, then click \u201cSelect Files\u201d. Once you\u2019ve found the file, double click it and WordPress will upload it automatically. When the upload is finished, make sure the image you want is selected, then click the \u201cInsert into post\u201d button to add the image to the post you\u2019re writing. Adding a Link Linking out to other websites is a great way to build relationships and share interesting content. To add a link, click on the icon in the toolbar that looks a bit like a chain link. On the pop-up, you\u2019ll need to enter a few important bits of information.  URL is the web address of the link you want to share. Make sure you include \u201chttp://\u201d before the \u201cwww.\u201d address, or your link will be broken.\u201cLink Text\u201d is the text you want people to click on to get to your link. It might be \u201cClick here\u201d, or anything you choose.\u201cOpen link in a new window/tab\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a smart idea to check this box. Otherwise, when someone clicks your link, they\u2019ll leave your blog.If you want to link to an existing page, you can use the \u201cSearch\u201d section to find a post or page you\u2019ve already created and click it to add a link.Finally, click \u201cAdd Link\u201d, and your link will be added where you left your cursor in the post you were writing. Adding Headers & Editing Text It\u2019s a good idea to use headers and bolding to make your content easier to read and scan. Adding Headings To add a heading, click on the drop-down menu on the bottom left of the toolbar. Try to only use \u201cHeading 1\u201d once within your page (usually at the top), and use \u201cHeading 2\u201d or \u201cHeading 3\u201d for other sections in the copy, as this is better for search engines. Tip: You can also highlight the text you want to change in your blog post, THEN click on the dropdown menu and select the format you want the text to be in. Editing Fonts You can also bold, italicize, underline and even change the colour of your text in a click or two.  \u201cB\u201d is for bolding\u201cI\u201d is for italics\u201cU\u201d is to underline your text\u201cA\u201d will open a dropdown menu where you can select font colorAs you can see, this is all pretty simple for someone who has worked with Microsoft Word. Step 5: Start Growing Your Blog Now that you have set up your blog and know the basics, it\u2019s time to make your blog successful. Many beginners struggle at that point, thus I\u2019ve put together a handful of guides to get you going easier.

In short, a blog is a type of website that focuses mainly on written content, also known as blog posts. In popular culture we most often hear about news blogs or celebrity blog sites, but as you\u2019ll see in this guide, you can start a successful blog on just about any topic imaginable. Bloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a \u201ccomments\u201d section where readers can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your readers in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader. This direct connection to the reader is one of the main benefits of starting a blog. This connection allows you to interact and share ideas with other like-minded people. It also allows you to build trust with your readers. Having the trust and loyalty of your readers also opens up the door to making money from your blog, which is something I discuss later in this guide. Should you start a blog?  One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style. In addition, you don\u2019t need to be an expert on your topic in order to have a successful blog. For example, readers of a cooking blog don\u2019t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all. To be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic. At its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Choosing a topic that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. Writing about more than one topic is totally fine too. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your readers interested. So why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons: Make money from home. Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a blog post and then continue to make money from it long after the blog post is written. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.Share your story. A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.Recognition for yourself or your business. No, you probably won\u2019t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest blog post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.Find a community. Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a blog post and people comment on it. This is a great way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.How to sign up for WordPress hosting at Bluehost For beginners, we recommend the cheap Basic plan because it packs plenty of power for your fledgling blog.

I found it was helpful to start on a free platform though as I could find out whether blogging really was a fit for me.

            "answer_text": " There are lots of platforms you can use for free to start your blog, from WordPress and Blogger to Medium and LinkedIn. The first question you have to ask though is this: Why are you starting a blog? If it\u2019s for fun, I recommend Medium as it\u2019s easy to use and requires zero setup on your part. Just create an account and publish whenever you wish. If it\u2019s for business, then you need to re-think how you\u2019re about to proceed. Are you blogging to establish your authority? Are you hoping to promote your business? Or are you planning to monetize your blog content? If any or all of those things are true, you cannot proceed with a free blog. First, you do not own a free blog - it\u2019s a free subscription somewhere that can be taken away from you at any time for any reason. If you\u2019re just blogging for fun, there\u2019s not much risk there. But if you\u2019re working hard at creating content to build a business and suddenly it\u2019s all gone, that should be a terrifying and paralyzing thought. Note: this is not dramatic hype designed to irrationally frighten you. Posterous, a free blogging site like Tumblr that was bought by Twitter and was the home of 4 million bloggers was ultimately shut down. At least those users had some notice and time to grab their content! Others whose accounts have been incorrectly flagged and suspended on various platforms aren\u2019t as lucky. Second, a free blog designed to build authority or make money will perform extremely poorly. Because your audience can tell you\u2019re using a free platform. Just ask yourself, when was the last time you bought something from a Tumblr blog post? The Best Way To Start A Professional Blog If you plan to use your blog for business purposes and want to set it up for success, there\u2019s a process you\u2019re going to need to follow. And it\u2019s going to require a minimal investment on your part. You need to determine: Who Is Your Blog For?What Is Your Blogging Voice?What Platform & Host Will You Use?How Often Will You Blog?What Will You Blog About?How Will You Grow Your Audience?How Will You Monetize Your Blog?This is something that I\u2019ve written about and taught about at length. I actually put together a primer to help you navigate these questions: How To Start A Blog: The Ultimate Guide. The point here is this: taking a few extra days or weeks now to think hard about what you want to accomplish and the best way to get there will save you tremendous amounts of time and energy in the future. Rather than waste time using a free platform that has no long-term potential, or writing about topics that are off the mark, you can make sure that your blog gets the best possible start from Day One.

            "answer_text": "Use Ahrefs to make a blog When I decided to start a blog back in 2008, I had no idea where it would take me. Over a decade later, I can honestly say that starting this blog was one of the BEST decisions I\u2019ve ever made! Mind you, it\u2019s been through a LOT of changes. I\u2019ve had three URLs (a mistake that I learned from), at least 10 different designs/layouts, and updated topics and categories over the years. However, what\u2019s remained constant is having a place to share what I\u2019m best at\u2014writing recipes and teaching online business\u2014that attracts millions of visitors each year. When\u2019s the best time to start a blog? NOW. Yes, now. Like, today. Even if you don\u2019t have 100% clarity on what you want your blog to be or look like, that\u2019s ok. It will constantly evolve, grow and change with you, and that\u2019s a good thing. Here\u2019s why now is the best time to start a blog: Google loves history: 70% of all web traffic comes from organic Google searches. Meaning, people land on a webpage from searching on Google (not from social media or another link). And, Google loves a good blog post with HISTORY. That means that the sooner you start blogging, the more time you\u2019ll have to build that history. Imagine if you would have started your blog a year ago\u2014or even six months ago! You\u2019d have all that history under your belt.Your blog will grow and evolve with you: I can\u2019t stress this enough\u2014no one really has their blog 100% figured out from the beginning. So many people tell me they want to start a blog, but hold off because they aren\u2019t totally sure what their niche is or how to blog. We all start that way! Once your blog is up and running you can make as many tweaks as you want. Let it grow and evolve with you. Clarity comes from ACTION, not just \u201cthinking about doing it someday.\u201dOnce you have a blog and start to gain traffic, your options are endless: There are tons of ways to monetize a blog, either through selling your own products or courses, utilizing affiliate programs, allowing an ad network, or doing sponsored posts. But here\u2019s what most people miss: get the blog up and running before you decide which of those you want to do! Getting your blog up and running is what will allow for the rest of those things to happen. Don\u2019t put the cart before the horse. Start your blog now. Also, if you happen to already have an online course or business, that\u2019s great. You can start blogging now to increase your organic reach. My online courses get thousands of free leads via organic Google searches landing on blog posts, and you can, too.Now that you\u2019re ready to start a blog, you have two options: Do it yourself. It\u2019s actually pretty easy, and I give you the exact steps below. I had no money when I started so I literally did it all myself. I just Googled each step or used the free tutorials on the provider\u2019s website and made it happen.Outsource the technical piece of getting up and running. This has become so much easier over the last five or so years. If the tech stuff stresses you out, or you just can\u2019t figure something out, you can hire someone inexpensively on Fiverr or Upwork to do it for you.Whichever you choose, here are 10 steps to get you started. I suggest doing one each day for 10 days if you need to squeeze this in on the side. Or, you can really get all of this done in a day if you sit down and binge through it. If you do it yourself, you should be able to start a blog for around $100 or less. You\u2019ll have to pay for hosting (the big server that \u201chosts\u201d your blog) and a few other elements, but in general, most things are free or very inexpensive to start a blog. Steps 1-9 here are all (mostly) one-time things. Sure, you\u2019ll update your design over the years and may upgrade the technical aspect, but most of these are things you just have to do once. From there, you\u2019ll just be on step 10 (the fun part!)\u2014writing posts to update your blog. ",

            "answer_text": "You can start a free blog on several platforms. But most of them come with several limitations. However, you can still succeed blogging for free. I\u2019ve seen countless people do that. And most of them did it using blogger.com. The popular FREE blogging platforms you can find around are: Tumblr Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free. WordPress.com: Create a free website or blog Free Website Builder | Create a Free Website | Wix.com Medium \u2013 Read, write and share stories that matter There are several other free blogging platforms. But I advise you to stick to either WordPress or Blogger. Most preferably, Blogger. I will explain why I prefer these two platforms and why you must too. There are basically four things you need to purchase when you start a blog HostingDomain namePremium themesISP Data Plans: I had to include data plans. It costs more than what some hosting providers charge.While you can avoid the others, Paying for data plans may be unavoidable. Also, depending on what you really mean by the word FREE. FREE to you may mean not paying for any of the things I\u2019ve mentioned above. To another it may be a little different. For this guide, I will take it that you don\u2019t want to pay for Hosting, themes and domain names. Domain name: Both WordPress and blogger provides you with a free blogname.wordpress.com and blogname.blogsopt.com respectively. So, you don\u2019t really need to buy a domain name before you start publishing. Hosting: Your free blog is attached to any free platform you choose to blog on (subdomain). So, you don\u2019t need to purchase hosting. Themes: All free platforms provide you with a wide range of free themes to choose from. So no need to purchase any theme. Depending on what you want to achieve from your Free blog, my WordPress vs Blogger review provides answers to all of your questions. I will go over a few important points here. Free WordPress Pros: Largest community of bloggers in the world.User-friendly dashboard.Beautiful free themes.Free blog setup and maintenance.Cons: You can\u2019t use custom themes and pluginsBlog monetization limitations: AdSense as we all know, is the biggest contextual advertisement company in the World and the first option for most bloggers. However, you are not allowed to add AdSense codes to your blog.Upgrade is really expensive: When eventually, you decide to setup a custom domain on your free blog, use custom domain themes and pugins, you have to upgrade from the free plan. But it is quite expensive for anyone not earning much online.Blogger: You can learn everything there is to know about blogger in my Blogger review. I will still go on and highlight a few important points here. Pros: Owned by Google.Wider range of monetization options: AdSense and Blogger are both owned by Google. So to sign up with AdSense using your free blog is really easy. All you have to do is play your own part by developing your free blog properly and writing quality blog posts.Free custom upgrades: You can use custom themes and domain names without having to pay a dime to blogger.Custom themes are way cheaper compared to WordPress.SEO friendly: Even free blogspot blogs rank very high on Google. Provided you write quality articles that actually deserve to rank. By default, your free blog is automatically added to Google Search Console and sitemaps are generated, all for FREE.Cons: A smaller community of bloggers compared to WordPressDefault themes not so fancyLook of the dashboard not very appealing.From the above points, I have made it obvious that the best option for you if you are looking to make money blogging for FREE is blogger. But truth be told\u2026 There are several limitations that come with blogging for free. You get to abide by several rules and regulations, terms and conditions.Most free platforms do not permit promotion of affiliate products.You can easily get banned without any warnings if you violate any of their terms and conditions.On blogger, it is very easy to stay safe blogging for FREE though. My advise is, your FREE shouldn\u2019t be so FREE. Upgrade your blogger blog to a custom domain. You don\u2019t have to pay anything to Blogger to do so. Your Question is not very clear, though. you didn\u2019t make it obvious what your blogging for FREE aims are - whether to get readers or to make money online. Whichever it is, I hope the answers provided to your question prove sufficient. ",

            "answer_text": "Pick a blogging platform. When I say \u201cplatform,\u201d I mean the software you\u2019ll use to run your blog. You\u2019ve got lots of options: WordPress, Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace to name just a few. WordPress is your best option if you want to start a blog on a platform that\u2026 Is beginner-friendlyMakes blogging as easy as writing an emailAllows you to have your own \u201c.com\u201dHas no monthly fees (you only need a host and a domain name)Comes with 5,000+ themes to suit your style, andGives you the power to make money from your blog one day,Choose a host for your blog. Assuming you\u2019ve chosen WordPress as your blogging platform (smart move!) your next step is to choose a web hosting service. Hosting explained in 10 seconds: Your blog is just a bunch of files. WordPress is the software you create them with. And hosting stores those files so they can be viewed through the web. TL;DR \u2013 Without hosting, nobody will be able to see your blog online. Decide on a domain name. A domain name is just the address people can find your blog at, like \u201cwww.yourblogname.com\u201d I recommend you get the .com if you can, as it\u2019s easiest for most people to remember, but it\u2019s ok to get an ending like .net or .co if your first choice isn\u2019t available. Set up WordPress (the easy way) Good news: now that you\u2019re logged in WordPress is just sitting there, waiting for you! On the first screen you see, you\u2019ll be asked to pick a theme. I recommend you skip this step by clicking the link below the pictures of themes, as I\u2019ll be showing you how to explore more (and better) options later. If you DO choose a theme now, you can always change it later without any problem. Choose and customize your design Finally, the most fun part: it\u2019s time to choose a design you are really excited about. In WordPress, they simply refer to designs as \u201cThemes\u201d \u2013 don\u2019t let the language throw you. The good news: You have over 5,000 FREE options to choose from! The bad news: With so many options, you can spend HOURS going down the design rabbit hole. Start writing! The good news is that if you can use Microsoft Word, Pages, or Gmail, writing a blog post in WordPress is just as easy. After that, it is all about attracting people with quality content and using all available traffic tools to help you out create a community around your blog and hopefully grow even more. ",

Today I am working with more than 20 websites but still, I have 4 websites in Blogger. And I am making a decent income from these 4 Blogs also. I just use some custom domains in these Blogs, which costs me Approx rupees 1000 per year per Domain. If you don't want to use a custom domain, then also you can create unlimited Blogs for free, You will get a Blogspot .com Domain with it for free. That means, Your website or blog name will be like yourname.blogspot.com. If you want to change your blog URL yourname.blogspot. com to yourname. com then you need to have a Custom Domain, otherwise, you don't need any custom domain, any hosting, or any other things. you can create unlimited blogs by your Email id for free.. For custom design, you can use free Blogger templates also, and for Email Marketing, you can use Feedburner Free email Subscription service also, its also a free service given by Google. So, at last, I can say You that it is possible to start a blog without investing a single rupee in 2020 also. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are just getting started with the idea of having your own blog and want to spend no initial investments, then you definitely should start off with Blogger.com To be honest, there are many blogging platforms which offer users the ability to create a free blog. I would not recommend any newbie blogger to start a blog with WordPress. I\u2019m not saying that WordPress should not be considered as your first blogging platform. In fact, WordPress provides you with very cool themes which you can customize and plugins which you can install to run a fully professional running blog. Having a blog with Blogger is free and it does not have any limitations. I am dedicating this article to all newbie bloggers who are new to the world of blogging and would like to start understanding the basics of running a blog. What is Blogger? Blogger is a blogging platform powered by Google. It offers you the opportunity to start a free blog. Blogger formally known as Blogspot is a Google-centric blogging platform. You may wish to check out one of my previous articles about the 4 Powerful Steps to Building a 6 Figure Blog. To start a free blog with Blogger you really don\u2019t need to be tech-savvy as you need very little technical knowledge. To tell you the truth, there are only two top reputed blogging platforms for this 2019 and they are Blogger.com and WordPress.com Why Blogger is Easy-to-Use? Unlike WordPress, where you are required to install different plugins and go through their complicated dashboard, Blogger does not need you to install anything. This the main reason Blogger has become a great alternative for any newbie blogger to start-off free and with no what so ever initial investments. Below the illustrated table, I have highlighted the Pros and Cons of using Blogger as your first free blogging platform \u2013 The Pros: Blogger is free of cost and you get a free subdomainThe blog is hosted by Google and you do not worry about anythingThe Blogger interface is very user friendly and you don\u2019t need any basic technical knowledge of running a blogYou only need a Google account to set-up bloggerWith Blogger you can create a blog with no investment and can monetize it with Google AdSenseThe Cons: The Blogger subdomains do not look professional so you have to pay for a custom domainBlogger is not suitable for professional blogging as you do not have enough controlThe Blogger theme can only be customized to a limited extent. There is very little what can be done.Other email accounts can be used to create a blog on BloggerAs Blogger is a free platform you have to follow the terms and conditions. In case you violate any terms your account can be banned and shut down.Creating Your Free Blog with Blogger First, you would need to head over to Blogger.com and login using your Gmail account. To open a Gmail account is Free and you are not required to pay anything. Once you are logged in, click on \u201cnew blog\u201d.  Creating Your First Free Blog with Blogger The next step in the process is to create a name for your blog. This will be the title of your blog. Note: You will be required to select an address for your blog to be hosted under the Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free. site URL.  Creating a Blogger address Note: Blogger requires you to comply with EU laws for posting a blog post in their platform. The EU laws require you to give European Union visitors information about cookies and data collected on your blog. In many cases, these laws require you to agree with their EU terms and conditions.  Blogger.com EU Compliance Agreement Terms & Conditions Once you have agreed with the EU Compliance Agreement, it\u2019s time to create your first new post with Blogger. I started my blogging journey with Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free., and later I migrated to WordPress. I will be shortly coming up with a detailed WordPress Guide. My final thought here would be that Blogger is a platform for newbie bloggers which you can use to gain experience. If using the Blogger platform seems too basic for you and you want to take your blog to a professional level then you can always use WordPress. Hope this helps, ",

            "answer_text": "Different host sites offer free blog hosting. For example, I have for years had a blog through Google\u2019s blogger for absolutely free. It just has the blogger extension http://www.tracylkarol.blogger.com - I used to have one with WordPress but someone took my name and the .com when I let it expire. It was a paid blog. Now I\u2019m trying to migrate everything back to WordPress paid with a Tracy Karol, Author site. But you can also use a free WordPress site with the WordPress extension in it - I have that as well, as a .com, it\u2019s just not set up. Personally I think WordPress is the best blogging software, either free or paid, and if you start free you can always upgrade. Mine is minimal right now because I\u2019m not tech savvy and the host isn\u2019t offering all it said it would, so I need help from a designer once I can afford it. But as you get the hang of it, tagging and key words are really simple and it seems to rank higher than Blogger. Good luck! Be prepared to spend some time getting it set up. I do offer help with editing. And as I said, the free version is fine to start. Though if you expect a lot of traffic, I\u2019d buy the eventual domain you want. It\u2019s not expensive and well worth the trouble of losing it to someone unscrupulous later. I still can\u2019t buy my name back. ",

            "answer_text": "I will tell you exactly how to do it. Even if you have a very little money or not at all to spend on the blog, still you can start a blog and that too like a professional one. You just start a blog on blogger or wordpress. Blogger.com gives more freedom to build a blog or site as compared to wordpress.com without charging you for hosting. (You will thank me later).  So after creating the blog on blogger, you will have an address like this: example.blogspot.com and its fine. You can still create your blog template and layout like professionals and also can place the adsense ads on them and start earning. But if you want to remove .blogspot.com from you domain to make it sound more professional or trustworthy like a brand, then you will have to spend a small amount to buy a domain for your blog or site.  GoDaddy and Bluehost provide domains that costs around $10/yr. But you may get lucky to grab a deal at a low cost. I bought my domain Twenties Madness from GoDaddy at just $1.49 for the first year. After you bought the domain you will have to set it up for your blog. This is easy and you can see how to do that on this blogger help page. That\u2019s it, no extra money needed. And I have created my blog exactly the same way as described above. ",

            "answer_text": " Having your own blog is the new \u201cnew\u201d. If you love to write and do not find any suitable platform to do so, do not sit and repent. Start your own blog and use it to do something good. And, make money alongside. It\u2019ll make you a better writer and will help you express yourself better. Now, the question is: What should be the first step towards creating your own blog? The obvious step you\u2019ll take will be to go for a Google search and type: How to create your own blog: And, the long list of searches will confuse you completely, as they did to me some years back. Everything comes from practice and making mistakes. So, I, after making I-don\u2019t-want-to-remember number of mistakes in the first step itself, have reached a situation where I can suggest you what to do and what not to do. . . Before even starting a blog of your own, the most important decisions that should be taken, that people generally ignore, are: The PURPOSE for having a personal blog (and not going for posting your thoughts on social media to get everyone\u2019s cries)Theme of your blog (called the niche of your blog)With this clearer blog vision, you are partially ready to take a step ahead. Do not worry at all if you don\u2019t know any, literally any, kind of coding knowledge, websites, blogging, software, plugins etc. I\u2019ll make everything easy moving further so that you can also have a blog to display your writing skills. For that, stay hooked to this. Setting up a blog is a task of dedicated 30 minutes. Choose a blog platform If you\u2019re alien to the blogging world, this must have been the first time that you\u2019re hearing the word \u2018WordPress\u2019. Yes, I said, W-o-r-d-P-r-e-s-s. Remember this word, for your blogging life ahead. WordPress is a FREE and open source system where you can create your own free websites or blogs. Why do I recommend WordPress? You can get your website hand-coded but for some reasons like high input cost, time and risk of inefficiency and bugs, I\u2019d recommend not to do that. Instead, go for WordPress and make use of the possibilities in front-end design, user-friendliness, cost-effectiveness and the fun part of playing with the plugins. WordPress is not only for small blogs, it has given brilliant websites like Vogue, Mercedes Benz, CNN, New York Times and so much more. Just pick up a design and start decorating your blog, in your own magical way. Other than these, you have following Free options to select from: Tumblr Tumblr will keep you engaged if you involve with the communities with your blog. Blogs at Tumblr are very interesting and super-easy to use. You can use different post styles to share images, videos and quotes, rather than the plain write-ups with had-to-be-followed designs. It is free but includes advertising, that you cannot escape. LinkedIn As well-known to everyone, LinkedIn is a professional website which helps connect people in similar professions, blogging is a new dimension that it provides. If you have a good following on LinkedIn and want to reach out to your customers to expand your business, you can choose this path confidently. This social networking site although allows you to build your own blog, it doesn\u2019t allow everyone to access your content. I\u2019d recommend this place only if you want blogging to affect your business and you don\u2019t really care about the design part of it, because it doesn\u2019t really offers any. Squarespace Squarespace provides the blog building service starting at $8, giving way to a lot of theme options by which you can get beautiful designs without even coding the special features. But, in case you love to code, this is also possible with this. It is a hosted service, not available for free. Medium Currently the neatest and simplest way to start blogging, Medium it is. It is natural to feel that the power of customizing the design of your personal blog and make it more attractive is not given at the hands of the writers. The only areas where the writer can work with the looks are the text, quotes, images and other media. With limitations, a Medium blog can still perform better than others because if it gets loads of recommendations, it can then gather a huge traffic by showing up on the Medium homepage. Isn\u2019t that a great news? Contentful If you are a developer and also need a blog along with it, this will be fun for you. I\u2019m saying this because this doesn\u2019t have anything ready in the name of a blog. You can only create an API of your blog by using Contentful and the interface has to be coded by you, The Developer, to get your posts published from the cloud to the blog. All the tools are provided but the end result from Contentful will be a code representing your blog. The good thing is that you have complete power to give your blog your own design.

The title of a blog post is the most important part, which all new bloggers don't pay attention. Make sure all your blog posts have a catchy title. If you want to rank on google then make sure your title of the blog post attracts peoples attention and they click it.  First, Let's Make A List of What We Need To Start A Blog In 2019 A Creative MindA free Hosting With 0 issuesA beautiful Pro ThemeA Seo Friendly Domain NamePro Bloggers TechniquesA Creative Mind (#1) So what's the big deal with a creative mind? well, let me remind you this is 2019, and you, of course, need to be a creative person in any niche you like, because of the competition. no ones like a copy pasted shit. and obviously, Google will not rank anyone with a stolen blog post.  I know everybody likes something and what can be a better topic then what you like. First, you need to know that you create your blog over one specific topic because Google gives priority to websites that based on a single topic. I mean if you are writing about tech then do not publish any blog post about entertainment. And I know that no one knows everything so, do some research on the internet about that topic and highlight their points, get ideas, but please do not think that about rewriting anybody's blog post, it will not help trust me. The most important fact is you need to satisfy your reader with the most relevant information. Trust yourself that if your competitor wrote a blog post highlighting 10 points, then you can do better, make that blog post 40 relevant points and destroy them. A free Hosting With 0 issues (#2)  Today I am talking about free stuff so I am being honest with you that it's not the best hosting but its certainly, not the worst. If you have money the go for the Bluehost. it's the best hosting in my opinion, but if you need a free hosting with 100% uptime it's blogger.com trust me. you will not get huge features like WordPress but you will have everything you required to start a Pro blog. Now I Am showing Step By Step process how to create a blog with google. Read more For Step By Step process A Beautiful Pro Theme (#3) we are in blogger so their ready-made themes are now kind of sucks and do not have a professional look. So you should start using custom blogger templates, there are lots of free custom bloggers templates out there but choose only responsive templets. I tried many templates in the past and I have a favorite template. and it looks like a pro-Wordpress theme. its called Helio  You can view this theme demo Here: Live Demo Now if you like this template, here is the good news, you can use this template for free. To download this template follow these steps A Seo Friendly Domain Name Finding a domain name is not so easy at all, because first if you have a name in your mind, and you check that domain name and you find out it's been taken. Also if it's not taken how do you know if its Seo friendly or not.  Think about a domain name that is relevant to your blog's topics and within 6-10 characters. Remind a smaller domain name with relevant keyword is a good SEO friendly domain name. And a good domain name sure helps to rank better in google. Pro Bloggers Techniques (#3 important) Amazing Content Ideas It does not matter that if you are a new blogger or old, one day you are going to out of ideas or out of topic, So what will you do that time? should you wait for new ideas to pop up? well, the answer is simple. If You don't publish blog posts continuously I mean if you wait like 20 or 30 days, Google will think that you are not serious about your blog. As a result, you will lose your ranking in google. So what to do now? Trending Topics Have you heard of google trends? if you don't, google gives us a free tool to see what topic is trending on Google. what you have to do now is go to google trends and first choose your country and search for the niche that your writing in your blog and see which blog posts are in the top, read that blog post and create a better version of that blog post.

I personally don't like Blogspot for because it's not that customization as WordPress. If you want to start blogging for free, you can.  There are many free domain extensions, most are blacklisted in Google and some search engines. But the domain .GA is a good one. You can register it for free at Freenom.com. And after that, you need to host your blog somewhere. I know some of the best free hosting companies providing enough space and bandwidth for you. That's the best to get started. Some of good free web-hosting services: Ultimate Free Host- Free Unlimited Hosting | Ultimatefreehost.InFree Hosting No Ads- FreeHostingNoAdsNZ Free Web Hosting- http://www.freewebhost.co.nz/ 000Webhost- https://000webhost.com You can use any one of them. But I used to use Free Unlimited Hosting | Ultimatefreehost.In which worked best for me. It's online 99.9% of the time and I face no server issues with it. I used it for about 8 months without any problems. And for domain, I prefer .GA for better ranking and for not being blacklisted in Google like the .TK domain is. You can also install WordPress within minutes at Free Unlimited Hosting | Ultimatefreehost.In with auto installer- Softaculous.  I hope it worked. Regards, Bright Joe (Copious Blogger - Turn Blogging Into Online Income)  I use Godaddy for Hosting and Domain! ;)  ",

There are other websites such as WordPress , Wix, weebly, etc. but blogger is best. Some people will suggest you for WordPress, which is really a good site but you have to pay for custom domain. So better start with blogger.com and earn some money then you can easily upgrade to WordPress site for better controls over your site. Let me tell you Three important points to keep on mind :- Create your unique content. Basically, if you copy the content from anywhere then google can easily detect you and will never show advertise on your blog.Never write something which hurt other people's feeling. It will not help you to grow much.Once you start blogging, then keep your post consistent, upload them regularly. Learn doing SEO. It's very helpful.",

With zero-knowledge of anything, you can\u2019t do anything. Information about your selected niche is a must. If you think you have enough knowledge about your niche, you are good to go. Let me list out some of the ways you can start blogging for free. You can use Google\u2019s free blogging platform: Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free. But, you have to compromise with your web address. It comes with a default name. For example: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.blogspot.comYou can use WordPress.com: Create a Free Website or Blog. (Best of all). But, the same with this, have to compromise with your web address.There are a lot of people who hire people to write content for their blog. Find them. (TechCrunch, Medium, HubPages, Write.as and many more). Made that easy for you.Above can be the easiest ways to start blogging. I\u2019m saying it again. You should consume a ton of content always if you start your blogging carrier. Otherwise, there will be one point where you will have nothing to write and you will give up. Also, another major thing you will need is patience. Blogs take time to grow. I hope that helps! Thank you! ",

But it is important to do this exercise because it will keep your interest and also your readers.  Top the Topic Once you determine your goal your first hurdle of choosing your topic will be solved because ow you can choose a relevant topic at ease. Your challenge will be to do some research and bring out something new in your topic which will make yourself and your readers learn some new things. Trigger the Title The most important thing on any of your new post is a having an influential title. Having a worthy title will attract more readers to the post; a bad title will keep people from ever seeing the great post you wrote. Right Writing Now it is time to write, this is where you just let go of any sprints or how you want to say this or that, Just Write! You already know your topic, title and your goal. Now it is just about you getting what you want to say on paper or screen, say it with personality and be done. Imagine Images Now that you have your title and post done, you want to find an image that fits. Be imaginative here, but make sure the image still fits the post. Read and Edit It is always good to read your posts which will give you insights about your writing standards and will continuously evolve your writing skills. ",

Yes, blogging is definitely free. It\u2019s not that you have to start a blog by spending thousands of rupees on domain name and hosting (if you are very serious about your blogging and you want to make a career out of it, then you definitely need to put money in blog, free stuff won\u2019t work there) If you are like me who just wants to write for fun and share knowledge than Quora is the best platform. I have used various platforms like Medium, Blogger, WordPress, but I have finally settled on Quora. This platform has good organic reach and you don\u2019t have to worry about running a social medial mage to keep your blog running. Also it had good statistic tools that will tell you which topics are getting more attention from the users. If you have a good reach, only then you can move towards creating your own blog or else spending money for a blog without any return on investment makes no sense. Thanks for the read. ",

Now I know a ton about them, and my blog\u2019s doing pretty well \u2013 I receive more than 30,000 unique visitors per month which makes me consider myself someone you could listen to and learn from when it comes to building your own blog.
