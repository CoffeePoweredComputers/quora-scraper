            "answer_text": "Firstly, good work - pat yourself on the back! Secondly, put it in a drawer and forget about it for a few weeks. The first feedback you need is your own, but at this point, after four months, you're too close to read your script objectively. So walk away. This isn't the easiest process, but it's necessary to get some distance and clarity.  Use the downtime to read scripts and watch movies in the same genre as your screenplay, or even better, immerse yourself in something completely different. Once you've had a decent break, pick up your screenplay and a pen and do an objective read.   Be ruthless. The old editor's saying is \"kill your children\" for a reason - you need to cut out anything and everything that simply isn't working, no matter how in love with it you are.Check your structure. Pull it apart scene-by-scene - does every scene have a purpose? Is it in the right place? Is the pacing right?Cut your dialogue. Make sure your characters say only what they need to, and no more. Put a mark next to any dialogue which is too on the nose, and come back to it later.Scrap lengthy description. Less is more. Choose your words wisely.Once you've had another pass at it, the next step is to have someone read it for you. There are several ways to do this; A reading service. You can find several decent reading services on Google who will provide lower-level coverage on your script.These services can be pricey and should be approached with caution, but can be worth it to test your script on an industry-style reader. Join a writers group. Use Meetup.com to find other screenwriters in your area. Find other writers of a similar level and experience to trade scripts with, and provide notes for each other. Critiquing other scripts will make you a better writer.Do a table read. This is one of the most valuable experiences in the script writing process. Gather a group of friends - who don't have to be writers - assign one as the narrator, and divide parts between the others.Don't assign yourself a part - your job is to hear how the words sound aloud, to take notes on what does and doesn't work. You'll be surprised at how different the screenplay will sound being read back to you.  Take on the feedback, draft some more, repeat the process.  As eager as you are for the world to read your work right now, a little patience is prudent. You'll be glad you waited once you're sending out the final draft to competitions and agents. ",

            "answer_text": "Agree with all the above. I will assume for the sake of argument that you have actually written a movie that is relatively commercial, will appeal to actors, directors, and financiers. The key thing here is to start learning how to be objective about your own material. To accomplish this you need to put the draft down for a week at least and work on a different script.  When you read it again after that week, you will be shocked at the changes you instinctively want to make. Go through the draft line by line and make those changes as you read. You might find you throw out the third act or ditch a character completely. Take the time you need to follow through with those instincts. If something raises a red flag for you, chances are it will with whoever reads it, so make the changes that are needed.  When that process is complete, put the draft away for another week. When you come back to it, go through it again, making changes as things bump. After a few rounds of this you will be hard pressed to make any changes after putting it down for a week. Now your script is ready to be read by someone else.  Give it to someone who understands the business. Friends and family are usually a waste of time because 90% of the time they just want to 'support' you and this is not how any business operates. Once you get notes from industry people you trust, implement the common notes, think about the others, make your own decisions. Now you need to get it to a producer who wants to make this kind of movie. Use every connection you have. Research. Ask questions. Go online. All the answers are out there already. If the script sucks you will get nowhere fast. If it's actually good, people will move it forward based on its own momentum.  Now start writing the next one, because even if you've written a great screenplay, the odds of it getting sold and made are still ridiculously low. Hopefully the next one is better. And the next... and the next... ",

            "answer_text": "The next step is to write another screenplay. Then another. Then you bring everything you've learned back to this one and see all the places where you messed up. Early screenwriters tend to get caught up in making their first attempt perfect, but no matter how many times you rewrite it, there isn't that much you can do to improve it because you aren't that much better than when you finished the draft. You learn much more by writing something new. When you turn back to this one, you'll be amazed at how bad it is. But that's a good thing. It means you're now in a place where you can make it that much better. As to getting notes from friends and family, they won't help you very much. Even if they like parts or don't like other parts, they won't understand what it is that is or isn't working. They are also not likely to understand how to read a screenplay. Reading down as opposed to across is something most people aren't used to. One of the most important skills you need to hone as a writer is the ability to critique your own work and the only way I know to do this is to write, write, write, which makes you a better writer, which makes you better able to critique your own work.

            "answer_text": "I finished my first screenplay a couple of months ago and I sent it off for a couple of competitions, but ultimately parked it on the Black List website. I was really proud of what I wrote and really happy with myself that I did it, but I don't have any serious aspirations for it nor did I ask for any real feedback from friends and definately not family. I'm not really into paying to have people review it either although, it might be helpful only if the people reviewing it isn't Sally Smith who by day serves coffee for the executive and by night reviews scripts. It was very much like a learning experience, almost exactly as it was when I made my first video game doing all the art, music and coding myself. It never went anywhere either however, the second one changed my life as I was hired by a certain game studio. So perhaps find people or a community in which are willing to read your script and offer feedback either free or by keeping a very close eye on the amounts they charge for such a thing.  Even entering contests too, the costs can easily add up unless they're free. As you said after  \"four long months\" you might be better off just letting it rest for a while but still try to get some feedback on it while it rests. I've begun my second one applying all that I learned from my first project so to me, I don't consider my first script to be a failure in any way whatsoever. So maybe the best thing to do after writing your first script, is to begin writing the next one and the one after that. ",

            "answer_text": "Pat yourself on the back, then take the next step and get the movie made. You WILL NOT be able to sell the script you\u2019ve written, ever. But you can let your friends and family read it, and get it reviewed by a few online script repair services. Once you\u2019ve done that, rewrite the whole thing. Then storyboard it, gather up all your friends who want to make movie, and shoot it. Have fun! After the movie is done, write another one, then another, and another. Write screenplays and make movies with your friends until you improve to the point where you make a good enough film to actually enter it into one of the bigger film festivals. Who knows? Maybe if you keep working at it, I might eventually see one of your movies - maybe, in ten years or so. ",

            "answer_text": "Excellent! Now you find an experienced filmmaker to bring it to life. You should definitely be re-writing once pre-production has started. Make sure the story is interesting and the dialogue is solid. I\u2019d recommend helping out with the casting, even better if you have actors already in mind while you were writing. I have seen great actors poorly casted, and it shows. Make sure all the technical aspects of production, especially cinematography and sound, are checked off. Once the movie is done, take as long as you need to have the film edited, and recut several times. Show the film to select audiences, take feedback and continue to recut. Many times a successful film turns out to become something outside of its initial intentions. ",

            "answer_text": "You can get free peer feedback on sites like Zoetrope Virtual Studio  and Page on amazon.com.   However, you'll probably have to give feedback in order to get it. You can also hire a script consultant (like me, for example) to tell you what you need to focus on in your next rewrite. If you haven't already done at least one rewrite, IMHO it's too early to show it to anyone else (even a paid consultant).  For this process, consult books like How to Make a Good Script Great.   Also, make sure you've got the easy stuff like format right before asking for comments.  It looks lazy if you don't bother to clean up your own mess. ",
