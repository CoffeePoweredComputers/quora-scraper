            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s define the initial area of the circle as A. Then the new circle will have an area of 0.75*A.I\u2019ll call the inital radius of the circle r. The x in the undermentioned equation stands for the factor with which the initial radius is multiplied to get the radius of the new circle. (So r*x is the radius of the new circle.) Thus the equations we get are(1) A = \u03c0*r^2(2) 0.75*A = \u03c0 * (r*x)^2 = \u03c0 * r^2 * x^2Rewriting (1) and (2) givesr^2 = A/\u03c0r^2 = 0.75*A/(\u03c0*x^2)(For the sake of clarity, \u201cr\u201d represents the radius of the initial circle and not the one of the new; see my definitions at the beginning.) And we know that r^2 = r^2, so apparently A/\u03c0 = 0.75*A/(\u03c0*x^2)I want to find the value of x. Multiplying both sides by \u03c0 and dividing both sides by A gives1 = 0.75/x^2So x^2 = 0.75x = sqrt(0.75) The circumference of the initial circle was 2*\u03c0*r. The circumference of the new circle is 2*\u03c0*r*x = 2*\u03c0*r*sqrt(0.75) Hence the decrease in circumference is2*\u03c0*r - 2*\u03c0*r*sqrt(0.75) = 2*\u03c0*r*(1-sqrt(0.75)) As a percentage of the initial circumference, this is equal to2*\u03c0*r*(1-sqrt(0.75)) / (2*\u03c0*r) * 100% = (1-sqrt(0.75)) * 100% \u2248 13.4% Hope this helped :) ",
