            "answer_text": "Teen love and break ups can be very serious stuff. Teens want to believe with great certainty that they are adults. In fact, they are experiencing brain changes dramatically in how it is used and how it functions physiologically. It is a timeline. when many teens feel strong emotions. The most common reason for teens to develop depression and/or suicidal ideation, revolves around \"breaking up.\" it is very common for the most healthy teen to feel a lot of angst on any given day. As teens develop and begin to differentiate a sense of self rather than echoing parental views, which is normal development, some teens can feel pretty desperate for a close relationship with any peer. It is the nature of teen relationships that each person is differentiating and growing differently. They don't yet understand that relationships will morph over time into a break up and then the building of new relationships. During the break up the emotions can run very high and people can feel strongly that: \"I will never find anybody that will love me more than this person.\" It's one reason that teenage pregnancy is such a common complication of youthful dating. Both sexes are curious about how sexual intimacy works. There is a lot lot lot of peer pressure to not be a virgin. Problematically lack of experience and peer pressure contribute to early intimacy being tense. Most teens are not prepared for responsible sexual precautions. There are a lot of myths around ways to prevent pregnancy. (You can't get pregnant the first time. I'll pull out in time. Next time we'll be more ready. It won't matter just this once.) The only sex education quite a number of teens have is checking porn sites. This of course does not encourage an understanding of sensuality, pregnancy prevention, or an understanding of normality. Age 15 is the typical year that most young people have their first sexual experience. Therefore you can see that teen time periods are fraught with a lot of emotional na\u00efvet\u00e9. it is really important for parents to provide some actual and informed information about sexuality. You can giggle all you want both parent and child, but you need to be very specific about talking about body parts and what kinds of prevention you will help your child aquire. Shaming a teen will only result in them sneaking around. Better to be able to openly talk about it, even if you giggle, then to leave your teen with a void of information on a very important topic. No, many school systems do not teach anything about it anymore. It is not covered in biology class. It is not even covered in anatomy and physiology class. Mom and dad this is up to you. Many teens do not understand that the purpose of dating is to meet a variety of people and experience a number of personalities so that they can be discerning about their choice of a life partner. Your first teenage love is highly unlikely, but not impossibly, permanent. Parents need to be alert to provide competent information to your middle school, and certainly by the freshman year of high school. Other pieces of good information can include things like explaining how dating helps you sort and learn about how other people are. That getting stuck on one person early in life, will prevent a young person from developing their own list of traits they would be looking for in a permanent partner. Especially around the teen years. Remember the highly emotional state of teens and be alert for depression, giving away cherished items, or any implication that they can't live without ________. ",

            "answer_text": "Apart from most of the teenage couples that break up, patch up and break up every month or two, there are still a few couples that really try hard to make things work. For instance, let me tell you about my friend here. She and her partner completed three years together this November. Yes, they started as Nibba and Nibbi and even I was apprehensive about their relationship since it had engendered a few problems between their families. They had been studying in the same school for two and a half years. But after that their parents made them change their schools.  Now, the girl's parents are very strict, especially her mother. I wouldn't call her behavior compulsive or disturbing or anything, but yeah, it's complicated. So she doesn't get to use YouTube, phone, or anything. But yeah, she uses a small phone to talk to her boyfriend sometimes which her classmate gave her once to keep. So all communication that happens now between them is through this little phone. - Anyways, when the two individuals changed their schools, they obviously started facing some issues which couples in LDR usually do. Not meeting with each other physically, relying mostly on texts and calls, etc. My friend met a guy in her class who wasn't particularly attractive but who talked and behaved like my friend's boyfriend. He reminded her of him. And so she told me once, looking very tensed: \u201cUgh! I'm not sure! Yaar(friend), I'm very anxious. What if I start falling for this guy just cause of the distance. I won't, I know that. I can't, I know that. Still. I'm supremely worried.\u201d I assured her everything is going to be alright. Her partner assured her he trusts her immensely and they both promised to each other they will make it work. They're still together and going strong. - So yes contrary to the popular belief, teenage love is indeed serious at times. It just depends on the two individuals, their will and efforts towards making the relationship work. \u2764 *Image from Google ",

            "answer_text": "At the time very serious. A lot of teenagers (myself included) had crushes on girls both outside of school and in one case in my Form, although that was never going to last -:) However I did have a very serious desire for my best friend\u2019s sister for a long time and to me that was very serious (in my mind), although looking back I hardly cuddled her -:) That said I have seen friends, and in particularly one of my sister\u2019s friends who had a teenage love with a boy in the form when she was 14, and hey presto at the age of 21 they got married, and as far as I know still married. So at the time teenage love is very serious, and in any case teenage relationships vary from child and adult ones as attitudes change through the transition of teenage years, indeed early 20s. I have seen cases where very intensely involved late teenage years, (16\u201320) then suddenly go in different directions. Hopefully they haven\u2019t married. I know at 16 (I had just left school) I was working with a girl who I had a very strong feeling for, but because I worked with her was caught in a double jeopardy and wasn\u2019t sure how the employer would react. Indeed we did often walk home with her after work, and talk about the days work and sometimes my hand did fall in to hers but would suddenly let go as I didn\u2019t want to feel that I was imposing myself. Actually I was very fond of her, but too frightened to say so. I left the bank and we went separate ways, but my feelings were still very strong. About three years later, I moved in to my own flat (where I still live) and remembered her address and wrote to her. We met up a few times and I invited her to dinner, as well as going to equine events (we both enjoyed horse shows and show-jumping). So in my mind I thought that she was aware of my feelings for her, even if I never penetrated her, and it really was a kiss and a cuddle and holding hands as we went around the events. Shock time came when I wrote to her to invite her for the whole weekend at the show as I had won a week end away in a competition and the hotel chain was just down the road from the event site. She had told me that she couldn\u2019t go as she was going away that week end with her friend. Now she had a number of old school \u201cgirl\u201d friends who she went away with, and she was also close to her sister and they went on weekends away, so I thought nothing of it. I knew that Patsy (in her own words) didn\u2019t like her own company (being alone for long) so these weekends away seemed to make sense. A few weeks later I got a letter from her saying that she had a great time with this \u201cGuy\u201d ! It had never crossed my mind that she was dating another bloke; that is not to say that she had betrayed or \u201ctwo timed\u201d me, but she had never mentioned him before. To make things worse she told me that at the weekend he had proposed to her and they were indeed going to get married. It really did break my heart, and I did write to her telling her that I had loved her very much, but recognised that it was my fault for not saying, but though she knew. I did receive a reply to both letters and her last one I still have in a drawe with the photos we had at the horse shows when we were teenagers. There is rarely a day that goes by that her name doesn\u2019t cross my mind or sometimes wonder whether she had children, indeed where she is. I have never tried to find out since I don\u2019t want to be a catalyst for a divorce or friction in her marriage: I just genuinely hope that it did work out for her. So this shows that \u201cteenage love\u201d in mid-teens can be very serious and often does lead on to very long term relationships, even if in my case it went badly wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019m a 16-year old guy, and I\u2019m gonna explain this from the guy\u2019s perspective. First, loving someone is love, regardless of age. So, onto the main point: When a guy falls in or crushes on a girl, she\u2019s the most beautiful and precious person in your life. Sometimes, it gets so serious that your own family wouldn\u2019t mean anything to you at the moment. Also, remember that hot girl you saw last week? What happened to her? She looks like a frog. NOBODY IS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MY (soon-to-be) QUEEN. you guys get the point, right? Also, if you know her on a certain personal level, and you meet her occasionally throughout the week, meeting her is the only thing you\u2019ll look forward to. Also #2, Let\u2019s say, she\u2019s gone for a weeklong trip or something. You won\u2019t see her for a week, but you\u2019ll be able to DM her or something, right? Well, you\u2019re wrong. Trust me, I\u2019ve been through this a few times now. This is when you\u2019ll understand what the terms \u2018 dying to see you\u2019 and \u2018slowly dying from inside\u2019 really mean. Oh boy, during the entire time she\u2019s gone, you\u2019ll suffer, and it\u2019s gonna be a loooong time before you see her. Or at least that\u2019s how it feels. Once you get to see her again, you\u2019ll be the happiest guy in the entire known universe. The hardest part? It\u2019s when she, for sure loves someone else (remember, she might not be dating you and it could be just you having a crush on her). You obviously hate that guy with all your heart, and you may even have an evil wish for him to get hit by a truck or something. But at the same time, you gotta respect him for being perfect enough to win her heart. If you truly love her, then you want what is the best for her. If going off with the other guy is what she wants, let her go because you really love her. Hehe, I think I got too serious ",

All you want is time to be with him and everything else is something to endure, something to get through, something you put up with until you can be together again. I mean, finally. For a teenager what you want is to erase your otherness. We are one. It\u2019s you and me, baby. You and me against the world. An adult has at the very least gained the faint notion that you and I are individuals, independent, and it\u2019s precisely this sovereignty that will make our relationship viable. Adult relationships change you, but you are largely already you. Teenage relationships shape you. They take place during your formative years so create inexorable paths that you will continue to tread on years later. It\u2019s in this way that teenage relationships all but seal your fate. I see now. I see now where this began. When you are a teenager you are more angst than answers, more dream than life, more in full contact with that dazzling, sacred core of you that is immortal. That guy you were with when you were a teenager will walk away with an understanding of you so true and so raw that no one else will ever again see you quite that clearly - not even you. You will lose your secret diaries, your lack of outlook, that particular vigor, the free-fall, your sky-dive, your fearlessness - and someone else will remember. It\u2019s for all these reasons that I would consider teenage love as serious as a heart attack. Except that thanks to modern medicine, a heart attack is something you can recover from. ",

The feelings I had for him were indescribable. I was a sophomore, he was a senior. He would drive me home from school, and just around wherever. He loved me too, I just know he did. But he went to college in a different state. I followed suit, but went to a different college near his. By that time, I had a new boyfriend and eventually he got a new girlfriend. He ended up marrying that girlfriend. On my birthday. I tell ya, that was not an easy wedding to attend. I took a taxi outta there as soon as I was good and sauced up, probably about an hour into the reception. Maybe two hours. Maybe a half hour. It was the most pure love I had ever felt because up until the point of him telling me he just wanted to be friends, I had never been heartbroken. I had no fear of rejection up until that point (still not that I really give a shit now). When I told him I liked him, he bent down and kissed me for about 5 minutes. Told me we would talk tomorrow about what we would be. He never came around. I went on vacation for a week with my family, and when I got back he had only IMed me that he did not want to ruin our friendship. I waited, and waited, and waited. When I got my first boyfriend, I told my first love before \u201cI love you. I am head over heels, over the moon, crazy in love with you.\u201d He still wanted to be friends. Therefore, I agreed to date my boyfriend. ",

It should be noted, however, that teens are more likely to be like manic people, so they will have more extreme feelings over a shorter period of time, but these feelings feel real to them and should not be dismissed as that then dismisses the person feeling them. Just know that manic people don\u2019t tend to stay in love very long. Hot fires burn out quickly. This shortness of interest, does not mean that the feelings are not \u201cserious\u201d though. Many people are like this (manic love/infatuation), they just don\u2019t have their parents myopically watching every thing they do. The main thing is to make sure everyone uses protection: Rubbers (disease prevention, birth control) and birth control pills. As long as no diseases are contracted and no pregnancies are created, teenagers can move on freely and go about their manic shenanigans no harm no foul. And eventually, barring bad genetics, they will become emotionally mature and encounter serious and long lasting non manic love. But until then, do not discount their feelings\u2026 And\u2026 DON\u2019T BE WEIRD AND ILLOGICALLY \u201cMORAL\u201d AND RELIGIOUS AND STUPID! ALWAYS MAKE SURE TEENS USE PROTECTION!! ALWAYS!!! Crazy manic people need protection the most of all of us. ",

            "answer_text": "If only we could bottle up the energy teens put into their love we could make a fortune. How serious is it - - for some teens it is deadly serious. Check the stats on teenage suicide and see how many died due to relationship problems - either with friends, girl friends or parents. Teens have only hot or cold - they do not understand lukewarm. Everything is to the extreme - so when a rupture occurs in their lives they have no middle ground on which to stand - it\u2019s all or nothing in their immature minds. When counseling American teens in the High School in Bangkok, Thailand I was shocked to learn how often teens thought of suicide. Since I was a \u201cgreen\u201d counselor I went to my supervisor and reported my find-ings and he confirmed that he was getting the same data/results. These were affluent, well behaved teens who had a lot going for them \u2026. fortunately only one attempted suicide while I was there, and survived. All in all Davidson, I would have to say that we owe it to our teens to take THEM very seriously. Emotions to the wall notwithstanding, we must work to stay in touch with our young people, even when they push us away. Stand in the shadows if you must, but don\u2019t abandon them. They are priceless. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Everybody takes love so seriously. Like it is this sacred thing that nobody should touch unless they\u2019re willing to die for it. Teenagers often do not feel like this. They experiment. They are dead serious about love one week. Like their significant other is everything to them. Like they wouldn\u2019t see the point of living if it weren\u2019t for them. It may very well be serious in this moment. Then, the next week, they break up and hate each other\u2019s guts and they are jsut as serious about that as about the mutual love they shared before. After some time, the feelings fade, they go back to their normal routine, or meet someone new, and eventually forget about that other person, it becomes just another memory. They realize they weren\u2019t serious about it in the first place. We make bad choices. We associate with shitty people. We start relationships that are bound to fail because the only thing that holds us together is a warped, romanticized idea of a very common feeling. But that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a part of growing up. ",

            "answer_text": "Teenage love can be very intense and very serious. Especially if sex is involved. A lot of people have been killed because teenagers were having sex and they tried to stop them. However, extremely intense relationships tend to burn themselves out. In the old days, parents and grown-ups in general tended to scoff at \u201cpuppy love\u201d and in many cases they were right to do so. But there may have been some envy involved because they new that they would never again feel that intense passion. If I were dealing with two teenagers who said they were in love, I would make sure the girl was on birth control, but other than that I would let nature take it\u2019s course rather than intervene. Unless, there were really good reasons for doing so. For instance, if I had a teenage daughter who claimed to be in love with some thug who as a teenager already had a rap sheet, I would intervene for her own protection. She might hate me for it at the time, but someday she would grow up and realize that I might have saved her life. I would also intervene if he was a user or purveyor of illegal substances. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe most of the time they are not really ready for it, and don\u2019t understand what they are getting involved in, and what it takes to make it work, and they are really not ready for how they will feel when they break up. They sometimes regret it later. I fell in love with my first love and the only person I ever shared deep mutual love with when I was 15. I don\u2019t know that I was really ready for it, or understood it. I definitely didn\u2019t fully appreciate the relationship, or what it took to make it work\u2026when we broke up I attempted suicide (even though the reason we broke up was because I betrayed her WITH her best friend\u2026and I guess I was upset enough that I thought she should have seen me betray her and see me die on the on the same day). How ready do you think we felt for that breakup? How would she have felt if I died? Do either of us regret it? NO, we both treasure that time together. I wouldn\u2019t trade that time together with her for anything I have seen or experieced from then until now. Were we actually really in love? You can bet on it, it was as real as it gets. We were just talking about it recently, 37 years later. But I promise you the odds of that conversation happening were very low; the odds of me dying in that suicide attempt were higher\u2026and it probably would have scarred her for life. Be careful when you are betting on those kinds of odds. We did get back together more than 5 years later, fell in love all over again and got engaged but never married. Didn\u2019t talk for a very long time after that 2nd breakup. We are friends again now\u2026and she is 100% supportive of me transitioning, and she follows on Quora. I gaurantee you we beat the odds on those things too. ",

I have seen many kind of relationships , some were serious , some just for timepass\u2026 Some fall apart while some are still going strong. I would give you some of the examples: Firstly, the boy and girl met in class 9th . Both of them come from diff. school and came into relationship in first 2 months itself.Even after diff. streams in class 11th , they were pretty strong. They broke off after 1 year of leaving school.Maybe due to religious differences or due to diff. College timings.Second, the boy was studying in the same school from the past few years and girl came up in 11th standard. Their relationship started within one week and died as soon as school ends.Third one ,girl was in school and boy in college and they were in relationship for about 1 and half years and ended before girl\u2019s board exam started.Fourth one, girl and boy met in class 11th and started as friends which gradually convert to relationship and going pretty strong.And there are many more diff. examples, will gonna add soon.Thankyou. Edits are welcome. ",

Regardless of the AGE of the person involved, a sense of \u201clove\u201d can appear to them and to others to be \u201cserious,\u201d when it is actually more accurately described as a short term, or even a self-delusion based infatuation. Since younger people are more likely to guess incorrectly that they are \u201cseriously in love,\u201d many people have ERRONEOUSLY concluded that ALL teen age emotions should be essentially laughed off. But since things which happen at that age, can result in anything from minor disruption to people\u2019s lives, to permanent distortion of them, to extreme anti-social acts (including suicide and murder), I tend to take teenage love seriously as AN EVENT, at least.

Google has quite a good analytics and I think I also have some good reason why not to fall in relationship in teenage it's normal it happens but if you have the option to come out from that just be out I am assuring you that you will not regret and I am assuring one more thing that you will regret if you don't come out So continuing For more click----> Blog | iiw-\u00c3 ",

They don't look down the road to see consequences of whatever drastic action their fantasy presents. Parents, especially these days, face the horrors of the children they spoI led such as threats of running away, pregnancy and sense of entitlement. This doesn't include not finishing their education. To make matters worse, parents also may face raising their grandchildren. I would say that teenage love can be downright scary. Of course, it depends on the teenager. Some are more logical than others. How did you raise yours? ",

You look older based on your avatar. So, I\u2019m guess you have a young daughter or niece (or son, etc.) who is involved with another young person. Don\u2019t attempt squash this relationship or else you\u2019ll just trigger rebellion \u2014 and this could be even worse.

You remember him while you sleep. He everyday comes on your dream. Unknowingly you become a shayar.  Teenage love is the most purest form of love and can't match with any of the feeling in this world. Suggestions are always welcomed. Yours, Prachi Khetan. ",

Few people marry the people they date in highschool, and many of those who marry end up in divorce. Teenagers are immature and full of hormones. That\u2019s not to say some teenage relationships are not meaningful. But not advisable to take it too seriously. ",

Most of the time teenage love doesn\u2019t last because as we grow into adulthood our lives change drastically. We go to college, start careers, ect. ",

They make think they are in love but for simple reasons such as: They like the same music, same hangout places, same ideas about life and such! True love is loving this person for real, establishing a love routine, making long term decisions, the more serious life roles. I thought I fell in love in grade 5, was his girlfriend till grade 10, no sex yet. He moved away in grade 11 and missed him. Went to visit him just outa highschool, we had sex but wasn't true sex. Then yrs down the road when I was 38, I visited him again. I was happy we were still friends and that he was happy yo hear from me. I never had sex with him this time and I could tell he was upset with me. Now he and i barely contact each other anymore. Thete that's my story lol ",
