            "answer_text": "Yes. It\u2019s a long-term business model that\u2019s not going away anytime soon. Also, it\u2019s important to note that, when speaking about blogging and profitability, profitability comes from the industry and niche you are in. In other words, bloggers aren\u2019t competing with all bloggers that have blogs on the internet. Bloggers are only competing with the bloggers in their particular niches. I\u2019ll try to explain this in a way that makes sense. At the top level, there are industries like fashion, technology, health and fitness, dating and relationships, finance, pet care, toys, and so on. Within these industries, niches exist. A niche is a group of people that exist within a larger industry. These groups of people have problems or issues they want to solve \u2014 and are willing to pay for such a solution. Let\u2019s say a marketer is in the health and fitness industry. Well, this marketer might specifically focus on \u201cMEN WHO WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT.\u201d Another marketer in the health and fitness industry might decide that she wants to focus on \u201cWOMEN WHO WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT.\u201d Do you see how you can have two bloggers can work in the same industry but work in two different niches? Each of these niches could be broken down even more. Blogs are written about niches. The niche a blogger is in determines all kinds of things \u2014 like what products he or she may sell. When people are first getting into this business, they look at competition as a bad thing \u2014 but it\u2019s really not. The more profitable a niche and industry are, the more product there are to promote. The more products there are to promote, the more opportunities to make money. Think of it this way. In order to get your foot in the door of a profitable niche, all you need to do is to start off with ONE PRODUCT that people are looking for and find a set of keywords that\u2019s not too competitive . With all of the profitable industries and niches out there, this is easy to do. All it takes is some research. Speaking of research, knowing how to conduct proper research is one of the first and most important steps to building a successful blog. It\u2019s the foundation upon which everything else is built. It\u2019s how you find your customers, what motivates them to buy, your keywords and all that jazz. If you\u2019re interested in an internet marketing-training program AND community that teaches you all about how to become a successful blogger and provides you with a place to meet like-minded marketers that can help you out along the way, I recommend you check out Wealthy Affiliate.

            "answer_text": "Blogging itself is not a business. But blogging can be used for money earning and business promotions. You can become an influencer to talk about different brands through your blogging platform. And the brands may pay you for that.You can have your own product or service that you may promote through your blog. That can help in user engagement and lead generation for business.",
