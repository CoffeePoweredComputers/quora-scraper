            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re going to write a book, there\u2019s no such thing as mastering grammar \u201cenough.\u201d You need to master it pretty completely, so much so that you write in perfect grammar without giving it a second thought. Automatically. You not only know when to obey the rules, but when and how to break them without appearing illiterate. If you\u2019re not a native English speaker, this is an incredibly difficult task, although Joseph Conrad, a native Polish speaker, wrote brilliantly in English and so did Vladimir Nabokov, a native Russian speaker, among others. They not only mastered grammar, they acquired a vocabulary that would have been the envy of any native English speaker. This is exceptionally difficult, since words not only have definitions, but nuances and connotations, and are easily misused by someone who has not genuinely mastered them. The odd thing is, these \u201ctechnical skills\u201d are the least part of good writing. They are the foundation, but not the building. The building is made with imagination, grace, creativity, insight and other skills that can\u2019t really be taught. ",

            "answer_text": "Start writing it in whatever way you can and complete it. Believe me, completing it is the hardest task. Now if you have money give it to a manuscript assessment agency for editing and they'll do the required job and a lot more. They'll charge anywhere between 15k to 40k depending upon the size of novel. For a 60000 words novel its approx 15k. If you don't have any money then you have two other options. First and the easy one is to give it to a friend, relative or anyone you know and trust for assessment. Secondly you can improve the novel by reading lot of other books as you'll come to know about various ways in which people write and your vocab will improve too but this may take some time. ",
