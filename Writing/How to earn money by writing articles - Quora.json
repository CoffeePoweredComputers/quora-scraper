There may be many people who say to start a blog and practicing writing and to be updated for SEO's and etc etc. So now I want to give opportunity to some one who want to try their passion or luck. As already I have experienced the situations where I was not good at made me try at least for one more time. So I thought of a plan where everyone can try. So if one need to get good understanding I have plan of action for them Rewrite news articles for any news website on regional language or EnglishTry to find a niche where you are good in writing and start to write for that niche.Start a blog and take actions on what your strong point is and get some traffic.Finally monitize it with any of the online sources to earn money.But don't think to write for someone without any experience because there are lot of people around to fool you. So here is what I can do for you if you want to start your day with first step I mentioned above. What you will get from me? A place or platform to write articles.Get some knowledge on how to write a articleIf you write for me you will be a author at one of the news site and soon or later your articles will appear in Google showing the author was you because Google trusts author too along with the news source.Finally if it worked out you will get your pay when site makes money. (As of now it is still a new one so I was in search of author's)If you like the idea join me and give it a try and have some fun. Note : I'm not a company to issue paper work. I'm just one of you. ",
