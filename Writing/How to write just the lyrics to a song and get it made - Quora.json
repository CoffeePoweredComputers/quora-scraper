            "answer_text": "There are many people who only write lyrics for songs. You can try to rewrite lyrics to already written songs but you may run into issues with copyright if you try to make money of the finished product. I\u2019d recommend trying to find a composer in your area that wants lyrics and try out some joint songwriting. There have been many famous duos of composer/lyricists throughout the history of music that have been very successful at their craft. ",
