            "answer_text": "Many years ago, I worked my way through The Artist\u2019s Way and began to write Morning Pages (3 pages longhand every day). Over the years, the practice has shifted from Morning Pages to Before I Write Pages. I sit down in a comfy spot with a nice journal and a favorite pen (sometimes a fountain pen with a 24k gold nib . . . and sometimes a pen I got free from the library that writes really well) and write. It\u2019s a very freeform, stream of consciousness talk with myself about my story, my setting, what my characters are doing, what might happen next, what problems they might encounter. There\u2019s something about the feel of quality paper and pen and the hand-brain connection of writing in longhand that inspires me to write (and I feel like I write better if I follow this routine).
