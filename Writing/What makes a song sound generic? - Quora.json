            "answer_text": "Doing what other people do, copying what they have done. Writing lyrics that make no sense. Writing lyrics that are pointless and meaningless. Repeating a line over and over and over an over and over and over and\u2026 Leaving a song unfinished. What do I mean by that. See above. These are elements of an unfinished song that is recorded and foisted upon the public. An unfinished song has lyrics that \u201cmiss\u201d in a way that means the choice of words is awkward or just doesn\u2019t quite work. It has musical passages that aren\u2019t well thought out. Allowing the mediocre composition, both musically and lyrically. Okay, apart from this, here are other elements that make a song sound generic\u2026 Production. Using the same guitar, drum, vocal, keyboard, and other sounds everybody ele is using. Using the same effects others use. Mixing songs exactly the same as others do. Compressing everything just like everyone else does. These are just a few of the things that make a song sound generic. There are others, but the descriptions wouldn\u2019t mean anything to you unless you were a recording engineer or studio musician, as I am. ",

            "answer_text": "There's nothing wrong with a song sounding generic. But for the most part, the same summer beats that are used every years are getting annoying. It's relaxing at first but over use can really get annoying. Mumble rap? It's over used and it's not even a good type of rap. Spanish type beat? It's really nice and all but almost all the top idols insist on reusing this beat and it's irritating. Honestly, these are just my opinions. If you wanna make a song, go ahead. Don't worry too much over it. The best songs are created with a free mind and body so don't fret yourself. ",
