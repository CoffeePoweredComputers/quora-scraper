            "answer_text": "The argumentative essay is a genre of writing that requires the student to investigate a topic, collect, generate, and evaluate evidence; and establish a position on the topic in a concise manner. This will involve using of counter arguments so as strengthen your essay and persuade your readers. Argumentative essay assignments generally call for extensive research of literature or previously published material. Argumentative assignments may also require empirical research where the student collects data through interviews, surveys, observations, or experiments. Detailed research allows the student to learn about the topic and to understand different points of view regarding the topic so that she/he may choose a position and support it with the evidence collected during research. Regardless of the amount or type of research involved, argumentative essays must establish a clear thesis and follow sound reasoning. Below is an example of an argumentative essay. High school students should be required to do community service. a. Helps students to become well-rounded citizens. b. A way for students to give back to their communities. c. Looks good on college applications. Counter-argument-some might claim that students should spend more time studying or participating in extra-curricular activities, but there are ways to serve the community that do not take much time, like taking canned goods to a food bank or helping once a year at a back to school supply drive.
