            "answer_text": "No! but yes, in a different way. Reading books is not guaranteed to improve grammar, although it\u2019s a way to improve grammar. The point I want to raise is that if you read books and books and don\u2019t think and concentrate a little on their composition and structure, then there is very little chance that you will learn anything. As Einstein said, \u201cThe person who reads too much and uses his brain too little will fall into lazy habits of thinking.\u201d And we don\u2019t want that. Winston Churchill in his auto-biography explained the method of teaching which his teacher used to teach him grammar at Harrow. His teacher used to write a long complex sentence on the board and would then start to analyze it, by underlining different parts of the sentence, for instance, underlining subject, predicate, fragments, verbs, prepositions, idioms etc. Not only for grammar, my teacher, Sir Tufail Shah says that, \u201cDon\u2019t go by the form, go by the function.\u201d It means that a word which looks like a preposition, may or may not be a preposition, so be careful and go by the function. So, it\u2019s not about lot of books, it is about sentences, words and their function. Another tip is that whenever you change a word in a sentence, ask yourself that what information is added or subtracted. Because, every word has its own identity which will usually have an effect on its\u2019 sentence every time it changes. At the end, I apologize for wasting your time because I didn\u2019t suggest you read any specific book \u2014like novels of Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, Pride and Prejudice, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, short stories like Chicken Soup for the Soul, and writers like Roald Dahl, Jack Canfield, Brian Tracy\u2014 this is your choice what to read. And one thing, don\u2019t be smug, think with your mind. And at the very end, I am sorry in advance if you find a grammatical mistake in the text because coincidentally, I am also smug. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely! But there is a catch: the books have to be well-written! That eliminates a lot of books. The other problem is that even a well-written book does not explain the whys or the hows of the language and grammar it is written in. But - by reading well-written books carefully, you will pick up the sound and sense of the language, and eventually, mistakes will just \u201cnot look right\u201d (or sound right). It would be good to read a good grammar book. One I can recommend is Amazon.com: The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition (7447521286972): William Strunk Jr., E. B. White, Test Editor, Roger Angell: Books This book has been in print, and has been sold, every year since it was first printed - in 1911. ",
