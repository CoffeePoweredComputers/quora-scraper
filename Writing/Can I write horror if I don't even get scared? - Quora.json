            "answer_text": "Yes. Many people think horror is about scaring the audience, but it\u2019s not. Horror is about evoking a primal emotional discomfort. Fear is one way to do that, but it isn\u2019t the only way. Horror is about finding what makes your audience anxious, what speaks to their sense of foreboding or unease, and then expressing that\u2014often through allegory or analogy. It\u2019s about creating a mood. It\u2019s about evocation. Fear is an easy way to do that (and sometimes a cheap way; jump-scares in movies make me roll my eyes). But it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be about scaring you, even though there\u2019s often a feeling of dread that accompanies horror. Kafka\u2019s The Trial is horror, but it uses confusion and powerlessness, not fear. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is horror that plays on themes of despair. You can paint horror with a palette of claustrophobia, angst, disillusionment, desperation, uncertainty, or dread. However you do it, horror is personal. Effective horror doesn\u2019t necessarily have to frighten your audience, but it does need to make them feel personally invested. It needs to evoke a genuine reaction. You can do that by pushing buttons we all have. Body horror pushes the button of bodily integrity, wired into our collective psyche since the days when we were prey almost as often as we were predators. The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers push on fear of dissolution of the self. Alien wasn\u2019t just a monster movie; it specifically targeted sexual angst. (It\u2019s one thing to be eaten by a monster; it\u2019s another to be impregnated by one!) You can write horror if you don\u2019t get scared, but you\u2019re unlikely to write effective horror if you don\u2019t feel anything. You need to find some disquiet that you can project onto your audience. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t get scared of my own work, even though I\u2019ve been told some parts are dark and suspenseful. So, yes, you don\u2019t have to get scared to write horror. In fact, it\u2019s probably best that you don\u2019t. That way, you can analyze horror literature and learn how to write good horror stories. Much of horror is a morality play. In other words, people often get killed gruesomely because of something they\u2019ve done. Other horror \u2014 Silence of the Lambs, comes to mind, which is more of a suspense\u2014deals with the deaths of innocents and how the hero will overcome the ghastly evil. In Jaws, the skinny dipper, a child who ignored the warnings and went out too far, and Quint get killed because of their behavior. Martin Brody survives because he is the \u201cwhite knight\u201d who must slay the \u201cdragon\u201d (the great white), along with Hooper, who provides the critical information about sharks. Some horror stories have a sense of despair associated with them. The protagonist has son great sin he or she eventually atones for. The original movie, The Poseidon Adventure, is actually a horror because almost everyone dies, and even the hero must atone for challenging god. Edgar Allen Poe wrote many horrors where the protagonist has a deadly secret. So, I know this is long-winded, but you see what I\u2019m getting at. Writing horror is like writing any other genre. Read a lot of good horror and analyze why it is good. Watch decent horror movies (not necessarily slasher films, unless you really want to write that) and analyze why the story works. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Uhm, I\u2019d like to think so.. The truth is, writing mostly comes from your ability to imagine. This includes scenarios, characters and so on. And although being scared helps, it\u2019s not really a factor that would or should stop you from writing in the horror genre. However, most people who write the best horror flicks or even the best horror movies had some level of reality to it. This means that, the writer (the original writer at least) had his horror characters come from a real world experience. It could have been a dream, a metaphor for a real life bad experience or something else entirely. But it\u2019s also important to note that, original ideas about writing horror stories can also come from you and your ability to imagine the scariest of situations. So to answer your question, I\u2019d say it\u2019s very possible. But try to make sure your idea for the writing comes from an original place as that helps in developing your characters in the long run..\ud83d\ude07 ",
