            "answer_text": "Comprehension (understanding), reading, writing and speaking / narration are all interconnect or inter-dependent with respect to any language. I have another question. How good is your fluency in your mothertongue or any other language. Because all of us have migrated to English at a later years because our academic pursuit exposed us to English and we became aware of virtues associated with learning English. We still have the mother tongue as our base language. Many of us think in mother tongue and translate the thoughts in to English. Only in case of professional sphere we do not use our mother tongue. The reason is the professional knowledge was delivered to us in English and we internalized it in English so we reproduce it in English. Any way I will give you a generalised English language improvement plan. You may trim it to suit your needs. There isn't any easy way to learn any language. Whatever may be your linguistic background it does not influence your learning ability. With respect to English and your 1st language there could be some similarities and dis-similarities between English and your mother tongue or 1st language.. But it is so with any two languages. Make a beginning and assess the speed of progress. You can devote requisite amount of time. It is a hard work and will need persistent efforts. If you are willing to take this path then please read on. Be proud of your linguistic background. Your emotional quotient resides your vernacular / 1st language. STEP - 1 Try and build proficiency in vernacular language. This sounds weird???~ Profiency of vernacular language forces you to look for appropriate words in the new language you learn. Besides in the initial stages everyone forms a sentence in the vernacular language he is comfortable with and translates it to ENGLISH. STEP - 2 Know the Common Ground across languages Capabilities of Imagination / structuring a narration / relevance of tenses and such other concepts get transposed from the 1st language to the new language you learn. In this case it is English. STEP - 3 Learning any language has following components. 1 - Grammar 2 - Vocabulary 3 - Comprehension ability 4 - Narration / Composition Close look at the above topics Grammar - Syntax + Tenses Vocabulary - Meaning + Usage Comprehension - Ability to understand written / spoken Narration / Composition - Ability to Express thoughts / Opinions + Structure the narration written or spoken Take a hard look and find out which of above needs to be strengthened. If you need help in grammar then I wish to suggest you to seek help or join tuition class. It will save time. Of course you can do it on your own. But it will need more time. STEP - 4 Read novels / Short Stories /Essays. Reading will help you internalize linguistic skills, improve vocabulary. I can suggest a few books. Many of the titles mentioned below have been re- written in simple language. Choose the level you are comfortable with Tomswayer - Mark Twain Jungle Book -Rudyard Kipling My India - Jim Corbet Malgudi Days - R. K. Narayan Wings Of Fire - A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Robinson Crusoe Gulliver's Travels Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea -Jules Verne Around The World In 80 Days - Jules Verne Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austin Tale of Two Cities - Charles Dickens Sherlock Holmes Ashenden -Bernard Shaw Pavilion of Women - Pearl's Buck Oxford's Reading Circle Series Check books by following authors Jonathan Swift Bertrand Russell Ravindranath Tagore Sudha Murty Ruskin Bond Arundhati Roy Chetan Bhagat Earnest Hemingway Edgar Allen Poe Keep out academic / science / technology books. They have very small literary footprint and do not help in linguistic sphere. STEP - 5 Take a note of the sentences that appeal to you or you find interesting. Pay attention to the construction. Similarly note the new words along with their usage. Usage modifies the meaning of the words. Example This book is a shade better than other books. The lawyers arguments exposed shades of hypocrisy. \u201cWait for me in the tree shade, after you come out of the tuition class\u201d, said my mother. The lamp shade fell of due to turbulent wind. STEP - 6 Word game - How many words can you find with 'eat' letter combination. Heat / neat / seat / beat / peat / treat / meat / sweat / cheat / death / threat / create/ wheat great / \u2026.?. Try your luck with different letter combination. 'ust' Dust / Just / Trust /Burst / Must / Lust / Crust / Gusts / Custard /Bust \u2026.??? Coin more challenges like only verbs and see how many you can find. Words with similar themes Danger / risk / endanger / perilous / Pernicious / Precarious Try and use the words in meaningful sentences. Challenging words which look similar but have different meaning. Discreet / Discrete - Wave / Waive - Stare / Stair You will have to struggle with such words to internalize. STEP - 7 Choose a simple topic of your interest or a simple story. Write three to four paragraphs. Read them and see if you can improve the narration. Search for more appropriate words. As you practice choose a bit difficult topic and continue. STEP - 8 Stand before the mirror and narrate / speak about some topic without referring to written text. If you can get an audience then get it. Speak with your colleagues / friends as often as you can. Watch documentaries with sub titles. Watch TV News Channels /Discussions Read news paper editorials Journalism is a field with vast spectrum. You will have to decide the specific area you want to work like politics, socialogy, crime reporting, sports, theater, performing arts, films and TV international issues, science and innovation, and gain knowledge in that specific area. Write on any topic of your interest and publish it in digital media or approach newspapers for publication. As far as technical writing is concerned you need to be precise. You must be well versed with scientific terminology. Example - speed / velocity + Heat /Temperature / Calories you most know the scientific definitions. It is a hard work but the results will surprise you. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you'll always have an accent, but honestly, as a native English speaker, I think foreign accents are really cool! But if they are too strong they can be hard to understand\u2026 But don't think that, that makes your English is bad. I'm an American and I can hardly understand the Cockney accent from England, and England is where the English language was created! You could try to learn some English slang words to make your English sound more like a native English speaker. People can also tell you aren't a native English speaker if you speak too properly, also. For example, if you never use contractions like: it\u2019s (it is), I\u2019m (I am), don\u2019t (do not), won\u2019t (will not), etc. people will definitely be able to tell you don't speak English natively. Not using contractions at times can make you sound kind of awkward while you\u2019re speaking as well. \u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d sounds a lot more natural than \u201cYou are right!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d sounds better than \u201cI am here!\u201d you get the idea. You really should look up the slang words for the kind of English you want to speak if you want to sound more like an English speaker, every native English speaker knows the English slang for the country they grew up in. For example, in America, we say stuff like: \u2022 I wanna\u2026 (I want to) \u2022 I gotta\u2026 (I have to. This one makes the less sense to me since it's not exactly proper English to say \u201cI got to\u2026\u201d unless you\u2019re saying something like \u201cI got to meet my favorite band!\u201d But saying \u201cI gotta meet my favorite band!\u201d only makes sense if you\u2019re saying you want to meet them. I know, it's weird.. don't ask me why it's this way, I only speak the language, I don't make the rules for it) \u2022 Creep (you'd use this word if someone was watching you undress from your window or something, someone is a \u201ccreep\u201d when they do unpleasant and weird things) \u2022 Cram (like you \u201ccram for a test\u201d thats the only really context you use the word \u201ccram\u201d for. It means you are pretty much \u201ccramming\u201d information into your head, studying information nonstop without taking any breaks) \u2022 Buck (we have another use for the word \u201cbuck\u201d in America, thats the word for a male deer, but that's another way we say \u201cdollar\u201d. For example, instead of saying you have 20 dollars, you can say \u201cI have 20 bucks\u201d) It\u2019s as easy as an internet search to know the slang words for the English you want to learn. If you\u2019re feeling really ambitious, you could even learn all the English slang words from each English speaking country if you really wanted! Good luck! :D ",
