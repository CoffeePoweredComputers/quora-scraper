            "answer_text": "I prefer the straight up truth. Some employers might discriminate against you because of health but many other who might have ignored you due to not being in the field might look at you. You say technical career. I suggest taking as many relevant courses and even doing some volunteer work in your field so employers know you are current. EG - I have a System Design Engineering degree from so long ago that I would never hire me because technology has changed - unless there was some education or experience that proves I am on top of the current technology. Introverts particularly (which many technical people are) can become discouraged by all the rejection that happens in job searching. Don\u2019t be - hang in there. Treat finding a job like a job. Good luck with it. ",

            "answer_text": "It is an uncomfortable truth that some employers may discriminate on grounds of health - they will likely prefer the candidate who has never been forced to take time off for health reasons (unless it was due to an accident). It\u2019s not really any of their business why you have had to take time out of your career and certainly not at the application stage so my advice would be to simply describe it as a career break.
