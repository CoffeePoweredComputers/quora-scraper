            "answer_text": "I charge more than others have suggested. I create informational content for B2B companies in a small, specialized niche. My clients will find no one on Fiverr who can write intelligently about their company\u2019s products or understands their customer\u2019s businesses. With decades of industry experience, I advise clients on subjects such as what topics to cover, how to re-purpose the material, how to connect blog posts to other content, and when to add content targeted for different levels of the sales funnel. Unless we\u2019re in a get-acquainted phase, I won\u2019t create a single item for a client. I help them prepare a content plan that lists the content types, the topics, and the publication dates. This allows us to create content that aligns strategically with their audience, their goals, and their sales processes. It also frees them from endless meetings about what topics to cover next and then finding someone to write it. I deliver the content consistently, according to the schedule. Before I Write Anything Before I ever write for a client we identify their audiences or buyer personas and explore the interests and challenges of each group. We review their existing content to see what material needs updating and where they have gaps. I have the client explain their sales process. I need to know what happens before they make a sale. Do prospects visit a specific page on the company website, watch a video, attend a webinar, sit through a demonstration, seek input from peers, or something else? Then we can structure the content to encourage movement through those steps that lead to a sale. A Customized Approach If the client is transitioning, we\u2019ll concentrate on content that emphasizes their new approach. Commercial printing companies, for example, are moving towards supporting multi-channel marketing campaigns. We will include more articles about digital print, variable data, and linked campaign elements and less about traditional offset printing. If they attend events such as trade shows, conferences, or open houses we will include supporting content in their plan, timed to arrive according to the event schedules. Publishing in several channels is important too. As Leigh Clayborne pointed out, bloggers post millions of articles every day. Unless a client already has a huge following or they are in a market with few competitors, getting readers to the blog is a challenge. My clients use social networks like Twitter or LinkedIn to get people interested in the articles and lead them to the blog for more information. Some of my clients publish their own newsletters; others use direct mail or paid editorials to attract potential buyers to their websites and blogs. Someone looking to just check off the box that says they published something in their blog might get away with the inexpensive approaches suggested by some of the respondents to this question. If they expect the blog to perform as an active component of the organization\u2019s marketing strategy however, they should prepare to spend more. ",
