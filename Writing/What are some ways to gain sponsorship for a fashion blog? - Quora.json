            "answer_text": "First off make sure you're going into fashion blogging because you love it. If you're doing it to become famous right away, you might want to rethink this. With that being said: The best way to gain sponsorship, is to see what you have to offer these companies. Sponsorships need to be mutually beneficial relationship. With the amount of Fashion Bloggers out there, what sets you apart? What makes you unique? Build your community, get to know other bloggers, comment on their posts, learn from them. Make sure you have a well designed blog and you write strong content. Find your voice.  There's two ways I've found successful in getting collaborations: 1. Doing a blog post on a company, without them sponsoring. If you have favorite companies or brands - write about them for free. Once the blog post is live - shoot these people an email letting them know with a link to the post. Most of the time they are very grateful! Tag them in social media, follow them. Now you're on their radar. This helps to build long term relationships. They'll remember you when they do need to sponsor a blog. If not, that's okay ,you've strengthen your writing and have an example to show other companies of what you can offer. 2. Reach out to companies BUT again, make sure you have something to offer - strong readership, social media followers, high quality photos. Remember, strong doesn't necessarily mean LARGE. If you have a few followers but they love everything you do and are engaged that is appealing to companies as well. Also, when reaching out to brands, make sure they fit your style and  tell them why you'd love the opportunity to work with them. Fashion blogging takes time, I'm constantly learning. Hope this helps you! ",
