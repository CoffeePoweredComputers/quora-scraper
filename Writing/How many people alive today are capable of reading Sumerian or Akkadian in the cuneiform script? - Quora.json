The woman who held it had a Ph.D. in Assyriology and could read both. Her dissertation was about economic relationships in the Akkadian Empire from texts that she had translated. I think she was a bit surprised by how impressed I was by her, since most people have no idea how difficult it would be to learn cuneiform and read original texts in those languages. Being a linguist though, I knew just how brilliant she was to have learned these languages from the dawn of human history. ",
