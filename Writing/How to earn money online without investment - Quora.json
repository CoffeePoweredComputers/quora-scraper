            "answer_text": "I once made $2,600 within a few minutes. No, it was not a drug deal and yes, it was perfectly legal. But first, let\u2019s talk about 4 major mistakes that most people make when they ask a question like this one: They only think of \u201cinvestment\u201d in terms of \u201cmoney.\u201d EVERYBODY has assets that could be used and leveraged as investments. For example, before they became Uber drivers, their cars were not business assets. But once they join Uber, they can make money from that asset. Same with Airbnb. So get creative. Look at the assets you do have, and use/leverage them to make $$$.They only think of \u201cinvestment\u201d as \u201ctheir money\u201d (you can always get others to invest, but of course, you gotta be persuasive)They never consider past investments they made, and thus never leverage such investments (including the trust they built in their social/professional network)They try to be creative from a place of scarcity, of fear, of stress and of negativity. Nothing comes out of nothing. Something comes out of something. So a better question is, \u201cHow can I make x dollars by using my y education, my z experience, and my w skills?\u201d Abundance can only come from abundance.How many ways to make money? Infinite ways. The number is limited only by your imagination (or, more precisely, your willingness to let your imagination run WILD and give you tons and tons of ideas, which you implement, and you then keep the good ideas). I\u2019ve got hundreds of ideas, and will update this answer with them over time. But here\u2019s one: contact the prolific Quora writers, and pitch to them the idea of compiling their best answers into an ebook that you can sell on Gumroad, and you split the profits with the authors (there can be MANY authors in this ebook). Note: The $2600 was a finder\u2019s fee for connecting a buyer and seller. ",

Well, we have good news for you. You can definitely get started in affiliate marketing, even if you\u2019re short on cash. There are just a few things you need to understand first. What is Affiliate Marketing All About? With affiliate marketing, you make money by promoting products and services to your audience members and referring them to the websites of retailers selling those products and services. When someone you refer purchases something or completes an action, such as signing up for a service or an email list, you earn a commission. This marketing technique benefits both the advertiser and affiliate. The affiliate gets paid while the seller makes a sale. Bloggers Use Affiliate Marketing These days many bloggers use affiliate marketing to earn money. You may have heard that some of the best bloggers out there are making as much as $40 thousand each month on affiliate sales alone. Of course, to make this kind of money, you have to have a huge, loyal audience. But what if you don\u2019t have that kind of following? Let alone a blog at all? Can you still become an affiliate? Fortunately, the answer is yes. No Money, No Worries! We want to start by saying that having a blog and website should be your ultimate goal as an affiliate marketer. It is, hands down, the best way to run a successful affiliate marketing business. However, when you\u2019re new to the business and you\u2019re on a shoestring budget (or have no budget at all) there are a few things you can do to start generating the income you\u2019ll need to eventually start your website and blog. Create a Social Media Presence Being an affiliate doesn\u2019t mean you have to become a blogger right away. Instead, you can begin monetizing your online presence through social media. You can do this by placing affiliate links within your posts, updates, and profiles. Social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest and so on are packed with millions of users. You can easily integrate links into your posts and see results. Just make sure to follow the rules and restrictions of these sites, as you technically don\u2019t own your accounts. Be on Facebook A lot of people, in fact, billions of people, are in Facebook these days, which makes it the largest social media platform. If you have an account, you can promote affiliate products on your page. The important thing is to focus your page on a subject of interest to your audience. It could be health, money, fitness, relationships, or pretty much anything else folks are interested in learning about. Be a YouTube Star Have you ever considered starting a YouTube channel? If not, then this is the best time to do so! YouTube is an incredibly effective platform for affiliate marketing and has millions of users. The most successful YouTubers are earning millions each year just by making videos promoting products they enjoy. This is perhaps one of the best ways to become an affiliate without investing in a blog and website. Just know that you won\u2019t likely have very many subscribers in your first few months, but if you keep posting interesting and useful videos, you\u2019ll eventually build the audience you need to succeed. Join an Affiliate Program Once you\u2019ve established your following on social media or YouTube, you can begin to apply for affiliate network programs like ShareASale and Rakuten. These programs are constantly seeking publishers who can promote well. However, to join these programs, you\u2019ll need to qualify, and that usually means having a solid online presence and following. So it\u2019s important that you have quality content to be considered a good source. What Should You Do Then?  If you\u2019ve set your mind on becoming an affiliate, there\u2019s no way to go but up. And if you\u2019re truly determined, you should always approach your work with the best practices and strategies in mind. Building an audience is critical, as well, so follow the rules of the trade. And when you do become a good source of information, expect people to recommend the products you write about. Your opinion will become gold in the end. So to answer the question, can you do affiliate marketing without money? The answer is a resounding yes! It just takes time, patience, opportunity, and determination; the rest is history. It\u2019s never too late to start! ",
