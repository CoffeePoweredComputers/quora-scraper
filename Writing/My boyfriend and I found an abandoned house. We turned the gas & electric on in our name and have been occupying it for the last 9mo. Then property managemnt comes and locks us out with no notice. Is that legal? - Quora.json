            "answer_text": "As others have pointed out generally as a squatter (at least in the US) you have very little rights. There is the concept of adverse possession: State-by-State Rules on Adverse Possession but that\u2019s generally measured in years and almost certainly not going to apply in your case. That said, some cities are starting to recognize a lesser form, especially if it helps fight urban blight. You have a couple of choices here: Move. This is 100% legal. Consider yourselves lucky for getting housing that only cost the price of gas and electric for 9 months. Many would be so luckly.Find a local legal aid society. Some cities have tenants rights groups that may be able to point you in the right direction and even provide legal counsel. That said, most likely you end up back at choice #1.The least likely to work, but honestly, if it does, in some ways the best outcome for all: Throw yourself on the mercy of the property owners. Now, they almost certainly will say, \u201cget lost\u201d for a number of reasons, many attached to liability (let\u2019s say you had gotten injured while on the property and had immense legal bills. You\u2019re responsible, so if you hired a lawyer they might suggest going after the landowner, etc.) Also, you\u2019ve already shown a breach of faith by basically \u2018stealing\u2019 from them. That said, you can also argue that you kept the property from decaying (if it was abandoned, my guess there was no upkeep being done) and helped keep their value up. You can also appeal to their humanity. And, most of all, be willing to pay rent going forward (and perhaps back rent).I think the 3rd outcome is the least likely (though it might be possible of choice 2 is followed) but, honestly, might be the most equitable. They get tenants paying rent in an otherwise abandoned property and you get a roof over your head. Good luck. ",

Nextly, just because you turned on utilities, doesn't mean you have some kind of legal right to continue being there (think of it like illegal immigrants\u2026just because they're here, doesn't mean they're legally welcome to stay as long as they want without penalty). Lastly, you were trespassing. Had you actually done some kind of research, you MIGHT have found that the house was owned by someone and not truly abandoned. ",

You are questioning the legality of such? Okay, what you and your boyfriend performed is also called Adverse Possession. Usually, for you to be able to claim the property you would have to haf stay the for a set amount of time. Since you did not inform us of what state this occurred.
