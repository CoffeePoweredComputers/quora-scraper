            "answer_text": "Why would you wish to?  First person works just as well, and done well, the reader begins to just filter out the continual \"I did this;  I did that.\"  Remember that if writing in first person, the writer can refer only to one's own experiences, thoughts and emotions.  First person is a limited point of view. However, if I wish to think of myself in third person, I'd just use my name, and the third person pronoun she / her:  \"Diane walked to the grocery store.  She watched a silver-gray SUV carom around the corner and wished for the fiftieth time in a week that she could drive.  Automatically, her eyes slitted against the glare of sunlight on the windshield.\"   With third person viewpoint, you can write from an omniscient point of view, where the character knows more than her immediate circumstances, background and attitudes.  An author can switch viewpoints, going from (let's say)King Arthur to Guinevere to Morgan Le Fay in three pages.  This gives greater freedom, but be careful.  Keep the changes to a few characters.  The limited omniscient view is almost like first person, where one writes from maybe one viewpoint or at most two (perhaps a person the viewpoint character knows intimately). ",

            "answer_text": "Josh thinks it sounds pretentious to refer to oneself in the third person. But he can do it. It's very simple. He just writes as if he were somebody else. Since he's using a pronoun he has to specify the target of the pronoun, which is usually done by starting with his name. Since this is non-standard, it will be confusing and perhaps even deceptive, it will always put people off and make him look like a bad writer. ",
