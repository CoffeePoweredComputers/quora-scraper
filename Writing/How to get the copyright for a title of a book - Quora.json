            "answer_text": "As others have said in their answers, you can copyright your entire manuscript, but you cannot copyright the title of a book. Titles of books cannot be copyrighted, and you will often see multiple books with the same title\u2014especially if the title is a single word or if it\u2019s a common phrase. However, there are creative elements that can be trademarked. People can apply for trademarks for their character names or the name of a universe or even the use of a unique phrase in certain creative uses. The owner of the trademark can then take action against people who use the trademark without fair use or proper licensing. For example, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d is trademarked, and therefore other authors cannot use those five words in that order to sell a variety of goods and services, including books but also keychains, collectible plates, etc. Applying for a trademark in the United States is a high-effort, sometimes-expensive process. If you believe this is the right route for you, start going through the process orientation a the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s website: Trademark process. Be aware that this area of the law is a little messy, however. In 2018, author Faleena Hopkins sued several people for using the word \u201cCocky\u201d in the titles of their romance novels. Hopkins had been granted a trademark to use \u201ccocky\u201d in romance titles. She was successfully able to convince Amazon to pull down some of these titles, even if they weren\u2019t romance novels, and even if the novel had been published before Hopkins was granted the trademark. The result of the court case is that the trademark was struck down, as the court ruled that \u201ccocky\u201d was not a unique term. (Source: The long Cocky-gate nightmare is over) The media reports on this has led to quite a bit of confusion between copyrights and trademarks within book titles in the industry. While unique names like Harry Potter and Jack Reacher can likely be trademarked, very few authors go through the expense to trademark something that can successfully defended as unique in a book title. When a work (such as a manuscript) is copyrighted, there is a legal basis for the author to defend themselves against an author whose work might cause confusion in the marketplace\u2014which doesn\u2019t have to be the title. For example, the name \u201cJack Reacher\u201d isn\u2019t trademarked, but an author who writes a novel in which a man named Jack Reacher is the action hero\u2014or even if he shares certain physical or mental features with Lee Child\u2019s character\u2014would likely be found in violation of Child\u2019s copyrighted manuscripts. (The author Diane Capri, who writes \u201cThe Hunt for Jack Reacher\u201d novels, does so with the express written consent of Lee Child.) The vast majority of authors simply attempt to title books something that can easily be found on search engines and book retailer sites\u2014and not easily confused with other authors\u2019 work. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, the word is Copyright. Secondly, titles are not able to be copyrighted. But here is a simple answer, from Writer\u2019s Digest: Can You Copyright a Title? | WritersDigest.com Third, if you want accurate info, go to U.S. Copyright Office Also, you do not have to register or pay anything to have copyright on anything you write. As soon as something is written, it is automatically copyrighted. But if you ever want to file a claim against someone for infringing your copyright, it does need to have been registered. Legal action is expensive, however, so in most cases, it\u2019s not worth it to pay to register copyright unless your work is being published. Finally, even if you copyrighted \u201cMy Life and Story,\u201d it would not prevent someone else from coming up with that exact same title. Copyright is not like a patent. No search is done to see if anyone has ever used that title before, and it does not stop someone else from having the same idea and writing the same few words (that\u2019s why copyrighting a title doesn\u2019t make sense.) A thing can be copyrighted if it is \u201can original work of authorship.\u201d Obviously, if someone wrote a new book and called it Fahrenheit 451, it would not make much sense. But there are definitely many books that have the same name as other books. Basic info from U.S. Copyright Office for the US: What Does Copyright Protect? ",
