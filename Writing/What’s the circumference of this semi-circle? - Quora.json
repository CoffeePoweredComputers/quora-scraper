            "answer_text": "The circumference of a circle is given by [math]C=2 \\pi r[/math], where [math]r[/math] is the radius of the circle. Since the radius of a circle is half its diameter, we can replace the former equation with [math]C=\\pi d[/math]. However, since we want the radius of a semicircle, we can use the formula [math]C=\\pi r[/math]. This formula is derived by dividing the first formula by [math]2[/math]. Since we also need the length of the line segment that divides the circle in half, we will use the formula [math]C=\\pi r+d[/math]. Now that we have our formula, we need the radius of the semicircle. The quickest way to do this is with the Pythagorean theorem, that is, [math]a^2+b^2=c^2[/math]. We will let [math]c[/math] be the radius of the semicircle, that is [math]r[/math], so we need to find [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math]. [math]a[/math] will be the distance between the center and the line whose [math]y[/math] coordinate is the ordinate of one of the endpoints of the diameter. Let us choose the lower point. Since its coordinates are [math](-1,-1)[/math], we need the distance between the line [math]y=-1 [/math]and the center of the circle. Then we should do the same for the line whose [math]x[/math] coordinate is the abscissa of that same point to find [math]b[/math]. Once we have [math]a[/math] and [math]b[/math], all we need to do is plug numbers into our equations and see what we get. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not usual to refer to the \u201ccircumference\u201d of a semicircle. A circumference is a special case of perimeter used for continuously differentiable outlines, such as circles and ellipses. The outline of a semicircle is not continuously differentiable, so we would normally call the distance around it the perimeter. The perimeter comprises the diameter and the semicircular rim. In the diagram the diameter runs from [math](-1,-1)[/math] to [math](5,3)[/math], and thus has length [math]\\sqrt{6^2 + 4^2}[/math] [math]= \\sqrt{52}[/math] [math]= 2\\sqrt{13}[/math]. The semicircular rim is a factor of [math]\\frac{\\pi}{2}[/math] longer than the diameter, which is [math]\\pi \\sqrt{13}[/math]. So the perimeter [math]= 2\\sqrt{13} + \\pi \\sqrt{13}[/math] [math]= \\boxed{ (2 + \\pi) \\sqrt{13} }[/math] [math]\\approx 18.54[/math]. ",
