            "answer_text": "We definitely can. But there are a couple variables that will decide the result. (Bear in mind everything I write is in my experience) First, understand that in order to avoid over stimulation, I regularly suppress my emotions. Our emotions are very sensitive, having no emotion is better then letting them overload and becoming an emotional wreck when it comes to being a productive member of society. So the first variable is 1: Am I suppressing those emotions? If I\u2019m suppressing it, then I probably wont feel it UNLESS 2: Is the person being kind to me? Kindness is not something I get very often, I hear this is pretty common among autists due to us being kinda weird compared to normal people. So when people show us kindness, even if I don\u2019t want a relationship with someone I\u2019ll feel love. I\u2019ve actually had crushes on most of my friends because of this. So yes, we can. However like many of our emotions, it\u2019s more of a curse then a blessing. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course we can feel love; just as intensely, if not moreso, than any neurotypical does. We just don't have the same methods of demonstrating it. I'm married. I have children. I am deeply in love with my spouse, and I love my children and my parents with all my heart, so much that it hurts if I think about it deeply. We're not that different from you, in many respects. We're not psychopaths and we're not an alien species. We're human, just like you are. Please don't ever forget or minimize our humanity. ",
