Most of the applicants are excellent. So what is it about you that makes you a valuable member of a community? How are you prepared to take advantage of all the opportunities Exeter offers? Try not to make any presumptions about what Exeter is, or what your experience will be like, and definitely don\u2019t think of Exeter as simply a means to an end - that end being acceptance to a \u201cgood\u201d college. And if you\u2019re in a bad situation, don\u2019t be ashamed to acknowledge that and detail all the ways Exeter can help you escape. Good luck, but if you don\u2019t get in, don\u2019t worry about it. You can be a successful happy person without going to an Ivy League college, and you can be a successful happy person without going to a top-tier boarding school. Although Exeter IS pretty spectacular and the resources are beyond compare. ",
