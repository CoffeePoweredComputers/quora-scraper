            "answer_text": "You can do anything in writing. Some things are to your detriment and the readers. I was a fiction writer long before I seriously looked at academic writing. I also work in a technical field\u2026 and documentation is something that comes with the territory. So how does this all come together? Structure. The REASON for the five paragraph essay is it is the minimum. It\u2019s the LOW bar. In higher education, you will shoot for your master\u2019s thesis, and your doctoral dissertation. These are LEAGUES bigger tasks. When I am tutoring a student I can whip this thing out:  And talk to you visually about this as the MODEL. The big challenge here for me is to get students out of this head space of : OH MY GOD 500 WORDS! MY WORLD IS ENDING! *sigh* One assertion, three points of support, one conclusion \u2014 5 chunks \u2014 this is bottom rung. You can have an introduction of 5 paragraphs, a body of 20 paragraphs, and a conclusion of 1. As long as it\u2019s all planned out and you understand how it\u2019s all supposed to work. First you need to know the essay type: ExpositoryDescriptive \u2014 Process / How toNarrative.Compare-&-contrastPersuasive/argumentativeThis in and of itself is one level of understanding \u2014 how you will attack or address the topic. In expository and narrative essays, there\u2019s no need for thesis or assertion. Now, for everything else is that darned thesis / assertion \u2026 this is where people draw the wrong conclusion. Example Thesis : Masks should be worn because they help prevent the spread of disease, set a good example, and shorten the lockdown. Assertion: Masks should be worn Point 1: they help prevent the spread of disease Point 2: they set a good example Point 3: they shorten the lockdown See how this is written out? This is a survival technique that will save you on essay exams. You write your essay prompt on the left side of the blue book which includes the type of answer the instructor is asking for. You write your thesis and support points. Once you have this in your noggin, you start on the ACTUAL essay, writing an introduction that winds up with a thesis. Then you have your topic sentences for each paragraph already figured out, you just need to add examples and support after them. Finally, you conclude with what you talked about. So, in answer to the original question can you have 5 body paragraphs. YES. If they are in ADDITION to an introduction AND conclusion. Sometimes it could take 5 or MORE paragraphs to fully support a thesis, especially if there 5 or more support points. Further, if discussion of a point requires multiple paragraphs. ALSO OKAY. I just want folks to understand the difference between a paradigm\u2014 a way of thinking about essay to UNPARALYZE students\u2026 and thinking 5 paragraphs is the box we\u2019re not supposed to think outside of.

            "answer_text": "Of course. Teachers who are rigid about the five-paragraph essay do their students a disservice, an egregious one, I would add. For example, I know of a community college whose entire English department until recently insisted that all essays must be of the formulaic five-paragraph variety. And each paragraph had to have five to seven sentences. And each sentence was to contain a prescribed number of words. In college. Instead of evaluating content based on best practices in college-level writing, instructors were counting sentences, paragraphs, words, and looking to see that each paper had proper topic and transitional sentences. Many of these students wanted to transfer to four-year schools, at which that elementary-school level of writing is completely unacceptable. The only thing those students were prepared for was compliance, not for their junior year of college. Without looking at a particular essay, I can tell you that well-written, well-developed essays should have more than three body paragraphs.The five-paragraph essay is fine for teaching elementary children and to please the writers of standardized tests. So write a five-paragraph essay for your SAT. Other than that, forget it. Go for development. \u201cDevelopment\u201d is a key aspect of essay evaluation. Proper \u201cdevelopment\" means that the writer has fully explored the given topic, using examples, explanation and evidence, addressing counterpoints, and perhaps adding some insight. Doing so will almost certainly require more than three body paragraphs. Hence, one idea may well require more than one paragraph to fully develop, so the elementary school notion of one idea per paragraph can cause student writers to produce incredibly long, cumbersome paragraphs. This is not good writing practice and in no way helps the reader to grasp what the writer is trying to say. They're just confusing. Break them up and add a few transitional words or sentences where necessary, but by all means, use more than three body paragraphs. This leads me to another related idiotic idea: requiring that essays be well-developed in the way I described above, but that they also contain only five paragraphs, no matter how long they are. So in this case, students must write the required number of pages\u2014let's say eight pages--but use only five paragraphs, so paragraphs that stretch on for a page or more are necessary, not because the student doesn't know any better but because the teacher doesn't know any better. Good god. Please, writing teachers, give up the five-paragraph essay for students past the eighth grade. Personally, I question using them even then. Let that be the minimum standard, but encourage more without being punitive if more is beyond a given student. Yeah, I know. Up until this sentence, this essay contains five paragraphs. Just a coincidence! ",

            "answer_text": "An essay typically consists of 5 paragraphs in total. The five-paragraph essay is a format of essay having five paragraphs: one introductory paragraph, three body paragraphs with support and development, and one concluding paragraph. Because of this structure, it is also known as a hamburger essay, one three one, or a three-tier essay. (source - Wikipedia) However, I believe that an essay can consist of as many paragraphs as one would like, given that it consists of an introduction, body and conclusion. ",

It is preferable to having paragraphs that are too long, have info that reads better in separate paragraphs or is otherwise forced just to meet an arbitrary number. A good essay or any piece of writing should stand on the merit of its content. The exception to this is in a composition class. There the content is actually unimportant. Writing in this class is a demonstration of your knowledge and understanding of composition rules and techniques. ",

If your prompt asks you to give 5 points, then 5 body paragraphs (plus the intro and conclusion) is the perfect length! If you have 3 main points, then 3 body paragraphs is perfect. As you can see, it all depends on how many main points you have- generally, each body paragraph should be for one main point of your essay.Happy writing! ",
