            "answer_text": "I think you're making a lot of assumptions in your details, and this can be the root of the problems. If you're talking about your parents or about your friends and you're assuming that they know you very well, you could be very wrong. If, on top of that, you're not communicating what is it that you want, then they will never know since they can't read your mind. If you are communicative and if you are vocal about your needs, then it's something different - people around you don't pay attention to you. With respect to your family, there is no legal requirement to provide you with surprises, and apparently you had chosen the wrong people to be your friends.  Friends can be replaced, of course, however how would you do it? Are you going to evaluate all candidates based on their entertainment (to you) value? You might as well go for clowns but I doubt that they will agree to work for free just to keep you occupied. This is why it is so very wrong for anyone to say that this entertainment can be \"outsourced\" to a significant other. Having a friend who's a joker is one thing, and it's entirely different to live with one on a permanent basis (please read up on the marriage outcome of one such pairing: Tom Green On His 'Whirlwind' Marriage To Drew Barrymore ; there are only so many times that you can have someone unleash their creative genius on you until you snap). Which leaves you with...you. You blame others for lack of surprises: your family, your friends, your non-existent future spouse. And what is it that you do? Why do you bore yourself to death and then tasking someone with entertaining you? Yes, it's your fault. Entirely your fault. I am coming from a family where there were no creative people - absolutely none. Well, instead of blaming them for being human, I took it upon myself to come up with exciting things to do, to create, and to anticipate. The best antidote to your \"Why me?\" question is you using your creative genius (if you have it) to make someone else's life a little more interesting. My first outlet for creativity was my sister. Then it was my circle of friends. Then it was my significant other, and now it's my child. I seriously doubt that anyone in the world would know what I want and what kind of surprises I desire, and since I know that not a single soul would actually put in a required level of dedication to bring it to a successful outcome. Admittedly, I have a high level of energy and I was told to have 2 modes: either on or off; I am either passionate and driven about something or I don't care about its existence. It is a blessing and a curse, and blaming others would not get me anywhere. ",

            "answer_text": "Its truth we can't stop expectation.Its human nature.everyone expect something from others when you do something for other but don't over expectation. I think it might be the reason why anyone doesn't make you feel special. 1- Might be you are isolate kind of person.Don't want to mingle with people 2-Might be you don't have girlfriend. 3- Might be in your family members are very simple type.They take the things very lightly. 5-Might be you don't make feel special to other.(Give and take theory). 6-Might be your are not close to someone 7-Might be you don't have something special. There might be lots of reason for your points of view and other people.  Solutions>> 1- identify the reason 2- fall in love someone. Surely they will make you feel very special. 3-do something for your parents so they feel proud of you.Surely they will make feel you special 4- Help your friends and others people.You will feel special inside and you never know friends make you feel special someday People say everyone is unique and special.God made special to everyone.i don't think so because its not happen practically. Do it the things own and feel good.everything will come your way. ",
