            "answer_text": "As with all old objects the main criteria in value will be how rare the item is, how good its condition is, and in this case whether it still functions. If you have something that\u2019s already quite rare, that\u2019s a good start. A pen in new or nearly new condition is a bonus. Making a point to save ink refills and other parts for it will certainly help future value. If you want to gain some certainty that you have a valuable pen, check it\u2019s current value and rarity. That\u2019s a good indicator of future value. Anything in the top 10% of rarity is fairly certain to be of interest to future collectors. On the down side, no one thinks of pens as particularly interesting or exciting. To add meaningful value, it would have to belong to someone famous (like a president) and come with proof to that effect. For a pen you already own, take good care of it and document what you currently know about it. Try to prevent further abuse and collect spare parts to keep it working. On the other hand getting into pens as a possible valuable collectible, I\u2019d suggest looking for something with a bit more appeal. ",
