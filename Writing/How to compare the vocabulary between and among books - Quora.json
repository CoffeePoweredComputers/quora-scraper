            "answer_text": "Hi! This should sort you up to around A-Level standard, if you are at a higher level, deeper analysis may be required - Firstly split it into the main frameworks (pick and choose which are relevant to you, I understand that you will not need all of them for a vocabulary comparison but they are good to know anyway) - Grammar, Lexis, Semantics, Pragmatics, Discourse and finally Phonology if that applies. Find examples of how the books use these in both similar and contrasting ways. Comparison pieces should always compare AND contrast. Secondly, always remember to put things into context. That means looking at the vocabulary in context to the phrase in which it rests and also the greater surrounding body of text, as well as the external context of the books/novels/novellas etc. Purpose, Audience, Genre, Formality, Mode and Representation are the best frameworks to start with. Think about the political, socio-economic and cultural status of the author and who he/she was writing for. (As well as what reasons they may have had for writing the piece in the first place and/or what biases they may have had. Political commentary? Historical significance? Plain old entertainment? ) How would this have affected the vocabulary used? In what internal and external context would the readership have received the text and how may the vocabulary used have swayed their interpretation of it etc. Good luck! ",
