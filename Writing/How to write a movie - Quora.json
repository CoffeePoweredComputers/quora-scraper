            "answer_text": "Well, to begin with you should do some brainstorming before you actually begin to write something. Remember it\u2019s your first time, so be cautious enough to make your stuff entertaining enough and avoid unintended cliche. The idea of getting recurring success based on some fixed ideology or concept can only work for some seasoned film maker. So just make it a point that you stick to originality. This does not mean you cannot use something that has influenced you for the lifetime. The first and most important thing is to decide the character map. Select a central character around which the whole story will be woven. It\u2019s easier to imagine and write screenplays that way, so there are no loose ends to the whole thing. Writing a screenplay involving multiple central characters will turn up into a mess at some stage, so as a novice you should avoid it. Now a key point to remember here is that you have to first decide the flow of the characters along the film and then create the scenes. Once you\u2019ve done with creation of scenes, it\u2019s now time to add a complete personality to your characters. I would recommend to always keep the personality to character mapping at last, as it gives you good creative freedom. Write down all the nuances of all the characters in your script. Always take a look at this data, before writing scenes and dialogues between your characters. Finally compile all your scenes together to form a great screenplay. No matter how good screenplay you write, the director is bound to make changes according to his comfort when he will direct the stuff. So keep some fluidity while writing the scenes unless you are writing for a genre like thriller, crime drama, etc. Finally if you are a novice and you have got very experience in writing, then always try to write some lightweight genre like romance or family drama. As a novice, one shouldn\u2019t try hand at crime dramas, sport dramas and never even think of writing comedies. Once you\u2019ve tried your luck 2\u20133 times, you can try experimenting with different genres. ",

            "answer_text": "First you'll need to write what's called a treatment. :) The point of the treatment is to communicate your story as quickly as possible, so brevity without sacrificing what makes it unique or worth gaining 'buy-in' from stakeholders Most script-writers I know start with a one page pitch. Then if they gain positive feedback, if they create a two to five page document that tells the whole story with important scenes sometimes dot pointed for clarity. Then, if required, to flesh it out before starting the first draft, a lengthy document that is a scene by scene breakdown of a script. Or a loosely drawn story board A professional treatment usually has: A Working titleThe writer's name and contact informationWGA Registration numberA short log-lineIntroduction to key charactersWho, what, when, why and where.Act 1 in one to three paragraphs. Set the scene, dramatize the main conflicts.Act 2 in two to six paragraphs. Should dramatize how the conflicts introduced in Act 1 lead to a crisis.Act 3 in one to three paragraphs. Dramatize the final conflict and resolution.The tradition of writing in three act structure comes from the theater and is still followed by film-makers. Act 1 : The Set-up, The situation and characters and conflict are introduced. This classically is 30 minutes long. Act 2 : The Conflict, often an hour long, is where the conflict begins and expands until it reaches a crisis. Act 3 : The Resolution, the conflict rises to one more crisis and then is resolved. Most of this info I grabbed from a site, as I've not written a script before, just worked, chatted with and interviewed writers who have. I remembered most of this but it was easier to look it up. So I'd say we might need to take a step back here, the first step of writing a script is to know the process. Of which you need to know you need to have a treatment first! Maybe research should actually be the first step. :) ",
