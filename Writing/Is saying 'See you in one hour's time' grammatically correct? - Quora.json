            "answer_text": "In formal grammar, it is not correct, because \"see you\" should be \"I'll see you.\" But it is a construction that is often used in informal communications, and is perfectly acceptable. The \"I will\" part is implied. \"In one hour's time\" is grammatically correct, but a little overly formal. Does this sentence occur in in formal or informal communication? If you are letting a friend know when you will meet them for lunch, that is informal, and you would probably say or write \"See you in an hour.\" If a superior in an organization is ordering a subordinate to come to a meeting, \"I will see you in an hour's time\" is more likely.

See you in an hour. (informal)I shall see you in one hour\u2019s time. (formal)Sometimes registers of discourse can be different between different varieties of English. An English newspaper, depending on its level of tabloidness, might say: The suspected perpetrator was apprehended.orThe crook was nabbed.but they wouldn\u2019t say:The perpetrator was nabbed.The latter might be perfectly fine for example in India, where the registers of discourse would have evolved separately from how they have in England. Register-mixing is something native speakers would avoid without thinking, but it is one of those areas that can feel a bit fuzzy to learners, and one simply has to learn in what context different words, expressions or grammatical constructs are suitable to use. When I went to school, register of discourse didn\u2019t even get a single mention in an entire nine years of English classes. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, well it is correct when you say it - I mean in spoken English. If you are writing this in an email or text, then it may seem informal. Thats the basic difference between written and spoken English. In context of your sentence, you also alternatively say; \u2018See you in an hour\u2019s time\u2019 OR simply \u2018See you in an hour\u2019. You can replace \u2018one\u2019 with \u2018an\u2019 as it conveys the same meaning and further simplifies the sentence. When you want to write the same sentence this is how it should be ideally presented; \u2018I will see you in an hour\u2019. The idea in both modes of conversation - written and spoken, is to simplify the sentence and make it seem sensible to the person on the other side who is receiving it. Again it also depends on who is the receiving party (if its a business email or conversation with a client etc, it needs to be formal and if its a friend or family member you may keep it informal - totally your choice). Hope this helps. Take care! ",

( at the end of the week )  I will repay your loan within a week. ( any time before the end of the week ) The above concept was in active usage in olden days. Contemporarily , this diction is not kept and \u2018in\u2019 is often used for \u2018within\u2019.    Thus  \"See you in one hour's time\" = \"See you with in one hour's time\" And both of them are grammatically correct.  ",
