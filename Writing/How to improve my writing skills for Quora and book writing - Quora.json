            "answer_text": "Good writing skills are a combination of being able to efficiently put your thoughts into words, plus having a decent vocab and good grammar. In order to improve both here are some things you can try: Journal: This doesn't have to be a minute to minute account of your day, just write about anything that caught your eye, anything that moved you. Do not restrict yourself, change the topic as many times as you like, let yourself free and let your mind wander. Make sure you were able to put exactly how you felt on paper.Read: Needless to say, to be a good writer, you have to be a good reader. Read novels, biographies, anything you fancy. Explore different authors, see how they all have a unique writing style, doing this will help you find your own way of writing.Read the newspaper: News articles and especially the editorial section articles are really helpful for improving grammar and vocab.Writing prompts: Look up writing prompts on Pinterest and continue ahead. Do not make it too lengthy, revise it, do a spellcheck, try making it more appealing to the reader, and revise again.Write: Now that you've read about improving your writing skills, put your pen to paper, and start writing. It can be a story, an article, a poem, anything you want it to be. Revise it, look at it from a reader's point of view, make someone read it and take inputs.",
