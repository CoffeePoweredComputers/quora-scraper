            "answer_text": "Preparing a research problem statement is often the hardest part of writing a research proposal or thesis. A research problem statement lays the foundation for work that needs to be done to correct a situation and proffer solution., A research problem statement outlines the current situation, identifies the challenges, specifies the location and indicates the people involved. Step 1 Think about your research problem statement. List a few ideas about the topic. Ask yourself if your research problem is important and if anyone else cares about the topic. Step 2 Identify the purpose of your research problem statement and indicate who would benefit from your study. Support your statement with evidence and expert opinion. Step 3 Work with the five W's: who, what, when, where and why. This will help you frame your research problem statement. Step 4 Specify the population of your study and identify what will be measured. Your population group, for instance, might be senior citizens in YOUR LOCALITY and you might want to measure how frequently they use public transportation at different times of the year. Step 5 Keep your title and research problem statement question virtually identical. If the title of your research problem statement is \u201cPublic Transportation Use by Seniors in XXX COUNTRY Relative to Seasonal Temperature,\u201d your research problem statement should close with the question, \u201cWhat is the public transportation use by seniors in XXX COUNTRY relative to the seasonal temperature?\u201d Step 6 Draft your research problem statement. Leave it for at least 24 hours -- 48 is better -- and then come back to it. Review it with a fresh eye and tighten the wording. Step 7 Review your research problem statement with your thesis adviser. She may be able to help you further hone the statement. ",

            "answer_text": "Describe the \"ideal\" state of affairs. There are lots of different ways to write a problem statement \u2014 some sources will recommend jumping right to the problem itself, while others recommend providing background context first so that problem (and its solution) are easier to understand for the reader. If you're ever unsure of how to begin, opt for the latter option. While conciseness is something every piece of practical writing should aim for, it's even more important to be well-understood. Start by describing how things should work. Before you even mention your problem, explain in a few sentences how things would be if the problem didn't exist.  Explain your problem. In the words of the inventor Charles Kettering, \"A problem well-stated is a problem half-solved. One of the most important goals (if not the most important goal) of any problem statement is to articulate the problem being addressed to the reader in a way that's clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. Succinctly summarize the problem you intend to solve \u2014 this cuts to the heart of the issue immediately and positions the most important information in the problem statement near the top, where it's most visible. If you've just stated an \"ideal\" state of affairs as suggested above, you may want to start your sentence with phrasing like \"However, ...\" or \"Unfortunately, ...\" to show that the problem you've identified is what is preventing the ideal vision from being a reality.

            "answer_text": "I start with research. First you need to find a problem. Many problems are available to research, so finding one is not an issue. After I find a problem or an area of problems, I start reading current literature to find out more about the problem and how others have addressed the problem. Armed with the current literature, I return to the field to learn about the problem first-hand from the people who experience the problem. I ask them about the problem: How big is the problem,What is the impact of the problem,How they work around/with the problem,What solutions have been tried,What would their work look like if the problem was solved?Next, I watch them work around their problem. I determine what could be measured to determine if the problem is solved. At this point, I\u2019m ready to write the problem statement. I likely have enough background to know if the problem is important and the impacts of solving the problem. This helps make the problem important enough to take on a study. ",

            "answer_text": "To generate a problem statement you need to come up with general ideas from your topic of discussion that acts as sample thesis statements. From these sample thesis statements, you generate a general statement that covers all these general ideas by combining them to form a general idea. Revise your general statement to ensure it agrees with all the key factors stated below such as clarity and conciseness. The revised general statement thus becomes your statement of the problem. For an efficient and concise statement that has direction and can be evidenced by supporting points, ensure to; \u00b7 Avoid the use of ambiguous words and rightfully place the statement The statement is best placed when written early in the paper. In addition, it should not include words such as \u201cthe main idea of my paper is\u2026\u201d \u00b7 Provide a narrow and concise statement but broad enough for you to place an argument A general idea cannot be argued appropriately and in-depth as expected in a paper. A statement that is too narrow, however, leaves no room for development and explanation. Additionally, when showing a relation between two general ideas in a statement; use conjunctions that best explain the relation e.g. although, though, because among others. \u00b7 Write a statement that is easily understood To write a perfectly good statement you need to keep revising it and come up with a statement that is not only clear and easily understood but also allows the reader to be aware of your position based on the statement. The reader should also become aware of why your opinion on the issue matters. A statement should not announce the topic alone but should also express subjectivity. When expressing subjectivity, provide a good enough and valuable explanation. For example, instead of writing \u201cloans, grants and donor funds are not the key to developing the poor\u201d, one should write\u201d making the poor aware of their capacity to be involved in their development will yield successful results\u201d. Finally, avoid oversimplifying a concept or even merely stating a proven fact. Go deep with your idea \u00b7 Express originality It is important to prove the worth of your paper. Your idea should not appear generic or formulated from other people\u2019s ideas. When developing your statement of the problem, you may formulate it from general ideas and arguments of others. You need to keep revising it nonetheless until it allows you to answer the question \u2018so what\u2019 without borrowing ideas of others or boring the reader in the process. Furthermore, it is common to experience a \u2018thought block\u2019 when developing your statement. When this occurs, you are expected to brainstorm ideas on the topic. Write whatever comes to mind on the topic. From this point, you follow the steps to coming up with a good problem statement. Ultimately, as a writer, you need to express flexibility while writing your problem statement. Whether you are justifying a claim (persuasive), explaining a concept (expository) or evaluating an issue (analytical); the topic or general idea may change as the essay progresses. It is important to, therefore, change your problem statement to suit your essay. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is: clearly. But I think what you really meant to ask is how does one lay down a problem statement clearly within the context of a research proposal. The general method is to use a good metaphor to describe the problem if the problem is too complicated or complex. Especially, detailed scientific research proposals that are in the realm of splitting hairs this (metaphor strategy) can be a useful strategy of laying down a problem. For example, let's say you are writing a research proposal to study economic volatility or macroeconomic stability. You can start off with a description that, let's say, uses airplane turbulence as a metaphor for economic volatility. This can give the reader an easier handle on the topic, which you can use to gently guide the reader's attention to the exact problem you want to solve, why it must be solved, and how do you propose to solve it (also, what's special about your way of solving the problem). However, ensure that the reader does not to stretch the metaphor too far by quickly connecting the topic to basic concepts that an interested reader may understand. If it is a simple problem, then the problem statement will be easier for you to not rely on metaphor to do the job for you. ",
