            "answer_text": "It depends on if the baby is born when the baby shower is held and if the parents had a baby registry. When baby is still in the womb, I like to err on the side of caution. I don\u2019t give diapers, lotions, formulas, etc. because, as is the case with my son, certain brands may cause baby to have a rash. I wouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for someone else\u2019s baby being in discomfort, nor do I want the parents to have to throw out my gift because they can\u2019t use it. It is better to let the parents decide what works for them, not be forced to use something because it was a gift. Things like gift cards are a safe bet as the new parents will be able to get what they want/need. I also like to give books. It\u2019s never to early to foster a love of learning. If there is a baby registry, I would go off of that. It might not seem very thoughtful, but the new parents will appreciate that they are able to get exactly what they want/need. If the baby is outside the womb by the time the baby shower is going on, I would find out exactly what the new couple need. Maybe they like a certain brand of diapers. Maybe they formula feed and use a certain brand. Maybe they have a zillion newborn outfits and need something for an older baby. Maybe they are swimming in receiving blankets and would like a cute toy. Maybe a bottle warmer would make their lives easier. Maybe an activity mat for their kid. Really, it could be anything, but I want to ensure I get something that the new parents want. I would also consider a personalized gift if I know the couple well. Something like a stuffy with the baby\u2019s name, date of birth, and birth details on it or a personalized growth chart. If the baby is still in the womb: a gift card, books, a gift off the registryIf the baby is outside the womb: a gift card, diapers in the brand that the new parents uses, the brand of formula the parents are using (if they are formula feeding), clothes if you know the parents\u2019 tastes/needs, books, a gift off the registry, personalized giftI think the most annoying baby shower gift I received was a picture frame where I had to print a picture of the baby, print a name plate, and do ink prints of baby\u2019s feet and hands. It was a nice gesture and I understand the reasoning behind it, but giving the new mom essentially a craft to do when she is overwhelmed with new responsibilities is inadvisable. It was just sheer willpower that forced me to put the thing together rather than have it collect dust in a corner. ",

I wouldn't have any desire to be at risk for another person's infant youngster being in a difficult situation, nor do I need the gatekeepers to need to toss out my endorsement since they can't utilize it. It is more insightful to let the guardians pick what works for them, not be obliged to utilize something since it was a blessing. Things like gift vouchers are a sure thing as the unseasoned watchmen will have the decision to get what they need/need. I also prefer to give books. It's never to precisely on time to build up a kinship for learning. In the event that there is a child library, I would go off of that.
