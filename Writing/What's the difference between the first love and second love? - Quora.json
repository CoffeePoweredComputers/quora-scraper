            "answer_text": "First love:- First love is really crazy. We imagine it as beautiful as they write in novels or the things which our filmmakers show. We tend to have a lot expectations from our partner (due to these movies and novels obviously). We would be so addicted to the other one that we often forget the people around. The butterflies in the stomach\u2026Romantic dinners.. Late night calls\u2026 \"How do I look \"factor\u2026 Small fights everything becomes so habitual. We compromise on things. We get insecure if with their certain over friendly friends;especially if they are good looking than us. We never miss an opportunity to celebrate ; be it birthdays,month anniversary, Valentines day or their dog's birthday. Our whole time starts revolving around the other person. Staring at their pictures for hours and not getting bored. Waiting for the other's call.We start dreaming about \"future -us.\" Second love: Now,there are less chances to make mistakes here because we already know \"how things work\" and \"what not to do in a relationship \" from our first love. So we wouldnt have much expectation from our partner;so even if he/she does a small gesture,it's enough to make us happy. We become mature enough to realize that celebrating these much of dates make no sense. We are comfortable with them without makeup or proper dressing up because we know they are not going to notice anyway :D. Now their friends must have become our best friends ; I mean insecurity,what's that? We finally understand that they are important to us as much as our dreams are. So we find time for them and also our life goals. We work out things as a couple. We choose to understand each other, rather than fighting for silly things (like not able to call or text frequently). We sure do love them to the core, but these cheesy lines,butterflieswaale feeling, staring at the pictures etc doesn't work for us anymore apart from the fact that they are the first person whom we think of when we wake up and the last person when we sleep. We deal things as an adult. We become each other's support system. We become each other's strength. We constantly motivate our love to go ahead and do something in life and if they do, noone would be happier than us. The main difference is that in first love,we were living in a dreamy world whereas in second love,we become practical and get a reality check from the experiences of first love.   ",

            "answer_text": "I had a breakup three years ago, I moved on, but it happened again. I felt the same on seeing my second love , I fell in love again after 3 years, not only same feelings but I started those same activities which I did when I was in love for the first time , writing , guitar , sketching and lots more, but the difference I felt was that second time you approach things in different way , though you might feel the same way , but you will be skeptical in your approach. For me in case of first approach I followed the pattern Acquaintance -> friends-> love -> proposal -> rejection -> friendzone ->proposal- > friendzone-> proposal ->friendzone -> proposal-> accepted-> relationship-> ups and down -> breakup -> move on. All this happened in the phase of 7 years , from class 12th to couple of years after completion of my btech. Well in case of second love. It was 3 years post my breakup and the pattern was. Acquaintance -> love -> more than acquaintance but not friend-> confession about feelings -> rejection with discontinuation in friendship-> decision respected and trying to move on . This happened in the phase of 4 months , since I didn't want to be stuck in the middle as I believe I am in that stage where career is important as well. If you see the difference the second happened with me after 10 years of my first love, and I didn't try to insist on trying to win over my second love, because she told me that she won't be able to be in contact after I revealed my feelings to her. I feel second person is more important since that person makes the way through your heart inspite of you being so stringent about love. But yes rejection hurts the same every time. ",
