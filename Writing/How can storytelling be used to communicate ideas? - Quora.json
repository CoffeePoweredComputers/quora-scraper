            "answer_text": "Woo! Laptops back, time to get to these. Sorry it\u2019s so late. So I\u2019ll be honest, the wording of the question set me back a bit, But I figure if I remove the what, it makes sense. And the answer? Yes, Storytelling is an effective way of communicating important ideas. Before we had the ability to write we used it, even when only certain people knew how to write, humanity told stories. A lot of what we know about the past came from stories that weren't written down until much later. If you want a giant, very well know example, take the Christian bible. Most of those stories, especially the ones in the old testament were passed down for hundreds of generations through word of mouth. And we still use it as a teaching tool now. Fairytales and Fables teach children and even adults values through the art of storytelling. Most children's books have a moral that they\u2019re trying to impart. Written in a way that appeals to the younger mind. I\u2019ve found that now, when I\u2019m writing, it\u2019s because I have something to share, a story to tell that is riddled with information, the morals, and the values I hold dear. Not in a way where it feels shoved down your throat, but in the characters and how they act. So yes, absolutely. ",

            "answer_text": "As the Grandmother of two young men with \u201cspecial needs\u201d, one of whom is dependent upon his mother for every aspect of care, and cannot speak, the other with autism, I can assure the reader that storytelling most certainly helps greatly with communication. My daughter has always read poems and stories to both of her sons, and the older one communicates with laughter and smiles when hearing these. The younger one who is autistic remembers whole lines of poems and stories. Storytelling has been used for centuries to pass down the cultural heritage of many different countries, and in my own family, via my maternal Grandmother, to pass down the family heritage and stories of life back in the early 1900\u2019s.

The answer is yes, it is.Look at the success of Rowling\u2019s Harry books (I\u2019m not sure they convey any important ideas but their readers certainly think so) and other books for children. Surely the Oz convey some important ideas. Lord of the Rings and Goodnight Moon, likewise. Books for adults certainly do. But the all-time story(ies) that conveys important ideas is, without a doubt, the Holy Bible. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. I believe that, regardless of your spiritual beliefs, a great example of stories that bear fruit would be the Parables in the Bible. Important life lessons are embedded in these stories, people remember these stories better than straight platitudes, and some people glean more from the story than just the initial intended lesson. Those are my thoughts on the topic! Lol. ",

I hope it makes people think about stereotypes and \u201cwarehousing\u201d people with these challenges. Another novel showed the psychological warping of a girl who had suffered incest. She, intelligent and driven, became a killer. Her sister, who had suffered the same fate, but was not especially intelligent or ambitious, did not become a sociopath. Think also of parables\u2014many in the Christian bible, and some part of a nation\u2019s folklore. ",
