My bare hands kept searching for the quilt that I remembered keeping next to me but never imagined laying out a quilt would be so difficult. Rubbing my hazy eyes I wrapped the quilt over my body. The warmth of the quilt atlast put my shiverings to a halt. This morning's frosty breeze discovered the most artistic and beautiful trait in nature that I have never felt before. I took more than four words. Thanks\u270d\ufe0f ",
