            "answer_text": "The Dutch are among the tallest people in the world. On average a Dutch adult will stand at 1.78 meters high and as a nation, the Netherlands towers over its European neighbors. This statistical anomaly has been the source of considerable scientific speculation and has consistently perplexed researchers. A recent study aims to uncover the reasons behind Dutch people\u2019s peculiar growth patterns, combing historic records to reveal the factors that contribute towards their enhanced height. Aforementioned vitamin rich diet undoubtedly helps to fuel growth and supplies children with the energy that their bodies need to reach such towering proportions. Nonetheless, scientists believe this to be only one factor among many.Until around a hundred years ago, the Dutch were actually one of the shortest nations in Europe and their exponential growth has remained something of a mystery to the scientific community. In July of this year, the journal eLife published an investigation that explored global growth trends over the last century. The paper found that other European nations have experienced similar increases in height, mainly because of significant improvements in living standards. The paper also gathered evidence drawn specifically from the Netherlands, tracing a picture of the country\u2019s genealogy during the years between 1935 and 1967. Their data shows that on average taller people were having more children than their shorter compatriots. Moreover, the Netherlands underwent a population boom during this time, resulting in a generation of taller citizens. These families were larger than European averages with Dutch people having one, or two, more children than usual.Observing these patterns over time, the researchers concluded that this distinctively Dutch trait is partly due to genetics. The genes that make for taller individuals are hereditary, and a large population of lofty citizens is more likely to produce broods of equally endowed offspring. Said genetic material has now spread across the Netherlands; meaning its citizens will probably continue to pass on the towering characteristic. While the Dutch are certainly at the peak of global statistics, it should be mentioned that most of the world has enjoyed an increase in stature over the last century; with improved health-care, nutrient, and sanitation believed to be key drivers behind this change.

A Brazilian guy whom I was welcoming to my city could not resist saying \u201cHoly damn, the people here are giants!\u201d He found it quite awkward too. He came here partly with the intention to find a beautiful Dutch girl, but he didn\u2019t take into account that girls here are, of course, towering over him too. He found himself being a very short person, which, he feared, was a bit awkward with the girls. A Russian guy who came here for a big progressive metal festival, which I would attend with him, complained that he never had to stand on his toes in concerts. In Russia he\u2019s a tall guy (and he isn\u2019t short too). Yet it would happen to us that a line of tall boys were just standing in front of us. Yeah, guys over 2 m of height isn\u2019t a rarity here. Myself, I am 1,87 m, yet I don\u2019t consider myself a tall person. Too many friends are much taller than me, and even I have dropped the joke \u201chow\u2019s the weather up there?\u201d a few times. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not all people are tall in the Netherlands. But if a male is shorter than 1.75m (5ft9) in general he is considered clearly shorter than average. For females 1.60 or less (5ft3) is considered short. In the United States the average height is 1.76m for males and 1.63m for females. So if you are average in the US you are short in the Netherlands, and from their perspective a majority of the Dutch people are tall i guess. But not all of them, there is no country where there are only giants except in fairy tales. ",
