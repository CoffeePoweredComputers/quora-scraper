            "answer_text": "\"According to a study, You are more likely to memorize what you've written if you write in blue ink.\" I really doubt this. That said I think the most important thing is how well a pen writes. I recall a looooooong time ago being on a beach in Traverse City Michigan and wanting to write a letter to a female acquaintance about how wonderful it was - waves crashing on the beach, a cool breeze blowing from offshore, that salty smell, the warm sun on my back, my toes dug comfortably in the sand. Feeling inspired and eloquent. I got out my notebook, clicked my pen, and began writing: \u201cDear Samra, Well here I am on a beach in Traverse City (the pen started skipping) \u2014 with a damn pen that won\u2019t write\u201d\u2014 !). (I still have that unsent letter somewhere. It\u2019s in blue ink. And I remember it.) Let me qualify the \u201cblue ink\u201d statement at the beginning and suggest that there are other factors so much more important that they probably overshadow the color of the ink you use to take notes! Here\u2019s an experiment: Copy a couple of paragraphs from a classic, say A tale of two cities, one in black ink and one in blue ink. Give the blue ink copy to 5 randomly selected friends equated on intelligence, age, etc. Do the same for the black ink copy. Then compare how long it takes each to memorize and recite the paragraphs with no errors. Then statistically analyse the results. I\u2019ve got an idea! Why don\u2019t you google this: \u201cBlue ink vs. Black ink memorizing\u201d? I\u2019m done! ",

            "answer_text": "I wonder if you are looking for a pen color or a protocol. I\u2019m not aware of any study as such; in my worklife I generally have 3\u20136 different positions for a as many clients open simultaneously; I use whichever pen I have at hand\u2026and the pen might have anything from a deep blue through a blue-black to a black (with the occasional red or orange) and/or a computer-based file. The positions are quite heterogeneous, very little in common, other than they will all need at least some sort of Bachelor\u2019s degree. As note, there are color coding systems that might work. However, there are three protocols I\u2019ve found useful in the situation(s) to which you allude. The first is MIND-MAPPING. This can be done manually or with a number of free or purchased computer applications. Some folks liken it to free-form outlining or avant-garde project management. I think of it as linking for tangential thinkers. Wikipedia has a fairly decent overview and if you search on \u201cmind-map freeware\u201d there are a couple of articles to guide you.Mind map - WikipediaThe second is to modify some of the concepts of THE PHOENIX CHECKLIST by Campbell. Apocraphally this concept was developed out of CIA/Black Ops protocols on how to assess a situation and plan an action/response. As I have read and begun to understand the concepts, there are methodologies in the beginning phases\u2014the information gathering phases\u2014that I\u2019ve started to adopt in my work.Amazon.com: The Phoenix Checklist: Turning Complex Problems into Simple Solutions eBook: Joseph Campbell: Kindle StoreThe third protocol I use is a quick reference system and this is a two-parter. I know I have a great concept memory and can get along on that pretty much 85% of the time. The devil, for me, is the 15%Mental hooksMicrosoft OneNote (I use this constantly) or Evernote (I used to use this prior to OneNote).These are not as complicated or daunting as they seem; each one is fairly intuitive. Between the three, it took me maybe a total of 2 hours to integrate a system. Hope this helps\u2026 ",
