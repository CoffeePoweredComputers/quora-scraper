            "answer_text": "Good question. I may have termed or at least popularized the phrase \u201cKiller Ending\u201d in my DVD called Killer Endings. A Killer Ending is when the goal and the need unify in the climax into one succinct action. The growth the character needs to achieve his character arc is what he or she needs to attain the goal (save the day, get the girl, defeat villain, etc.). You want to align the external journey of \u201cstory\u201d with the internal emotional journey of the character. Scenes have to \u201cturn\u201d or change both story and character. A Killer Ending does this too. You create an ending that simultaneously addresses the story and the character. This is the classical Hollywood narrative done well. This is your typical \u201chappy ending.\u201d You can play with this to create other sorts of ending. A tragedy is when the character flaw weighs on the character so much that they don\u2019t get the goal and are wounded and destroyed by the attempt. A \u201cbittersweet\u201d ending is when a character has the character arc and growth, i.e., they learn the lesson, but they don\u2019t attain the goal. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll do my best to answer this question but I\u2019m not sure if it is what you\u2019re looking for. A good ending should be directly connected to the beginning and grow organically from everything leading up to it. Most movies are about characters growing and changing. You can almost think of it as a \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d ad. If a character is a certain way at the beginning of a movie, the character will often be the opposite at the end, usually improving. If you\u2019re talking about having a surprise twist at the end, just make sure that it doesn\u2019t come out of the blue like a deus ex machina. The hints and clues should be hidden in plain sight, embedded into your plot but not so obvious that they\u2019ll ruin the surprise. ",
