            "answer_text": "Yes, tense does matter while writing a poem. Let me explain it via an example. Consider a situation where you are writing a poem on a boy and a girl who are in love. (I know this topic is widely pet. Forgive me here.) So let's just say that you are writing this poem with the point of view of the girl. (as I'm a girl it makes it a lot easier to consider that way. Sorry for being so selfish xD) so now you start off with- 'never had I been so lost. Never have I felt so lovely. Never having seen such beauty.\u2019 I know it sounds cheesy. But just look at the difference in tense and the incongruous tone the poem seems to convey. (It isn't even feeling like a poem to me now.) Now, let's alter the poem considering the tense of the verbs and see how it looks. \u2018Never had I felt so lost,never had I felt so lovely,never had I seen such beauty.\u2019 This feels more like a(to be) poem. There are instances when we do not realize the difference in rhythm caused due to faulty use of tenses in a poem but it still does exist. All you need to do is remember the different rules of tense of verb that are applicable on prose and use them the same way on poetry. Poetry is no excuse for faulty grammar. However there's no such hard and fast rule of following the norms of Grammar. Do it your way. Poetry is expression as long as it makes sense and conveys enough. You can experiment and explore your ways. Randomly placing a couple of words in stanzas, making no sense at all is not poetry. ",

            "answer_text": "Tense is the grammar-ization of time. The basics are often all you need: past, present, future. Poets have used verb tenses to manipulate time in their poems. Tenses ease the reading and gives the reader a feel about when is the poem happened. Is it a record of events or a future fantasy? Grammar might be intimidating and complicated, but we need it in order to perform. But there had been poets who have experimented with grammar use and succeed. There is no hard and fast rule about following rules while you write poetry. E.E. Cummings didn\u2019t used capital letters at the start of a line. Shakespeare ended sentences with a preposition. So try it out yourself. Walk on the tight rope of rules or take a leap and see if you can fly. ",

Either you feel something from past or present.. You feel for someone and you are writing for them. That's s the only fact. Poems are emotions that you feel for someone special to you. If I remember someone from past or I feel someone from present it doesn't matter while writing.. So don't be confused just write your stuff.. And feel proud while sharing same ",
