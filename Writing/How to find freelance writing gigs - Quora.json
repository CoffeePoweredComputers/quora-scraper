            "answer_text": "I find my clients by reaching out to them mostly through social media, and most of my current clients were referred to me. The two questions I see and hear most often is \u201cHow do you find clients?\u201dand \u201cDo you use Upwork?\u201d These are two separate questions, and I am going to briefly address the latter first, as it is an easy answer for me. I do not use ANY content mill sites. No Upwork, Elance, Fiverr, etc. I have seen on Reddit that some freelancers have had success and are able to mine through the bad clients and find great projects and clients on those sites over time. I, however, am not one of them. I attempted to use Upwork when I first started, since so many people give the advice to use it \u201cto build a portfolio.\u201d And I think we all know I hate that people keep getting told that. You don\u2019t need a portfolio! I still don\u2019t have one! I gave it a shot, and I was horrified by the sheer amount of clients looking for \u201c2500 words for $25\u201d or \u201c2 cents per word, no negotiation.\u201d To me, content mills feel like a race to the bottom. A horrific perpetuation of a cycle for lowest bidder. If no one were to WORK for 2 cents per word, then no one would only OFFER that low pay. It\u2019s hard because when you first start out, you think you don\u2019t deserve much, since you\u2019re inexperienced, and it\u2019s incredibly common for freelancers, especially writers, to severely undervalue themselves. I\u2019ve been there. Since writing comes fairly easily to me, I was not really putting a fair price on my work and my time. Pricing yourself fairly to YOU is important!  As soon as I say I don\u2019t use content mills, as they just do not work for me and my business, the next question is always \u201cThen how do you find clients?\u201d Great question! My current monthly clients (my business model is monthly retainers for stability and then always having a project or two on top, for diversity and fun) were referrals. But my projects come from all over! I have gotten a couple clients from Reddit, answering ads from people looking for writers, and maybe 2\u20133 who found me through my website or from reading my book. The majority of my clients came from social media. One of my main clients right now originally came through Instagram. The easiest way to start using Twitter and Instagram more effectively is to start using relevant hashtags ASAP. They are searchable and followed by many people as a way to get exposed to new content. On Instagram, you can have up to 30 hashtags per picture, and on Twitter, your only limit is the 140 characters. You want to use relevant hashtags and not just popular ones if they don\u2019t fit the content, as that is an easy way to get people to ignore you. Use good pictures. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are selfies from your phone, try to take a decent picture that isn\u2019t blurry or too crowded or anything. Instagram in particular is a very visual platform. Also, be yourself. I post everything from food I cooked, my cat being cute, blogs I wrote, and random things from throughout my day. I am not just looking for random followers, I am being myself and showing who I am. So, now that you\u2019re using the platform correctly and continuing to build your account, how do you find clients? You can direct message anyone on Instagram and tweet at anyone on Twitter. Every single time anyone liked or commented or followed my account, I checked their page. If they had CEO, founder, entrepreneur, public speaker, etc, any of those types of titles, I sent them a quick message: Hi! My name is Jyssica Schwartz and I am a writer and editor based in NYC. I\u2019d love to talk to you about helping you with blogging, website and ad copy, ghostwriting, articles, or book editing. I can provide you with writing samples as well. I got a surprisingly high number of responses. Most of them were along the lines of \u201cYou\u2019re a writer? That\u2019s cool!\u201d or \u201cHow much do you charge?\u201d For the first, I said thanks and we often had a conversation. That is one more follower on social media and potential reader of my books and blogs, or even possibly a client in the future. Be nice to everyone, you never know when they will pop back up. For the second, I started asking questions and explained that prices depended on the work. After all, I can do per-word, per-project or monthly pricing, and it includes different things and amounts of time. In fact, I\u2019d love to talk about it. What is your email address? I\u2019ll send you a couple writing samples and we can schedule a time to chat about your business. This works well for me. I have a conversational approach, and once I get people on the phone, I do well. People tend to like me and I know how to ask questions and laugh with them and understand what they need without them ever fully explaining it. In fact, my background in sales and business has been extremely helpful in my writing career. I have no problem at all reaching out to strangers. They are welcome to ignore me, respond, block, whatever they want. But how are people supposed to find me? By magic? 99.9999999999999% of people in the world don\u2019t know who I am. It is up to me to promote myself. No one is going to do that for you. Sure, they might read your article or share your post now and then, but everyone is the hero of their own book and it is important for you to take control of your life and your business and go get clients. For me, the hardest part was getting to the point where I felt I was getting compensated for my time. It was a bit of trial and error, seeing how long things took me versus how much I was getting paid. I do not go below 12\u201315 cents per word for individual blogs and articles. Do I get some push back? Sure, sometimes. But for every \u201cThat\u2019s way too much! You just lost out on a customer!\u201d (Gee, sounds like I kind of dodged a bullet\u2026) I also get a \u201cThanks so much, you\u2019re amazing to work with. I appreciate you!\u201d You can\u2019t please everyone, so start with yourself. (Also, don\u2019t ever work for free. Ever.) Reach out to people directly. Social media has made it so easy to get out there and introduce yourself to people\u200a\u2014\u200ause that! ",

            "answer_text": "Use Your Existing Connections As humans, we all have our little spiderwebs of personal connections. You know people. People you went to school with. Family friends. Former co-workers. Internet friends. And even though it may have been a while since you last spoke to all of those different people, you should check in with your connections to do two things: Tell them that you\u2019re available for freelance writing opportunitiesSee if they need help in that department, or if they know someone who doesWhy? Because it\u2019s far more likely to land a gig based on a personal referral than almost any other medium. Do I get work through my website and social media? Sure. But 9 times out of 10, the freelance writing jobs that pan out are the ones that come through past and current clients. Touch base with your people and re-introduce yourself in this new capacity. It\u2019s not desperate. It\u2019s part of being a responsible businessperson. Join a Group of Fellow Freelancers There are so many different Facebook groups, Twitter chats, Slack groups, etc. that bring groups of freelancers, writers, and content marketers together. These groups are places where you can build relationships with like-minded individuals (that can eventually turn into referral sources.) I wrote more in-depth about using Slack this way for Entrepreneur. Participating in these groups can help you build up a network of connections\u2014and freelancers are known for being huge generators of referrals. In fact, FreelancersUnion found that as many as 81% of freelancers refer work to each other, while 52% partner up on projects. I can personally vouch for this, too. I have a small group of fellow writers I work closely with for overflow projects and partnerships, and they do the same. Bottom line: Be deliberate about making friends with fellow freelance writers. Don\u2019t ask for something right away\u2014build rapport, be kind, have real conversations\u2014and this part will happen naturally. Browse Job Boards There are a few job boards out there that are worth checking out\u2014but this is the last place I\u2019d suggest looking for freelance writing gigs. You can waste a lot of time applying for jobs here, and without an existing personal connection, it can be tough to know what you\u2019re getting into. A few relevant job boards for freelance writers: ProBloggerUpWorkWritersJobBoardWeWorkRemotely (often looking for long-term roles to be filled) To save time, be sure you have a standard resume and cover letter you can quickly edit and customize, as well as a web-based portfolio you can reference. Freelance Writing Gigs: People at the Core The one thing you should remember about finding freelance writing gigs: It\u2019s all about people, no matter which way you look at it. ",
