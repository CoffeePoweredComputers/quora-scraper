            "answer_text": "Does journaling make you a better writer? In many cases, I believe that to be true, especially if you\u2019ve been writing over a long number of years. You begin to note your own style, what turns you on, your personal proclivities, probable stories about your family including ancestors, about how you perceive the world and universe and everything \u201cbeyond that.\u201d So much more you gain from journaling; it digs into your mind for those things that you care about and that very well may emerge as part of a story, a novel. Please don\u2019t do what I did: A bit over twenty years of filling spiral notebooks with my writing, a couple of attempts at a novel, one night I stayed up late and burned ALL of it in the family room fireplace. My best friend has never let me forget that. And for myself, I\u2019d give a lot to have those hundreds of pages back just to see who I used to be, what my dreams were, my fantasies and realities. So, please, write on. You realize that journaling doesn\u2019t have rules and regulations. It\u2019s just you free-falling with whatever is foremost on your mind at the time. Always grab what sits on your head waiting to lay an egg. You might visit the decedents of the egg a couple of decades down the line. Best of luck. Shanti. ",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. If you do it daily then journaling is great for building discipline, creativity, and visualization. But you don't do anything to really improve your technique. Writing long form fiction or nonfiction teaches skills such as word choice, sentence structure, plot development, story organization, characterization, proper grammar and punctuation (SO important!), dialogue techniques, pacing, and so on. The biggest problem with journaling is that nobody but you reads it. Without the critiques of others, you don't learn what you're doing wrong so your writing doesn't really improve. Of course, if you don't care about publishing then none of that matters. Let your journal drive your creativity and teach you more about yourself. And have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "I think that writing in any form helps to make you a better writer. The real question is whether it\u2019s a more efficient way of becoming a better writer than other approaches. I\u2019d say that the best thing to do is to do a mixture of things, so journalling can help but you should also read books, attend writing workshops, carry out practice essays and do whatever else you can think of to improve your writing skills.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Writing makes you a better writer. Writing on a regular schedule, like journaling, will make you a better writer because you will begin to \u201cthink in writing.\u201d As you review your day\u2019s events, you will see - more and more - which are \u201cstories\u201d and how best to tell them. Good luck and \u2014 write on! ",
