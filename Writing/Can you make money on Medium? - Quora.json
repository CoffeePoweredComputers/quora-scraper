            "answer_text": "Writers earn between $0 and about $9,000 per month on Medium\u2019s Partner Program. I have been writing for the Medium Partner Program since April of 2018. Every month they send me an email that includes a few facts about the partner program. Here were the three bullet points from the last email: 59.1% of authors or publications who wrote at least one story for members earned money.9.1% of active authors earned over $100.$8,745.25 was the most earned by an author, and $2,203.91 was the most earned for a single story.So over half of people who tried to earn money were successful, slightly less than 10% are earning $100 or more a month (I\u2019m lucky enough to be in this group), and someone was on pace to make more than $100,000 a year from Medium. I can tell you that those stats are relatively consistent from month to month, and if anything they seem to be slowly climbing. Here is the exact breakdown of my journey in the Partner Program:  When I first started with the Partner Program I was relatively new to medium and had maybe 100 followers or so. Now I\u2019m on the verge of cracking 1,000. It\u2019s pretty cool that last month I made $1,200 on a platform that I have less than a thousand followers on (and that I worked on for maybe 10\u201315 hours). The key to succeeding with the Partner Program is similar to succeeding anywhere else: keep at it even when it doesn\u2019t look like there are any results. The more consistent you are, the more likely you are to succeed. There\u2019s a great writer on Medium named Shannon Ashley who is a single mom and actually started writing on Medium after me, but is more consistent than I am and just made $5k last month (I believe she made $2k each of the two months beforehand). She only has 5,000 followers or so. You can make decent money if you are consistent. If you\u2019re interested, I just wrote about my 2018 journey on Medium, complete with an overview of my method and a detailed breakdown of my results. You can check that out here (and be sure to follow me and steal any insights you glean from my approach): My 2018 Journey on Medium \u2013 The Ascent EDIT (1/10/2020): The bullet points above are now a year old. Here are the updated numbers, straight from Medium (this is the mail the sent on 1/10/2020 giving info for December 2019): 68% of writers or publications who wrote at least one story for members earned money.8% of active writers earned over $100.$21,650.88 was the most earned by a writer, and $8,855.73 was the most earned for a single story.You\u2019ll notice that overall this is good news. A much higher people are successful at making money and the amounts earned by a writer and a single story have gone up dramatically. It is worth noting that the percent of people earning at least $100 a month went down slightly. What this says to me is that although Medium is potentially more lucrative than when I originally wrote this answer, it\u2019s a little harder to get over the $100 hump. You\u2019ll need perseverance. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, when you approach it in the right way. First, you must have a business. In other words, a product or service of some kind to sell. You should also have an online presence for that business. So a website and, in most circumstances, an email list of potential customers. Assuming you have the above, here\u2019s how you make money on Medium. By publishing and sharing content regularly on Medium, you get in front of your marketplace for your business. It\u2019s the same with other sites like here on Quora, YouTube, SlideShare, social media sites, and so on. As your audience on Medium builds (see my answer to another question on how to build a following on Medium), your content is amplified accordingly and gains increasing levels of visibility. How does this make money? You use your content on Medium for lead generation (as well as other advantages such as brand awareness) by doing things like: Linking back to posts on your own blog where you have fine-tuned converting visitors into leads for your email list (I discuss the most effective ways to do that here).Linking through to content upgrades on your site - so for example, for some content on Medium about trout fishing (if that fits your niche!), you might mention a set of video tutorials you have on trout fishing, linking back to a page where people can enter their email for access.Offer other lead magnets, e.g. a free email course on something, but lots of possibilities.Attract followers to your social media accounts, who you convert to leads on your list over time in a similar way.By following up with the leads, you convert them into customers over time. In addition, publishing regularly on Medium (along with other content platforms) builds your authority, influence and visibility in general, all keystones of effective marketing today. For marketing purposes, you either work on building authority and influence, or risk increasing irrelevance and declining visibility in the marketplace. Medium\u2019s another powerful channel through which you can do the former. ",

            "answer_text": "How Much Money Can You Make Writing for Medium? \u2013 Medium Can You Make Money Writing on Medium? Medium is the only platform on the Internet right now that allows anyone to sign up, post an article, and get paid earnings immediately. And yes\u200a\u2014\u200ayou definitely can make money through Medium\u2019s Partner Program. The Medium Partner Program has been used by thousands of writers, and it is not a scam (as a few have suggested). However, the amount earned writing for Medium can vary widely. How Much Money do Writers Make on Medium? Screenshots of Medium Earnings In the era of internet marketing and self help gurus, it\u2019s hard to trust what you read online, especially if it involves earning money. So while this is by no means a thorough scientific answer, the following screenshots offer some testimonials about earning potential on Medium. Given that exceptional results are typically bragged about (and would subsequently by posted) I\u2019m going to assume that these authors all experienced at least short term success that would place them in the upper 10\u201325% of paid writers on Medium.  Medium Earnings | Source: Stella J. McKenna   Medium Earnings | Scource: Yann Girard   Medium Earnings | Source: Blake Gossard   Medium Earnings | Source: E Price   Medium Earnings | Source: Medium Mastery Earnings Data Released by Medium Another way to Estimate Medium Writer Earnings is to look at the data provided by Medium. Here are some other stats Medium included on their Partner Program as of July 2018: $2,059.72\u200a\u2014\u200athe highest amount earned for a single story$16,007.02\u200a\u2014\u200athe highest amount earned by a single author9.8%\u200a\u2014\u200athe percentage of active writers who earned over $100Anecdotal Medium Results I\u2019ve only just started writing on Medium but it appears that it is realistic for someone putting in decent part time writing effort to make $35\u2013250 per month. I cannot say for sure, but given that the search algorithm weighs story recency so heavily, I\u2019m willing to bet that a writer that can consistently produce marketable content could earn $500-$1500 per month without being featured by the site or major publications. If you can manage to be featured repeatedly, that is when you have the potential to earn thousands of dollars per month. How are Medium Payments Calculated?  Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash When you enroll in the Medium Partner Program (which is free and open to the public), you can start earning money with your Medium content. With Medium, users are able to read up to 3 articles per month. If readers want to enjoy any content past that limit, they must become a Medium member for the price of $5 per month. When Medium Members clap for an article, a portion of their $5 monthly subscription fee is paid directly to the author. According to Medium: Partner Program writers are paid every month based on how members engage with stories. Some factors include reading time (how long members spend reading a story) and applause (how much members clap). Each member\u2019s $5 per month subscription is distributed proportionally to the stories that the individual member engaged with that month. In other words, you are paid per clap on Medium. Generally speaking, the more claps you receive, the more money you make. Each reader is limited to 50 claps per article (with no total clap limit across all articles they read). The confusing part of this payment system is that your payment per clap varies using a weighted average. Since clap payments are a fraction of a user\u2019s $5 per month subscription fee, users who clap very frequently have lower paying claps than users who only clap a few times per month. This means a single clap ranges from $0.01 to $5 depending on who is viewing and clapping for your article. This assumes the person clapping is a paying member (non paying readers may create a free account and clap however these claps do not factor into your earnings). How Writers Actually get Paid Through Medium? Your Partner Dashboard is updated every Wednesday with what you\u2019ve earned up until the previous Sunday. Your earnings are deposited into your bank account on the last Wednesday of every calendar month. Medium makes payments through Stripe. Should I Lock my Articles and Make Them Exclusively Available to Members? This is a choice each writer must make based on their goals of reader engagement. Generally, by \u201clocking\u201d an article in the Medium Partnership Program, you will receive less views, reads, and overall engagement. However, articles that are not \u201clocked\u201d and are freely available to anyone may get more views but they are not eligible for payment. So if you are a new author it is probably worth at least experimenting with leaving a certain amount of articles \u201cunlocked\u201d to help gain exposure. Remember\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can always start off with an article being accessible to everyone and later choose to make it available exclusively through the Medium Partner Program (or vice versa). Do I Need to be a Previously Published Author or Professional Writer to Succeed on Medium? Partner Program stories are rewarded by readers who believe writers should be compensated for the quality of their ideas, not the attention they attract for advertisers or their status as a previously published author. So, no\u200a\u2014\u200ayou do not need to be a \u201cprofessional author\u201d to succeed on Medium. Do I Need to Promote my Articles Outside of Medium? Medium won\u2019t be the right platform to promote all types of articles. However, certain industries have really great, established audiences. Topics that do really well on Medium include: Life learningBusinessEntrepreneurshipStartupsCultureTechnologyPoliticsEven if you are not publishing articles focused at the above topics, Medium can still provide sufficient traffic:  Medium Internet Traffic | Source: SimilarWeb However, if you really want to boost your Medium article views, I would suggest sharing your article on other social media platforms. I recently posted a link to my Medium article on Uber Vomit Fraud on LinkedIn to see whether it would gain any traction. I was shocked to see that within a few days I had amassed 45,000 views and nearly 20,000 reads: How Sharing a Story on LinkedIn Can Generate 45,000 Views on Medium\nWhy you should post your Medium articles on LinkedInmedium.com So while it is not necessary to promote your Medium articles on other platforms, it should certainly be considered to maximize traffic.

            "answer_text": "Before you know how to make money on Medium, you should know what is Medium generally. Medium is a publishing platform that was created by the former CEO of Twitter that\u2019s officially launched in 2012. Hence you can probaly know how Medium woks?, yes, pretty much like Twitter. Medium offers publishers and bloggers alike to share their works or create new articles entirely. Medium unlike Twitter the only platform offers that allowing anyone to sign up, post an article and get paid earnings almost instantaneously. You can make money once you enroll in the Medium Partner Program which is free and open to public. Making money on Medium - how clapping works: Once you enroll to Medium partner program, whenever Medium members clap a portion of their $5 monthly subscription fee is paid directly to the author. Basically you are being paid per clap on Medium. The more claps you receive the more money you make. However this is where it gets a little bit tricky, users who clap every so often will have lower paying claps than users who only clap a few times per month. Per clap typically will ranges from $0.01 to $2 depending on who is viewing and clapping on your article. Do not use this as a benchmark, but it\u2019s better for you to have general idea about how you making money via Medium claps. Making money on Medium - author bonuses: My friend made over $100 in 24 hours after reposting about his phone garming guide on Medium due to a Partner bonus;  This is fairly new, and you should not only relying on Medium bonuses as reliable source of income because Medium editors will only be rewarding bonuses to a few dozen stories every week as they explained in a Partner program to my friend\u2019s email. Over 48% of authors who wrote at least one story for members earning money. The average around $77 per month. The most Medium make from a single story was $1,700++ and a single author can earn up to $7000 and more. The benefits of Medium - traffic and reach for bloggers: Medium one of top 300 most popular website in the world in terms of traffic and ranked 137 in the United States. Medium draws more than 60 million monthly readers and while their algorithm that wasn\u2019t fully understood. It\u2019s clear that Medium is a powerful blogging platform with incredible potential.  When you examine a breakdown of referral traffic for a Medium article, a few things are also apparent:  You can see there a variety of referral sources contributed to views as per my friend\u2019s article and provided a noticeable spike in viewership. Medium pushed those content to more readers by having the article trend on the entrepreneurship section of the website. Additionally, other outlets like smartnews also decided to direct readers to the article. It is hard to compete with Medium\u2019s algorithm and massive amounts of monthly traffic if you\u2019re just starting out. Importing stories to medium: Medium allows bloggers to import past stories onto their platform, allowing them to maintain control their content based on their own blog while benefiting from Medium\u2019s massive amounts of monthly traffic. Importing content to Medium is really a form of content syndication: the process of making existing content available on other platforms. rel=canonical tag essentially crucial here because it tells Google that your original article maintains ultimate authority over the website that houses imported content. Which means Google will put your blog as main in the SERPS not Medium. Consider the use of rel-canonical tag, there\u2019s no reason not to import your blog posts to Medium. You can earn money, drive additional reach and even grow your blog in the process as your Medium followers trickle over your original blog. After all that you might be eager to start your own Medium account and if you ever need some sort of booster to your Medium profile quickly you may opt on hiring a credible marketing service site. Usually they can help to promotes your stories posted on Medium. Large number of Medium followers and claps together with other engagements help stories to get ranked higher in readers feed and help it to go on trend!. In short, here are some of my suggestions for using Medium alongside your own website: Create a professional Medium profile - include your picture, credentials, interests and purpose you write on Medium Import your best articles - start out by importing an article or 2 to Medium. Tinker with the algorithm - if some of your work isn\u2019t receiving viewership after a few days, just delete the story and re-import it. Medium do not care if you do this, and republishing a story might place it in front of the right set of eyes. Treat Medium like a partner blog - Do not be afraid to outbound link to your own blog or website, or link to other great articles on the web. Medium doesn\u2019t like overly pushy affiliate links or tonnes of links in general, bu t can get away with a few. Hope this is fairly helpful for you ",

This is a screenshot from my analytics on Medium. I do have 3 articles posted in 3 months. And as you see. 0 views. So if you want to start to publish articles, be prepared to promote them. What you can suggest? Use Quora instead. Here is a screenshot of my stats on Quora for last 30 days  11 000 views. With zero promotions. And over 150 leads generated. Of course, Quora doesn\u2019t pay me. And Medium doesn\u2019t. No views to pay for! Even I do have a valid Stripe account. Problem is that Medium I need to put much more effort into promoting. As you see from stats. Medium has 0 views in the past 30 days, but Quora over 11 000 in the same time period. How then you are monetizing your content on Quora? It is actually a very simple method.

I\u2019ll just include a few aspects of the Medium platform to outline how it can be used to make a living, specifically for the purpose of answering your question. Medium\u2019s payout is based on a reader\u2019s membership fee. These fees are distributed to writers that the readers engage with based on reading time + claps, applying only to \u201clocked\u201d stories. There are also opportunities to make money through affiliate marketing. On Medium you can also create Mailing List through which you develop subscribers who you can market to in order to earn money. You can market to these subscribers via a call to action ling within your articles. Your earning potential will depend on the number of subscribers. Earning potential is based on the quality of your writing and the number of engagements you content attracts. You can visit Medium\u2019s site for details about the jargon used to identify sections of the platform that highlight methods of payment. This is just a short paraphrase of how much I learned about Medium in my short research. I\u2019m sure that there are plenty of details that I\u2019ve left out.

The feeling things are going to snowball, if I keep pushing just a little harder.  Besides\u2026 \u2026it\u2019s infinitely more than Quora has ever paid me! :) ",

So, if you want to make money, your writing has to be something others want to read\u2014and the more others, the better. You might gain popularity by offering unique insights, being a particularly skillful storyteller, or writing about controversial or high-interest topics. You can also employ distribution methods such as social media promotion to drive more traffic to your content on Medium.

You can earn money from their MEDIUM PARTNER PROGRAM  Writing is a serious business, one who wants to earn money from writing you must be very proficient writer and you should able to select the topics that readers are more interested in. If you are not proficient, keep writing one day you will.  If someone are writing for their joy or passion for writing then, I do not think one would expect the money, if the money generates from their writing passion then they will be more than happy to accept it. If you are thinking to write for earning money then one should find the topics related readers perspective.  Yes, find some topics which can go viral, and write different from other existing writers and make money It is a very long path and process to reach that level. I wish you best of luck. ",

This means you write an article and you select the partner program from the drop down menu before you publish it. If that story meats the editorial standards, like impressing the English teacher at school then they can recommend it to other readers. When subscribing members applaud your story you make a little money. You really don't make that much, If someone is a $5 dollar a month member and only clap for your article you will get the $5 dollars. If someone claps for 500 articles then you will get 1 penny.

So, if your article get 1000 views and it get 500 ad impressions, then you will make money based on those ad impressions and what cpc you get out of those ad impressions. In the end, I just want to say it to you, if you\u2019re planning to spend time on medium, then you should do it now. I\u2019m too trying medium to spread knowledge and to get some extra attention in this online world. Thanks :) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can. If you are a consistent writer that offers valuable content that is fresh, relevant, unique. You can definitely make money on Medium. Also, you have to know how to promote your work on other social media platforms. You also have to know how to do long tails keyword search. Learn SEO and storytelling techniques when writing your blog posts and articles. At first, it\u2019s hard to make money because you have to grow your audience. Once you establish yourself as a writer, your earnings will have no limits. You can also use Medium as a portfolio for your sample work. I hope this helps. ",

And to be a top writer (in terms of popularity and earnings, not in terms of the Top Writer award, which has no value at all) you have to publish daily and be an outstanding writer and blogger. Also, your topics, profile, and voice will matter. You have to stay in line with the taste of Medium editors. It may be intentional or it just happens out of lucky alchemy, but writing outside potential curation usually just ends in nothing. You can try, of course, but be aware that it\u2019s not hard; It\u2019s way beyond hard. ",

In data science, it means writers with less exposure to real data science practice, and more juniors. Also, given the small amounts Medium pays, it attracts beginners and students. Indeed, many of the articles posted on Medium are from beginners and not from professional, experts in their fields. Such professionals would expect to be paid $500 - $1,000 per article to spend their time on writing. Some can\u2019t do it at all because they work for companies and can no disseminate what could look like trade secrets. In short, Medium\u2019s business model result in poor content. They surely have a few experts on payroll, who write great stuff, and the result is probably something like this: 1% of the content is great, 99% is of little value. ",

This service is only available in the following countries- Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, USA, and a few others. If you're a resident of any of the aforementioned nations, you are eligible to enroll for the Partner Program. If you are a writer from outside USA, you can set up a payment route using 'Stripe'. You will paid on the basis of how readers liked your story and not the advertiser's preference, which is a neat little detail to add. With the help of this program, you can turn your hobby into a source of income as long as you're good at it! Hope this was helpful.
