            "answer_text": "For me, poetry has beauty when it enriches, simultaneously, my intellectual and emotional awareness. It manages to do this primarily by using powerful imagery to advance metaphorical language that offers much more than the images themselves. Consider the way imagery supports the personification of \u201ctime\u201d in this final stanza of Dylan Thomas\u2019s poem \u201cFern Hill\u201d, which is written in the first person voice of an adult remembering childhood: \u201cNothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take meUp to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,In the moon that is always rising,Nor that riding to sleepI should hear him fly with the high fieldsAnd wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,Time held me green and dyingThough I sang in my chains like the sea.\u201d You will notice that your imagination can \u201csee and hear\u201d the images in the stanza. You\u2019ll also notice that the images are not isolated from the poem\u2019s overall meaning. For example, the initial image \u201clamb white days\u201d conveys more than just a pleasant picture of white lambs on spring days\u2026it suggests that our childhood days, like lambs in springtime, have purity, naivety, and innocence, and this idea contributes to the poem\u2019s thematic structure. As we link each image with the developing meaning of the overall poem, our feelings and thoughts become more and more deeply involved with each other, producing in us a mood, a sustained emotional state that inspires us to further discover and explore the poet\u2019s insights into the mysteries of the human heart. We are \u201cmoved\u201d, and are no longer, psychologically, where we were before we read the poem. In the unfamiliarity of this new location, we experience what can be called \u201cbeauty\u201d\u2026a moment in which something new meets something old, and the two joyfully become one. It is a moment in which \u201ctruth\u201d grows in us. In his poem \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn\u201d, the poet John Keats said: Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\u2014that is allYe know on earth, and all ye need to know.' Poetry, then, has beauty because it uses the imagery of metaphorical language to search for truth, and if a poem somehow helps us experience newly-revealed truth, we find ourselves in the presence of \u201cbeauty\u201d, that wonderful combination of thought and feeling that allows a fleeting and perfect union of the familiar and the unfamiliar. Here are links to the poems: Fern Hill Ode on a Grecian Urn ",

            "answer_text": "To me, poetry is beautiful for : Its technical. The way the words are used : assonance or alliteration are some examples and to properly use them while keeping a sense to the poem is a real work. Behind that work, there is a real intention from the poet that sometimes can only be understood by reading it out loud. For example, the assonance is generally used to meant an harmony between the terms in the verse. The words aren\u2019t the only explanation of a sentence, there also is the way it is used.Its structure. The syllables form or the number of those to be more accurate. Alexandrin or other verse metrics give to the rhymes a frame of existence : ABAB/ABBA/AABB. Each verse stays in a very well structured structure, combining with the technical and the sense, hidden or not, it gave us a wonderful result which is subject to multiple interpretations because each choice of fitting can have a purpose.Its musicality : each word makes a sound depending on your pronunciation, the tone of your voice, your accent and your speech rate. The association of those words under the two precedent points create rhymes which are designed to be easily integrated inside us. Don\u2019t you find it easier to remember a song\u2019s lyrics instead of a mathematical formula ?Its feelings. The choice of words describe the writer\u2019s way of thinking, what he bears in his heart and what he meant to express. I find it beautiful the intimacy the poet dares to share with us.Poetry is a meant to play with your language and to exploit it. The language is the assignment of a word to something, an idea, a feeling, an object etc. It creates in our mind a mental structure that leads us in our reflexion and our expression, which is one of the roots of cultural differenciation. All languages through any civilisation has its own poetry, it\u2019s a differenciation point as it is a gathering factor and that\u2019s one of the reasons I find poetry beautiful. ",
