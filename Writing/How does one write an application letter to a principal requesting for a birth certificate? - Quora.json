            "answer_text": "In the state of Texas a birth certificate is requested by application with proof of identity from the County of birth where the original birth document is stored. In the State of Texas, USA, you will apply through the County Clerks Office where you were born. You may be able to print the application form out or download it as a PDF file to print later if your birth county has an official site. There is a fee, the amount is listed on most county sites or the County Clerk can tell you over the phone or in person, or even mail you an application form. There are Identification documents you must provide with the fee upon submission of the application form. If you submit an incomplete application or one with incorrect information, you will be denied as pending. However, the County Clerk's Office will provide you with a written reason for denial and may keep your application pending correction or submission of information or documentation, with a deadline. It is an official letter that comes within a few weeks of submission of your application instead of the birth certificate. If you allow the deadline given in this letter to pass, you will have to start over resubmitting a new application, original State issued identification documents and add the fee again with the new submission. If you are incorrect about the birth county you will be denied without recourse through the County you applied to. Hope you find this information helpful in resolving your challenge wherever you reside. Have a good day and God bless you in your efforts. 0:) B ",
