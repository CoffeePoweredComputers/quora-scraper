            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you have never been forced to use your right hand and it has always felt natural to do so. A switch in handedness is rare, but not unprecedented. I\u2019m one case and I know of at least another one, and I think it also happens sometimes after strokes. I can\u2019t tell you the exact reason, which is probably highly dependent on the individual, but I\u2019m assuming it is a sign of some kind of neurological restructuring,. It was certainly in my case. It\u2019s not surprising it manifested subconsciously, it did in my case too. You have to remember that our conscious mind is only a shadow of unconscious processes, not all of which are mirrored by it. In particular if some process is far removed from the identity you built up, it might try to circumvent you. Also, it is not important how good your writing looks or how fast you can do it, you can train both of those things, but whether or not it feels natural to write with a particular hand (ignore the answer that says you have to stick with one hand to produce a legible script, it is simply wrong, I am a counterexample as are countless ambis). You should know immediately if it does when you try it, otherwise it feels like you running against some kind of block or forcing yourself to do something you shouldn\u2019t. If it doesn\u2019t feel that way when you\u2019re writing with your left hand I say train it. I was able to learn to write with my right in about a month (not perfectly but well enough for it to be passable) but I was a special case. Regardless, it probably won\u2019t take as long as learning to write for the first time. I was able to import a lot of the fine motor skills from my left, which is why my writing with both hands looks similar. That might be the case for you too. Maybe try changing hands every so often when training (I used to do it about every other sentence, but I\u2019m assuming the suitable frequency varies between individuals, each time I change hands it feels like a noticeable reorientation and it\u2019s often better to just go with the flow). If it still doesn\u2019t feel natural to you to write consciously with your left, let your subconscious write left whenever it wants and check up every once in a while if writing left consciously has become more natural or not. Whatever you do, don\u2019t force yourself to only write right. These changes in handedness happen for a reason. Your mind wants to restructure itself, stemming yourself against the tide can only end badly. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe you are really ambidextrous but social pressures cause you to use your right hand. Your parents and teachers discouraged use of your left hand and you found it easy to just use your right so you did. But now your inherent abilities have surfaced. Just enjoy it, it is of no real consequence. While lefties are discouraged \u201cambis\u201d are cool. ",
