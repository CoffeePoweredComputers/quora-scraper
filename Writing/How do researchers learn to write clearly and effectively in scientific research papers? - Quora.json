            "answer_text": "Very, very slowly. I have published a lot of papers, but I would hate to read most of them. My writing developed from paper to paper, and a good part of the progress was caused by the reviewers. If you are lucky, your manuscript will be assigned to a helpful colleague. Sometimes, this person seems to hate you and your paper, but this is seldom the case. The likeliest case is that s/he tries to get you to write her/his style. Before writing, you should draft your main message. What shall a reader learn by reading your paper? After doing so, you may try to formulate further messages. Then, try to write a single page including all parts you wish to publish. This is very hard work, but reading long texts of other people is also hard work. A normal reader will read a number of papers each year but the final outcome is some addition to her/his knowledge, not more. If you are successful, the reader will remember some parts of that single page. In scientific writing, IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) refers to a common organization structure of a paper. You may try to have another structure, but do not bet your bottom dollar that you will manage that. Please always discuss the limitations of your work. Normally, you should be aware of them before writing anything, it is a must before starting a research work. While writing, be aware of the fact that after some time you will not be able to detect the shortcomings of the paper because you know much more about the topic you write. Your mind will always add things that are not included in the text. The best way to avoid this is to ask a knowledgeable person to read the paper and tell you which message this person thinks you are trying to convey. I normally had all my figures interpreted by someone who did not know about the purpose of them. Do not try to camouflage weaknesses of your theory if you feel that there are some. Formulate your hypotheses very precisely and in a concise manner. You should be able to justify your message with a small number of hypotheses. If you need a dozen or more, plesse check whether your message is too complicated. It can be complex but never too complicated for the audience. If you use figures, please consider knowledge about drafting good representations of your data. Books like Tufte will help to simplify your figures. If you submit figures generated by Excel with certain colours, the Editor will be warned about the quality. Most figures are likely to be printed in B/W or copied etc. Check whether they lose some information through such processes. Please decide which journal is your target long before submitting your manuscript. Editors can easily detect that you did not write the stuff with their journal in mind. Some journals may limit the length of the paper. But even they don't, set your own limits. While writing manually, I counted the number of manuscript pages I had planned and took that number of paper sheets to write. If I did not get beyond Introduction and Method sections after one quarter of the planned pages, I stopped and wrote again. Later, I learned typing directly into the file. And I limited the number of pages automatically. It is very helpful to generate a TOC and to check your progress from time to time. In my time as an Editor-in-Chief, I read about 4500 manuscripts out of which only a few had an internal formal structure generated by Word. It is extremely helpful to keep control of the structure.
