            "answer_text": "There are a few, such as Daryl Hannah and (allegedly) Jim Jeffries. There are, however, a few problems with ASD and celebrities. The first is that ASD is \u201cin fashion\u201d in certain circles, meaning that a lot of people with no formal diagnosis in it claim to have it. Though many of them might have a legitimate claim of ASD, there are some that \u201cclaim\u201d it without having been actually diagnosed. Perhaps they think ASD is a way to pad their resume. Perhaps they believe that having ASD makes them extra smart or creative. Whatever the case, it\u2019s both offensive to people with ASD and spreads misinformation about what people with ASD actually deal with. In addition, because it is, for some reason, trendy to have ASD, a lot of people who have no qualifications like to make the claim that past famous people, particularly smart or creative ones like Albert Einstein and Leonardo Da Vinci were autistic. Not only is this not based on any actual evidence, but actual psychologists can\u2019t diagnose someone whom they have not examined themselves, especially if that person is dead. That rule is called \u201cthe Goldwater Rule\u201d. There are definitely celebrities who are autistic. Finding out which ones, though, is usually a bit of a challenge. A good rule of thumb, though: If they are dead, ignore any claims about them. If they\u2019ve just \u201ccome out\u201d in the last two or three years, view them with suspicion. ",
