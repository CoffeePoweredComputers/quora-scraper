            "answer_text": "It\u2019s questions like this which are somewhat impossible to answer honestly and accurately, so, let me explain a few things. The length of the video is only ONE of the many factors, compression method, resolution, bitrate, framerate, all of these are things to consider when determining the size of a video, or the data it takes up. I rendered an hour long video yesterday, it was 2GB\u2019s in size, it was 1080p 60fps, but if I had chosen to render it at 720p 30fps, it would have been much smaller.Now, why does this matter, you might be wondering? Simple, we need to understand the file size in order to determine upload speed, when you upload a video, you are essentially copying the file to YouTube for them to compress further and then make available.As such, the size of the file determines how fast it\u2019ll be uploaded, since YouTube is a big platform hosted by a VERY large company, it\u2019s likely that the bottleneck is YOU, not your computer, your internet. If you type in speedtest into your search bar then you can bring up this website which will measure your upload, download and ping.Upload is what we want to know for the moment, in my case I have a 10Mbps up, ten megabits, not megabytes (MB) So, once you know the size of your video and the upload speed of your network, you can now start doing the maths required to predict the time it takes.Since you have failed to provide any details on either of these factors, I cannot help you here, you can probably find a calculator for it, good luck.

            "answer_text": "How long does it take to upload a 2 hour video on YouTube? It\u2019s impossible to have an exact answer for this question, because that depend on your internet speed and video file size, not video length. for example, It\u2019s the faster to upload a small 2 hour long video than a big one. I don\u2019t know your internet speed and video file size, so I can\u2019t give u an exact answer. but if you want to speed up the uploading process, you\u2019ll have to speed up your internet speed, or compress the video file to be smaller size, then upload on YouTube.
