            "answer_text": " Traditionally, college admissions essays/personal statements are written as a story that show character, qualities demonstrated such as leadership and perseverance, overcoming hardship, etc. That\u2019s the WHAT, or the content of what you will be writing. In order to address the HOW, there could be several techniques you could utilize. Brainstorm-Brainstorming is something we\u2019ve been familiar with since those worksheets we got in fourth grade, but the process can be daunting when you feel as if you have very little content to work with. The quickest way to start the process is to simply take a blank sheet of paper and in the middle, write down \u201cME\u201d, or your name, or whatever the focal point of your personal statement should be. (It should be you.) Then, simply write down words that are offshoots of you. Focus on the positive and the qualities you\u2019ve demonstrated in your life, but if it is negative, elaborate on how that has allowed you to grow and change and develop. Remember: the events in your life are objective. The interpretation of those events become your subjective reality, as you process your life through cognition.Mindmap-Next, take those words and try to find the links between them. For example, if you wrote down ME in the middle, and the offshoots werea) track and field b) NHS c) social acceptance d) AP English composition f) Your family This is quite like a jumble without any kind of coherence initially. As it should be, because you\u2019re just getting started. Now let\u2019s look for the links. I have no idea what your background or personality or how you want to \u201cangle\u201d yourself to the colleges, so this has to be purely hypothetical. These 5 offshoots that I thought of off the top of my head represent sports, extracurriculars, a larger scope of HS life, academic courses, and background. Always think about what your words, sentences, and paragraphs represent. The meaning is more important than the literal words. Now, going deeper, what can we extract from these topics? Sports-leadership, teamwork, dedication, passion, achievement, competition, spirit, growth extracurriculars-going above and beyond, volunteering, sustaining excellence, balancing multiple obligations, potential leadership social acceptance-insight, analysis, relationships, humanity AP English composition-academic excellence, dedication to academics, focus, industriousness, will, interest, potential family and background-Connections, support, love, hardship, learning, growth, forgiveness, understanding Can you see where we can go with this? Layered depth-If you want to get a little fancier, we can go with something I\u2019ll call layered depth, which would be a kind of technique where you go deeper and deeper in a particular topic until you reach something so deep that it resonates and connects beyond a standard essay.Let\u2019s use the social acceptance example. a) School is tough, hard to fit in, like Mean Girls b) Why is school structure like that? Then you notice cliques c) How do people behave in cliques? Each person has a role in each group d) What is the function of each role of each person? e) How can one enter an established group or become expelled from a group through violating social norms From here, you have the opportunity to transition into a more academic and mature discussion of topics related to anthropology and sociology to show that you are more than just a typical candidate. f) How similar are humans to animals in the animal kingdom? Wolfpacks, bonobo monkeys, flocks of migrating birds, etc. (zoology) g) in-group out-group theory (psychology) h) How society functions (sociology) Makes sense? Micro/macrocosmLastly, microcosm and macrocosm can be used to take one tiny microscopic event and use it to symbolize a grand universal theme. Let\u2019s use sports in this example. You constantly finish last place. That\u2019s a normal occurrence. Somebody has to finish last in every race. But how does that feel? What does that mean? What did you do in response? Did you languish and accept it? Did you analyze it? Did you feel inferior? Is Darwinism the be all end all of land, or does man possess the power to harness his or her own strengths to overcome a situation through force of will and perseverance? That\u2019s one example. Another example could be SOMEONE ELSE constantly finishes last and gets bullied and picked on all the time. You, as an observer, do not contribute to the bullying nor do you aid this person. Meanwhile, you observe, and sit, and watch. How do you interpret this situation? What does this mean? What will you response in the future? Will you do anything? Did you feel compelled to help but felt powerless in the situation because of the power of the social situation? Or did you accept that such is life and one person can only do so much? These are the questions that will reveal your character, and the way you present your answers is the revelation of your own nature. There is no falsifying of content because you are who you are and nobody else. And nobody can be you. But just know that every instance, moment, event, or situation, no matter how mundane (such as Newton\u2019s apple falling from a tree), or cataclysmic (natural disasters, the terror you see in the news ever day), can represent and symbolize the essence of who you are. If you can present it well enough, and it\u2019s a good fit with the school, luck will be on your side. On that note, there will always be a factor of luck. But that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have the means to put yourself in the best position to become the best that you are capable of becoming. ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot write on your own topic. You will be responding to essay prompts posted by the college (application tool) and your response (in the form of essay) should be aligned to that. Example, https://recsupport.commonapp.org/recommendersupport/s/article/What-are-the-2018-2019-Common-Application-essay-prompts-App What are the 2018-2019 Common Application essay prompts? The 2018-2019 Common Application Essay Prompts are as follows. 1. Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story. 2. The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience? 3. Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome? 4. Describe a problem you've solved or a problem you'd like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma - anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution. 5. Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others. 6. Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more? 7. Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design. ",
