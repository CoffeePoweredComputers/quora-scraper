            "answer_text": "Ideas are worthless. The value of a story is in the execution. As long as you take the premise of the story and put your own spin on the execution, that\u2019s called writing. Think about how every science fiction or fantasy TV series in recent years has a few \u201cstaple\u201d episodes. The \u201cbody swap\u201d, the \u201cit was a dream/psychosis all along\u201d, the \u201ctime loop\u201d, the \u201cevil twin\u201d, the \u201ceveryone lost the last few days\u201d amnesia. The premise gets recycled over and over again, but each show executes it differently. My writing group used to do a short story challenge every quarter. We would each take a prompt and write a story based on that prompt. Sometimes, we would draw lines out of a hat, or play a game to give everyone a unique starting point, but usually it was a picture, song, phrase or premise that we all started with and had to write a short story on. With 8\u201310 speculative fiction writers, we never saw two duplicate stories. We never saw two similar stories. We would start with \u201cIt\u2019s a holiday morning and an unexpected gift shows up,\u201d and get a frazzled mom with a baby fox, an alien on a spaceship trying to date a human, and a dead man trying to communicate with his mourning girlfriend. Don\u2019t worry so much about the source of your ideas - worry about how you write them. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: No. \u2026 as long as you create a unique story from that premise. There are relatively few story premises, despite the millions of stories out there. It\u2019s your twist on that premise, using your own characters, in situations you develop, that will make it different. How well you do that will determine what others think of it. If you just change the names but keep the same situations and outcome, then you\u2019re ripping off someone else\u2019s story\u2014not their premise. ",
