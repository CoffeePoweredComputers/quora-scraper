            "answer_text": "For writing on any given topic, you must know something about its background. Then whatever you know frames the basis of your imagination. Let your imagination go wild like if you're given topic to write about space you can write about aliens as well as SUPERNOVA, other planets or dystopian crisis. The range is unlimited and your imagination decides the standard of your piece of writing.  Then have the plot in your mind and start creating your story around it. Don't think that what you will write in next chapter. Just focus on the chapter you're writing. Then the story begins to firm around the given topic or plot. Thanks for requesting the answer. Hope that you will find this useful. ",

            "answer_text": "You can improve your writing skills in a given topic by researching on that particular topic. The more you know about the topic, the better content you'll be able to write about it.   2. Practice writing. Having knowledge is definately important but you have to make sure your grammar and everything is perfect.  3. Learn how to be expressive. If you are writing about something educational, you should also keep in mind that what you write is understood by the people who aren't very aware about the subject. It should be simple yet fulfill the necessary conditions of the content. Hope this helped :) Good luck. Cheers! ",
