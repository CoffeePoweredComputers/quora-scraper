            "answer_text": "Do you expect me to say that one is way more better than the other and start fanwars? I\u2019ll gladly not do so. I think both are great at whatever they do and say, we all are talented in our own ways and saying one person is way more talented than the other person just, isn\u2019t cool you know? They\u2019re both very hard-working and professional groups, and deserve the fame and recognition they have in the present. I\u2019m not saying only BTS and Blackpink are the professional ones because they\u2019re certainly not the only ones. We have TON TON of groups who\u2019ve worked hard to get to where they\u2019re now and I feel like some of them deserve the fame that BTS and Blackpink have. Mamamoo are four hard-working women that have great stage presence and they deserve the fame that Blackpink have. I\u2019m not saying that that Blackpink don\u2019t have stage presence and don\u2019t deserve the fame because they certainly do, I\u2019m just saying that Mamamoo deserves to be more recognized just like BTS and Blackpink. Of course, there are more groups who are hard-working and professional but Mamamoo just really caught my eye and I just wanted to state on how they also are very talented. Anyway, back to BTS and Blackpink, please don\u2019t start fanwars between the two because it\u2019s very unnecessary and childish. Both are hard-working groups and fighting on who\u2019s better is hella stupid and just stop doing it because you\u2019re going to get nothing out of it except make new K-pop fans or non-K-pop fans seem that this place is toxic and full of fanwars when it\u2019s not, really. In conclusion, stream ice cream and dynamite or else mona lisa is going to come to you\u2019re house and blast awesome screen awesome camera in your ear, kay? ",
