            "answer_text": "ouff usually i complain about questions being too unspecific, well this one is specific, but could you elaborate what you mean by worse. i guess you mean something like harder to live an ordinary life with. welp it really depends on where you live. i would say in most countries of europe that live in the 21st. century (including but not nesssarly limited to: the Scandinavias, Germany, France, Switzerland, Netherlands, Liechtenstein, Austria and Poland maybe even some parts of Spain.) you would be fine either way, because of the advanced health care system we have here. if you live in a country that has the technology, but not the mature mindset (like USA or Russia) either can make you broke, because someone would have to pay for your treatments (spoiler the someone is not free health care) or you are rich and you can afford your treatment, resulting in a relatively normal life. if you live in parts of the world where there is neither the technological development nor the ideological (poorer countries of Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia (basically everything but China, Japan and South Korea) you are fucked. either people will kill you for being different/not cost efficient. by people i mean your family. its not that they cant love you, its just that they cant afford you or maybe they cant love you, because they think you are possessed. really depends where you live.

            "answer_text": "I get what you are asking, but I think this question does not understand either condition. I would be hard put to determine what mild schizophrenia is, and I know that high functioning autism is not what most people think. It is not \u201cmild\u201d autism. You can be ASD3 with high functioning autism. High functioning autism has more to do with language onset than general functionality. Speaks later than somebody diagnosed with Aspergers (DSMIV) but does have some language. Some papers even explained HFA as autism without brain damage, merely meaning that it is autism without intellectual delay, not that it is at all \u201cmild\u201d in presentation. These terms are bandied about without adequate understanding. So, I don\u2019t think this question is helpful all. ",
