            "answer_text": "I have veryyyy few. *Controversial topic*  I don\u2019t really like Salman Khan except his oscar deseving performance in Bajrangi Bhaijaan. I was a fan of SRK specially after watching Don 2, Dilwale and fan\u2026. but I slowly lost intrest due to obvious reasons. Varun Dhawan makes me cringe, though he was better in \u201cMain Tera Hero.\u201d Same for Hritik Roshan though I really liked \u201cBang Bang.\u201d A couple of Amitabh\u2019s movies like \u201cPink\u201d are hilarious, so is his acting but I don\u2019t actually like him \u2014 I forgot the actual reason but one day I will remember and come back and edit this answer LoL. I suppose we are talking only about actors not actresses.  So my favourite actor \u2014 with whom I dreamt to meet in this life  Irrfan Khan Wait \u2014 there\u2019s another.  They both have produced numerous epic screenplay in the Indian cinema, from Slumdog millionaire to PK. Vs ",

            "answer_text": " well, you can see I added Salman sketch here, that means I am a huge fan of Salman Khan, my neice made this sketch she is just 10 yrs old and even she is a huge fan of Salman, when Salman entered the bollywood industry in 1988 he's first movie was \u201d Biwi ho to aisi\u201d I was not even born at that time. He is my first crush. I remember when I was a kid I used to watch only his movies, eveyone teases me for that. When I grew up I realised that he is not just a superstar but he has a golden heart too, you all know the reason why I am mentioning him \u201cThe man with a golden heart\u201d and it's not b\u2019coz of the NGO Being human, that he runs but also because the actor would leave no opportunity to bring smile on someone's face. Be it playing with kids or celebrating festival's with slum dwellers or painting houses or adopting a family. This is all I can say about my favourite actor, he is not just my favourite, but every one loves him. ",
