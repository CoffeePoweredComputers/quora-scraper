            "answer_text": "Somebody out there could probably figure out the optimal ratio but I think it\u2019s more one of those things you just have to feel out for yourself. Which I know is unhelpful. Otherwise I guess you wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I recently started writing this fantasy thing and for the first several pages I never used the character\u2019s name at all, not once. I referred to him only as \u201che\u201d. That was intentional, I wanted to introduce his name only when someone else asked it, and give the reader the idea that maybe he was lying about his name, in the process. The story is told in 3rd person and the point of it is that it doesn\u2019t matter who he is or who he says he is, because it matters more that we get the feeling of who he is through his actions and his thoughts and all that. I generally think that fantasy relies too heavily on place names and people\u2019s names (especially Game of Thrones, where you end up not remembering who a single secondary character is because of all the names thrown at your brain constantly). I wanted to write a story where names don\u2019t really matter. If you write in 1st person, obviously the balancing of pronoun/name becomes somewhat irrelevant because you\u2019re just using \u201cI\u201d. You could consider switching to first person if you\u2019re having a lot of difficulty. Another way to avoid the overuse of pronouns/first names (which does become awkward after a while) is to write less action sentences (as in, \u201cThen he got up and grabbed a drink of water\u201d) and write more descriptive sentences, as in \u201cThe fields rolled away brown and empty under the cold sky\u201d, or whatever. Then you can go on to ruminate more on the surroundings or go off on tangents. When I\u2019m writing a \u201cpassive\u201d scene I like to drift away from the character\u2019s thoughts or actions and do a little tangent about how the flowers that grow on the brown hills only come out in late spring or something pretentious like that. This will break up your story and make it more than just action and dialogue leading endlessly into one another. Hopefully that is of some use to you. Good luck! ",

I definitely use pronouns and names the most, but if I noticed that I\u2019ve mentioned a name way to many times in the last paragraph, I put in descriptions. It really depends on what your story is about, but I usually put in a: a) description of their appearance Examples: The brunette, the tall boy, the blonde (If the ages of your character are clear to the Reader, I sometimes also use \u2018the older/the younger\u2019) b) description of their profession Examples: The stylist, the bartender, the student c) description of their race (because I mostly write fantasy stories) Examples: the angel, the demon, the human ",
