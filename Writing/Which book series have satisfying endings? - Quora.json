            "answer_text": "The First Law series by Joe Abercrombie.  This is about the best high fantasy series I've read, ever. It's better than Lord of Rings, it's better than A Song of Ice and Fire, it's better than The Magician, better than the Malanzan books, better than Gentlemen Bastard series, better than The Grimnoir Chronicles, it's much much much better than that god awful Kingkillers Chronicles, and Harry Potter.  It has strong, realistic and flawed characters. It has none of the common cliches you'd see in fantasy books, no chosen one, no evil king, no mentor who died so our hero can grow, no damsels, no \"tomboy\" wild child everyone likes... It still has all the basic elements of a fantasy, a rich complex world, various colorful characters who interact with each other in realistic ways (no Mary Sues, no smart assholes everyone somehow put up with, no chosen boy and his damn griffin and owl and every good guy loves him every bad guy hates him for no reason at all ...).  I don't want to get too much into the detail, there's quite a few unexpected plot twist here and there. It's refreshing in a world of special people with special pedigree who win the day because they're destined to win. And what surprised me the most, and what make this book stand out is that, the perceived \"good guys\" didn't win, or more like at the end of the book, you don't know who are the good guys or bad guys. They're just people ...  And unlike A Song of Ice and Fire, where everyone is equally despicable, the book didn't resort to violence or more specifically rape against women to further the plot. Instead of introducing a world of desperation full of horrible people, where no one is worth for me to root fore (like A Song of Ice and Fire), even \"evil\" people in this world don't go out of their way just to hurt people (like Ramsay or Joffrey).  The ending is satisfying not because \"good guy win\", like I said, the perceived good guys didn't win. But it is a good closure, it wrapped up all the plot lines, explain the \"mystery\".  Oh and... This might be a minor spoiler, the \"couple\" you think would totally end up together, they fought side by side, honest friendship grew from their journey together,  very much like Max and Furiosa. And like Max and Furiosa, they didn't end up together. The plot didn't force a romance just so there's \"love interests\" in the story.  It's just a great book series, I highly recommend it.   ",

            "answer_text": "Does it need to be fiction?   Tony Judt's \"Postwar\" has the most satisfying last chapter of any book on history that I've ever read.  Stephen King's \"Misery\" is one of the most \"un-put-downable\" books I've ever read in my life and I found the entire thing from beginning to end to be outstanding.Dean Koontz's \"Intensity\" is the Koontzian = to \"Misery\".  It's thoroughly enjoyable and has an incredibly satisfying end.  Frank Herbert's \"Dune\", \"Children of Dune\" and \"God Emperor of Dune\" have really great endings.  Conclusions to individual epochs in the story, they wrap up their stories quite tidily.  Unfortunately the last epoch--\"Heretics\" & \"Chapterhouse\"-- were intended to be a three part story and the author died before finishing the last and his tallentless, dick-hole of a son tried to undo and one-up his dad.  He failed miserably.  I'm sure he's surrounded by a team of professional sycophants who extol his virtues daily thus insulating him from the utter failure of a human life he is.  Marcus Sackey's \"Brilliance\" saga (a three part series) is well-written and fun.  Nothing tooooooo deep, but still filled with great characters and good, tight stories.  ",
