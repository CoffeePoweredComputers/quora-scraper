            "answer_text": "There are outward signs, but there are very slight covert sneaky signs. They interrupt you quite a bit (they don\u2019t care about what you\u2019re saying or that you\u2019re talking at all)They try to convince you of what you don\u2019t believe - always wanting you to agree with them (in small ways they do this so they can go in for the kill on larger things later)As an addendum to #2, they try to convince you in random ways that you can\u2019t think for yourself so they can later make you actually believe you cannot \u201chuman\u201d on your own and you\u2019re defective. Forget the fact that you\u2019ve survived this long without even knowing them.They take your ideas and make them their own.They bait and switch you. They make you believe one thing in private, then do the opposite in public. They also will convince you to do something and then act like its the worst thing in the world after its done. For example, a husband finally convinces his wife to cut her hair short because she would look so sexy, chic, cute, fierce, all those adjectives. Maybe even that she\u2019ll be his little Halle Berry kitten. Then in public or among friends, he\u2019ll go on and on about how beautiful women are when they\u2019re hair is long and how he looooooves long hair.They love bomb you. Anyone who flatters, says you\u2019re they\u2019re \u201csoul-anything\u201d right away or their \u201cbestie\u201d at an alarmingly fast rate, is setting you up for devalue. They love to put you on high so they can pull the rug from underneath you. Always remember flattery is dangerous. It\u2019s akin to violence. Trust and believe that. And beware of the one who wants to know \u201call about you\u201d and \u201cI know you so well\u201d, or \u201cwow, You know me so well\u201d before a natural passage of time.A person who doesn\u2019t respect you will not take your No for an answer. They will question you, try to make you doubt yourself, and dismantle your sense of reasoning every time.They\u2019re not interested in anything you\u2019re interested in; on the flip side, they will feign interest to bate you in, and then show no lasting interest or no emotion. They shortly begin to act like they\u2019re tolerating you or your interests, successes, etc. They also are not happy for you when you are happy about something.A person doesn\u2019t respect you when they are short tempered with others but nice to you. Also, if you\u2019re only good to be with in private but never in public, No respect for you.I\u2019ll stop at 10 because the list goes on but over all the things, TRUST. YOUR. GUT. If your physiological responses are popping off in a negative way around this person, or you feel red flags, or just that something isn\u2019t right\u2026.You\u2019re right!I hope this tiny little list has helped identify some of things you may possibly have experienced. There are things that we sometimes overlook in the spirit of being gracious or forgiving but the signs are there. We have to learn to manage them or we will end up all of a sudden like the guy who took a nap on a small raft- he eventually woke up and didn\u2019t see land. Stay awake and best to you ***Edit: Thanks to a commenter this list will be extended. By the time we\u2019re adults, we all have observed or experienced some form of these things from the casual encounter with a stranger, to professional interactions, to that of our closest relationships. The things listed are meant to cover some of all of those kinds of relationships. So this might get a little deep but, here we go\u2026 11. A person doesn\u2019t respect you when you see or even detect that downward look, the roll of the eyes, that negative energy, or that smirk that communicates contempt. You don\u2019t even have to be talking directly to them. You can see it from the corner of your eye- You are NOT imagining it. This is a real thing and they know you\u2019re absorbing it. 12. They call you out without saying your name or reveal something very confidential in a public space (whether on social media or within a group of people). This is done without cause and whether this exposes you or not the point is, they know that YOU know they\u2019re talking about YOU. Also, they will have you with them at public events and then actively ignore you. Provable only by you. 13. You tell them what hurts you and they use those very things to hurt you. They like to open up wounds. 14. They \u201ccollect\u201d things you say to fire back at you at a later time, like ammunition. You get the sense that telling them things is unsafe even tho they welcome you to open up to them. 15. You have a strong feeling that there\u2019s a hierarchy between you and them; them being superior and you being inferior/subordinate. When there is no employment situation, its disrespectful. (Even in employment, it can translate to subhuman treatment). But if this is a personal relationship its being done on purpose. They tend to find things you need help with or to make better. Sometimes they outright tell you that they want to mentor something in your life, or that they feel like your big brother/sister. Warning: they want you beneath them. In life, period; and they want you not trusting yourself. 16. They do not respect your boundaries. (addition to #7). For example: If you\u2019re sick, somehow to them you\u2019re not sick enough not to do the thing they want you to do or your level of illness is questionable to them when they want something. They have the overtone of making you feel better or cheering you up but really grooming you to do their bidding. 17. They do \u201cnice\u201d things for you as a deposit in the bank of \u201ctrust\u201d so that they can get what they want out of you. Fake altruism. 18. They Do Not sincerely apologize. 19. They \u201cjoke\u201d with you at your expense. Humiliating you. The same things they like you for, they hate you for. Disrespect on tap. 20. They rope in others to prove that you\u2019re wrong about something that doesn\u2019t merit right or wrong. Or to make you feel like you\u2019re walking around looking and being foolish. In the meantime, they make you look defective to others. They will even get others to do their bidding and appeal to you; strengthening their claim that you\u2019re just wrong. 21. They make a mountain out of a molehill when it comes to you. Always making things a right or wrong\u2026fault or no fault, where there\u2019s no merit for it. They make you feel like other people\u2019s actions, the weather, a circumstance\u2026 is your fault too. 22. They make you feel obligated to cater to them. They don\u2019t say it, but they clearly communicate it. 23. They do offenses with plausible deniability. For instance, they offend you in a way that if you complain about it, they can easily deny it. THEY know and YOU know they did it on purpose but its hard to prove. Anyway, its very damaging. 24. They give unsolicited advice. They use words like \u201cwhy don\u2019t you do..\u201d and \u201cyou should\u2026\u2019 25. When they give unsolicited advice, they follow up to see if you\u2019ve done it. Then treat you like you\u2019ve committed a crime if you chose to do something else. 26. You are treated like the pet of a hot and cold owner; coddled and abused across the board. 27. They ask entrapping questions and double bind you; meaning they put you between a rock and a hard place- damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. Numerous ways this can be done. Either way, your response or action will be wrong. 28. They create drama situations, vilifying you while they play the victim. They do NOT care about your discomfort, setting \u201cstandards\u201d you can never reach and always raising the bar. 29. They will build you up to let you down. Telling you they will do something you\u2019re depending on them to do and they have no intention of doing it all, while having you in wait and on hold. 30. They monopolize your time. They will insert themselves in your space if it serves them. They love to know your coming and going so they can influence what and when you do things. If you deviate, it throws them off and they WILL let you know it. 31. Silent treatment (plausibly deniable- but deserved its own place on this list). 32. You\u2019re at the climax of a story and suddenly \u201cwait, hold on\u2026let me call you back\u201d - or something of the sort. Something could legitimately come up but in this case its a trend that you notice. Not your imagination, not a coincidence. Even still, they can deny it. When you try to revisit it- the long deep inhale and hard loud exhale (Grrr). 33. You\u2019ve worked hard on something your\u2019e proud of or that they encouraged you to do and boom!- reaction of a corpse. Or they give the weakest of responses that actually speak loudly that they could care less; its nothing to them. Or they actually find a fault in it. Well how bout that? 34. They gaslight you, re-write history and have circular conversations where you cannot get your problem resolved. Then try to convince you that you are the one who cannot have a progressive conversation. 35. They say disrespectful things within earshot of you- but deny saying anything when you confront them. 36. They speak too low for you to hear them when you\u2019re in personal quarters. Or they claim to have responded when they didn\u2019t- saying you didn\u2019t hear them. 37. When you ask them to clarify something they say \u201cI just said it\u201d or \u2018I explained it to you\u201d. And you\u2019re to fend for yourself to figure it out. You\u2019ll be wrong. They want it that way. 38. They twist your intent and badger you with noble things (rules, morals, principles)- when you\u2019ve violated none of such things. Just a way to make you seem like you have because you haven\u2019t given them their way. 39. They use their measure of \u201cpower\u201d to sabotage your opportunities while flattering you for having those opportunities (keep in mind, flattery is akin to violence- its aggression). 40. They flat out tell you that \u2018They don\u2019t care\u2019! Listen when they say this in any way, shape, or form that they say it. They\u2019re having an honest moment with you. Don\u2019t take it for granted. They mean it. I\u2019m interested in any additions to this list. It gets pretty intricate. But the heir of disrespect in so prevalent that it has become like the fabric of our everyday interactions, cloaked in normalcy. However, an ancient book does say that these days we live in are \u201ccritical times hard to deal with\u2026men (people) will be lovers of themselves\u2026haughty\u2026unthankful, disloyal\u2026not open to any agreement \u201d and so on. (2Tim. 3: 1\u20135 NWT) Be kind, be on guard, and practice the Golden Rule. We all know how we want to be treated. Let\u2019s extend that good treatment to others. I wish the best to you all ",
