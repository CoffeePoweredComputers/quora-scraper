            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question. The answer depends on what comes before. Obviously, if you\u2019re talking about a contrast, there need to be two things that are contrasted with each other. One of them may be implied because it was mentioned just before. If you use \u201cin contrast\u201dwithout further qualification, you need to have specified the other item of contrast previously. E.g., \u201cAround this latitude, every autumn the leaves on most trees change color and fall off. In contrast, the leaves of tropical plants stay green all year.\u201d \u201cIn contrast\u201d applied to the tropical plants would not make any sense if you hadn\u2019t brought up deciduous trees in the first sentence. The other version, \u201cin contrast to\u201d fits best when the two items are both brought up within the one sentence. E.g., \u201cIn contrast to the Western use of knives and forks, many people from the Far East prefer to eat with chopsticks.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Both are correct; rather, it\u2019s the grammatical structure they should appear in that differs. Trying to avoid grammatical jargon, the standard structures are as follows:\u2014 In contrast to (some particular thing, described without using a full sentence), (full sentence about something contrasting).e.g.: \u201cIn contrast to (dogs), (cats hate water).\u201d \u201cIn contrast to (all my previous dogs), (my new dog turned out to be lazy).\u201d \u201cIn contrast to (my mother\u2019s attitude to marmalade), (I can\u2019t stand the stuff).\u201d 2. (Previous full sentence about something.) In contrast, (full sentence about something contrasting). e.g. \u201c(Most cats hate water.) In contrast, (many dogs love swimming).\u201d \u201c(My new dog turned out to be lazy.) In contrast, (all my previous dogs have been dynamite).\u201d \u201c(I can\u2019t stand marmalade.) In contrast, (my mother adored it).\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Both are fine . When you use 'in contrast,' you should have mentioned something in the previous sentance that you are going to contrast with now. When you use in contrast to, neither of the contrasting phenomena may yet have been mentioned and you will be talking about both of them or at least about one of them later in the sentence. Example: I am moody and irritable. In contrast, my brother is cheerful and tolerant. In contrast to my moodiness, my brother's cheerfullness stands out. ",
