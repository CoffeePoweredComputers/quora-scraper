            "answer_text": "That would depend on how you define \u201cstart writing my PhD thesis.\u201d If you consider \u201cwriting\u201d your thesis to be started with mindmapping the topic you are interested in, then you should start as soon as you start reading background information about your research area. If you consider \u201cwriting\u201d to be outlining your literature review, you can start that shortly after the mindmapping has started. If you consider \u201cwriting\u201d to be typing the actual words that will go into your dissertation document, then you can wait until after you\u2019ve done your research and analysis. If you estimate you\u2019ll have a 100-page document and you can produce 5 pages per day, then you need to start no later than 20 days before your supervisor wants to see it before it goes to the rest of the committee. I don\u2019t, however, recommend this method. I recommend putting it together in chunks and write as you go. If you consider \u201cwriting\u201d to be developing three journal articles that will be combined to make a dissertation, then you can start sometime in your first year of research. I am an advocate of mindmapping and it seems to work well for me and my students. That means starting \u201cwriting\u201d very early in the process instead of waiting until you are in a panic/crash mode to get it done. ",

            "answer_text": "The traditional answer to this question is \u201con the day you begin your Ph.D. program.\u201d That is, the earlier you begin reading the background research, making notes, and outlining the structure of your thesis the better. While this is great advice, most students end up pursuing a thesis topic that\u2019s different from the one that piqued their curiosity when they first joined the program. So, early efforts may not be that beneficial or, even worse, may bind someone to a research issue that\u2019s not very productive. I would suggest keeping an open mind for at least a year. New doctoral students are much like kids entering a candy store for the first time. There\u2019s an array of wonderful things to pursue, almost all of which you never thought about before you walked through the door. ",
