            "answer_text": "It was a time in my twenties, while I was living a hermit\u2019s existence in the woods, trying to come to terms with several sudden deaths in my family. I took a psychedelic trip, alone in the forest, with a notebook, and words kept pouring out. Later, reading what I\u2019d written I could clearly inhabit the mind and emotional space - a very healing experience. And considering the \u201cvoice\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but notice it was nothing like the Earnest Hemingway style that was so popular and strongly considered \u201ccorrect\u201d at the time. It was flowing, loose, extended sentences more like Faulkner than anyone, I guess. Anyway, I\u2019ve written many ways for many purposes in the 40-odd years since then, but that freewheeling flow remains my \u201cvoice.\u201d ",
