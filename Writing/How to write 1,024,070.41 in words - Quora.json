            "answer_text": "Yay! Fun number writing. Other\u2019s kinda have it, but here is the fully formal, correct way to say it: One million, twenty-four thousand, seventy and 41 hundredths. Oftentimes though, we will say it: One million twenty-four thousand and seventy point four one. One thing wrong with this is the and. Perhaps you remember; in elementary-level math, it was hammered into our little brains to never use an and in the middle of a number. What they probably didn\u2019t tell you is that the and represents a decimal point. So by saying that above, you say: 1,024,000.70.41 Doesn\u2019t make sense, does it? Also, to be formal, it is more appropriate to say 41 hundredths as opposed to point four one. But, in everyday speaking, everyone knows what you are saying and it isn\u2019t causing any ambiguity like the and could, so you can get away with it. Fun side note! In lots of other countries, they switch the roles of the comma and period. So that number would be written: 1.024.070,41 They also, instead of point four one would say comma four one. At least in my experience. I imagine that was much more than you anticipated getting, so I\u2019ll shut up now. ",
