Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, uses the abbreviation \u201cJ.K.\u201d- a combonation of her first name, Joanne, and the middle name Kathleen- in addition to her last name. This name was formed after her publisher reccomended that she use a male, or at least a less feminine-esque name. She also has another publishing name which she published a series known as The Cucco\u2019s Calling under: \u201cRobert Galbraith\u201d. ",
