            "answer_text": "In most academic situations, yes. Teachers usually want \"around\" 500 words or \"around\" 300 words. So a \"few\" will unlikely draw a penalty. However, if you are writing for public media, when they say 250 words they mean it! Space is costly to magazines and newspapers. They will usually feel obliged to abridge your work, and you may not like the parts they take out. Whenever you are reading a news story and run across these . . . marks, it means the editors have taken stuff out. It might be a few words or a few pages! If your teacher says 500 word essay, don't try to impress her with 1500. There is value in efficiency. Writing is something like a bicycle wheel--the longer the spoke, the greater the tire. ",

            "answer_text": "It very much depends on the professor\u2019s own rules. In my own classes, students are given very clear instructions: if you are asked to write an essay between 1,000 and 1,200 words, and end up handing in an essay that is 1,202 words long, it will be returned to you for revision \u2014 and then counted as late. A strict word count is the only way to make sure all students are on a level playing field. And if I allow you 3 extra words, why not 6? Why not 10? Or 50? Or 100? And suddenly, you\u2019ve got an unfair advantage\u2026extra space to make your point. By the way, it is always possible to cut an essay by a few words. And it\u2019s a very important skill. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly in the UK, and in my experience, a give or take of 10% over or 10% under has been acceptable. The main criteria for acceptance however, is relevance. Go up to 10% under if you have completed your paper in full. Where any additional words will simply be you waffling, diminishing the integrity of the writing/premise. Go up to 10% over if your topic is complex and you need to be able to get all the salient points in and give each point the appropriate amount of exposure in the paper. ",
