            "answer_text": "Imagine your head is full of rocks\u2014little ones, big ones, pebbles, flat, crumbly, ugly, beautiful\u2026 All of those rocks, regardless of their appearance, are your thoughts and ideas. In my opinion, a poem itself is an idea and therefore is based off of one of those rocks in your head. However, these currently existing rocks have been drained and shrivelled in your mind, overused, rotten, eroding and shrinking. They are old thoughts that you have to take and hammer recklessly into, hoping it\u2019ll turn into something amazing. That\u2019s like dragging out a vague opinion and trying to make it into an essay. It\u2019s very difficult, and because of that, the chances of it becoming a pretty rock are slim. Those poems usually come out as granite or something shapeless, boring, and mediocre. A good poem is a gently lit, iridescent, gem. A bad poem is a crumbly chunk of dry concrete. They are both poems nonetheless, the only difference is that one portrays meaning in a more insightful and introspective way. Imagine if your head is a basket by a river; it contains your old ideas and opinions, experiences, etc. The river is full of new rocks, pebbles, and jewels that you\u2019ve never seen before, and your job is to find one that you are willing to nurture and take care of, fix and add onto without failure. Once a stone is chosen from the stream, I believe you have to commit to it and not give up your choice. The stream represents the outside of your basket, the happenings, the sounds and voices, the inspirations and motivations, the things that flow around you, around your mind, and through your life. There is a limited amount of stones that you can find in your head, a limited amount of imagination that you can draw from your past, sometimes you have to find new rocks in order to make a truly stunning work. Poetry is a commitment to explore the world of creativity, to create something wonderful, original, and yours. To add to your collection, to treasure and to enhance. Poetry is a way to show yourself and others what you think and what you believe is beauty, what you believe is reality, and what you understand to be the rules, morals, and lessons of the life and happenings around you. I think that poetry can be many things, it all depends on what kind of stones you have in your head, and what they say about what you believe. This is only what I believe to be true about poetry, my answer isn\u2019t to persuade you to agree with me, it\u2019s only a reminder that poetry is a wonderful thing, and that we shouldn\u2019t take it for granted or give up on creating it. (sorry if i didnt answer your question clearly, I kinda went loopy on my answer. ) ",

            "answer_text": "Poetry makes us all feel something. As for me, it makes me feel like home. It makes me realise that I'm not the only one who feels so much about the world and emotions in general. Like perhaps I'm not the only one after all. Not the only one who thinks so much about things even though I know it's just a Utopian idea. Not the only one who finds it hard to seek comfort and consolation in the retreating waves of peace and love. Poetry pulls me in a tight embrace and soothes my hurricane of doubts. And when I find myself stuck in a hurricane, swirling around a pile of messy feelings, it dives right in accompanying me in destruction. When I'm at loss of words, it seeps itself in the cracks of my heart and transforms itself into my emotions. And then finds its way in to the cracks of another's heart. It adds music to my sobs and makes a song of my otherwise weightless words. It dances on my smile. It wraps itself around me to protect me from the hurls of reality and feeds me when I'm starving from love. It speaks volumes when I'm the most silent. Its soft and musical voice yells at the world for making me so quiet. It refuses to keep me stagnant and teaches me something new everyday. It disturbs me when I'm too comfortable and comforts me when I'm too disturbed. Poetry makes me feel like home. I love Poetry. And I can only hope Poetry loves me too. ",
