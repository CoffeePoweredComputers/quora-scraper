            "answer_text": "There\u2019s two, but I\u2019ll start with the older one so you don\u2019t get spoiled. Note, the films in question are Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Let\u2019s start with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the redheaded stepchild of the franchise.  The plot: Dr. Jones teams up with his buddies and newfound son to battle some Communists in a race to a ridiculous finale that was well deserving of the original title \u201cIndiana Jones and the Saucer Men from Mars\u201d The twist: Jones\u2019s bumbling sidekick, Mac, is revealed to be a double agent working for the soviets about ten minutes in. Then about halfway through the film he proclaims he was a double agent for the CIA. Oh wait, nevermind, then later it\u2019s revealed he\u2019s been a spy for the KGB the whole time! Shocker! Why it sucks: Mac is a character I don\u2019t know who is introduced in this corny \u201chey this is worse than that one time\u201d manner that instantly translates to \u201cmy buddy here is a good pal who would never betray me\u201d. Mac is treated as though he\u2019s the secret traitor in hiding but the problem is I don\u2019t know him. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s Marion or Short Round or someone who I\u2019m already familiar with. No, it\u2019s some new offhand character who is blatantly going to be a traitor. Not to mention it\u2019s way too stupid and complex. Jones points out at the end that Mac is a \u201ctriple agent\u201d after counting the betrayals on his fingers. If a plot twist is so overdone that a main character counts the amount of times you\u2019ve pulled it, you need to reevaluate your narrative. In that same vein, it\u2019s time to talk about Godzilla. Sorry big guy, sun\u2019s getting real low on these corny twists.  The plot: A scientist uses a sound machine to wake up a bunch of monsters who fight. Godzilla wins. The twist: Vera Farmiga\u2019s Emma turns out to be a traitor for the eco-terrorist villains of the film. Why it sucks: Two words: character motivation. Emma\u2019s motivation for working for the bad guys to wake up monsters is to return the world to a primordial state wherein humans become the subservient species to these kaiju beasts because that\u2019s what her dead son would want. Her son who is dead because of Godzilla\u2019s wanton destruction of San Francisco mind you. Her motivation makes no sense and the twist is hardly interesting anyways. It\u2019s just a way to make her more unlikable for whatever reason. ",
