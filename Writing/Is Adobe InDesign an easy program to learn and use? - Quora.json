            "answer_text": "In my experience no, unless you have a mind that\u2019s already good at graphic design and learning programs to do that. My mind wasn\u2019t & isn\u2019t like that. I also found it difficult because there\u2019s so much InDesign can do, but I only needed it to do a limited set of basic things. It was as if I\u2019d been plunked in the cockpit of a 747 when all I needed was a bike to ride and fetch milk from the store.  747 cockpit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  InDesign screen   bicycle I\u2019ve been a writing/journalism/teaching/copy/content person most of my career, not a graphic designer. The brains of those two sorts are wired differently. For example, many find it easy & entertaining to draw. At the same time many others can\u2019t draw worth $hit, but they can write content well. Someone who does both is rarer. That\u2019s why people who can do comic strips & graphic novels (and do them well) are so rare. I\u2019m a writer. I want to learn to cartoon because I get ideas for funny one or multi-panel static cartoons/comics. But I can\u2019t draw that so they never get made. I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s easier to teach a writer to draw than it is to teach a cartoonist to write and come up with interesting content. I hope that\u2019s true for cartooning, but when I had to learn InDesign I struggled constantly. It was even harder because I had to take it as an online course instead of in a classroom/lab with others and an instructor to help. Even after I used InDesign on the job a few years, it only got a little easier. Now that I\u2019ve not used it in 5 years, I\u2019d be rusty at it, especially because I wasn\u2019t good at it to begin with. ",

            "answer_text": "Coming from someone who used Quark Xpress before Indesign, the answer is a big \"Yes!\". Indesign is indeed easy to learn. This was back when I was in College for design so that would've been Indesign version 2.0.  I didn't use any books, courses or tutorials to learn the basics, just fired up the program and started fumbling around the menus and panels.  Within a day I was re-doing all of my college projects in Indesign to see if I could make them \"better\" in Indesign than in Quark. With all of the great resources out there for Indesign, someone with no knowledge of a Page Layout application like Quark could easily learn Indesign. I suggest you start with the free Adobe Training.http://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/topics.html#dynamicpod_reference_3 If you have a subscription, Lynda has great tutorials for beginners, intermediates and power users. http://www.lynda.com  Be sure to follow Terry White on Twitter. He tweets some really amazing tutorials for Indesign. Terry White (terrylwhite) on Twitter ",
