            "answer_text": "Doing a thesis project because you think its \"creative\" seems like a terrible idea. Do a project because you are interested in the subject, would be a substantial contribution to the field and you think it can be reasonably done in the ~6 years it takes for an average PhD. If the project is creative, great. If not, you are hopefully still making a substantial contribution to human knowledge.  Frankly, the entire point of doing a PhD is to learn how to come up with good projects. Just read a lot, constantly try to come up with projects, make connections and see if you can find holes in our knowledge to fill, and get constant feedback from someone in your field (preferably your adviser or other senior researcher) on your ideas.  Good luck! ",
