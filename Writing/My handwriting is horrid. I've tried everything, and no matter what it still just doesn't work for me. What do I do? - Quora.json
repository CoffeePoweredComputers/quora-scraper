I keep practising slowly and not in a rush until I get used to my reflexes. Another thing that I do is write \u201cAa\u201d in a whole sheet of lined paper and that goes on and on until letter \u201cZz\u201d. I write everything I think and feel in a scratch paper or even tissue paper. Keep practicing and write slowly until you get that hang of it. Good luck! ",
