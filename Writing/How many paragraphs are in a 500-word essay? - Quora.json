            "answer_text": "QUESTION: How many paragraphs are in a 500-word essay? There is no set number of paragraphs for a 500-word essay, but people often create paragraphs containing about 100 words. Usage can vary depending on the content and your audience. Some paragraphs can be less than one line long, and others can be longer than 100 words. Each paragraph should have sentences that go well together. One basic purpose of paragraphs is to help your audience group together like thoughts. Paragraphs also provide a welcome break in the reading so the reader can rest for a second. \u2014Sarah M. 12/13/2017 ",
