            "answer_text": "Before embarking on an academic or career choice, you should decide on a specialty. Do you want to write fiction as an author? Are you poetically inclined and desire a career as poet? Do you want to see your words make it to the big screen as a screenwriter? Are you interested in marketing and want to work as a web writer? When getting started, think about the type of writing you want to do, more than the industry itself. That can help guide the decision about what type of education to pursue. There are two types of writing training: formal and informal. Formal training includes completing a degree program at the undergraduate level. Some writers choose either an associate degree in English or a bachelor\u2019s degree in English with an emphasis in writing or creative writing, while others may choose a journalism degree. Beyond attending a traditional degree program, you need to write. Prospective writers can develop a portfolio while they attend school. Submitting pitches to publications, and writing articles on \u201cspec\u201d (for free), and writing for the college newspaper are three great ways to gain experience and familiarity with the publishing industry. Professional writers in fields such as business, marketing and healthcare can benefit from completing an internship. Internships will provide you with experience, by applying your classroom-based knowledge in real-world projects. Whether it is copywriting or journalism, future writers can hone their craft and develop new skills by completing an internship while in college. After completing a degree program, you can seek out full-time writing positions in your respective industry. If you want to become an author, poet or a screenwriter, the road is slightly more challenging. Typically, your path includes writing a novel, collection of poems or screenplays, attempting to secure an agent, and selling your work to a publishing firm. It can be a long road that takes dedication and persistence. You can choose the formal route by getting a degree in writing which is safer or just go ahead and get in the real world and put your talent to work. Decide wisely. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, writers are born, they don\u2019t become writer! You can become writer even before 12th - you just need to write awesome stuff. In the world of digital era, you don\u2019t have to wait to publish your articles, stories, books etc. - you can do it yourself.
