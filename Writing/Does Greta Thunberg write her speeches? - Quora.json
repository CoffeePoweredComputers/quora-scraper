That she is a 16-year old Swedish girl who has better command of English than a certain American - well, that must must chap his ass. We won\u2019t speak to intelligence. She blows him away. Sixteen years old, female, citizen of one of those \u201csocialist\u201d European countries - and she commands a degree of international respect and admiration which said certain American envies and resents. I\u2019d wager he manifests a nervous tic when he hears her voice. Betcha he no longer wants to be Swedish. ",

This makes her unusual as most politicians get others to write them. Famous examples are Kennedy and Roosevelt. Though one cannot imagine the drivel Trump comes out with was written by anyone sane.

Her message is right on point, her courage is stellar, and if she has the intelligence and ego strength to use advisers about presenting those ideas and speech writers to help her put them down and polish them, that puts her head and shoulders above trump and the clones and clowns with whom he chooses to surround himself. Having said that, I have no difficukty believing she authors her own work from start to microphone. ",
