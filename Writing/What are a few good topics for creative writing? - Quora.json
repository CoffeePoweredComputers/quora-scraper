            "answer_text": "Hi, When talking about creative writing, no one can specify any certain topics which you could write as a beginner. And, that\u2019s the thing about creative writing, this world is so vast that there are not any limited topics to write about. You pick words out from thin air and sew them together into a story. And no matter how good or bad it is, at first, if you are happy with it, or if you are satisfied with what you\u2019ve written. The work is done. Rest, you get better with time. You can write about anything and everything. It can be as simple as a diary entry and it can go up to full-length stories depending upon what you want to write. If you are new at creative writing, I would suggest you to sit in silence, or whatever environment works best for you to think, and except the surroundings, you look inside you and see how you really feel. When you feel something inside you \u2014 anything which moves you, even a little.Words will come to you, and you will have your first story. Easy. Isn\u2019t it? Hope this helps.Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Anything at all can be a good topic for creative writing if it\u2019s done well. Make lists of what interests you, create themes, does a character blossom out of that with a story they want you to tell. There\u2019s also creative non-fiction. Take a writing course, read writing books. Ideas will come to you as you read, or during the course. Jot them down right then, don\u2019t think you\u2019ll remember them later, you probably won\u2019t. When you are writing down ideas on a regular basis, you\u2019ll find that you have times when they come almost faster than you can get them down. Other days, not so much. But that\u2019s all right because if you keep your lists, you will always have the seed of a story idea. ",
