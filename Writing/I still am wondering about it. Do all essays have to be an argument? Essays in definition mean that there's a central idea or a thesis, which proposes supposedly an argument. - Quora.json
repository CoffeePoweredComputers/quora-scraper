            "answer_text": "Thank you for the question. An essay could be like a stream of consciousness without a pre-planned structure but the essay might drift around like a fish in the water and not get to any firm conclusions and will often confuse the person reading the essay. Essays usually have a conclusion that you are aiming for and a coherent worked out argument leading from an introduction. The purpose for this classic structure is lucidity of thought and ease of readability. Otherwise the essay becomes a right old mess that drifts about and confuses the reader. Good luck. ",
