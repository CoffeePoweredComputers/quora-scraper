            "answer_text": "This would depend on what one would consider \u201cbetter\u201d. If originality and creativity are requisite then Shakespeare would probably be considered better since so many other important works of literature have used elements of Shakespeare or even entire premises, the show Empire being based off of King Lear for example. Shakespeare\u2019s prolific career has also allowed him to cover a variety of issues which are still very prevalent to this day such as race relations, class struggle, family, mental illness, feminism, and political corruption. This makes his work universally relatable to audiences regardless of country of origin, class, gender, or time period. Many works since then are quite dated and deal with issues of the author\u2019s present day whereas Shakespeare has stood the test of time up to the present day. This is not to say that no other writer\u2019s work is universal, but Shakespeare\u2019s is probably most ubiquitously known. In addition, so many of our idioms, words, and figures of speech which have become an integral part of English speech such as \u201cbrevity is the soul of wit\u201d or \u201clove is blind\u201d all were first used by Shakespeare himself. He may not be the all-time \u201cbest\u201d writer since quality of writing is subjective, but no other author in English/American literature has had such a profound impact on culture, literature or language as Shakespeare.

            "answer_text": "Are you asking if Shakespeare is better than every single author writing today, or better than most authors writing today. Obviously, no one human being can be familiar with the work of every single author writing today, so I do not think anyone is qualified to answer that question. However, Shakespeare is widely regarded as one of the finest authors of works in the English language, so most people would agree that his work is better than the work of MOST authors writing today. On the other hand, appreciation of writers is a matter of taste. ",
