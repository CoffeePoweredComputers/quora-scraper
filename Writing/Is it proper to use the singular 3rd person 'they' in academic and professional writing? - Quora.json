            "answer_text": "In informal speech you often hear \u201cthey\u201d used for a singular antecedent (e.g., \u201cHey \u2014 who left their coffee on my desk?\u201d). While from a linguistics point of view, \u201cthey\u201d has evolved in common speech in the direction of serving a singular antecedent, that is not the case for academic or professional writing, where \u201cthey\u201d is expected to have a plural antecedent. In college English classes I taught, I would mark incorrect usage of \u201cthey\u201d down, but not in a judgmental way. It\u2019s just a matter of being clear who your audience is and what the standards and styles are for that language. Even in APA, the style for most doctoral work, \u201cthey\u201d has some discussion. See for example Bias-free language which takes one view and Purdue OWL: Pronouns which is more standard. And I\u2019ve seen plenty of colleges\u2019 official publications over the years that use \u201cthey\u201d to refer to singular antecedents. If you use words in a non-standard way, you may lose your audience\u2019s understanding. Even if you define your usage well, you may raise questions in the minds of the audience. In some fields \u2014 like legal writing \u2014 clarity on pronouns and antecedents is critical. In fact, having written and edited a number of legalistic documents over the years as a college administrator, I usually tried to avoid pronouns as much as I possibly could. For example, I wouldn\u2019t write, \u201cThe superintendent is responsible for producing an annual report. The college president will review that report and give feedback. He will present the report to the school board by \u2026\u201d Who is that \u201che\u201d referring to? Sounds like the president, but colleges don\u2019t have school boards and superintendents typically do. (Title vary of course.) Something that simple can and has caused confusion in contracts and agreements, due to lack of clarity on a pronoun\u2019s antecedent. Often when people are thinking plural anyway, even when they choose a singular antecedent. \u201cA man has choices he must make in life\u201d is no more singular in _concept_ than \u201cthe male lion typically lives in his favored savanna habitat.\u201d Those could easily be changed to \u201cpeople have choices they must make in life\u201d and \u201clions typically live in their favored savanna habitat.\u201d In general, it\u2019s easy to avoid the \u201cthey\u201d problem by simple rewording to change the antecedent from singular to plural. Instead of \u201cEach student must have their homework turned in by noon\u201d just say \u201cAll students must have their homework turned in by noon.\u201d That also helps you keep out of the awkward \u201chis or her\u201d or \u201chis/her\u201d constructions. My hunch is that over time \u201cthey\u201d will become more accepted with a singular antecedent, but I would not use it that way now for professional or academic writing \u2014 and definitely not for anything legalistic. Here is a map of gender distinctions in various language that readers may find interesting: Feature 44A: Gender Distinctions in Independent Personal Pronouns.  PS Over the course of my life, split infinitives have gone from being taboo to being accepted in a number of cases, and the use of commas has decreased dramatically (I could have left out that preceding comma, by the way). The rule against split infinitives was a rather misplaced effort to force Latin grammar onto English. The decreasing use of commas is interesting. Commas indicate a slight pause and slightly falling tone (not as much of a fall as represented by a period, though). Is the changing use of commas just an aspect of writing change, or does it also reflect changes in spoken language \u2014 suprasegmental features (or prosody) like intonation, for example? ",

            "answer_text": "For academic writing, it was the custom to use \u2018he,\u2019 \u2018his,\u2019 and \u2018him,\u2019 throughout the text. Now we have reached the age of political correctness, this assumption that everyone is a man is considered unacceptable as being sexist. At one stage, it was thought acceptable to add a sentence in the introduction, explaining that \u201cwhen the text refers to \u2018he\u2019 this is intended to mean \u2018he or she,\u2019 but in the interests of clarity, the original convention has been retained.\u201d I don\u2019t think you can get away with that now. Most writers use \u2018they\u2019 for informal writing, but for formal writing, it would be better to refer to a person of unspecified gender as \u2018he or she\u2019 or \u2018s/he\u2019 or \u2018he/she\u2019. But then you have to use \u2018his or hers\u2019 and \u2018him or her\u2019 and the whole text becomes dominated by unwieldy pronouns, which can be annoying to read. The best method is to rephrase the text so you are referring to groups of people rather than individuals: \u201cdoctors will give patients their medication,\u201d rather than, \u201cthe doctor will give the patient his or her medication.\u201d Alternatively, you can use examples featuring a specific person, so it is correct to specify the gender. \u201cSue found the education in her son\u2019s school unacceptable, so she\u2026\u201d You might use the same examples throughout, for instance by using a fictional family, or use alternate male and female examples.
