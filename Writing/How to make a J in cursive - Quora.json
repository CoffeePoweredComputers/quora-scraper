            "answer_text": "I apologise for the quality of photo, and the writing isn\u2019t the best either, but I\u2019m currently on a moving coach, so this is the best I could do. If you want it in the middle of the word, I\u2019d go with something like this:  That says \u2018injured\u2019 if anyone can\u2019t recognise it. I do my \u2018r\u2019s in an odd way. Basically, you lead up to it like any other letter; there\u2019s a little slope up to the top, then you go down and around in the \u2018j\u2019 shape, but carry on looping all the way around so you can join it to the next letter. If you want to do it at the start of a word, I\u2019d do it like this:  That\u2019s says \u2018Just\u2019 if anyone\u2019s confused. You kind of do the same, using the little run up as the top stroke of the \u2018J\u2019 in a serif font, and looping around to start the next letter, only it\u2019s bigger. Hope this helped! ",

            "answer_text": "Supposing the letter before is \u201ca\u201d: continue from the downstroke of it up to the top of the downstream of \u201cj\u201d, make the stroke, pen off the paper, finish the word, go back and put the dot. When in extreme hurry, the J will develop a loop as you sweep up to the next letter. The style I learned in the 50s was almost italic. Most of us had atrocious loopy writing based on copperplate. It had been taught in old-fashioned schools. Our new lessons tidied it up a lot, while still being fast enough for the breakneck speed of exam answers. ",
