Moreover, people are wise to them, such as this one about lowering their barriers to them giving you their phone number.Just be yourself, try to make some genuine conversation, see if it goes anywhere. Don't pester people and stop once you figure they're not interested.Maybe it will work and maybe it won't. It's okay. There are no mystical PUA secrets. ",
