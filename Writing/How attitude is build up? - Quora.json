            "answer_text": "An attitude usually refers to a set of behaviors, beliefs and emotions towards a specific event, thing, person or object. They are usually a result of an individual\u2019s upbringing as well as experience and their influence over the behavior is very powerful. Even though attitudes are enduring, they can also undergo changes. A number of different factors influence the way attitudes are formed and the reason why they are formed. These include the following :- Experience \u2013 The formation of attitudes due to experience take place directly. They may be a resultant of personal experience that is direct or they might be a resultant of observation.Social Factors \u2013 A strong influence on attitudes is formed by social norms as well as social roles. Social norms are related to the rules of the society regarding the behaviors which are considered to be appropriate. Social roles are related to the behavior that the people are expected to show in a specific context or role.Learning \u2013 It is also possible to learn attitudes in a number of ways. Classical conditioning is often by advertisers to influence the attitude of the consumers for a specific product. For example, in a television commercial you might see beautiful as well as young people having fun on a beach and at the same time enjoying a sports drink.Hope this helps you :) ",
