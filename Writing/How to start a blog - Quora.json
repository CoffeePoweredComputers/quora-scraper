Blog  Internet is exploding in growth right now. More people who are never online. This explosion in growth means more potential readers for your blog. In short, there is no better time than today to start your blog. When you start a blog you can expect the following benefits : 1. Income Blogging can be very lucrative if done correctly. The best bloggers in the world obviously earn a lot, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a good profit if things are done correctly. 2. Recognition No, you probably won't have paparazzi around you as a result of your last blog post. But a successful blog can give you great recognition in your respective field of interest. Many bloggers are known as experts just for their blogs. 3. It's fun! In addition to the most tangible benefits, such as curriculum vitae training and income, blogging is a great way to share your ideas with like-minded people. The problem with free Blogs As a blogger, you have the option of creating a free blog through a variety of websites. This sounds like a great idea in theory, but there are some huge disadvantages to using a free blog site: Problem No. 1: \"Free\" is not free Oddly enough, sites that offer free blogs exist to make money for the company that offers you the \"free\" blog. They don't give you a blog space because they like you. Instead, they make money over time and the hard work you invest in writing your blog. This is done in a couple of ways: They sell your advertising space Free blog sites will put ads on your blog. You have absolutely no control over what is being advertised on your blog and you will not see a single penny of the money they receive for the sale of this advertising space. They sell you the \"improvements\". Registering for one of these services can be free, but you will quickly realize that to make any significant changes to your blog you will have to pay. Do you want to change the design of your blog? $ 50 Do you want your own domain name? $ 20 per year. Problem No. 2: Nonprofit The goal of free blog sites is to make money for the company that offers the blog space, not for you. This means that you are not allowed to sell products or services through your blog . In addition, the company that offers you the blog gets the full benefit from the sale of an advertising space on your blog. As you will see in the step-by-step tutorial, the sale of advertising space is an important source of revenue for most blogs, and it is something that is simply not possible with a free blog. Problem No. 3: Without control When you start your blog on a free website you are basically renting your blog space. Because of this, the owner is the one who has all the power. If they decide to leave you out, for whatever reason, then there is absolutely nothing you can do about it , since you are not really the owner of the blog. To make matters worse, free blog sites do not give you access to the full range of features you need to become a successful blogger. In the step-by-step guide on this site I show you some great tips and tricks that you can use to optimize your blog. Unfortunately, many of these things simply cannot be done on a free blog site. Problem No. 4: Little security The reality of the Internet is that sometimes sites are hacked. Yes, this happens even to new, smaller blogs. If this happens to you, and you are using a free blog provider, the hacker can steal your domain name, which means you will lose your entire site and can never recover it . Simply put, I recommend that you stay far, far away from free blog sites . It's just not worth the headache or risk, no matter what type of blog you are starting. The good news is that paying for your own blog can avoid all these problems, and it is not expensive. In fact, it is cheaper than a \"free\" blog because there are no hidden charges. In the tutorial on this site I will show you my method that costs less than a Starbucks coffee - $ 4 per month. The infallible method to start your Blog Starting a blog does not have to be expensive or complicated. In fact, it all comes down to just these two steps: 1. Follow the step by step tutorials on this site.

            "answer_text": "Starting a blog does not assure your success. Most of the bloggers quit blogging because they don't know how to rank a blog using SEO. Beside this, there are some people who don't even start. It may be due they are not really interested in blogging or they don't know how to set up a successful blog. So let me share my story. There are 7 main steps of setting up a blog or any website. Pick a NicheChoose a Domain NameFind a Web Hosting ProviderConnect Domain with HostingAdd Domain and Set Up WordPressInstall a Good Theme and PluginsPublish Your First PostI have discussed everything in detail in a post 'How to Set Up a Blog' on my blog. But, before starting a blog it's good to have some ideas about On-Page SEO and Backlinks. It may take a year to learn about these two important things. I have shared my own successful strategies, how I write a SEO friendly article and how I create quality Backlinks. This strategy always helps me to rank a blog very fast. (The last one is within less than 3 months) Hope you will enjoy it. Bonus: Ahrefs Vs SEMrush SEO Tools 90% of Successful Bloggers use SEO tools. I prefer to use SEMrush(7 days free trial) for some benefits. You can decide what tool is perfect for you and go accordingly.  Remember blogging is not a game of quick money. But it can change your life totally. So give a start. Maybe you are just one year away from success. ",
