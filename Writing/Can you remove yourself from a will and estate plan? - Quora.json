            "answer_text": "I\u2019m unclear what you mean by \u201cremoving yourself from a will and estate plan.\u201d If what you mean is that you do not want to serve as someone\u2019s Executor upon their death, their having named you as such in their Will does not obligate you to so serve. You have no duty to serve, and upon their death, all you need to do is to formally decline to so serve, preferably in a writing. If what you mean is that you do not want to receive any property as a beneficiary under someone\u2019s Will upon their death, their having named you as such in their Will does not obligate you to receive any of their property. You have no duty to so benefit, and upon their death, all you need to do is to formally decline to so benefit, by executing a document known as a Disclaimer or Renunciation, the result of which is that, for purposes of interpreting the Will and determining \u201cwho gets what?\u201d, you would be considered to have predeceased the Decedent. Note that what you may not lawfully do in a Disclaimer is to say that although you do not want some property, you want it to go to some other specific person(s), such as one of your children. Whatever you do not want, you must give up entirely, including the ability to direct it to someone else. If you want it to go to someone else (who would not receive it as a result of your Disclaimer), you would need to receive it from the estate and then give it to that person, a two-step transaction.

            "answer_text": "In most cases one cannot stop someone from including them in a will or estate plan made by another as it is up to them as to who they want to include. A person making a will or estate plan does not have to remove another person upon request either. When a will or estate plan goes through the probate or estate administration process one call disclaim their devise or inheritance and it has the same effect as removing them from the will or estate plan in most cases.

There are time requirements that you must follow at both the state and federal level. You should retain an estates attorney to make sure you do this correctly and that you fully understand the financial and tax implications of such action. ",
