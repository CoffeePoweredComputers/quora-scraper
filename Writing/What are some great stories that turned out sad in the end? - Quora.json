            "answer_text": "\"Mom , I don't wann'a give it a second thought. I have decided and I am going tomorrow to New York \"said the son . \"But, Where will I go? Your dad is also no more.I can't live here alone\". \"Oh! You would not be alone.I have made a room booked for you in an old age home.\"replied her son. \"Oh okay ....... son.\"said the mother in a hurtful voice with tears in her eyes\"I hope you will be successful in your project for which you are going so far .\" The son straight away went to his room and dialled some number on his phone. \"Hello! I am ready.\" \"But the chances of success are only 5%.\"said the other person on the phone. \"I don't care. I can do anything for her. I am coming tomorrow.\"said the son. \"Ok\" The next day he mixed a pill in a glass of water and as soon as her mother drank it she was unconscious .He took her to a place where he met the same person whom he called yesterday.After some time his mother opened her eyes and found herself in the old age home.  She asked the receptionist \"Where is my son? Who brought me here? How did I came here?\" She replied \"Oh a doctor brought you here but I don't think he was your son and he has left this letter for you.\" The mother opened the letter . \"Mom I was getting late so I just dropped you and I would hardly be able to call you.Now this is your new family and please don't disturb me by calling me on my mobile phone as my number is going to get change. Please take care of yourself and yes , I love you Mom..... I love you very much. Good Bye Your son\" She was crying loudly by the time she reached the end of the letter. She took a taxi and straightaway went to meet someone. \"Where is my son ?Tell me\" She cried loudly. \"What are you talking about ?I don't know anything\" the voice filled with guilt answered. \"Oh come on! The receptionist told me that a doctor brought me there but in the letter my son has written that he dropped me at the old age home. And since you are the one who is looking into all the health problems for past nine years ..... I don't expect anyone else to be involved in all this. Now please tell me where is my son? Is he all right? \"she pleaded the doctor. The doctor sighed \"He asked me not to tell you.He has gone but not to New York . Instead the place from where nobody has ever returned.The only kidney you had was no more functional. So he gave his only kidney to you.Even the chances of success were very less but he didn't gave up.\" The mother was feeling tearful. She told the doctor \"Today I have lost my son , that I got 20 years back at the cost of one of my kidneys , ........ at the same cost .\" (written by Sanchit Minocha) This is my first self-wirtten story and please don't copy it in any sense .Please tell me how you found it.

            "answer_text": "You know, when I first met you, I did not like you at all. I think that was in class 5. You were the new girl, looking around the class confused like a deer caught in the light of a vehicle. You probably did not know where to sit, when the teacher asked you to sit with me. And I despised him for that. She made me sit\u2026.. With you\u2026\u2026.With a girl\u2026\u2026 in class 5, there could not be a greater humiliation according to me. And yet, till today, I wonder. What would have happened, if that day you had not sat by my side? What would have happened, if I had never known, that God had enough time to carve out someone as wonderful as you from the clay of life? Of course, that feeling of enmity did not last. You were much too sweet to despise for too long. The children around used to call you fat. I never know why they did that. You might be a bit on the heavier side, but you were always amazingly helpful to everyone. I still remember Ashish, the class bully who used to constantly tease you. And I still remember the tipping point that I reached with him. And after loads of blows that were exchanged, most of his hitting me square and mine bouncing off harmlessly, I still remember the look of concern on your face when you saw me. Oh, you were angry, no doubt. But someone, needed to stand up to him. And he could do whatever he wanted to any other girl. But not to you. Never to you. I would not let him. And given a chance, I would get beaten up yet again, even if it is just to make a point again. And then came the time, when teenage hit us like a blast of hot air. And suddenly, girls became mysterious little entities, like UFO\u2019s and black holes. And no little amount of research used to be carried out over them, believe me. But somehow, I don\u2019t know why, no girl ever interested me. Except for you. The only one mattered was you. And you, you were never mysterious. You were just, you. The same confused little girl who had been unable to find a seat in a new school, and whose fate the world had very comfortably entwined with mine. No complications, no expectations. Just a relationship which both of us were unaware of at that time. Did I know, that I loved you at that point? I don\u2019t know. Though at some level, I think I did. But you, you never really saw me as anything but a friend did you? No, I guess you did not. Well, I just wanted you to be happy, no matter what. And if, my being a friend to you made you happy, well I would be just that. But you put yourself out there and got your heart broken. I still remember him too. Rohit. That bastard. I found you crying at the terrace of your house, and that was the point I think, I knew I loved you. That was when, I think, I realized, that I could never let anything hurt you, even if it was as simple as a burn or as agonizing as a heartbreak. Especially if it was a heartbreak. I asked you out, you accepted. And life was great. For people say it is awkward when friends get in a relationship. But it was never awkward with you. You were still the same girl, and what was more, now I could care for you and show it in a million different ways. Things that had not been possible before. Things which people had tried to question before. Why is it so hard for the world to understand that a person can love another without any conditions and expectations? I think, that in their hearts of hearts, they want that. But not everyone is lucky enough to even witness it, let alone feel it. And that is why, when they finally see it as a reality, they just don\u2019t want to accept that something as pure as this could exist. That someone could love someone else the way I loved you. The way, the stars love the sky and hang on in a million different points. The way, the sea loves the sand, and constantly tries to touch it and carry it off. And the way, no one, in the world ever loved anyone else. Forever and always, that is what we used to say. The day we finished off our graduations, we went out together for a lovely date. At that point, you asked whether I wished to continue this. And I tried to explain, albeit a bit unsuccessfully I think, that without you, I did not exist. But you understood a bit I think. Because you smiled that shy and relieved smile, which still made my heart feel like melted chocolate. I think you guessed the day when I was going to propose you. At least, you looked like you did. And this time, you gave that all knowing smile, as if you knew something the whole world did not and were laughing at the ignorance of all of us. But you said yes, and that was what mattered. You and I, finally together. The journey of so many years, from the earliest memories of my life to the latest. Forever and always, just like we said. Which is why, I think you can understand why I cannot live without you. And which is why, I believe, you will see why it will be so hard for me to move on now. The journey took its toll, did it not? I guess, nothing can overflow in the universe, not even love. And ours was definitely doing that. At least for each other. Which is why, I still do not know who to blame, the disease which snatched you off or our fate. The only way, I know how to live is to live with you. You were the only constant in my life of ever changing entities. And now, I feel like that class 5 boy over again. Lost and confused. Could we learn to ever live without the person we love the most? I don\u2019t know. But one thing will never change, whether you are with me or not, I will love you always. Forever and always, after all, isn\u2019t that what we said? ",
