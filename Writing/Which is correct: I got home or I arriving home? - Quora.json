I am arriving home. As to your question, whether you say, \u201cI got home\u201d which feels very incomplete, or \u201cI am arriving home,\u201d that depends on what you are attempting to say. You might say, \u201cI am arriving home\u201d if you are on the phone with someone and it is happening right at that particular moment. \u201cI got home\u201d could answer a question. Did you make it home last night? Yes, I got home. ",
