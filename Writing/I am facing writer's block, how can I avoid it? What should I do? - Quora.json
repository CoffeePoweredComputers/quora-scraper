            "answer_text": "Writer\u2019s block is a common phase most writers, if not all, face during their creative process. I\u2019ve faced it myself while starting a new story, where you have to build up every aspect of it from the ground up. Other times I\u2019ve had it when I have to connect the events with each other. But the moment I have it the most is when I\u2019m driving my story towards the end. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s very hard to lead a story to where you want it to, if you haven\u2019t planned out what you want to do. I\u2019d recommend you to do some of the following and see what helps you: Outline the story visually, sometimes you need a visual of the events to know where to go to next.Point down the main events, so you can play with the order and add or delete those that don\u2019t sum to the story.Know where you\u2019re heading with your end, it\u2019s good to be fully free to create, but I find it easier to lead a story to an ending I already planned than creating an spontaneous ending.Draw inspiration from other sources, in my case, visual sources of inspiration seem to take out the best of my imagination.Don\u2019t dwell on the time you\u2019ve \u201cwasted\u201d, just focus on getting things done and don\u2019t stop experimenting with your writing.Remember that writer\u2019s block is pretty much a myth, and like myths it can only become true if you believe in it. Focus on creating a solution, rather than worrying for what you\u2019ve been unable to write in any time period. ",

            "answer_text": "We all know Bruce Wayne\u2019s secret. He changes his pants and shirt and boom! He\u2019s Batman. But nobody talks about Bruce Wayne - naked. Chances are nobody has thought about it except for one person, the creator of Batman. Writer and artist, Bob Kane. You can make and win a bet that Kane sometimes had writer\u2019s block while figuring out how to dress up Bruce with problems to overcome as he transitions into Batman, the superhero who saves everyone in every crisis. I am not going to tell you to pretend you are Batman, and poof! there goes your writer\u2019s block. No. What I am going to suggest is for you to get naked with yourself. You see, when you have writer\u2019s block, that is a gift. You get to be intimate with yourself and connect with your truth (that you haven\u2019t revealed to yourself yet). What is real for you. When you are undressed you are in between the clothed Bruce and the costumed Batman. You get to be really gentle with yourself and talk to yourself. Do I want to write? What is going on with me? Do I really want to do this? You may get a shock when you hear your body and soul tell you, \u201cI don\u2019t want to write.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d So you don\u2019t. You toss out that path you are on, and choose another path. Maybe a path that does not include writing. See how that works? You find out what is really going on with you, and live your authenticity. You hear your own voice. Your truth. Here is another situation: Often we have writer\u2019s block when we don\u2019t know how to do something; and we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. So we are stuck. When you are in the situation, write out why you are stuck. That is how you uncover what you need to know. Here is a fork in the road: If you don\u2019t feel energized discovering what you need to know, stop. Drop writing. If you feel excited discovering what you need to know then you will naturally move on, you will write, even if it is a little bit of writing, you will want to do it. You will feel eager, maybe even electrified. Simple. Respect the expressions that come from your truth, your authentic self. If you are naked and feeling out of sorts because you don\u2019t want to put on a bat cape and be Batman, then don\u2019t do it. ",
