            "answer_text": "People are relying on technology to make up for their weaknesses. I can give you a prime example. I saw a parking space in a car park and went over to it. The parking spaces were like a comb if that makes sense. Space was clear . Positioned myself on the road and reversed in. One hell of a bang. I checked and I seemed to be parallel to the other car to my left. Had I hit something like a post ? Nope. I had rammed the car on my side. And rammed it hard. I was not driving inappropriately . How had I completely caved in the front wing of his car ? I checked again and I was parallel to the other car beside me. My reversing sensors had not given any warning . Then I worked it out. I had not hit him, he had it me !!!! Instead of reversing out straight onto the road and turning he had swung the front of his car over into my space !! It would not have mattered if I had been moving or not he would have hit me. How can you develop technology to stop other drivers from hitting you ? You can\u2019t. So all this let the car park itself stuff assumes that all the other cars remain static and in my case they didn\u2019t. ",
