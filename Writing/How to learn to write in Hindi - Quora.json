            "answer_text": "The Devanagari (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u0940) script is a phonetic one, meaning that it\u2019s pronounced as it\u2019s spelt and vice versa. Each phoneme (basic sound unit) has a character and these are joined together to make graphemes (i.e. words). For the most part, characters map one-to-one between the Devanagari (used by Hindi) and the Perso-Arabic script (used by Urdu). I grew up knowing Hindi, so when I wanted to learn Urdu, I had to find the equivalent Perso-Arabic characters for each of the Devanagari ones. A basic table can be found here, but a full list with the IPA pronunciation can be found here. You\u2019ll eventually realise that it\u2019s pretty simple. \u06a9 is \u0915, \u0686 is \u091a and so on. Just a few things to note: Vowels. In Urdu (as with other languages written using Perso-Arabic scripts), vowel markings are typically not written in daily use. However, they always are in Devanagari. So you would need to learn the matras (\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e), or vowel diacritics. For example kit\u0101b (book) would be written as \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 (k-t-\u0101-b) in Urdu, but as \u0915\u093f\u0924\u093e\u092c (k-i-t-\u0101-b) in Hindi.Furthermore, when used initially, the short sounds [a], [i] and [u] would all be represented as \u0627 in Urdu, but as \u0905, \u0907 and \u0909 respectively in Hindi.Aspirated consonants. In Urdu, consonants are aspirated by adding \u06be. However, in Hindi, each of these aspirated sounds has its own character. So \u06a9\u06be is \u0916, \u0686\u06be is \u091b, and so on.Missing letters. Not all letters used in Urdu are used in Hindi. For example, \u0641 and \u0642 typically don\u2019t exist in the Devanagari script. However, they are commonly represented by modifying existing letters, in these cases \u0915\u093c and \u092b\u093c respectively. Some letters, though, just do not exist. \u0637, for example, might just be written as \u0924 (\u062a) in Devanagari.Different orthographies. Certain words may be spelt using different characters, but these are generally exceptions, as the two writing systems align quite nicely.",

            "answer_text": "Hindi is written in the Devnagari script. It is written from left to right. Unlike in Urdu, a single letter may be used in Devnagari for subtle different pronunciations. Usually you right what you speak. For example, \u2018Kal\u2019 can be written by righting two consonants - \u2018Ka\u2019 and \u2018La\u2019 one after another. So, the first step is to learn common vowels, consonants and matraas. The second step would be to write simple words such as \u2018Kal\u2019, \u2018Bus\u2019, \u2018Ghar\u2019, etc. Attempt more and more complicated words as you start enjoying your Devnagari experience. Best of learning! ",
