            "answer_text": "Most motivational speakers look back on some event in their lives that prompted them to change. Sometimes the event is abrupt, other times it\u2019s a gradual realization that things must change. Motivational speakers use that personal event as a springboard for their motivational works. If I\u2019m right in guessing that\u2019s the case with you, use your own event as an introduction to propel you into the rest of the letter. If there\u2019s been no such life-changing event, then use your life as a whole to convince the reader that you are the kind of person whose life can be an example to others. You do this because a motivational letter (or speech) is different from other letters and speeches in that it\u2019s totally and completely personal even if the audience numbers in the thousands. That\u2019s because the goal of motivational writing and speaking is to reach deep into the reader\u2019s hearts and convince them to change for the better, one heart at a time. So write the letter as if you are writing to a friend who is having problems and you want to help that friend and remember that the most important thing is to write from your heart directly to his/hers.

            "answer_text": "Begin by imagining yourself speaking to a person you want to motivate to do something, such as to encourage a person to seek a particular type of job. What would you say to them? Then write out your side of the conversation, leaving out the other person\u2019s answers. Start by describing what action you want them to do. Would it be to make a phone call? Write a letter? Prepare a resume of their experience or training? Imagine saying it and write it down, then read it and see if it would motivate you if someone said it to you. One suggestion: your query has some problems. The English language uses indefinite articles. in your query, you should ask about \u201ca motivational letter\u201d, but in your query the indefinite article \u201ca\u201d was omitted before the word motivational. Always read any communication to yourself before sending. As your fluency increases you will spot errors that way. Good luck. ",
