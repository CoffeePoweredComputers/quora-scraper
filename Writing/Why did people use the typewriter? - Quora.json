            "answer_text": "While Mark Simonson\u2019s answer covers the most basic reasons why typewriters were used until word processors and then computers came along, one should also point out that people still use typewriters today in vast numbers, but also for additional reasons: There are still documents being produced by government agencies or armed forces that from a security perspective should only exist as a single hardcopy. Only a typewriter or handwriting can achieve this, and the typewriter being faster and more legible, it is the obvious choice.In many prisons, inmates are not allowed a computer, but they are allowed typewriters.There are many places in the world where the electrical supply is irregular at best, non-existent at worst, and mechanical typewriters are still highly useful as the only means of print-quality writing that is always accessible.Many creative writers find the restrictions of a typewriter actually improves their output. When you type you cannot go back and correct a mistake easily, you cannot cut and paste, and you either form your sentences in your head before typing or go with how you started writing it. It also means you must pace your thoughts more accurately to the pace of your typing, which also might help the creative juices flowing. It is also much easier to proofread writing on paper than on a screen, and with a typewriter, you don\u2019t have to go via the printer to do that.The sound and smell of a typewriter can be rather pleasing to many, and the force needed to push the keys (of a mechanical typewriters) makes for a very different sensory experience than writing in other ways.You can not just read a typed page, but you can also feel it: the indents of the keys makes the writing three-dimensional. This adds to the pleasure of using a typewriter.Because of small differences in typing force, ribbon wear, paper iregularities, etc, no characters typed on a typewriter will ever look exactly the same twice \u2013 and at the same time, each individual typewriter can easily be identified as accurately as a fingerprint can identify a person. This makes for a very organic feel to a typed page that the printed page cannot easily replicate.It is a great digital detox to shut off the computer and type something on a typewriter instead with paper instead of a screen, no hum of fans, and the meditative clack of the keys.For many, typewriters are part of the many current waves of retro and vintage nostalgia, reminding them of the halcyon days of yore, when life was simpler \u2013 or at least differently difficult.Many use typewriters simply because they are fascinating marvels of mechanical engineering.Okay, I could go on all day, listing reasons why people use typewriters today, but I think you get the picture. If anything, the advent of democratised computing has eventually made it easier to appreciate the typewriter for the amazing invention it is when what seemed its raison d\u2019\u00eatre was superceded by computers.
