            "answer_text": "It depends on where you are and what illness you have. Always be polite, and write the note as soon as possible. I will write some notes from imaginary students in different situations: Dear Professor L, I have recently been diagnosed with a concussion after a car accident. I will not be able to take the exam for clinical calculations as scheduled. I expect to be recovered enough by (specify date) to take the exam. Attached find a doctor\u2019s note explaining the situation. Yours, Anny Student This student took the exam, but had an assistant read the questions and write the answers, since you are not supposed to read and write a lot after a concussion. Dear Dr. So and So, Please excuse me from yesterday\u2019s class and allow me to reschedule the exam I missed. I was very ill with a high fever and (vague description of symptoms). Can I stop by your office hours and reschedule the exam? Yours, Another Student This student was allowed to take the exam the next week. Some professors/teachers are okay with you taking a late exam, others are not. Mainly the reason is whether they use the same exam for all students, or have a computer generated one that is different for all students. If you know your teacher is not very forgiving on late exams, try to find a solution before you miss the exam. ",
