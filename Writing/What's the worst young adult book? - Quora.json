            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll start by describing some things that really annoy me regarding the whole genre. I think that the worst books are those featuring characters much older than the reader itself but with such immature personalities and behaviour. Or when authors feature a theme (Greek or some other mythology, historical setting) thinking that because the reading public is young it\u2019s not necessary to make good quality research prior to writing a book. One more problem, books really follow the same pattern (love triangle, discovering superpowers, new mysterious person in the neighbourhood\u2026), there isn\u2019t much novelty in the concepts of plots or character building. Horrible books worth mentioning: Born at Midnight (C. C. Hunter), Forgive My Fins (Tera Lynn Childs), Legend (Marie Lu). ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not the worst book, but it not high on my list. Everything, Everything by Nicola Yoon. A book about a girl with SCID, a rare diease that forces her to stay inside her house, who meets and falls in love with a new boy next door. Although, this book has intriguing plot, beautiful writing, and diverse characters, focuses on a rare disease\u2026 It so offensive to not only people who suffer from SCID, but people with immunodeficiency disorders. Here it is, a book that features SCID and possibly the struggles that many people go through, but it turns out to be a fluke. And the main character, Maddy, is so rude to her mother at the end. It kind of justified, but still, no. ",
