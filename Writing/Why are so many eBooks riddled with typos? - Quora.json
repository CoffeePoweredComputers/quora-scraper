            "answer_text": "It seems that many publishers have abandoned the human editor in favor of electronic conversions with no oversight. The most recent example of this that I\u2019ve seen is the Kindle edition of C.J. Cherryh\u2019s Faded Sun Trilogy. It is published by Penguin, which is a global publishing house and certainly ought to have proofreaders on staff. And it was, yes, riddled with misplaced punctuation that completely changed the meaning of sentences, or interrupted the reader in the middle of a thought. Mostly commas and semi-colons inserted where they made absolutely no sense. There were also those annoying words that are obviously the result of converting from a PDF format, where the text isn\u2019t clear and letters are mistaken for other letters. Because the result is a legitimate word, it isn\u2019t corrected by a spell checker, though a human proofreader would easily catch the mistake. My feeling s that publishers just don\u2019t care about the quality of the product, or the readers who purchase their books. I have written to Penguin/Random House about this, and recieved no reply, and also to Amazon, who sells the products and might be able to influence the publishers, since they doo such a large volume of business, also without receiving a reply. If you work for either of these companies and are reading this, I\u2019d appreciate a comment. ",

            "answer_text": "Format conversion from print to digital (if we're speaking about ebooks from classic print publishers) is a massive source of errors. Older books (older = pre ca. 2007) that were published on paper first don't just lay around as Word files somewhere on an old drive, nor are they archived in reflowing Text formats (ePub, Kindle or XML). They are archived in their \"prettiest form\", i.e. in their post-proofreading, post-plotter-checking stage as fixed layout files (InDesign or QuarkXpress) as well as PDF files. These stable \"fixed layout\" formats are excellent for printing, but suck if you want to convert them to a reflowing format such as ePub. Hyphenation is a bitch, awkward line breaks will stick around, spaces will be missing etc. Try for yourself: Convert a PDF into a Word document and have a good close look at the result.  There are of course professional services for that, but this kind of format conversion always sucks. You will need a human to proofread the result, and humans are never error-free. (This is not supposed to be an excuse - of course it's the publisher's duty to be as careful about digital as about print.) ",
