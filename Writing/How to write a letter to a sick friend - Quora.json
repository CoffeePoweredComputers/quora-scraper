Your not missing much days still go by just as fast as they used to, I don\u2019t even remember what day it is now to be honest. Remember when you used to say I was wasting my time with that one girl and I should find someone who doesn\u2019t make fun of my laugh or conplain when I listen to podcasts in the car. You were right I don\u2019t even remember when we broke up we just stopped talking suddenly and that was it. Did they say when you can go out again I know they don\u2019t like it when I come by they say I\u2019m to loud and I always want to stay after. I don\u2019t know when I can come again it\u2019s so hard when I leave sometimes. I heard you were hurting and I should of came and I\u2019m going to regret that. I\u2019m glad we got to spend so much time together never did I think that would be the last time I saw your smile. Your friend Sal ",

            "answer_text": "Find out their address.Write!Send. Remember the stamp and return address.Tips: Make it creative. Add some artwork to a plain white paper to spice up your letter. Ask questions. Everyone loves questions about themselves, and it feels a lot more like a conversation when the letter includes the sender and the receiver in the dialogue. Use your storytelling skills. Here is the best place to describe in great detail. Make every scene juicy and bright. Tell the smallest experiences in the biggest fashion. (This is why letters from the 1800s sound so cool. People from that era used storytelling to relay everyday experiences to their family and friends.) Add a handmade gift. Paper bookmarks, stained glass art with cellophane, or small crocheted items add a sweet touch to any letter. Focus on inspiration. Tell funny jokes. Make your friend smile with your words. Laughter is medicine: may your letter be the cure your friend needs! ",

I know I was very appreciative of those who came to visit me, or even just sent a short text, when i was in the hospital for a few days. I don\u2019t think most people know just how nice it is to hear even a few words from someone and know they remembered you (: A few words of consolation and sympathy can be nice, so let them know you care. Making someone laugh or sending a small gift provides a great distraction for them, and they\u2019ll be grateful. It\u2019s nice to know if someone dedicated time to sending you something. Don\u2019t worry, you can\u2019t really go wrong with this one. They\u2019ll be happy to hear from you, I promise. ",

You want your friend to read it and still have joy in there heart after reading.. A nice picture or a drawing or poem is always good to do also.. ",
