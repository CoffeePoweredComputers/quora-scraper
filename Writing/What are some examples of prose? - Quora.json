            "answer_text": "Your question is written prose. So is my answer. Prose is any form of writing that has no meter, alliteration, or rhyme. Examples of good prose can be found most anywhere, but judging what makes good prose takes time, lots of reading, and recognizing your own preferences. Here are some qualities of good prose that I\u2019ve put in the form of questions, so you can decide for yourself if you are writing good prose. Is it clear? Does it communicate the one thought you wish to convey so that no other meaning can sneak in to \u201cmuddy the waters?\u201dIs it succinct, meaning brief, requiring as few words as possible to convey meaning? Sometimes you might want ornate writing, but in the normal course of things, less is more.Is it grammatically correct? Good grammar is essential to good writing. If your grammar is a little shaky, get a good handbook.",

            "answer_text": "Prose is so-called \"ordinary writing\" \u2014 made up of sentences and paragraphs, without any metrical (or rhyming) structure. If you write, \"I walked about all alone over the hillside,\" that's prose. Example of a piece of prose with the same sentiment expressed poetically: \u201cThe woods look lovely against the setting darkness and as I gaze into the mysterious depths of the forest, I feel like lingering here longer. However, I have pending appointments to keep, and much distance to cover before I settle in for the night, or else I will be late for all of them.\u201d (Prose) \u201cThe woods are lovely, dark and deep.But I have promises to keep,And miles to go before I sleepAnd miles to go before I sleep.\u201d (Poetry) (Note: poetry does not necessarily have to rhyme) ",
