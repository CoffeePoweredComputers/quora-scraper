            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to answer this from personal experience, and also because the people saying it will be \u2018crap\u2019, are those that \u2014 for some reason \u2014 are unable to do it themselves. With Six For Seven, I wrote, edited, did the book covers, the typesetting for print and electronic eBook formatting, had it independently edited, and published in 25 days. If I remember correctly (I can\u2019t check at the moment), it\u2019s about 66k words. I didn\u2019t wait for the editor, for example. I was already busy with the covers, the formats, and the promotional material. This book is proof that it can be done, not that it should be done this way. I didn\u2019t set out to break any records. It just went very well. This happens when you write what you want, and not something because it\u2019s a product to sell. It\u2019s a very quirky book that has only ever received one bad review while it was on Amazon. I can write over 10 000 words in one day, but that is the exception. I normally aim for 3000\u20135000 a day \u2026 when I write. I only write when I want to. Last year, I wrote two books in a few months, but I haven\u2019t published them. When inspired, sometimes I will write for as long as 12 hours or more. This is how these things get done for some of us. A book isn\u2019t good or bad because of how long it takes you to write it. Alex Boast, thanks for the A2A. The original question was: How quickly can you write a 50,000 word novel? ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, so, I actually wrote a 127,000 word novel in about 3 months\u2014 and that was where I spend almost all of my free time writing and not going back, just continuing on and on, so let\u2019s assume I could have hypothetically written 50,000 words in, oh, one month. Let\u2019s rephrase the question. How quickly can I write a good 50,000 word novel? Because let me tell you, that one I wrote in 3 months? Absolute trash. I wrote it two years ago. I renovated it and changed it up quite a bit about a year back. You know what I just started doing a couple of days ago? Re-reading and editing it again. It\u2019s not trash anymore. It\u2019s actually comprehensive narrative and whatnot. I\u2019ve been adding more body language to the dialogue, so it\u2019s not so stiff. Anyway. Easier. I wrote what I would consider to be a pretty good 60,000 word novel more recently, which is much closer to the 50,000 words in the question. I did that one a chapter a week, with one week missed when I was really busy. It\u2019s about 23 chapters long, so I did it in 24 weeks. The main difference here is that I spent more time on it, and had the time to re-read chapters as I wrote the new ones, had more time to edit what I already had to be better. While I will doubtless edit it as my writing skills improve, I won\u2019t edit it as heavily as I have been my bigger novel because, well, it\u2019s already better. So, short answer? A hypothetical month, but it would be trash, or, a hypothetical five months with a much better result. ",

            "answer_text": "How quickly can I, the writer that I am, write a short novel? I could probably TYPE the first draft of a short novel, 50,000 words, 180 pages, in six months, if I had a very clear idea of the story\u2014if it was say, autobiographical. But I wouldn\u2019t consider it a finished novel. It might surprise you, but it can be harder to write short than long\u2014to get one\u2019s complete thoughts down, the full action, in a few beautiful strokes of the pen. I admire people who can write elegant short books\u2014Marguerite Duras\u2019 the Lover is a thing of beauty. Joan Didion\u2019s Play it As It Lays. Jean Toomer\u2019s Cane. Kozinsky\u2019s Being There, Annie Dillard\u2019s The Maytrees. It\u2019s interesting that Didion and Duras were both screenwriters. For me, cutting is ferociously difficult, takes a lot of insight and some stamina. But many writers do write quite quickly. Most are genre writers, responding to the needs of certain kind of reader. Simenon, the French mystery writer, could write a book in 6 weeks. In America, many mystery writers have to turn out a book a year. Romance writers\u2014writing to formula\u2014often write a book every two months. Genre readers are very specific as to their needs, and very tolerant as to what is a \u2018novel\u2019 let alone a \u2018good novel.\u2019 ",

I tend to write 500\u20131000 words a day these days, so if my math is correct, that\u2019s a 50,000 word first draft in approximately 50\u2013100 days or around four months on the outside. My current work in progress is around 65,000 words and showing no signs of stopping yet. I think each of the novels in my trilogy might run about 100k each. Fifty thousands words sounds positively cute at this point. You have to realize though, that a first draft is not a novel. After that, there\u2019s at least six passes of editing, then beta reading, then more edits. Then, it\u2019s ready to send out to publishers to see if someone wants to make it a novel. So a finished novel would take significantly longer than four months to write. Sometimes I think to my creative papa, Ray Bradbury, and marvel at how he cranked out the rough draft for Fahrenheit 411 in like, a month. I am not that prolific, and I\u2019m okay with that. It\u2019s no good scouring your brain at top speed to write a book if you aren\u2019t enjoying the process. Life = too short. ",

            "answer_text": "Why are you so fixated on speed? Writing a novel is a marathon, not a sprint. Anyone who says otherwise is selling something. There are people who would ask a marathoner how quickly they can run a marathon, and sure, for some runners, time matters, but a lot of others are a lot more concerned with finishing than breaking some sort of arbitrary record. Writing is not widget-making. It doesn\u2019t happen on an assembly line on a particular schedule. It takes time to plan (are we including planning here, or just assuming that a novel springs fully formed from the author\u2019s mind?). It takes time to revise. It needs time to sit for a while so the author can come back to it with fresh eyes. There\u2019s the time it takes someone else to read it and offer feedback. Then more revision, and perhaps an agent or editor gets involved. Lather, rinse, repeat. It takes as long as it takes, and that\u2019s all there is to it. It\u2019s not like challenging yourself to paint a house in a weekend, just to see if you can do it. Sure, people do National Novel Writing Month and churn something out in 30 days, but the goal there is 50,000 words, which is pretty short for a novel, and doesn\u2019t involve anything but getting those words on paper. No revision, no editing, no nothing, because the only thing you have time for to hit that goal in 30 days is pure writing. (And if you think anyone has a publishable novel at the end of that month, I have some oceanfront properly in Kansas you might be interested in.) If you\u2019re thinking about writing a novel, just sit down and start writing. Don\u2019t get hung up on how long it\u2019ll take, because it\u2019s always going to be longer than you think when you start. If time is your only concern, be okay with writing a bad novel, because you won\u2019t have the patience to make it good. If you\u2019d rather write a good novel, decide it\u2019s going to take as long as it takes, and be okay with that. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Almost certainly the wrong question. As the others have put it, the question is more of how rushed a job are you willing to put up with? There\u2019s also a question of how you measure start to finish. Less than half the time is spent in actually putting words on the page. Roughly speaking, there\u2019s four different tasks that go into writing a novel. Brainstorming, planning, writing, editing. Make it five if you want to talk about the publishing process, including the effort of, say, sending out queries and drafts and waiting for reply. The brainstorming phase is when you are putting together ideas. You might say, \u201cGot an idea already, let\u2019s go.\u201d But that\u2019s not where brainstorming ends. It also involves gathering sufficient elements to fill a novel. And it includes figuring out how you are going to dramatize them. This shades into planning/outlining. The more you pre-plan, the faster the actual writing can be. But is that a net saving or not? The thing is, the early parts of this work \u2014 the brainstorming, the research, the synopsis \u2014 can be done while you are writing something else. So the measure of \u201chow long does it take to write this one book?\u201d Is a little nonsensical when you are talking about the process of a working writer. (The same goes for editing, and especially for publication.) Editing, too, is hard to measure. It is best done after a pause, and do you include the pause in your estimate? Rush to edit, skimp on the edit, count only time until first draft and, sure, you can make the numbers look better. But, again, are we after the numbers, or after a book that people will want to read?  So last year I set out to put a novel on Kindle before the year was out. I made it with a month to spare. But\u2026 It was under-edited. I\u2019d been working on the ideas for years before that. But on the other hand, it also could have been less ambitious. ",

Please don\u2019t compare what I am doing now with what a novice does in their first few books, ok? :) Also, I write novels full-time. It\u2019s my day job. Comparisontitis sucks. Don\u2019t get caught in that trap. I average about 2000-2500 words per hour, which means a fifty thousand word novel takes me about 20\u201325 hours of typing to finish. I often will do that over the course of a week or so. Sometimes a month, but I never write less than 50k a month these days. I\u2019ve also trained myself to write fairly clean. As a result, I don\u2019t have to do revisions. I write the book and send it immediately to my editor. She goes over it, I get it back and look over the typos and such she caught, and then it gets published. Thats fast, but I know some writers who manage 4000\u20135000 words per hour via dictation. Writing a book is a bunch of work, but mostly it is about the discipline to sit down and do the work - and building the storytelling skills that will let you write books people want to read. ",

Third, if speed is your only measure, you should be able to do it in a month of eight-hour days. But for me, it takes longer. I can easily spend a month on an outline and another three-four months on the actual writing. The journalist A.J. Liebling once said, \u201cI can write faster than anyone who can write better than I can and I can write better than anyone who can write faster.\u201d But is speed the measure by which you want to be judged?

            "answer_text": "Every author I know has a different pace. Since you have asked about length, I must mention that length tends to vary by genre/subgenre, though there is no hard, fast rule (though some editors have preferences, which I wouldn\u2019t worry about too much). Most of the authors in the mystery & thriller genre tend to write between 80k to 100k. Some go over, some finish under. Those in the romantic suspense & cozy genre often center around 50k. Fwiw, there is no rule. It is whatever it takes to tell the story. So with that in mind, some v good genre writers I know can do two books a year (at their chosen length). I do one book a year once I have a clear idea of where it\u2019s going, even if I don\u2019t yet have all the details in mind. I tend to rewrite and edit extensively after the first draft, and sometimes during a first draft. I don\u2019t like to let the ms go until I\u2019m very happy with it. Some good authors will do 2.5 to 3 books a year, but this pace is not common. And sometimes the higher book count comes in spurts. Romantic suspense writers crank them out. The genre demands it. All that said, first-time writers generally take more time, and require more time, as they are not only writing a book but also finding their voice and style. Hope this helps. ",

I just released a Dark Noir detective novel set in 1877 Victorian England that\u2019s around 100,000 words. The writing took a couple of months as it was submitted to a group for approvals, and used in a contest. Afterward, I collected those postings, put them into context for a story, edited them for proper formatting and terms. (Can\u2019t have a Sherlock Holmesian detective using a cell phone now can we?) then got it ready for publication. I just released it about 4 days ago. It details the adventures of characters that have unique and very different types of backgrounds than what is normal. While the creative process was fast and furious, the writing took the time necessary as it was, as I said, a submission for a contest I had entered. Hard Answer- Word counts are NOT what determines the time it takes. Too many are concerned with this as they presume a PAY per word situation. THOSE are prevalent in print media, such as magazines, newspapers, and public blogs. As a writer/author, you aren\u2019t PAID per word, so a word count has little value to your considerations for a novel. Writing what is good, quality prose, and involving character development is what\u2019s needed. Look at some of the greatest for your inspirations. READ something by Shakespeare, H.G. Wells, Jules Verne J.R.R.Tolkien, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and any number of others in whatever genre you choose to find out what WORKS and why it does. Then find YOUR own version of this to make it work for you. Concentrating on word counts is self-defeating. I can crank out tons of words, but do they make a coherent, cohesive story that draws the reader into it? Probably not. Just like my answers here, I try to engage the questioner and look for others to reply with insights and experiences they share. ",

            "answer_text": "Every November, thousands of writers write 50000 words in thirty days in a thing called Nanowrimo. However, that would be a first draft. Revising and editing could take any amount of time, depending on your experience, how strong the idea is, how much research is required, on your time management and to what level of quality you intend it to reach. In other words, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to your question. Lee Child starts a new novel every September, but he has years of copywriting experience before he became a novelist and now has a whole team behind him to read through the manuscript and flag any inconsistencies or other areas that require editing. That would cut down his production time quite considerably. And if they are all Jack Reacher novels, he has the added advantage of knowing his main character inside out, which makes the creation process much easier. Still, if a fully revised and edited story came in completed at 50k words, it would fall under the scope of being a novella, not a novel. A novel usually hits the 65k mark as a minimum, though the ideal size is between 75\u201390k. Writing the first 50k is just the start. Do not underestimate the need to revise and edit, especially if you are an inexperienced writer. ",

I believe passion for the story should dictate your schedule unless you are experienced, writing to pay the rent, and no longer writing for your own pleasure. ",

Even then, once in a while, you will run across an unsatisfactory ending in the last few chapters and you know he was up against a publisher's deadline and just cranked out an ending to the story to get it done , not get it right.

I'm not a full-blown planner, but I like to work with rough outlines and summaries. Typically, I would set out about an hour a day for writing. In that time and depending on how much is in my head, I'll write about 2000 words. I can do 10000 in a day (8 hours, including meal and short breaks) if I focus on it and ignore everything else. The 30 days also makes time for having a bad day, or a 0 count day. Editing is a whole different story, though. I like to self-edit (read: I have no budget to pay an editor), and that's a much longer process. About 3-4 hours per 2000 words. Thanks for the A2A. ",

For editing, it could take double that, to get all the kinks out, change the wording to get emotions across better, etc. The better you want it to be, the longer you would work on it.
