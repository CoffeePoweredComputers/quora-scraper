            "answer_text": "Dialogue: Each person speaking gets a new paragraph. Spoken words are written between quotation marks. e.g. A little boy sat on the curb, wailing. The nurse crouched beside him and said, \u201cHello, my name is Judy. What\u2019s your name?\u201d2. \u201cBilly.\u201d 3. \u201cDid you hurt yourself, Billy? Is that why you\u2019re crying?\u201d 4. \u201cI can\u2019t find my mommy. She went into the big tent,\u201d he said, \u201cand she didn\u2019t come out yet. I need to pee and she told me to stay right here. If I leave she won\u2019t know where I went and I don\u2019t know what to do. 5. \u201cPlease, lady, will you help me find my mom?\u201d 6. \u201cOf course I will,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cHere, have a tissue.\u201d Note the words in Bold: When I broke the quotation after \u201ctent\u201d in paragraph 4, to put in the attribution (he said), then carried on, I didn\u2019t use a capital letter for the word \u201cand\u201d because it was a continuation of the child\u2019s sentence. Note the bit in Bold italics: Because Billy was still speaking I did not close the quotes at the end of paragraph 4, but opened paragraph 5 with quotation marks and closed it because that was all Billy said. This is the correct punctuation of quotations in dialogue when one speaker needs a new paragraph for the rest of his speech. He needed a new paragraph because it was a new train of thought, It\u2019s always a good idea to read published novels that have a lot of dialogue so you get the hang of punctuating it. ",
