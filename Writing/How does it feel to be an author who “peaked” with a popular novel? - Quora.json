            "answer_text": "I wish I knew? I haven\u2019t peaked, nor have I written a popular novel. From my perspective at least, I would think one would have some disappointment finding and then losing success. However, being a writer, that just comes with the territory. Most of us will type until our fingers bleed and our brains are mush, and never write a popular novel, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to stop trying. To be a writer is to put your hopes and dreams, along with your failures and frustrations out there for the world to see. We write to share. We write to be heard. We write for fun. We write for work. My point is, regardless of what life throws at us, we\u2019ll still be at the keyboard the very next day doing the same thing we did the day before. Try to measure success by what you do, rather than what you\u2019ve done. ",

You find yourself saying, \u201cYeah, that one was fine, but isn\u2019t this one even better?\u201d And the market keeps saying, \u201cNope.\u201d But after awhile you adjust. That early success is still something you\u2019re proud of, but you recognize it as largely a stroke of luck and you keep going, doing the best you can \u2014 and hoping luck will strike again, but not expecting it.
