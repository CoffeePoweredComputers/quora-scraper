            "answer_text": "I have always advocated against the idea of sequels, particularly for original movies. If a movie is left open ended then that was how the director intended it, a sequel shouldn\u2019t be needed to further develop the ambiguous ending. 2010 : The Year we Make Contact ruined the legacy of the original and despite Blade Runner 2049 being an excellent sequel I had never thought it to be necessary. But the ending of Whiplash opens up a can of worms of things irresistible to explore in a sequel.  At the end, Andrew Neiman has pushed himself to perform one of the best drum solos the world has seen. He broke his personal barrier of limitations and by doing so has becoming the next Charlie Parker. He looks up at his conductor, Fletcher and they both smile as the song \u201cWhiplash\u201d finishes. The movie cuts to credits.  It should be a perfect ending, Neiman has pushed himself enough to become on of the greatest drummers and fulfilled his dreams with the effort of his dedicated conductor. But the ending of Whiplash is not a happy one. Neiman has become the greatest, but at what cost? By performing such a solo for Fletcher\u2019s approval he has become a slave to a conductor who\u2019s teaching methods require pushing students to suicide in order to become great. He puts his entire life on the line to impress a man who has manipulated him throughout the entire movie. He is no longer himself, he is a machine.  Neiman\u2019s dad who has given nothing but support and always wanted what\u2019s best for his son looks in horror as Neiman smashes away at the drum kit, pushing himself beyond what is safe. He has lost his son to the hands of an abuser. And Fletcher has finally gotten what he\u2019s always wanted, his very own student becoming one of the greatest through means of violence and bullying.  The film doesn\u2019t end at the end of Neiman\u2019s career, it ends at the beginning. What would follow is an experience of constant manipulation from Fletcher, world wide fame and Neiman\u2019s complete fall into self destruction on his quest for perfection. He will become a shell of a person but become the greatest drum soloist in the world. His journey on his dark journey down the road of destruction houses some of the most intriguing films to be put onto film and a sequel would certainly do these themes justice. Neiman : I\u2019d rather die drunk broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me, than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remember who I was  With a sequel, we would finally see if people really do end up talking about him at a dinner table Or if he falls into the depths of irrelevance.

            "answer_text": "Predestination  Summary An agent is tasked to travel back in time to prevent a bomb attack in New York in 1975. Why a sequel A must watch for anyone who enjoys a mind bending, soul imploding film. Although the first scene is action packed, not much is understood as to the who's and why's. After that, and for only a few minutes, the movie seemed slow and without direction. Soon after it becomes intriguing, suspenseful, and where the direction of the film is going (although not yet understood). The Director was able to clearly explain the unexplainable at the very end of the movie. So, for those that sometimes walk out of a movie not understanding what happened, I can assure you that will not be the case here. I give many kudos to the original writing, screen writing, directing, and acting. This movie will be ranked as one of my all time best films ever. The film ended on ah igh note. There should be a sequel to this movie as it has alot to dicover. In the end we are just confused about what happened in the movie but there is a lot of story uncover if they are willing to. ",
