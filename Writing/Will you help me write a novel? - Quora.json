            "answer_text": "There are many people who could help you write a book. Probably the best place to start, if you haven\u2019t already, is to take a writing class or workshop. Depending on the kind of book you\u2019re trying to write, you\u2019ll want one in novel writing or longform non-fiction. A class does several things for you at once: Makes you responsible for producing actual writing on a weekly basisGives you permission to spend time writingGives you feedback from readers who are peers and at least one reader who is an experienced writerForces you to revise and editWhile you could simply hire someone to ghostwrite for you, you\u2019re better off writing your book yourself, because of the way it makes you develop and communicate the thoughts you have swirling around in your head. Simply keep writing the equivalent of one long Quora answer every day, and you\u2019ll have your book written by the end of the year. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. I get $75 per hour for novel consultations. When you are ready to have me edit it, I receive $3000 per novel. If you are my editing client, I cannot act on your behalf as a literary agent because it is against the ethics. If not, there are lots of ways to educate yourself, like the really awesome answers you have received so far. You can also pay to have someone ghostwrite your novel for you. I do those services as well, but not as often. I much rather write my own things. I get a great satisfaction from all of my own hard work. Good luck to you, and let me know if you need those services from me. ",
