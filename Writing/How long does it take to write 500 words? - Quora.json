            "answer_text": "Being a learning writer it takes about 5 minutes to write down 500 words after the research and all the data is collected. All I have to do is write it down. But if am writing and along with that am also doing the research, then it takes me to write 500 words in almost 15 minutes because that time I would be thinking where to place all the data I am collecting I have to edit it or also reedit it, check my grammar mistakes, and also read properly before submitting it. Hence you can see how much effort and time it takes to write 500 words without being prepared to write. ",
