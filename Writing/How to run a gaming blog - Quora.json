            "answer_text": "First, pick your topic within gaming.Just talking about \u2018gaming\u2019 is far too broad. You\u2019ll need to focus on key linking ideas between the games you wish to discuss, or establish for yourself a set of key themes or design ideas you\u2019d like to cover. Choose your platform - different blogging platforms work in different ways. Depending on your tone and your personal style of writing (and blogging), you will want to select your platform considerately. Are you planning to use more images and videos to illustrate your points? Is it going to be more technically focused? This can affect your choice between going with somewhere like Blogger or Tumblr, with hosting your own blog on WordPress. That said, they should all work reasonably similarly and provide reliable means of attaching images and other media to your post, but still\u2026 the \u2018look and feel\u2019 of your platform will effect your writing and how people see your work. What do you want to get out of this blog and how far do you want to take it? With answers to these, you can have an easier time deciding on a platform. Also, engage the audience when you\u2019re blogging. Bring up discussion points and ask questions throughout. Don\u2019t become reliant on asking for information though, because people will visit your blog for ideas and answers - so make sure to give them something they can\u2019t get elsewhere. Good luck! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I run a YouTube gaming channel myself, so I may be able to help you out here. But I\u2019d suggest using your own personality, don\u2019t give us another generic gaming blog saying \u2018\u2019This game out today and I like it\u2019\u2019 give us you, that\u2019s the most important part. Emphasise your thoughts on X, Y or Z game. Let us know what you think is good, what you think could be better, etc. I\u2019d suggest watching YouTube videos from channels such as Raycevick, I get that he does videos which isn\u2019t a blog, but if you write your posts in a style like his, while making sure it oozes your own style, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find an audience. If you were to also do YouTube videos, that\u2019d make it a bit better: Need to show off something cool in a game? Drop your own link. Want to make a TL:DR of your post in a video format? Go for it. Drop your video link. If you go ahead and do your gaming blog, comment your link. I\u2019ll take a look! ",
