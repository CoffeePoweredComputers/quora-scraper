            "answer_text": "I suspect you are asking because you see \u201chow come\u201d as a synonym for \u201cwhy\u201d and since \u201cwhy\u201d is usually followed by a form of \u2018to do\u2019 it puzzles you that \u2018how come\u2019 does not. But many of our language rules don\u2019t depend on the meaning of a word or phrase, but on its form. I don\u2019t know the official derivation of the phrase \u2018how come,\u2019 but I suspect it is a contraction of \u201cHow does it come about that\u2026\u201d So instead of saying \u201cHow does it come about that drivers ignore yellow lights?\u201d we say \u201cHow come drivers ignore yellow lights?\u201d The word \u2018how\u2019 is an adverb, so we need to supply the verb it modifies\u2014usually a form of \u2018to do\u2019 when we are asking a question. But when we begin the sentence with \u2018how come\u2019 the verb is \u2018come\u2019 and the adverb is \u2018how\u2019 so the verb and its modifier are already there. I\u2019m sure a linguistics expert would have a more erudite explanation. ",
