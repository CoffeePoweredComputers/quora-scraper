            "answer_text": "I started writing to prisoners offering to share my traditional Catholic Faith with them. Apart from relatives, and those offering some kind of guidance, I think there are two main reasons, and believe it or not, the prisoner sometimes ends up getting taken advantage of: One is, you're the kind of person that can't keep anyone on the outside - no one can stand you. I know a prisoner who, at age 25, had just left 6 1/2 yrs of solitary confinement. Of course, he was (and still is) traumatized. Along comes this girl from a rich family, who lavished commissary money on him and spent a fortune on phone calls. Of course, he got attached to her. But she tortured him. She would try to upset him and provoke him, and then laugh and say she liked it. Finally he couldn't take any more, and he broke the relationship. Of course, that works both ways: some prisoners get very good at \"fishing\" for pen-pals, carefully cultivating a \"relationship\", and then they get the commissary money coming.... people that fall for that are plain fools. The second reason I could think of, is some people think it's interesting or cool. You get first hand accounts of the horrors of those dungeons, and of the inmost thoughts of it's inhabitants. You can brag that you got a letter from a \"whatever\". Writers can find *very* \"interesting\" things to write about. Again it's taking advantage of the prisoner, who is so lonely, he will pour out his soul to anyone that acts friendly. Prisoners need help. No one should be going to random prisoners to get help, companionship or anything else. Yes, I do listen to \"my prisoners\" and even ask their advice, but that's because they have proven themselves. They've submitted to God and changed their hearts and their ways. Prisoners are individuals and should be treated as such. I went looking for souls to save. I got that, and more: I got SONS. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t thought about Logan in a long time. Seven years ago, he was prosecuted for rape, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years at a maximum security prison. I should clarify that I don\u2019t know him. I was a witness for the prosecution during his trial. I was asked to testify about the party, about driving a drunk friend home and listening to her slurred, dis-jointed speech. I was asked to testify about her insinuations of rape and about the aftermath of that night, which concluded in an ER visit and hours spent sitting in a waiting room the following day. Neither the prosecuting attorney nor the defense attorney asked me to contextualize the evening on which the rape occurred within the broader context of that summer, which might have colored the situation grey. The prosecution wanted \u201cguilty\u201d and the defense wanted \u201cinnocent\u201d\u2014 they wanted black or white. But the truth, I suspected\u2014 and still tend to believe\u2014 was more complicated than that. After he was convicted, I watched Logan\u2019s parents and girlfriend start crying on the other side of the courtroom. Logan looked at his family intently and said \u201cI love you\u201d before officers took him. Meanwhile, my friend\u2019s uncle tried to triumphantly take pictures of him leaving the courtroom in handcuffs. Life continued. I graduated from high school. I went to college. I thought about him sometimes, marveling at how much my life was changing and imagining his to be completely stagnant. I decided that I agreed with the conviction, but not with the length of the sentence. Given the prosecution\u2019s overt attempts to imprison Logan and exaggerated claims made against him by other witnesses, I felt strongly compelled to tell him that someone from the prosecution disagreed with how it all shook out. I wrote him a letter during my senior year of college. I hardly knew what to say or how to express it. I wanted to apologize\u2014 almost. It felt like an apology that wasn\u2019t quite. Perhaps more of an \u201cI hope you understand\u2026and by the way this is what I\u2019m doing.\u201d It didn\u2019t feel appropriate. The letter never left the top drawer of my desk, and I assume I eventually threw it away. ",
