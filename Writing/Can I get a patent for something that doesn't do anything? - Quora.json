            "answer_text": "No, you cannot obtain a utility patent for something that has no use. If you applied for a utility patent for this non-useful thing, the patent examiner ought to reject the application under 35 USC section 101. You could, however, possibly obtain a design patent, which protects the look (design) of the thing. With a design patent, you can merely stop others from making or selling goods that look like yours. But for a non-useful product, that might be exactly the kind of patent protection you'd want. ",

            "answer_text": "Like a pet rock? The patent system is designed to promote the \u201cuseful arts\u201d. Thus, there is a \u201cutility\u201d requirement for patent eligibility. As a practical matter, this requirement rarely comes into play because very few people try to patent things that are not useful (and there usually is not a market for them anyway). It comes up in the chemistry area most often - since it is easy to create new chemicals that have no known use. We don\u2019t want people patenting them just in case someone later figures out a use. People that later figure out a use can patent that use, even though they can\u2019t patent the chemical itself if they did not invent it. ",

It cannot be a step away from another idea that would be common sense.3. It must have commercial application. An example of its commercial use must be included in the patent. An item that does not do anything will not have a commercial application. ",

Note that \u201cfor purpose of amusement\u201d is a true utility, so an invention that is just silly might very well be patentable. But an invention that does absolutely NOTHING cannot be patented. Why SHOULD such an invention be patented? ",
