            "answer_text": "There are a couple of core ideologies that are necessary to understand in order to really get how content marketing builds up your business: Inbound marketing \u2014 the marketing approach of drawing customers and prospects into your funnel with their permission, usually through efforts like SMM, blogging, PPC, SEO, etc. It builds on the idea of providing value to prospects in order to build a relationship with them.The opposing idea is outbound marketing, which interrupts someone\u2019s time in order to get their attention and show your message. Some examples of this include cold calling, purchasing lists, popups, and email spam. It is generally more sales and profit-focused.Know, like, trust \u2014 the belief that in order to buy from you, a prospect must know you, like you, and trust you. Again, this idea highlights the importance of building a relationship with your prospects and leads.Content marketing builds your business by building your funnel, which builds revenue. The more that you offer content that they find valuable, the more that they begin to know who you are, like you as a company, and trust you as a solution for their business. You\u2019ll see more opportunities for sales conversion the more that people have heard about your business and continue to hear from your business. If you\u2019re interested in implementing content marketing, the general strategy is: Create content that people care about and will find useful.Attract visitors via inbound marketing efforts, like social media or SEO.Gather contact info via content conversion aka get people to download whatever you\u2019re offering in exchange for you giving you their contact information, usually their email address and name, but could also include company name, address, phone number, etc.Nurture via email to move down the funnel towards purchasing behavior. This might include encouraging your prospects to schedule a demo, talk to sales, or simply make a purchase on your eCommerce site.For Net-Results Marketing Automation, where I work in the marketing department, content marketing is constantly building our business. A fair amount of our resources were my requests or ideas \u2014 because I knew what I really found use out of. The resources that perform the best in our funnel were genuinely developed to help people. for us, it\u2019s Marketing Automation 101, a top of the funnel offer that explains what marketing automation is and isn\u2019t; the Email Deliverability Guide, the definitive guide to getting to the inbox, developed by our Customer Success team; and the ROI of Marketing Automation for CEOs, requested by our sales team when they met repeated requests from leads for a resource to help convince their C-Suite of the ROI that their business can expect from marketing automation. Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "In any content marketing strategy, the most important aspect is to identify your user\u2019s buyer\u2019s journey.There are 5 stages in a buyer\u2019s journey: AwarenessThis is the stage where the person is addressing his/her pain point. Awareness of the product should be the goal.ConsiderationAs the name suggests, the individual is considering different options. And this is where you should show why your product is the one he/she needs to go for.DecisionThe options have been narrowed and this is where customer reviews play an important factor for that person to decide which product/service to go for.RetentionAlso sometimes referred to as the delight stage, this is to ensure to keep your existing customers happy and delighted.AdvocacyCustomers take it upon themselves to promote the brand in their respective circles in the advocacy stage. Source: Hubspot Once you\u2019re aware of the buyer\u2019s journey, your content strategy should revolve around a set goal. Not any goal. But a SMART goal.S - SpecificM - MeasurableA - AttainableR - RelevantT - TimelyIt is recommended to measure, keep track of and update this SMART goal on a monthly basis. Audit and AssessAuditing helps pool all your resources in one place so it is easy to assess. There are 2 types of auditing to be done:1. Content Audit Identify all content that attracts customers to the business, thus identifying all the resources available in hand.2. Event-based AuditHelps identify all the upcoming projects and eventsCollaborationsCollaborations can happen in different ways. A couple of them include marketing through Influencers and including guest blogging in the strategy.Content RepurposingA very famous method to recycle old best performing content and republishing them again in the form of new blogs, guides, ebooks etc is called content repurposing. This method also helps when you\u2019re looking to switch a different but similar themed platform. For example, if you\u2019re getting started with Quora, republishing snippets from old published blogs would save time and effort.It goes without saying that the content that is being put out needs to be very high in quality and should add more value.Following Pareto\u2019s principle, 80% of your content should be value-based while the remaining 20% should be promotional.UGCUser-Generated Content is that content which your audience take it upon themselves to share stories, experiences and different forms of content with or without your direct intervention i.e. by themselves or as a part of your campaign.All in all, your strategy should make sure that your content should Reach, Engage, Conver and Retain.
