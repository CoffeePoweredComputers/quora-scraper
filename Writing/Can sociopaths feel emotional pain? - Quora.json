            "answer_text": "Yes, sociopaths do feel emotional pain. Sociopaths often experience depression, stress, and anxiety. Rejection can be quite an intense experience as well. Abandonment or loss of a close relationship can be an experience that triggers many of the bad feelings we grew up having. Although I have very low levels of social emotions (empathy, guilt, remorse, etc.) I would definitely experience emotional pain if 1) one of my relationships went south on me and 2) I did not have control of that outcome; both criteria have to happen in order for me to feel the maximum amount pain that I do (which isn\u2019t much to begin with.) Intentionally, I have six relationships that I value. Four of the six mentioned are my immediate family. If I were to consciously cut one of those six out of my life, I would experience even less emotional pain. Of note, I would get over the pain faster as well; it\u2019s part of our defense mechanisms/coping strategies that we learned at a young, compartmentalize and move on. My children seem to think I\u2019m bipolar because I could hear bad news and be livid and ready to go on rampage and as soon as we get out of the car and see others who don\u2019t know me, I\u2019m smiling and displaying this great mood of laughing and joking. Clearly this is not bipolar, it\u2019s controlled. I can do it in my sleep. My rage is my rage. I show the public what they want to see as a \u201cwell adjusted\u201d father of three. For sociopaths pain can be diverted, compartmentalized, or absorbed and projected upon others or self. The first two methods of dealing with pain are what I excel at. It has been an extraordinary gift for me. It serves me very well in a world that is chronically disappointing. ",

            "answer_text": "I can only think of a small number of things that could cause me what I think is emotional pain, the biggest one being suspected unloyalty, I emphasise suspected as it is uncertain in my mind if it is or is not there, once it was proven to be there, I would stop feeling anything and then remove the person who was involved, however while it\u2019s suspected, that seems more like a feeling of irritation and a general \u2018bad feeling\u2019 than a feeling of actual pain, I don\u2019t like it, and it is uncomfortable to the norm though, so I guess it counts. When this happens my mind would do a kind of \u2018I will find out if it\u2019s true\u2019 and then I would keep it in my mind, though the feeling with it would fade pretty quickly. As I said earlier, once that becomes a certainty, I will deal with that and won\u2019t be impacted by it at all. Since people with ASPD are pretty good with adapting and moving on. It\u2019d be a short lived feeling of minor uncomfortability that led to finding a solution to the issue. If the solution comes back negative or positive, in terms of the mood I\u2019d be in, it would be pretty similar either way. In essence, we can, but probably not the way you\u2019re picturing. Pretty much everything I feel is very short lived and unimpactful when compaired to what most would feel, and I experience it way less often than most also. \u2014\u2014 As a little PS. It\u2019d never be felt for traditional things. Going by the concept mentioned before of certainty, if someone is dead, they are dead. There\u2019s no point getting sad over that. If a partner or family member is feeling sad, lets say they became homeless, the fact of the matter would be that they feel their things and are experiencing that situation, and I am not, so it is not really my issue. Thus, no sadness when it comes to things like that, only when it comes to things about me. As selfish as that is. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they can. Admittedly it isn\u2019t often. Sociopaths are people who have built extraordinary defenses for themselves against the emotional pain that they felt in their early years. Very little causes them to feel pain as adults. But they have hot button issues which vary from person to person and when those arise, they can indeed feel pain. It is not wise to deliberately cause a sociopath to feel pain. Their pain is not hidden behind acceptance, but denial and with that denial comes all the banked emotion they have pretended they didn\u2019t feel. If you know a sociopath\u2019s trigger, avoid it. Being triggered by someone other than themselves usually causes rage, while being triggered by themselves can cause rage and depression. That rage is uncontrolled and can be violent. That said, sociopaths are generally the most accepting, genial people imaginable. They aren\u2019t bothered by much; things that would shock or stun an ordinary person, they can just shrug off or laugh at. Don\u2019t go poking them with a stick. They have that armor for a reason.

I don t think so. however, what hurts him, is if his ego is bruised. if trump loses power, or loses his sense of control, this hurts him. this is about as close for Donald trump to feel emotional pain. in general, this is how I would expect from a sociopath. does Donald trump care if a dog dies?\u2026or if anyone dies, or anyone is hurting? I don t think so. even if he is ill, I don t think he cares, which might sound strange. that is hard to explain\u2026but as far as I understand,and I could be wrong,even if bad things happen to a sociopath, they may not care in a direct way. their concern is in each situation, they have their sense of power, or ego, or control, or find ways to please their egos. then when their egos are bruised, then I think that is the closest to them feeling emotional pain.

However when it comes to having empathy or feeling the pain of other people they are too embroiled in their own self-centeredness to feel anyone else's pain. They view other people as mere objects to be utilized for their own motives and self-serving purposes. They don't even have the ability to feel other people's pain. But they can be very vindictive, angry, plotting and scheming, because they very much care about the things that they want for themselves and their own goals and desires. ",

If you're referring to a random person dying or an emotional pain of rejection, then no we don't exactly. Why? Because we simply don't care for it and it's not something that bothers us for the most part. Unlike a psychopath, we were born with the ability to feel emotions as the neurotypical could, we just don't currently. Our brain wiring has changed, so something we could or used to be able to feel no longer can be felt to that same degree if felt at all. Emotions for the most part are surpressed unless otherwise stated. ",

You are coward enough not to touch those pages. Because you know they are the right incision for the poison to flow out, only if you could bear the pain of the surgery. It is equally hard to be indifferent as it is to be empathetic. Nothing weighs any side up or down. Sometimes hatred and arrogance you develop as a result of hard circumstances you have gone through, makes you successful. It helps you to slash off all the loose ends that could tangle the roads to your goal. ",
