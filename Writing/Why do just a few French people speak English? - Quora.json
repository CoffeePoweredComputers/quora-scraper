            "answer_text": "Original question: \u201cWhy do just a few French people speak English?\u201d The reality is that millions of French people are able to understand basic English texts and basic spoken English, so the question would be incorrect. I will rewrite this question as \u201cWhy is France routinely among the weakest countries in Europe when evaluated on English proficiency?\u201d, which is indeed the case. The reality is that it\u2019s very hard to learn a second language to high proficiency without some form of need and/or immersion. It\u2019s easier to become bilingual if 1) there is a strong incentive (\u201cI want to become an astronaut\u201d) or if there\u2019s a form of immersion (\u201cI lived in England with my parents for all of my teenage years.\u201d) Life in France does not provide many strong incentives, nor does it provides many opportunities for immersion. Most people in France will grow up in the following environment: Your family speaks French to you. All your friends speak French to you. School is in French. Good universities teach in French. TV and movies are in French (original language, quality dubs, or more rarely subs). Books are in French (including a long, long tradition of French literature. No pressing reasons to read Shakespeare when you have Moli\u00e8re, Racine, Balzac, Hugo, Voltaire, Dumas, Fontaine, the list goes on\u2026) Most jobs won\u2019t require you to speak English. Printed, televised and online news sources are in French. Restaurant menus, product packaging, and house appliances all come with printed text in French. Most daily interactions in your life won\u2019t involve English. You can be a happy, wealthy, successful individual without being particularly fluent in English. With this context, it is quite easy to learn very little English, or to choose some other second language (like German, or Spanish, or Italian, or Norwegian) and try to become fluent in that instead. Schools in France follow that approach, where English lessons are sprinkled here and there, but other languages are taught as well, and no emphasis is put toward English proficiency. I would say that the most common use of English nowadays are 1) to interact with tourists if you live in Paris, 2) to work as part of a multinational company where English would be an advantage, 3) to go on the internet. And so most young people in France nowadays know some English. But \u201csome\u201d might not mean anything in terms of proficiency. I remember learning words like \u201cdelete\u201d or \u201cscan\u201d or \u201ce-mail\u201d when I was very young and didn\u2019t speak English. But I didn\u2019t actually know what any of those words really meant except for the actions it lead to on a computer. Note: I wrote all of this about \u201cFrench people\u201d living in France. It\u2019s a very different story for French Canadians who have both strong incentives and many possibilities for immersion, and who do have very high rates of bilingualism. ",

            "answer_text": "This quesiton was in my mind a while ago. As a person who studied couple of years in France, I have my observations. I think there are three reasons why French people cannot speak/does not speak/does not prefere to speak English. First of all, everyone says that French are nationalists and they are jealous that English became \u201cthe internation language\u201d. The French language was once the international and diplomatic language so they miss those days. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. (Let\u2019s not forget that I\u2019m not a linguist nor a sociologist. These are my personal observations.) Reason 1: The Prononciation I lived in France and everyone I know, knows English comme ci comme \u00e7a. What I saw is that French is not like English. At all. So the prononciation of English words require the sounds that French does not have. Words that end up with -er (like mother) is pronounced in French way. Because they cant properly make that sound. So the french glottis can\u2019t provide most of the English sound. Reason 2: The Education Once a french friend said that they don\u2019t have good English teacher who can pronounce the words correctly and they don\u2019t have enough class hours to practice what they learn. This might be a problem of the R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise but probably the main reason. Reason 3: Perfectionism If they can\u2019t do it perfect, they don\u2019t do it, at all. Maybe they think they will be laughed at, or maybe they get shy while talking in English, who knows. But most of my classmates that I know they can speak English, wouldn\u2019t talk in English if the professor didn\u2019t ask a question to them or make them talk. ",
