Humor & Entertainment Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com.Read a lot of good screenplays, if possible while watching the movie, stop and start to see how the script is translated to screen - 50 Best Screenplays To Read And Download In Every GenreRead more scripts - Movie Scripts, Screenplays and TranscriptsIf you\u2019re in L.A., go to events at the Academy (they\u2019re cheap) and meet people - EventsWherever you live, try to meet pro writers - Meetup is a place to start - and see if you can get some good feedback.Learn what WGA signatory means and look up people to see if they are - Signatory Confirmation Lookups - that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t try to screw you or steal from you - Hollywood does that a lot - but you need to learn who the more respectable producers might be. (I didn\u2019t say, are.)Pay for a subscription to IMDbPro Start Your Free Trial because you can look people up and get in touch with them.All this time you should be writing a script. When it\u2019s done, find a local theater company and either join it or see if you can wangle actors doing a staged reading of your work - you\u2019ll learn more than you imagined about what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad and whose opinions are only that.Register your script with the Library of Congress U.S. Copyright Office and don\u2019t buy into the Hollywood lie that registering your script with the Writers Guild is the smartest way to protect yourself.When you sell a script, know that you\u2019ll probably only be offered \u201cscale plus 10 (percent, for the agent)\u201d and that if you get more, you\u2019re lucky. https://www.wga.org/uploadedfiles/contracts/2010_PBS_minimums.pdfFind a representative - currently there\u2019s a crazy war with agens and the Writers Guild going on, but you can find a manager or entertainment attorney to rep you if someone wants to buy your work. A manager cannot legally negotiate for you per CA law but they do it, anyway. You\u2019ll find as you go along that Hollywood largely doesn\u2019t care about law, but cares quite a bit about money, and not money for you, money for them.You can always find me and ask a question and if I think it\u2019s a good one I\u2019ll answer it.
