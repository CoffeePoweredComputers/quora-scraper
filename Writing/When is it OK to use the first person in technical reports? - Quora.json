For instance, if you want to use it in discussing assumptions you used in your methodology, go ahead. As discussed in detail in Michael Alley\u2019s The Craft of Scientific Writing, such writing can be easier to understand and clearer (Instead of \u201cIt was decided that\u2026\u201d or \u201cThe authors made the assumption\u2026\u201d). Most of the time, however, you\u2019re going to stick with third person construction since you want to keep the emphasis on your work, not you. ",
