            "answer_text": "You own a copyright on the following: Your style, your writings/articles, your poems, your book, your drawings, your design, the title of anything you prepare or make, Your dance moves. BUT everything should be original and not a single part/element should be a copy of any other work. Even if you use any other work (while writing, you are referring some lines of the author) in your own article, you should mention the author and provide author\u2019s/owner\u2019s reference. Second thing, you own a copyright the moment you create/publish it, but you can take it to court only if you have registered your copyright material/work in that particular country. On the other hand, you own a patent for an invention which should be a new product or process and involving an inventive step and capable of industrial application. In simple words, you own a patent on technical ideas. ",
