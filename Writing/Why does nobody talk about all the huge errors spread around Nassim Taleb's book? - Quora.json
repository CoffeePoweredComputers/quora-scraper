The FED and other central banks around the world have been printing all the money they wanted without major consequences (so far). Taleb\u2019s idea refers mostly to the fact that central banks no longer (after Bretton Woods) need to back their currencies with a real asset, like gold\u2026 I don\u2019t remember Taleb\u2019s second quote above\u2026 In any case, Taleb is not such a big deal such that everybody should be concerned about what he writes. You take him or leave him. ",
