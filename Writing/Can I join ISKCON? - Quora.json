            "answer_text": "Please do not join Iskcon until you understand what is involved. There are different levels beginning from being a congregational member who visits the temple when convenient or when there is a festival (with a feast), to being a FOLK member, (Friend Of Lord Krishna), to being a life member for those with enough money, to being a Namahatta member or Bhakti Vriksha member, up to being an initiated disciple. If you want to take initiation, it is a life-time commitment, there is no going back because vows are made (usually in front of deities), and they are life-time vows. Depending on your guru there will probably be other expectations as well as the vows at initiation as there is a code of behaviour as a Vaisnava that should be understood. All the details should be clarified before making the commitment. No one is initiated without personal contact with their guru, or a recommendation from someone their guru trusts in this regard. It should be understood that initiation is just that, a commencement or beginning, not the goal or end. From the time we are initiated we are a work in progress, but at least we have started. Without that first \u2018initiative\u2019 we are preparing the garden ready for planting the seed. After taking initiation we are disciples. Disciple means discipline, like the army, but kinder, more personal and less dangerous. Because Srila Prabhupada was very liberal in giving initiation some people took initiation and later fell away and in some cases became inimical towards the society. They didn\u2019t take to the process seriously and lost interest as a result. This is not helpful for anyone. Iskcon is an open door to everyone regardless of background, race, caste, creed, financial situation or even legal issues, but one ingredient is necessary and that is sincerity based on knowledge of the commitment. Since the guru is responsible for his disciples he will generally want to see conviction in his disciples before accepting the responsibility of delivering them from samsara. If he feels a candidate is not serious, it will cause problems for him if he makes the commitment to deliver him or her in front of deities and a fire sacrifice. Disciples are the responsibility of the guru and if they ignore his instructions, not only are they an embarrassment, but he will have to take birth again to deliver them. For all these reasons it is essential to establish a solid relationship with your intended guru or someone that he trusts if he is not easily available in your area. This can be done within a temple or outside depending on your circumstances. In one way or another make contact with an Iskcon member either on-line, at a temple, through an outreach group, a preaching center or some other way, and through them make contact with an authority who can admit you to a temple or introduce you to the person you want to serve as your guru if that is the sort of \u2018joining\u2019 you want. The relationship is based on love and trust which must go both ways to be fruitful. Should you do it? Yes you should, but with your eyes open and confidence in your heart. ",

            "answer_text": "When you say you \"want to join ISKCON\" do you mean that you want to remain brahmachari (celibate student) and never marry? This is a very rare position. Most will find it necessary to accept a partner. But this doesn't have to limit your involvement in ISKCON. Srila Prabhupada himself became a devotee as a householder. He supported the devotees, had preaching programs in his home, distributed and printed Back to Godhead magazines, wrote for his spiritual master's magazines, and in many ways tried to spread Krishna Consciousness. \"Joining ISKCON\" doesn't only mean moving into a temple. It means dedicating one's energy toward supporting and spreading the teachings of Srila Prabhupada and following good sadhana (regular spiritual practice), reading Srila Prabhupada's books, etc. You can establish a temple in your home and help to make your parents and other family members Krishna Conscious as well. If you are considering leaving your family to join the temple, and remaining in the temple...that is another thing and it is a heavy decision to leave your family, but you can do whatever you feel is best. Your parents don't have to agree, although that would be nice, but it's not essential. If you have a spiritual master, or other senior devotees in the temple that you go to for advice, I would suggest you also consult with them. But consider carefully before you take any action...and understand that joining ISKCON does not necessarily mean you have to leave home and move into the temple. First, my appreciations that you have the determination not to allow your family to suffer. This is what I expect from the devotees. Every devotee should learn how to balance the family and devotion. They should not run away from their family to serve Krishna unless there are genuine reasons or unless they seriously desire so. Devotion can be followed as a grahastha also.It is very easy to associate with the devotees of the ISKCON as they are always available to guide you at their temple. However, you can\u2019t get the opportunity to stay and serve on the first day itself. If your services and devotional growth impresses the temple manager/ president, he may allow you to stay there. Otherwise, you should serve as a congregation member. May Lord Krishna give you a bigger devotional path and bless you in your bhakti karma ahead. Hope it is helpful. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure !!! You can join ISKCON, but there are some basic principles that we need to follow, for which we can start practicing from now and then slowly and slowly we will become perfect in that. Here are those: a) Strictly follow four regulative principles of Sanatana Dharma. They are as follows: i) No meat eating or non-veg of any kind that includes not eating onion and garlic as well. ii) No gambling, even not playing cards or any card game. iii) No illicit sex - only establish relation with your wife for child birth and considering all other women in the wold as your Mother iv) No smoking b) Doing atleast 16 rounds of chanting of the below stated Hare Krishna Maha-mantra daily (in this sequence only): Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Ram Hare Ram, Ram Ram Hare Hare Practically, it does not become possible to chant 16 rounds daily from our schedule, but we can start with atleast chanting 2 rounds daily and slowly and slowly we can increase. One round of mala contains 108 beads, so we have to chant the above maha-mantra on every bead and that takes only 5\u20137 mins to complete one round. c) Visit your nearby ISKCON temple(s) and on entering first show your obeisances to Jay & Vijay (spiritual doorkeepers of God), then on entering do prannaam to Srila Prabhupada (founder acharya of ISKCON) and then have darshan of the deities of the temple. d) Try to visit ISKCON Temple every day, but must attend Sunday Feast program (afternoon) and try to engage yourself in some devotional service. Meet with some devotee residing in the temple or the temple President and they will involve you in some devotional service. e) Read the books that are available in ISKCON Bhaktivedanta Book Trust (BBT) . These books are originally written by Srila Prabhupada and the divine effect of these books has changed the people from each and every part of the world and engaged in the loving service of God.

            "answer_text": "As other posters have said, there are different levels of involvement. ISKCON is very welcoming to all, so there is no requirement that you have to fulfill in order to participate in weekly programs or festivals. But, if you want to take things more seriously, there\u2019s other things you can do. You can find a group of devotees that meet weekly and attend their programs regularly. This could be a college program, Bhakti-Vrikshas, Nama-hattas, or other home programs. Here you can receive further training as to how to further your Krishna consciousness.Once in regular association of devotees, you may want to decide to progress further in your life of Krishna consciousness. This means you start working up to the standard for initiation (chanting 16 rounds, following the four regulative principles, as well as regularly reading Srila Prabhupada\u2019s books). You may not get there overnight, that\u2019s ok. But you can start to work up to the standard from whatever point you are currently at.Eventually, you may decide you want to take the next step and take initiation from a guru. Usually, you first take shelter of a guru, which means you chant 16 rounds and follow the four regulative principles for a certain period of time. During this time you will also want to take the ISKCON Disciples Course. After the specified time period is over for taking shelter of a guru (usually 6 months to a year), you can take first initiation, where you receive formal initiation into the Hare Krishna mantra (you also receive your spiritual name at this point). There is also a second initiation you can receive, which qualifies you to serve the Temple Deities. Usually this occurs after at least a year of following the principles. In all cases, as other posters have pointed out, one tries his or her best to sincerely uplift others by giving them Krishna consciousness. Srila Prabhupada risked his life and underwent extreme difficulties to help humanity by sharing the spiritual knowledge of Krishna consciousness, and he hoped his followers would adopt his spirit of selfless service.Should you decide to join ISKCON, you\u2019ll find it a very blissful and rewarding experience that gives you a taste of the spiritual world even in this life.

            "answer_text": "Okay, Don't bother much about joining ISKCON, it's not like joining a college. ISKCON is like a hospital. Do you agree there are different levels of \"joining\" a hospital? One may have just taken some medicine from one of the doctors of the hospital. One may have admitted in ICU, one may have become a doctor himself.. Similarly many ways are there in ISKCON too. Main thing is to understand and start practicing the philosophy given by Srila Prabhupada, the founder Acharya of ISKCON. By associating with some devotee who is already following this, it becomes easy. Srila Prabhupada has instructed all devotees of ISKCON to chant 16 rounds of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra and follow 4 regulative principles. Apart from this, there is no rule as to where one should stay, whether one should marry or not, whether one should pay any money to follow ISKCON. Hare Krishna Mahamantra is : Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Chanting this mantra 108 times equals to 1 round. 4 regulative principles are - No meat eatingNo intoxicationNo gamblingNo illicit sexThere are many schemes for donating money for ISKCON mission. One of them is \u201cLife Membership\u201d, the amount for this may vary from place to place. Hare Krishna\ud83d\ude4f ",

            "answer_text": "Hare Krishna! iSKCON of nowadays as organization is quite decentralized. Every center is like separate entity and mood and demands differ quite drastically from country to country, from town to town. Before to join ISKCON - first one must try to join teachings of Srila Prabhupada - founder of ISKCON. Try to implement them in life, prove them, experience them - like waking up early at morning, like following 4 regulative principles, like chanting Hare Krishna mantra, like reading books, like situating oneself in varnasrama. Step by step. Year after year. So many have \u201cjoined\u201d ISKCON through \u201cdead bodies\u201d of their relatives, families, duties - by leaving them, neglecting, betraying for the benefit of \u201cspiritual carrier\u201d in ISKCON - but after few years in ISKCON they found themselves dissatisfied, disappointed and devastated - and they leave ISKCON. No - this is not what is thought by Srila Prabhupada. No. Main idea is - at the beginning stay who you are, where you are - and add Krishna. Experience it. Get a taste. Learn how to serve Krishna and people - society around. Situate yourself in your dharma as devotional service to the Lord. It will take time. It will take efforts - but it will be honest, it will be truthful. Truthfulness is a last leg of religion. ",

Do dhyaana, weekly visit near by Orphanage / old age home distribute some fruit , chocolates, medicine,etc and Support them . Organise kirtan at home with family members friends etc.. Learn biographies of Ancient and modern sages , saints and follow their teachings ; Following books are good one you can read it - An autobiography of a yogi. Miracle of love A search in secret India Yatharth Geeta Learn about - Shri raman maharshi, Shri Ramkrishna Paramahans, swami Vivekananda, neem karoli baba, Lahidi Mahashaya, Trailanga swami , etc.. On other hand after joining any group person gets stucked with a single thought process with a single teaching which don't allow that person to judge through his own mind that what is right , what is perfect method et. . My grandfather was member of iskon, that time I was use to visit frequently , best part is that they focus on chanting, but in reality they don't know the steps of chanting\u2026 worst part is that if you are from poor family / you are poor you face following issues - Membership is costly. Prasad is not free it has cost RS 50 & above vary from city to city . You supposed to do Seva all time like may be they will give you a task to sell sweets at the temple's owned shop within temple premises .. etc etc \u2026 discrimination among foreigner vs indian swamis, devotees and resident of temple.. Now choice is yours. Yet if you want you have to visit iskon and get registered yourself with their life membership cost is in between USD 1008\u20132550. Membership packages has few choices you may choose as per your situation. ",

            "answer_text": "Hare Krishna Prabhu, This is a vague request and this cannot be answered without knowing your spiritual level and without consulting some senior devotee. You can join ISKCON movement in 4 ways:- By dedicating your life, by contributing money, by using your intelligence or by spreading the word of Prabhupada. They are all in decreasing order. The general guideline is one should begin chanting 16 rounds and follow regulative life for around a year, render service to temple in various capacities. Also you could join devotee training center's like FOLK or other such centers where you will get first hand experience of Vaishnava culture followed in temples. Then according to your inclination the devotees concerned would guide you if you are fit for ashram life or grihasta life outside temple. Other considerations like family situation also will be taken into account. One has to read Prabhupadas books especially Bhagwad Gita and Bhagwatam to get convinced about joining. Most importantly one must have a missionary spirit to help spread the movement of Chaitanya Mahprabhu and Srila Prabhupada. Recommend you to read \u201cPrabhupada Lilamrita\u201d to get to know more about Prabhupada and his teachings. ",

Rtvik, as it\u2019s colloquially known by the answer below, has nothing to do with authentic ISKCON, and is merely an excuse to find fault with other aspiring Vaisnavas. Like any other cheap knock-off, it has similarities and gradations, and they certainly have some sincere chanters, however, at it\u2019s heart, this compromised system rests upon Vaisnava aparadha, and therefore must be rejected. It is true that, if you want to make advancement in Krishna consciousness, you should test a prospective guru. That is required. However, there are many wonderful candidates from which to choose. To name a few, there is HH Radhanath Swami, HH Indradyumna Swami, HG Vaisesika Prabhu, HG Mahatma Prabhu, HH Hridayananda Goswami, and many others. Fortunately, there is a perfect checks and balances system in Vaisnava tradition, called: Guru, Sadhu, & Shastra. There are TWO things to understand when choosing a Guru: 1) He is following His own Guru (Srila A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada) sincerely and strictly; 2) He is the right Guru for YOU. As I mentioned above, there are many bona-fide Gurus, and actually, you can have multiple instructing Gurus, however, there will be only one initiating Guru coming in the line from Srila Prabhupada (A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami), and you will feel a special connection to such a Guru, if you sincerely want to. There are many other finer points to consider, and I would be happy to discuss them with you. Feel free to connect with me on Facebook at: Gopal Frank Cohen. You will find that if you connect with the Ritvik Yatra, you will find far more time finding fault than you will growing your love for Krishna and His devotees. It is up to you to decide what you want to accomplish. ",

However the vedic conclusion is that the slightest and even offensive or inadvertent contact with the Holy Names gives the full benefit of Krishna Consciousness, so there is absolutely no need for an intermediary to God, if you read the verses only. So if your purpose is to achieve Bhakta Yoga perfection, it only takes a few sessions at most, according to the Vedic poems. If you love KC, then I suggest accepting the mercy you already got which is enough according to the vedic conclusions\u2026.. keep your full independence and be what they call a \u201cfringer\u201d. They will treat you nicely and you can have fun with friends at the Temple. :-) Good luck :-) ",
