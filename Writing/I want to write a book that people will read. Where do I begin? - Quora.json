            "answer_text": "Most people will tell you to just start writing, and keep writing, but I don't agree. It's not enough to just write every day if you don't know what you're doing. That just means days and weeks and months of useless writing. It's like not knowing how to knit so you just keep making loops with the yarn. You can't get better, you can't turn that into a scarf ... you have the desire, but you don't know how. I'm going to give you my stock answer that I give everyone who asks me this question. I'm going to give you some good advice on how to learn the craft, and give you a place to send in some of your work when you're ready. In order to write stories that people want to read you will need to understand how to put one together. There is a definite pattern and rhythm to it. And there are certain expectations from the editors and publishing houses as to how your story is laid out. You will need a good imagination, one that can look at a situation and picture all sorts of different scenarios. You need to be able to ask 'what if' and come up with twists and lines that are new and fresh. You will need to be able to research things. For example I wrote a story set in Iran where there was a wedding. I had to research how the wedding would take place, the food, the customs, common Iranian names, clothing, etc. in order to write an interesting yet correct story. Take classes in writing; grammar and punctuation (very important... lots of self published books are swimming in glaring errors and typos), character building, dialogue, plotting, pacing, point of view (POV), inner and outer conflicts, subplots, scenes and sequels, genres, story boards, twists, chapter hooks, suspense, killer opening lines, and satisfying endings. If you're going to write sci-fi you will need to take classes in world building. Each genre of book has its own set of expectations from the reader that you will need to fulfill. For example a murder mystery must have clues for the reader to try and solve. A romance needs a happen ever after ending, known to writers as an HEA. A thriller needs fast pacing and danger. There are classes in short story writing. Where to find these classes? Local community colleges often offer writing classes. My local library has classes seasonally. Best of all there are hundreds of classes you can take on-line. They run about $25-$35 each and range from 2 to 4 weeks. Google on-line writing classes and you will get lots of sites. There are sites that offer expensive classes, so be careful. I\u2019d recommend starting with a few less expensive ones to see if you really like writing and want to continue. IMO it is not necessary to have a degree or to take an expensive course to write well. Try http://Savvyauthors.com. They have classes year round. You can join their site for free and get a discount on their classes. Read a lot. Get a feel for how a story is told; how it starts, how it progresses through the story to a satisfying end. See how your favorite author keeps you interested. I don't know your age, but when you are able join some writing groups, even online groups are helpful. Oftentimes these groups offer lectures and classes in writing. They share their work and critique each other. Once you start taking classes and get a good feel for how to put a story together, write some short stories (800 - 1500 words). The more you write, the better you will become. You will make new writer mistakes, we all did. But that's how you learn. I say start with short stories because they are, well short, and don't take years to complete like a novel does. You can share your stories with others and get feedback. Take the feedback and use what you feel is constructive for you and ignore the others. Some people don't give good feedback, or there is a motive behind their negative comments. You have to learn which ones to take and learn from and which ones to disregard. And when you are reading and critiquing other's stories, be kind, give good feedback, and find something positive to say to them. It's hard to hear harsh things about your writing. It's tough love. But it works when you get it and understand why the comment was made and you go and make your piece better because of it. Submitting to contests is another way to get good feedback because the judges are usually editors and agents who have their finger on the pulse of good writing that sells. Once you feel you have written a great short story, be brave and submit it to a magazine that publishes fiction in the genre you wrote. Don't worry about rejections. They will come. Oftentimes it's not because your story is not good, it's because the story doesn't fit their needs. They are running a business after all, and they pick the stories that they feel will best entertain their readers. All authors get rejections. It's part of the 'hunt'. Here\u2019s a place to start submitting. Check out their guidelines carefully. FLASH FICTION ONLINE http://flashfictiononline.com/main/submission-guidelines/ We publish stories from 500 to 1,000 words in length. They\u2019re very short, but they are still stories. That means the best ones have strong, interesting characters, plots, and (to some extent, at least) settings. We\u2019re not that concerned about genre. Many of us have a fondness for science fiction and fantasy, but we also like literary fiction; and in any case, great flash stories aren\u2019t always easily classified. If you wrote it, and you love it, then submit it. No erotica, porn, graphic sex, or violence. Pays $60 per story. Buys reprints at two cents/word. Once you are good enough to sell a few short stories, then you will have the skills to think about plotting out a whole book. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s after 2:00 in the morning. I\u2019ve been dealing with numbers all night. I see I get this question on Quora, \u201cI want to write a book that people will read. Where do I begin?\u201d I think to myself, should I put on my Serious Hat to answer this question, or my Sassy Pants? I look to see who the requester is. He\u2019s an educated, cute young guy. He could be my son. Sassy Pants, most def. If you\u2019ve seen anything I\u2019ve written on Quora, you know that I ask a lot of questions. You are obviously good with English. But\u2026 WHY do you want to write a book? No, seriously! Come up with a list, and it better not have \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201cfame\u201d on it. Okay, it can have those two things on it, but put them down at the bottom. Way, way, way down at the bottom. Write that list down.What KIND of book do you want to write? Fiction or nonfiction? Write that down. Any particular genre(s) you like? (Hint: If you like the stuff, there are probably others who like that stuff.) Write that down.Have you DONE any writing (non-academic, although research can become a book, too)? Yes? No? If not, you have to do some writing before you take on a book. Because you have to write a lot of stuff (including crap) before you can take on a writing a book and not frustrate yourself into oblivion. Tons of writing prompts out there. Go have some fun with them. Take a writing course. Just because we are good at English doesn\u2019t mean we know writing the way a book makes you do it. Join a writer\u2019s group or forum. In-person or online, whatever fits your needs and schedule. Don\u2019t be a novelist \u201cweekend warrior\u201d and try to write a book without writing practice. Your imagination will be groaning on the physical therapist\u2019s table until it screams, \u201cI\u2019ll never *&#$&^ write again!\u201dRead, read, read! Classics, different genres, the type of books YOU would like to write, etc. (What? No question? Just a lousy statement? Do you feel cheated?) Is it fiction you want to write? Read these: Anne Lamott\u2019s Bird by BirdNatalie Goldberg\u2019s Writing Down the BonesThe Writer\u2019s Digest Handbook of Novel WritingStephen King\u2019s On WritingAre you WILLING to write regularly, both practice and on the book? As in, are you willing to GLUE, epoxy, weld, strap, bolt your butt cheeks to a chair and write? (You have a standing desk? Really? Then, chain, splint, staple, rope, duct tape your legs to that desk\u2019s legs! HA! Thought you had me for a minute there, didn\u2019t ya?)Ideas? Sorry, out of the scope of this question. Ask another. (I\u2019ve written a bit about this in answer to other questions, as have many others far smarter and more experienced than I.) In all seriousness, the idea thingy is part of the writing practice and you can conjure ideas in so many ways, you\u2019ll be here longer reading this than I will have been writing it.What you should NOT do is try to \u201cwrite to market,\u201d try to write something based on what\u2019s popular now. By the time you finish the book, it won\u2019t be \u201chot.\u201d It\u2019s like trying to \u201ctime stocks.\u201d Write about what you know, what you like, what you are interested in. You will be surprised what good seeds for a book will be planted by writing practice, by keeping a journal, by watching what goes on around you and describing it when you get home. One thing to remember is: It\u2019s not just the idea for the book that makes people want to read it. It\u2019s how you tell the tale, too. And how it gets promoted to get people to read it in the first place. If you have told the tale well, they will tell their friends, who will tell their friends, and\u2026 Which brings up one last question \u2013 Do you know how to persevere? How to take rejection? Accept constructive criticism? Rewrite when it just doesn\u2019t work? Okay, so that was four last questions. Is that a problem? Five.Disclaimer: I\u2019ve been a reporter, an editor, a freelancer, and written as part of my jobs for what seems like forever. I\u2019ve had a few short stories published in a local paper. I have not finished my novels or published through a traditional publisher. What I know about novel writing is due to reading a lot over the years. I\u2019ve been in writers\u2019 groups. I listen to slam poetry. (Not bad for an ordinary old lady.) Blah, blah, blah. In short, I\u2019m no expert on producing a book. But people ask me about writing, so I share what I know, what I like, what I\u2019m interested in. And if you read this far, then I guess I wrote something people (you) want to read. Thank you for the A2A and for letting an old lady have a little fun while hoping to help. . ",
