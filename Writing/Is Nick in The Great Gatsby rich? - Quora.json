He\u2019s becoming rich and already lives as a bourgeois, but not as much as Gatsby. He\u2019s not from old money artistocracy like Tom Buchanan is. ",

Nick Carraway is Gatsby's next-door neighbor. His personality traits: he is easy-going, occasionally sarcastic, and somewhat optimistic, although this latter quality fades as the novel progresses. He is more grounded and more practical than the other major characters in the novel (and movie adaptations), and is always in awe of their lifestyles and morals. ",
