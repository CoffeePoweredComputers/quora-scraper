            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the technique. In the blue-book or essay book you open and write on the left side, the essay prompt which includes whatever style the professor may have specified. ExpositoryDescriptive \u2014 Process / How toNarrative.Compare-&-contrastPersuasive/argumentativeNow, hopefully the mods won\u2019t ruin this post when I put this model in here:  The model on the left is the essay skeleton. It has all the reminder bits of what you should be doing. On the left side of the book create your guide outline: In single lines write : Thesis assertion : Ex: this that other is true because 1 2 3 (1 2 3 are your point summaries)Point 1 topic sentencePoint 2 topic sentencePoint 3 topic sentenceHere\u2019s an implementation : Example Thesis : Masks should be worn because they help prevent the spread of disease, set a good example, and shorten the lockdown.Assertion: Masks should be wornPoint 1: they help prevent the spread of diseasePoint 2: they set a good examplePoint 3: they shorten the lockdownWith this quick outline to guide you on the left, you start writing the essay on the ruled part on the right: A real short introduction, the thesis / assertion, first topic sentence then elaborate support, second topic sentence plus support, third, and conclude. Note this mechanism works for even large projects. A masters thesis or doctoral thesis is basically like a giant molecule composed of related essays put in sections. You can map out assertions to points and support. MAIN ASSERTION -> SUPPORTING SECTIONS -> SECTION ASSERTION -> POINTS AND SUPPORT. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally I just get wordy. You can say a lot with few words. The same is true, but reversed. You can write five paragraphs, but you barely say anything. All you have to do is write this basic skeleton and then go back in and ramble. Like this. Wafers are delicious, but unhealthy. Five words, right? Just go in and blab on and on about how they taste like this. Wafers are a delicious albeit low-price delicacy. Coming in a variety of flavors and sizes, you can find them in many places from various brands. Some give a satisfying crunch when you bite down, others melt in your mouth. Coming in a variety of flavors, chocolate, strawberry, etc, wafers are for everyone. but that\u2019s not all\u2026 And that one paragraph literally took me three minutes to write. Piece of\u2026 wafer? It actually takes a tiny bit of practice but after two reports big word counts no longer seem so scary. Of course you\u2019re going to want to make there at least enough substance that the teacher isn\u2019t negatively impressed. If all five paragraphs were about the taste of the wafer your skeleton is too weak. But once you get the hang of it this is a fast and easy way to get your reports done. ",
