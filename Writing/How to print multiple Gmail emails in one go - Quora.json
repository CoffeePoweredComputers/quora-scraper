            "answer_text": "Just export them (if doing that individually is a problem due to numbers, you could write a macro that sequences through an entire mail folder\u2014this could also do the printng) as .eml files. Once you have say, 30 messages sitting as files on your desktop or in another convenient location, you can select them all and right-click (Windows) or use Mac-P (Macintosh) to print them all at once. You may be amused to see each file pop open your email client briefly (to print each one; if you use a macro, you may need to plan and pre-test your code for each step to be sure it doesn't get stuck). My other thought was: How industrial is the printer for this? Because nearly every modern printer uses a digital queue to stack jobs ready for printing and outputs them in series. Unless you're talking about dozens rather than hundreds of messages (or a Xerox 9000 production printer), the printer will probably need a little breathing room to keep up, too. ",
