            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I think you're probably meeting people from Non-English speaking countries with English names such as mine - \"David\" was given to me by my first grade teacher because I was so self conscious about my given Japanese name. Having said that, most Japanese would probably just like your foreign name just the way it is. As you probably know, Japanese people call each other by their last name in formal settings and as they get more comfortable, they'll say \"call me by ____,\" which is probably a shortened version of their first or last name or something that stuck since childhood because of a hopefully a pleasant incident. So what would be best is you start by formally introducing yourself by last name, then you can go, \"but please call me AJ\" (if appropriate). Or you can let them figure out a new nickname for you and depending on their age, comfort level, and general creativeness, they might stick something funny, cute or annoying. (I would probably guess something like \"Dano'tchi\" or \"An-chan\"). I hope this helps you enjoy your time in Japan! ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the other answers. No need to choose a Japanese name. The only foreigners that do are people who become Japanese citizens. AJ will not be hard to say at all. My maiden name was not extremely difficult, but I didn\u2019t much care for how it sounded in katakana, which is how all Japanese people would pronounce it. I just asked people to call me Sue, and everyone was happy to oblige. Even now that I\u2019m married I get called Sue-san more than I get called by my last name once people get to know me a bit. ",
