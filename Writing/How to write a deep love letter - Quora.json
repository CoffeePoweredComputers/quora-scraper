            "answer_text": "Tell her what she wants to hear about her self. All positive attributes (nothing negative or \u201cconditional\u201d) Describe her attributes that you deem important. Her loving smile. Her eyes that glisten and radiate love. Her impeccable choice of clothes. Her loving ways around children. You get the idea. Make the compliments real, IE, actual attributes. No left-handed compliments with a conditional \u201cbut\u201d. Such as \u201cyou are so great with children, except when you are really tired\u201d. Tell her how you feel when you are with her. Maybe you feel \u201crapture\u201d. Perhaps you just want to hold her tight and never let go. Or, you just want to protect her from the hardships of life. Assess your own feelings and express them. However, do not mention anything of a personal sexual nature. Such as exploring her body or seeing her naked. At this stage of the relationship such frank feelings would be a turn-off to her and maybe a deal-breaker. OK to tell her how you feel when kissing. But no further with a sexual theme. (Assuming your feelings would be OK if your Mother is reading the letter.) Tell her how you would like the relationship to continue and grow. Perhaps you are looking into the future with her at your side and supporting each other in all matters of hardships. And your love for each other will see both of you through hard-times and make the \u201cgood times\u201d even more enjoyable. Good advice here: Do not put anything in the letter that would not be approved of by your Mother. You do not know where or whom may one day read the letter. If you put it in writing, you own it. But DO be sincere. Good Luck ",
