            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll need a main character that people can relate to. Give them both good and bad qualities. Since no one is perfect, your character can\u2019t be either. Same goes for every character you come up with. Some can be more good or bad than others, but they should have a mix of both. If the MC is part of a group, give each member of the group a defining trait. This will help differentiate. Try to give group members complementary traits and qualities to cover each others weaknesses. After that, come up with a theme you want to explore ( i.e. friendship, loneliness, family). It can be over reaching, in that it\u2019s found in every arc somehow, or it can be arc specific. Try to come up with both. Next is plot. Doesn\u2019t have to be overly complicated. It also doesn\u2019t have to be simple. Set a page limit to make planning the plot easier. Say, 20 pages. What do you want to happen in those pages? Think of things that drive the plot (i.e. questions: who, what, where, why, when, how; conflict; reconciliation). What\u2019s the story wanting to be written? Dialogue is very important, it moves things along. It explains things to the reader that the art doesn\u2019t or can\u2019t. Being a good artist can only help you. You\u2019ll have to world build. Establish laws and rules of your universe. What works, and what doesn\u2019t. I think that\u2019s it. Have fun. ",

            "answer_text": "First, you need to create deep characters with both negative and positive traits to make them believable. Then you have to set a page limit for each manga, this makes it easier to plan the plot. You need to find a theme or themes to focus the plot around and a conflict or conflicts to help the story along. There is a storytelling technique called Ki-Shou-Ten-Ketsu you should research that, it makes storybuilding easy. I\u00b4s advise start small, with 16 page manga. You can go all the ay up to 32 pages and then even more ofcourse once you get more experience. Try to write like it is a tv-episode, keep it simple and to the point.. Dialogue is also very important because it is what moves the story forward together with the art. If you want to really make a series, you have to a) create many, many deep characters with diverse traits and be different from eachother b) create their universe and world, establish the laws of that world. c) Decide whos story you wish to tell or what the bigger narrative is, what is the goals of the protagonist? Series manga take huge effort to make and you have to do lots of research to make it believable, as to make it so, you have to look at reality we live in and add a twist to it. You have to look at techniques of writing and storytelling to begin with. Then comes the art. If the story is good, it doesn\u00b4t matter if the art is less than good. Look at one-punch man for example\u2026 or some kids manga.. ",
