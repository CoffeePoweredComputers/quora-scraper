The hard part is doing the research, presenting the argument and coming up with a conclusion BEFORE you write the paper. The paper will write itself once you know what you are doing.  When I was in college I wrote research papers for money for other students and routinely did all of this in one night, and we had no fancy \"internet\" in those days.  It was all library work and taking notes and creating bibliographies and so on.  You need to have an idea of where the paper is going and what cogent points you want to make, then the rest is easy. Let me know how it turns out. ",

You could probably do that in three hours. It's a rough draft. I used to do that, find my \"research\" afterwards and be done the next day. Of course this was writing about film, literature and history. STEM research is something I don't know about. Good luck. Get going! ",

I would make sure I had all my necessary resources in front of me, and that I had thoroughly thought out what I wanted to write - my message, my ideas, perhaps a picture of how it would be organized by topic.
