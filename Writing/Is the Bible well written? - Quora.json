            "answer_text": "In the sense of say Greek and Roman literature, not even close. The G/R literature was not written for encoding moral law, detailed public and private behavior, etc. While the G/R works did depict such things, there is a very distinct difference in how 'moral law' was promulgated, and lists of prohibitions or acceptable behavior was not popular. The 'play' form does not exist in either the Old or New Testament. While there is mention of 'other cultures', it is almost always in the context of a condemnation. One never finds a Herodotus, or heck even Homer's viewing both sides, perhaps with a decided bias.... of the Trojan War finale... What we get is a midget slinging a stone at a giant, blam dead... move on... that would have generated about 100 plays were it a 'greek experience', or say Samson... oh... wait... Samson would have been Hercules... and did generate a long sequence of 'heroic' works... and even some comedic works... Speaking of which The Bible is completely devoid of 'jokes'... unless of course one considers Eve to be God's second joke... One reason is perhaps that The Bible was not written for 'literature' in the least, but for 'instruction' and any literary works such as the poems attributed to David and Solomon, etc. were more for 'instruction' than actual 'literature'. We read that the Greek theater was an extension of some ancient ritual of recitation by the group, then as time passed, the 'group' reduced down to The Chorus, while one then two principle actors became the center of the performance. There is almost no equivalent literary device... perhaps with the exception of the book of Job, which could be presented as a 'theater' work. Which of course could suggest that it is a 'late' inclusion when the ancient collators of the Old Testament did in fact come in contact with more 'literate' peoples. Since the reason for the OT and by extension the NT was 'instruction/giving of law', there was for both Jews and Christians a large set of additiona texts generated on 'argument/discussion' about how to apply these laws, what sort of conduct was allowed/prohibited, under what conditions various laws held, etc. In a few words, Greek and Roman 'behavior' was regulated more by 'ethics' with a minimal set of explict 'laws', vs. a detailed set of moral laws governing all, or a large amount of 'behavior'. The later necessarily would required a large set of documents, as well as prior arguments, as exemplified by both Jewish and Christian traditions. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's be careful not to shoot the messenger if we don't like the message... For as a start, it helps to remember \"the Bible\" isn't one book and didn't have only one author. Once you realise that, many of the usual criticisms fall flat (Fallacy of composition). Nobody accuses the Library of Congress of being badly written. Second, your humble opinion has no influence on the measurable quality of the writing in its original context - disliking the content or themes in the Bible does not make any of it badly written (nor does liking them make it well written). That's judging a book by its cover. So when someone makes a judgement on the content by casting doubt on the \"The Bible's\" intention, questioning its agenda, or says \"there are better stories\", they are merely Begging the question.The reality is not everyone likes poetry, epistles, legal texts or history, least of all if they require some effort to follow. You've been to school. The fact that someone tells you something is good content does not mean you will automatically appreciate it. Whether it's Byron, Calculus, Homer or Shakespeare, much of the literature outside our usual frame of reference is often only unlocked by studying it. Especially with genres that are no longer current or have modern alternatives that are more accessible, we have to learn what to judge them by.As far as the writing  goes, you are probably reading a translation anyway, which means you are not picking up on subtleties that might have been self-evident to the original audience. Good writing assumes the skilful integration of language and culture into the text or story, and if that language and culture is foreign to your own, you are forced to grant a different mindset, suspending some of your own cultural prejudices and assumptions in order to read it as intended. (Modern readers are wary of how the Suspension of disbelief can be exploited, and we usually associate it with genres of fiction - but it is often necessary for a gracious reading of any text.)The books in their original languages may very well be of varying quality depending on author and genre, and what you compare them to. For instance, Paul might have been well educated, but he often uses a scribe or \"ammanuensis\" (Letters of Paul: Amanuensis) who would have been well versed in the letter-writing conventions of the time. It would be unfair of us to dismiss Paul's sincere messages (as compiled in the New Testament) because of modern prejudices against the art of first-century epistle-writing. It's not the fault of the authors if we don't appreciate the stylistic devices and requirements of their genre, or if we prefer other forms of expression (our culture is more visual than oral these days, and we prefer our messages packaged accordingly).Take the Book of Job, for example, which Lord Tennyson called \"the greatest poem of ancient and modern times\". It is universally regarded as a masterful example of Hebrew Wisdom literature and praised for its skilful use of language and structure by scholars of the period. Much like Ulysses and War and Peace, it is tough to appreciate the expert appraisals... but what makes armchair opinions any more authoritative?In conclusion, I don't think the average reader is in a good position to judge the literary merits of the books in the Bible. But if measured by their influence on the writers and books we generally consider to be classics in Western literature, I don't think its place in the literary corpus can be lightly discounted.

            "answer_text": "The Old Testament was written primarily in Hebrew but has some Aramaic texts. The book of Daniel begins and ends in Hebrew but the bulk of the book is written in Aramaic; there is also a small portion of Aramaic in Ezra, and very small examples of Aramaic in other places. Note the use of \u05d1\u05e8 (Aramaic word for son) in the following verse rather than the Hebrew word \u05d1\u05df \u200e \u05de\u05b7\u05d4\u05be\u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05ad\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d5\u05bc\u05de\u05b7\u05bd\u05d4\u05be\u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e8\u05be\u05d1\u05bc\u05b4\u05d8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u0591\u05d9 \u05d5\u05bc\u059c\u05de\u05b6\u05d4 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e8\u05be\u05e0\u05b0\u05d3\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05bd\u05d9 (Prov. 31:2 BHS) In Daniel, the change from Hebrew to Aramaic comes mid sentence, and then continues through the bulk of the book. This is the verse where the transition is made. \u200e \u05d5\u05b7\u05bd\u05d9\u05b0\u05d3\u05b7\u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05e8\u05a7\u05d5\u05bc \u05d4\u05b7\u05db\u05bc\u05b7\u05e9\u05c2\u05b0\u05d3\u05bc\u05b4\u059b\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05b7\u05de\u05bc\u05b6\u0596\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b2\u05e8\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u0591\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05bc\u05b8\u05d0\u0599 \u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05b4\u05a3\u05d9\u05df \u05d7\u05b1\u05d9\u05b4\u0594\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b1\u05de\u05b7\u05a5\u05e8 \u05d7\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u059b\u05d0 \u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05d1\u05b0\u05d3\u05bc\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05da\u05b0 \u05d5\u05bc\u05e4\u05b4\u05e9\u05c1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05a5\u05d0 \u05e0\u05b0\u05d7\u05b7\u05d5\u05bc\u05b5\u05bd\u05d0 (Dan. 2:4 BHS) In Hebrew: \u201cAnd the Chaldeans spoke to the King [in] Aramaic\u201d In Aramaic: \u201cO king, live forever. Tell the dream to your servants and the interpretation we will give.\u201d The books of the New Testament were written entirely in Greek. Some have theorized the existence of a \u201cQ\u201d source written in Aramaic that was the basis for the synoptic gospels i.e. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, but at this point in time no Aramaic \u201cQ\u201d source has been discovered. There are some minor quotes in the NT that reflect an underlying Aramaic dialog, but the text of these quotes were transliterated into Greek. Examples: \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f14\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u00b7 \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f75\u03c1 (Mk. 14:36 BGT) And he said \u201cAbba Father\u201d Mk. 14:36) In this example \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 is the Aramaic vocative form for father i.e. \u05d0\u05d1\u05d0 And \u2026\u1f10\u03b2\u1f79\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd \u1f41 \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u1fc7 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u1f71\u03bb\u1fc3\u00b7 \u03b5\u03bb\u03c9\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bb\u03c9\u03b9 \u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c7\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9 (Mk. 15:34 BGT) Jesus cried out with a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\" (Mk. 15:34) In this example, the quote is Aramaic, while most of the vocabulary is similar to the Hebrew vocabulary, the declined verb sabachthani is very different from the Hebrew azavtani. The quote comes from Ps. 22, below I have provided both the Aramaic and Hebrew versions of this verse. \u200e \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9 \u05dc\u05de\u05e0\u05d0 \u05e9\u05c1\u05d1\u05e7\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9 (Ps. 22:2) \u200e \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b4\u05a3\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b5\u05ad\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9 \u05dc\u05b8\u05de\u05b8\u05a3\u05d4 \u05e2\u05b2\u05d6\u05b7\u05d1\u05b0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b8\u0591\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 (Ps. 22:2) These Aramaic quotes provide evidence that the language spoken by Jesus was Aramaic, but the Gospel accounts themselves were written in Greek. Even in the case of these Aramaic quotes, the Aramaic was transliterated into Greek letters in the Gospels. ",

Among other early attempts at writing, the bible was certainly very well written. Mankind\u2019s infancy of literacy stumbled and fell over and over again. Even the original Old Testament, the Torah, was very primitive. It did not have spaces or punctuation or verb tense or capitalization/lowercase or chapter number or verb number. It was very primitive, but (again, for its time) well written. By today\u2019s standards large parts of it are pretty much crap, and cannot be fixed as the original authors are dead. The parables and psalms hold up fairly well as individual stories. But revelations is a nonsensical fever dream. As a whole, the collection of books known as \u201cthe bible\u201d is all over the place, split in theme and direction. Militant atheists joke it\u2019s The Big Book of Multiple Choice. Christians themselves certainly cherry pick what verses compel them individually sect by sect. With hundreds of denominations and major splits that sometimes violently disagree with each other, the book certainly does not seem to demonstrably reflect a unified whole. ",

            "answer_text": "In order to answer the question of whether a given book is well-written or not, we first have to determine what its purpose might be. A novel and a car repair manual are both excellent things, and both can be very well-written (or very poorly so), but they don\u2019t use the same styles. In fact, a car repair manual written in the style of a well-written novel, full of drama and gripping scenes and suspense. . . would actually be a very poorly written repair manual, now wouldn\u2019t it? Either your mechanic would never get around to fixing the car, or else he\u2019d be driven to drinking by trying to find what he needed. So, then, what\u2019s the purpose the Bible is supposed to accomplish? Some people (a few) read it purely for literary purposes, and if that\u2019s our motive then I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s very much a mixed bag. Some parts of it are quite enjoyable and well-written purely as literature, and others are not. On the other hand, some people (quite a lot) try to read it as if it were an instruction manual, and I\u2019m afraid those people will find it to be a difficult and confusing book, because it\u2019s not written for that purpose either. In fact, it\u2019s partly written with the express aim of discouraging that kind of approach. The real purpose for which the Bible was written is to help the individual reader to form an intimate relationship with God. Anyone who tries to get something else out of it is trying to cut the wood at cross-purposes, and probably isn\u2019t going to find the experience very satisfying. For that reason, it\u2019s sometimes entertaining, sometimes instructive, sometimes difficult to understand, and sometimes even contradictory (at least on the surface). And these things are far from being flaws, because those are the kinds of things one encounters when getting to know any real person. Indeed, you can\u2019t truly get to know anyone unless you experience a lengthy relationship with him and see many different facets of his personality. It\u2019s only then that you can learn to love this person (or not, as the case may be). That\u2019s why the Bible is such a lengthy book, full of so many different types of writing and so many vexing difficulties. So, given the purpose of the Book (to get to know God on a personal level, and hopefully to love Him), I\u2019d say the Bible is very well-written indeed. It\u2019s just not what you\u2019d expect at first. :) ",

It is not an accepted proof to refer to 2 Timothy 3:16 to claim that \u201cAll Scripture is inspired by God\u201d That claim was written by Paul to add some credibility to his letters after the disciples denied him and deserted him. Other reason to reject the claim of Paul in 2 Timothy 3:16 is that the letters of Paul were written before Mark, Matthew, Luke, John and revelation; we cannot say \u201cthe book of Revelation is inspired by God because Paul said so\u201d. We cannot say \u201cthe bible is inspired by God because the bible said so\u201d; that is not a logically accepted argument and is a clear \u2018Circular reasoning\u2019. When Jacob\u2019s descendants wanted to glorify him, they claimed that he wrestled with God and was saved. The verses in Genesis 32:24-30 teach that Jacob was able to wrestle with God; he said to God \"I will not let you go unless you bless me\u201d Although the true teachings of Deuteronomy 10:17 teach that God does not favor \u2018who shows no partiality\u2019, the descendants of Jacob wanted to glorify him in the name of God; they added the distorted teaching of Genesis 25:23 and Malachi 1:2-3 \u201cJacob I loved, but Esau I hated\u201d They wanted to say that it is the will of God to choose them regardless of any condition like good work and true faith. That distorted teaching is against the true teachings of Moses that God chooses the righteous who obey and curse the wicked as the core and the most consistent teachings of Exodus 19:5, Leviticus 18:4-5, Leviticus 26, Deuteronomy 11:18-20, 11:26-28 , Deuteronomy 28, Deuteronomy 30:15-16 , and Deuteronomy 30:19, Deuteronomy 32:46-47 Deuteronomy 30:11-14 teach that obedience is possible; the verses have been copied into Romans 10:5-9 in order to change the salvation by obedience into the salvation by faith alone Some teachers teach that obedience is not possible; they do not teach Deuteronomy 30:11-14 anymore; they teach the distorted teachings which teach that obedience is not possible like Romans 7:14-25, Romans 10:5-9 and Galatians 3:10 The original verses of Deuteronomy 30:11-14 are: Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, \u201cWho will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?\u201d Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, \u201cWho will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?\u201d No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it The distorted verses of Romans 10:5-9 are: Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on the law shall live by it. But the righteousness based on faith says, \"Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?\" (that is, to bring Christ down) or \"Who will descend in the abyss?\" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say? The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart (that is, the word of faith which we preach); because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved The reason of the change is to shift the faith foundations from obedience, repentance, and good deeds into claims of faith without good works or obedience to God\u2019s law Romans 7:19 teaches For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing James has corrected that misunderstanding in James 4:17 If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it, it is sin for him Instead of the true and most consistent teachings of \u2018blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 in Deuteronomy 28, Leviticus 18:4-5, Deuteronomy 11:18-20, 11:26-28 , Deuteronomy 32:46-47, Deuteronomy 30:15-16 , and Deuteronomy 30:19, some teachers teach that God chooses people regardless of their obedience as in the distorted teachings of Deuteronomy 9:5-6 and Deuteronomy 7:6, Malachi 1:2, Romans 9:13 When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Atonement they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:11 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who do not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teach that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teach that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood Proverbs 17:15 states: \u2018He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination unto God\u2019 That should be considered as a warning to the teachers who promise free salvation to the sinners and who teach that the innocent has been punished on behalf of the sinners Jesus taught the parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32 to highlight the importance of obedience and repentance as the main pre-requisites for salvation That is the core Christianity teaching as taught in Matthew 7:21 Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven Jesus has confirmed the teachings of the Old Testimony \u2018in repentance and obedience is your salvation\u2019 as taught in Isaiah 30:15 In Matthew 25:31-45 Jesus described the final judgment as being based on good works; he clarified that those who obey the law will be saved Salvation is not based solely on belief and nothing else; salvation is not granted to those who merely profess acceptance of Jesus without performing kind or compassionate deeds Jesus did not teach that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law; In Matthew 16:27 and John 5:29, Jesus has confirmed that God will reward each person according to his deeds; those are the basic teachings of the old testimony like the verses taught in Psalm 62:12, Ecclesiastes 12:14, and many other old testimony verses In Luke 13:3 and 13:5, Jesus taught that repentance is necessary for salvation But unless you repent, you too will all perish Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one\u2019s neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6 \u2018For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings\u2019 That verse teaches us that forgiveness is possible by repentance and obedience; no sacrifice is necessary Matthew 9:13 teaches that Jesus came to call the sinner to repentance \u2018I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance\u2019. When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Trinity; they have added verses like 1 John 5:7 \u201cFor there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one\u201d The bible footnotes explains that verse 1 John 5:7 was not in the original old scriptures Jesus did not ask the disciples to worship him as a God; he asked them to pray to \u201cthe only true God\u201d, \u201cMy God and your God\u201d. The bible footnotes show many other additions in King James Version which were added to support the claims of trinity and which were not in the old scripture; examples are: In I John 4:3 \u2018CHRIST is come in the flesh\u2019 is an addition In Matthew 8:2, 9:18, 15:25, 18:26, 20:20, Mark 5:6 the word \u2018bow down' was changed to \u2018worshiped\u2019. Jesus referred to himself as \u201cson of man\u201d. Jesus was not all-knowledgeable and he prayed to GOD, so this is enough to say that he wasn\u2019t God nor did God come down to earth to be Jesus. Jesus said, \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know You ***the only true God***, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.\u201d John 17:3 Jesus said that he does not know everything; he said that only God knows But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father Mark 13:32 Jesus said that he is not equal to God \u201cI can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.\u201d John 5:30 Jesus said, \u201cThe Father is greater than I.\u201d John 14:28 \u201cJesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.\u201d John 7:16 Jesus prayed to God as written in Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16, John 17:11, Matthew 26:39, Luke 10:21, Luke 22:44 \u201cmy Father and your Father; my God and your God\u201d John 20:17 The disciples did not pray to Jesus, they prayed to the God and Father of Jesus \u201cBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d 1 Peter 1:3 Jesus introduced himself as a Prophet and people accepted him as a prophet, not as a God in Matthew 13:57, John 9:17, Matthew 21:11, Luke 7:16, Luke 24:19, John 6:14, Matthew 14:5, Matthew 21:46, John 7:40-41, and in Matthew 24:36 Jesus never said I am God; In the Old Testimony God says he is God several times, but Jesus did not say so in the New Testimony Isaiah 45:5 and 46:9 \u2018no God beside me\u2019, \u2018none like me\u2019 In John 17:6-8 and John 13:3 Jesus explained that God has given power and authority, he did not own it \u201cI have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. \u201cNow they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You; for the words which You gave Me I have given to them; and they received them and truly understood that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me John 12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say John 14:24 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me In Matthew 19:16-17 and Luke 18:19 Jesus denied being good in the sense that God is good. \u2018Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.\u2019 Jesus is called a \u201cMan\u201d many times in the Bible of John 8:40, Acts 17:31, Matthew 27:54, Luke 23:47, Mark 15:39 \u2018a man who has told you the truth\u2019 The disciples have introduced Jesus as a \u201cMan\u201d in Acts 2:22 and Acts 2:23 ",

            "answer_text": "Most people who will answer this question have not studied the Bible or its history and origins. The Bible is a remarkable book, written over a period of about 1400 years by about 40 authors. It is entirely unified with a single central theme. Hundreds of Old Testament prophecies have been fulfilled already, and we see signs of more coming to pass. If you want to understand our current times - all the turmoil and unrest and rebellion, read your Bible. It\u2019s all there, warning of what\u2019s coming down the pike. The Bible is beautifully written and meticulously preserved. Jewish scribes have relentlessly copied manuscripts, disposing of anything that wasn\u2019t flawless, down to an exact letter being in the exact same place on the copy, counting every word, every letter, and even throwing out mistakes as small as one dot. The differences between our current Bibles and the most ancient manuscripts are minuscule. The poetry is exquisite in the original languages. The history has been verifiable 100% by archaeological discoveries. The single theme throughout the entire book is Christ - the Redeemer of mankind. Christ, alone, fulfilled about 300 prophecies written hundreds of years before his birth. Authors that never met each other and that lived at different times wrote in complete agreement of each other. And they validate the other\u2019s writing. The Old Testament points to the Savior of the New Testament with flawless perfection. The Bible is a powerful, life-changing book. If formed the foundation for the constitution of our nation. The reason our country is coming unraveled is because we have forsaken God and his Word. And you can be sure, without a doubt, judgment is coming and is already visible. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible is extremely well written and has various genres of literature: Narrative history, poetry and prophecy. Each section of the Bible reflects the culture and customs of its day when that section was written. It is good and wise to know the culture behind each part of the Biblical text. It is not good to pull one verse out of its context to prove some predetermined belief. That is called eisegesis and leads to many misunderstandings of what the Bible does say. A better way is to read the text at hand, understanding its culture and text in the original language. Stay away from the King James text, as the meaning of many English words has changed since 1611, and new manuscripts of the ancient original languages of Hebrew, Aramaic and Koine Greek have been made in the past 200 years. It is best to read the Bible in two versions, one a literal text like the New American Standard Bible or Christian Standard Bible, and a less literal and more dynamic translation like the New International Version. Reading the Bible will be a blessing once we realize that not everything mentioned is for us now. Some things like Holy War , dietary laws, or polygamy were practiced in Old Testament times and were the norm for then, but not normative for us now. The Bible reflects the cultures in which it was written, and how God dealt with people within each culture. God still speaks through his written Word-the Bible and the Living Word Jesus Christ. ",

            "answer_text": "The only real way to judge \u2018well-written\u2019 is to look at the response of readers. JRR Tolkien and JK Rowling have both been accused of \u2018bad writing\u2019 by the standards of modernism popular in the 20th century. But they between them wrote nine of the most popular fourteen fiction books ever written. If you\u2019re looking purely at literary style, in as much as that can be judged, the best-written book in the Bible might be perceived to be Job, which has an advanced vocabulary and passages of extraordinary beauty. The worst-written, in the sense that the grammar is at times \u2018unexpected\u2019 is Revelation. And yet Revelation has been one of the most significant inspirations in Western Art for 1500 years, and has had a dramatic impact on thought and language. Was William Blake a great writer, or just a bit weird? Was James Joyce a great writer, or just odd? Both of them are in the canon of literary English. Certainly William Tyndale and Miles Coverdale\u2019s translation of the Bible, even in the slightly watered-down form of the 1611 King James Version, has established itself as one of the most important works in English literature, and is cited by many as the single most important work in English. The Bible is the world\u2019s best-selling book, and it is every year. It has been translated into vastly more languages than any other book, and it exists in English translation in more versions than any other book. It is the most cited book in human history. You could reasonably argue that the Bible is the standard by which \u2018well-written\u2019 should be judged, since no other book can come close to it. Even in terms of plot, the producer of the long-running (and often most-popular) British soap opera Eastenders maintained that all of the storylines were taken directly from the Bible.[1] Footnotes[1] Would you Adam and Eve it? EastEnders is inspired by Sodom and Gomorrah, says producer",

What we have problems with is \"Is it well translated?\"  The King James Bible, translated in 1611 was translated from Jerome's Vulgate, not original Manuscripts and today it is like a foreign language to many. There are \"Children's Bible\" that claim to be translation that are written on and elementary school level.  There are \"gender neutral\" Bibles that have perverted much of the meaning of some passages.  There are denominational translations that have inserted the creed of the denomination in the Bible.  Take your pick...  Personally, I have found that the New American Standard Bible and the English Standard Version have made good use of the most ancient manuscripts and the most understandable American English. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. The Bible is majestic. It is truly brilliant and bears the marks of divinity down to even the structural level. There are story arcs that resolve after millennia. There are allusions that show up in the strangest places, with stuff you would only catch on your 8th read-through of the whole Bible, but not the 7th, and so on. The composition of books are so thoughtful that serious interpretive problems can arrive merely from underestimating the care put into the book. That\u2019s just reading English translations. If you can read the original languages you can see all kinds of clever wordplay and masterfully fluid poetry. Just reading contemporary books to the Old Testament, like the Epic of Gilgamesh, or the Enuma Elis demonstrates enough familiarity to show they had some common literary relationships, but the Bible is just better.

The Quran teaches you and makes you understand today\u2019s world and it was written 1500 years ago. it shows you that the world hasn\u2019t changed much.

The author of Mark\u2019s Gospel is regarded by some scholars as perhaps the pre-eminent author among all extant Greek works of the first century. He is a largely unacknowledged literary genius of his time. ",
