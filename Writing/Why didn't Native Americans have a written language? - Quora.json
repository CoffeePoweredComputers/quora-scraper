The Mayans have left some archeological evidence in the Southeastern U.S. showing they were trading with the Mississippian civilization and 5 Civilized Tribes there (chocolate residue in the bottom of clay pots in North America the most recent) so exposure to written languages (the Mayans made books and paper) would be certain. Much of the writing in North America, like anywhere but the use of clay tablet imprinting in the official cradle of civilization (also falling apart), relied on materials that rarely last long enough (tanned animal hides, the insides of chunks of tree bark, or on cloth) while written languages not exactly like modern European languages were overlooked as just decoration (beadwork patterns up through wampum belts, colors and shapes used on dwellings, pots, apparel, baskets, blankets, or rock carvings, complex knotting systems like the Inka Quipu.) Symbol-based written languages in the Americas\u2019 writing, noncoincidentally like Asian, Semitic, Egyptian, and others, are much harder to translate, recognize, and survive civilizations\u2019 collapse since quite few people master all or most of such difficult to remember characters. The Native Americans are only \u201ctoo primitive\u201d if you completely ignore anything the women say, do, or make (other than as quaint and pretty crafts for pure decoration), only compare them to contemporary English, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese stuff as the apogees of meaningful civilization and sole measure of relative sophistication, and ignore their quite advanced research and thinking in so many topics it took us 600 years to notice and acknowledge.

            "answer_text": "Old world writing developed out the need for accurate accounting of inventory, taxation, and interpersonal loans. (Linear B, the earlist decifered Greek writing, was mostly accounting records. Early Summarian prototype-writing was clay tablets inscribed with simple symbols to record financial transaction.)The majority of Native American societies were small enough that interpersonal debts could be handled by memory of past favors. (Hey, I gave X some meat after are previous hunt and he did not return the favor during the latest hunt. Well, not only is he now on my list of people not to get into debt to, but everyone else in our group noticed.)Most early exchange of goods between separate political units in Mesoamerica were one time, long distance deals, say dried fish for turquois, salt for quetzal feathers, so no reason for record keeping.When things got more complicated in Mesoamerica, pictures with a few added symbols were sufficient. This system used, for example, by the Aztecs to keep track of tribute owed by subject states.Above does not explain why Maya did have writing. Possibly something do with systems of complex calendars, complex religion, and egos of rulers who who liked to record their military exploits? Maybe to support , justify, family dynasties? Teotihuacan, which dominated central Mexico, 300 to 800 AD, never had a ruling dynasty.. The Aztec ruler was chosen, usually from the family of the dead ruler, but it did not have a ruling dynasty in the Europian sense . However, Mayan states definitely had ruling dynasties.Above does not explain why South American states like Incas and earlier states in South America did not have writing.. Did they not last long enough? Did they not last long because they did not have writing?",
