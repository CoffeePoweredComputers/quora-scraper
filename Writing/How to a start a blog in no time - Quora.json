            "answer_text": "Good question. I will gladly share my experience. I started my blog nearly a year ago. It\u2019s not just A game, it\u2019s your work. But\u2026how the heck do you get started? There\u2019s so much info out there on the web, and everyone\u2019s telling you to do different things. Who do you listen to? Where\u2019s the starting point? I can speak a lot about this topic, but for you, my dear friend, will be useful some tips. There\u2019s five main steps you need to do in order to start a blog. If you follow this guide exactly, you\u2019ll have your own blog set up in 30 minutes or less. Choose your preferred blog platformChoose web hosting for your blogSetting up a blog on your own domainDesign your blogUseful resources for bloggingSo, we made it. Phew. Better late than never! So, without further ado, let\u2019s jump into step 1. Step 1 \u2013 Choose your preferred blogging platform Choosing where you want to build blog is pretty much the first thing you have to do. I have my blog on Wordpress and I recommend it. There are more than 82 million active users of WordPress = a lot, basically. WordPress is bigger (and probably better) than those two, here are reasons why you should still go with WordPress: Super easy set-up and is free to useTons of free themes and layouts (I\u2019m not kidding, there\u2019s gazillions).There\u2019s a massive support forum in case you get stuck (you won\u2019t, but it\u2019s nice to have it there if you need it).Your blog will be insanely fast and it\u2019ll also look Functionality and form \u2013 perfect! People can interact with you easily. Your content can be shared, commented on, and so on.Step 2 \u2013 Self-hosting or a free alternative? Whoa, slow down there! This is the biggest decision you\u2019ll have to make before we go any further. You need to decide whether to pay for your blog or grab a free one.WordPress, Tumblr and Blogger all offer free blogs for anyone. Awesome, right? It\u2019s perfect for those of us who aren\u2019t super serious about blogging. Step 3 \u2013 Start a blog on your own domain (if you chose self-hosting and a custom domain)I\u2019m going to push ahead based on the premise you\u2019ve chosen WordPress, and if you haven\u2019t, you should. Seriously, it\u2019s the best.You\u2019ll need to come up with a domain name you like and also choose a hosting company that can host your blog.Domain: The domain is basically the URL of your website. Examples: Google (Google is the domain), Log In or Sign Up (Log In or Sign Up is the domain). See? Simple! Hosting: Hosting is basically the company that puts your website up on the internet so everyone else can see it. Everything will be saved on there. Once WordPress is installed on your website, all you have to do to start blogging is go to your WP-Admin page. Step 4 \u2013 Designing your WordPress blog Now, the fun bit. Let\u2019s make your blog look exactly how you want it to. I did my own design for my blog, but fot you, you can choose a new theme, you can either head to Appearance > Themes and install a free WordPress theme or you can head to a premium theme website and buy a theme for around $40. Last step! Woo! Step 5 \u2013 Useful Resources For Beginner Bloggers Bloggers come to blogging arena with varying degrees of online and social media experience, but we\u2019ve all made more than a few newbie mistakes \u2013 there\u2019s always room for more learning and improvement, whether you\u2019re a beginner or you\u2019ve been blogging for years.These articles may help you avoid some of the growing pains when it comes to your first blog \u2013 enjoy!: 5 Beginning Blogging Mistakes You Can FixChoosing a Blogging NicheHow We Communicate: FAQs for Beginning Bloggers7 Ways to Boost your success as a BloggerGood luck.
