            "answer_text": "I remember is was easy for my dissertation some years ago. It was something like the title in quotes plus year (2020) and \u201cretrieved on\u201d this date in numerical form, followed by the author and publication, and URL. That may still be correct, or somewhat changed in order, but there were no pages, sections, or versions to mess around. Consult the online guide of APA which exists in many colleges today. I remember some talk between professors that they felt online citations were in need of standardization, so that may have occurred by now. An easy way to check this is to pull up a media journal and search for citations in article form. Any academic journal will use the latest APA form to cite another internet article properly, and that will take you just minutes to find on Google in the search box \u201cacademic journal media.\u201d Here\u2019s one: Warren TK, Jordan R, Lo MK, et al. Therapeutic efficacy of the small molecule GS-5734 against Ebola virus in rhesus monkeys. Nature [Internet] 2016;531(7594):381\u20135. Available from: Therapeutic efficacy of the small molecule GS-5734 against Ebola virus in rhesus monkeys Good luck, Mac ",

            "answer_text": "It sounds as though it would be helpful to you to go to the Purdue Online Writing Lab or OWL. It\u2019s easy to Google. There you\u2019ll find information about different citation conventions, sample texts, and examples of how to cite, both in your text and on a works cited page. No one keeps all this information in their head unless they\u2019re doing a lot of writing, and you\u2019ll learn more by familiarizing yourself with the resources. I believe the APA also has a website with instructions for how to do this. Good luck with your paper. ",
