            "answer_text": "By and large, the most common mistake I see first-time authors make is to race to get their book to print before it is actually ready. In an ADHD, instant-gratification-consumer-driven culture, there is a lot of pressure on writers to get something out there -- anything really -- in order for them to get themselves established and recognized as an author. Not having your book professionally edited is a big no-no in this business, but unfortunately, there are many writers who choose to skip this very important step. Even in New York Times bestselling novels I will frequently catch spelling mistakes and grammatical errors that can and do happen, but in general, these books are pretty clean. But in a over-saturated, self-published world where anyone can and does publish (many books being offered for free on Kindle) the sheer number of typos and punctuation errors is enough to put off most readers. (There is nothing more irritating than being pulled out of an otherwise great story on every other page by glaring spelling errors!) What's worse is that most readers may not be likely to pick up another book by that author ever again, thereby \"ruining\" the author's reputation. By not having his/her story professionally edited for content, the author is doing himself/herself a disservice and basically selling the story short. After all, who doesn't want their story to be absolutely spectacular?! There may be just one or two plot holes that the writer doesn't see but could be picked up on by an editor and easily corrected. It may be a great story, but readers are fickle. They can love 95% of the content and be so put off by one tiny aspect of the book that they will give it a one or two-star rating. The bottom line here is: if you take the time to make a great piece of literature, invest some money and time to hire a professional editor! Additional note: I feel the need to add here the second biggest mistake that first-time authors make, which is: not getting the book cover done by a professional. Although most of us hate to admit it, we all judge a book by its cover. Gone are the days when nondescript black and brown leather covered every book and each one was judged solely on its literary merit. It's quite possible that you may have just penned the best story of the century, but without an attractive, eye-catching cover, no one will give it a second glance. ",

            "answer_text": "     There are three mistakes that will tick your reader right off and maybe even cause you to lose him or her. They are: poor editing, sloppiness with tense, and poor vocabulary.       There are some readers who can't seem to turn off their internal editor. These readers will notice every missing or extraneous  comma, awkward or run-on sentence,  wrong homophone, and any other writing error you commit. When they do, it jerks them right out of the story. Don't think your reader won't notice that your \"editor\" was your friend, sister, etc. who's \"really good at English.\" You need a professional.      You may think that tense should fall under editing. It should, but deserves special mention. Please pay attention to your tense. Nothing screams amateur more loudly in an otherwise well-edited  piece than inconsistent use of tense. Pick a tense and stick with it. If you must use temporary tense changes that are part of a plot device, keep them consistent within themselves.       And lastly, vocabulary. Readers like to think that you as an author have a better vocabulary than them. Don't prove them wrong. If you aren't more than 100% sure that you know and understand a word's meaning, please, please, look it up. But don't simply rely on a thesaurus or dictionary definition,  read examples in sentences. Make sure you actually  understand the word before putting it out there for the world to see.       Avoiding these common mistakes will help you look like a pro. Now you just need the story.  ",
