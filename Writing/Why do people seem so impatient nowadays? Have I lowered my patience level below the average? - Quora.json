            "answer_text": " Patience is the key to success but unfortunately, its hard to find a person with patience these days. The lack of patience and composure is prevalent among modern human societies. The primary reason can be cited as change is lifestyle . Its almost ironical to say that most Humans in modern societies are often unhappy with themselves. The desire to get better than their present situation fuels them to push their limits. The technological advancements in 21st century have made the life miserable. Most of these people suffer with Insomnia. A healthy and balanced lifestyle alongside a successful career can aid Patience and composture. Comming on to the second part of the question, it's just your perception. I don't know if there are any laws in psychology like this but I prefer to say that, everything are perceptions. There are always some unpleasant things going on in life. Your life is all about how you react to it. Likewise, if you perceive that you have lowered your patience level, you have gained noticeable maturity regarding things going around in life. ",
