            "answer_text": "Yes. It is incorrect, and sort of a pet peeve of mine, to say you are \u201cwriting a grant.\u201d A grant is typically a monetary award given to somebody to do something. Artists, teachers, researchers, businesses, and others can give or receive grants. The awarding agency usually receives many applications and they go through some review process to pick the winner(s). Using proper English and grammar, if you are writing a grant, you are writing up the paperwork to give the award to somebody. If you want to apply for a grant then you need to write a grant application or proposal. However, 99% of the time when somebody says they are \u201cwriting a grant,\u201d they are speaking incorrectly and are actually writing a proposal to try to receive a grant. ",
