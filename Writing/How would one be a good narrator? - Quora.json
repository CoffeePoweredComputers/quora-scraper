(Other dialects may be useful, but these two are bread-and-butter.) Get into the habit of checking a dictionary to be sure you can pronounce every word\u2014without hesitating. If you get emotional while reading, learn how to turn it off; sometimes emotion is desirable, but you must keep it on a leash. Internalize that it\u2019s \u201cthuh\u201d before consonants and \u201cthee\u201d before vowels. ",
