            "answer_text": "If you dont like working for money then you must like work which you are interested in. And if you are doing so then there is nothing wrong with that. Even many successful tycoons says dont go for money rather go for in which you are interested it will definitely pay you off, not immediately but absolutely and definitely. If you go after money then you have a high chances of failure than those who go after interest. Interest is such a vital element that a human have, it can lead you to where you want to go and it even lead you to where you dont wanted to go. Yeah, you read it right. Interest in wrong and illegal activities can lead you to hell. Okay. Interest in good activities can lead you to heaven. Hope you are getting my point. And yes, if you go after your interest money will run after you. This is what i all have regarding your question. And if it is not related to your question then dont dislike it because i did not even write any bad thing. Thanks! ",
