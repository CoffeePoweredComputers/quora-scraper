            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a hard question to answer. It depends on so much. For instance, if you have an outline made, it will take much less time than if you are starting from scratch. Also, how you feel about what makes up the biography. If you are writing about how you worked your way up from being afraid of the water to winning a gold medal in the Olympics, it will likely take you much less time than if you are writing about how your mother died when you were very young, then your father ran off and started a new family leaving you to raise your young siblings. Rejoicing takes less time than mourning. The best approach is to start a biography without declaring a deadline. Tell the good and the bad, the successes and the failures. Good luck, and write on! ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019ve lived for about twenty years and haven\u2019t done very much, you probably won\u2019t have a lot to say but if you write one page a day, in a year you\u2019ll have a 365 page manuscript, or about 85,000 words, a pretty good start on an autobiography. If you\u2019re eighty, fought in three wars, raised seventeen children, opened and ran five different business, some of them successful, ran for a political office, spent time in prison, met multiple highly-visible celebrities, you will probably have a lot to say about your life. If you produce one page a day, in a year you\u2019ll have a 365 page manuscript, or about 85,000 words, a pretty good start on an autobiography. ",
