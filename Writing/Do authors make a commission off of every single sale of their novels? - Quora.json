            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t make commissions, we earn royalties. \u201cCommission\u201d implies you\u2019re working for someone else, and novelists aren\u2019t. As for whether we earn royalties off every single sale, it\u2019s not quite a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Usually, if a novel is traditionally published, the publisher has paid the author a lump sum up front called an \u201cadvance against royalties.\u201d Every single copy the publisher sells at or above wholesale does indeed earn royalties, but the author doesn\u2019t receive anything more until the royalties earned exceed the amount paid as an advance. The book is indeed earning royalties, but the author already got paid. Once the full advance has been earned, then the author does indeed get paid for every copy sold \u2014 except see below. Traditionally, the publisher would send a royalty statement twice a year, listing how many copies had sold, and enclosing a check for anything above the amount of the advance\u2026 except for a reserve against returns, which is money the publisher holds back until it\u2019s sure bookstores aren\u2019t going to return more copies than they sell. (You know books are returnable for credit, right?) Anyway, short version, the accounting can get complicated, but yes, every copy sold earns the author a royalty, with the following exceptions: Review copies and copies given away for publicity are not sales, and therefore don\u2019t pay royalties. When a book goes out of print \u2014 that is, when the publisher isn\u2019t printing any more copies and decides the remaining copies on hand aren\u2019t selling fast enough to justify the warehouse space they\u2019re taking up \u2014 the remaining copies can be disposed of two different ways. They can be destroyed, or they can be sold off below cost. Books sold off below cost are called \u201cremainders,\u201d because they\u2019re what remained in the warehouse after the book\u2019s commercial life was over. Authors do not earn royalties on books sold as remainders. It also used to be that Braille editions and other books for the blind didn\u2019t earn royalties, but since audiobooks have caught on I don\u2019t know whether that still applies. Generally, Braille editions were done as a public service, and the publisher didn\u2019t make money on them \u2014 they\u2019re more expensive to produce, and sales are very low. Publishers understandably didn\u2019t want to pay the author for books that were already losing them money. So giveaways, remainders, and editions for the blind don\u2019t earn royalties. But every single book sold through normal channels does earn the author a royalty. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the situation. If there\u2019s a contract, it might specify certain kinds of sales that the author won\u2019t get a royalty for. The author might earn royalties but they will be applied to whatever advance the author got. If a book is written \u201cfor hire,\u201d the author might only get the initial pre-launch payments until the book is completed, unless it was negotiated to get a bonus or percentage if sales exceed a certain number. Obviously, there is no royalty to the author on second-hand sales. Sales to libraries may also be exempted by the contract. (If the publisher can avoid paying royalties on those, which are virtually guaranteed regardless of quality or popularity of the work even if not a single copy is sold anywhere else, why would they pay them? Business is business.) Sometimes, a bookseller has a lot of unsold copies they want to return to the publisher, but the publisher doesn\u2019t want them back (doesn\u2019t want to pay the freight and can\u2019t sell them anyway), so they credit the bookseller\u2019s account with the return and tell them to just sell them. Those are the books you\u2019ll see on the \u201cCLEARANCE\u201d tables at Barnes and Noble for $5 when the cover price was $24.99 a month ago, or they may sell them to a large second-hand bookseller, such as Red Carpet.
