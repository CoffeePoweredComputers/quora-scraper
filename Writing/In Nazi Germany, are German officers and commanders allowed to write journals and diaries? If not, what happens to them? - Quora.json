            "answer_text": "Many individuals, both military and civilians, kept diaries during the Third Reich. Nazi Germany never had a proscription on personal journals, and even if it had, enforcing such a thing, even in a totalitarian state, would have been next to impossible. A great deal of what we know of the intimacies of life in those years is actually due to surviving journals and diaries. But there certainly were risks involved in placing your thoughts and opinions to paper, particularly if you were critical of the regime or the war, and there was always the risk that your journal would be discovered. For civilians, this included the very real risk that your home could be bombed out and your personal papers and journals would be discovered in the rubble. Somewhat less likely was the possibility of your home being searched by the Gestapo, but this risk increased exponentially if you happened to be Jewish. Victor Klemperer, a Dresden scholar and Jew, maintained a diary(published post-war as I Will Bear Witness)throughout the entire period of the Third Reich, and even wrote in it that if it were to be discovered, would most likely mean instant death for him. Eventually relegated to living in a Jewish \u2018house\u2019 that was regularly searched by the Gestapo, to mitigate the risk, he wrote only a few pages at a time and entrusted them to a gentile friend for safekeeping. As for the military, the difficulties of maintaining a journal, particularly in combat situations or close to the front, were naturally more considerable than if they were located further behind the lines. Ernst J\u00fcnger was a WWI veteran who had maintained a diary of the Great War years and had written a book, Storm of Steel, based on those diaries, which was published in 1920. A staunch militarist and nationalist who disapproved of the Weimar Republic, J\u00fcnger had strong authoritarian leanings but also resisted attempts by the Nazis to woo him to their side. When WWII broke out, J\u00fcnger eventually found himself an officer assigned to Wehrmacht headquarters in Paris. It was here that he maintained a diary of his war years, which was published in 1949 as Strahlungen(Radiations). Though often criticized as being a too distant, dispassionate observer, J\u00fcnger certainly understood the risks of writing \u2018honestly\u2019 in the Third Reich. Though not directly implicated, he was close to many of the officers involved in July 20th Plot against Hitler, and as a result of those ties, was summarily dismissed from the officer corps. Only a few months later, his son, while serving in a penal battalion as punishment for \u2018subversive talk\u2019 while a Kriegsmarine cadet, was killed in combat. J\u00fcnger wrote in his diary, \u201cOften I have the impression that I am writing on paper that is already browning in the licks of the flames.\u201d In spite of the risks, J\u00fcnger was also not afraid to write critically or disapprovingly of the regime or the military. Upon hearing of atrocities committed by SS units in Ukraine in 1941, J\u00fcnger writes, \u201cI was seized by disgust in front of the uniforms, the shoulder boards, the medals, the weapons whose brilliance I had once so loved.\u201d Had J\u00fcnger\u2019s diaries been discovered, particularly after his dismissal from the Officer Corps following the July 20th 1944 Plot, he most certainly would\u2019ve faced a fate far worse than a Strafbataillon(penal battalion). The fact that he was already a famous, published writer in the Third Reich(and a WWI hero to boot), would have counted little for him, and the Nazis might well have relished using him as an \u2018example\u2019 of what can happen to dissenters or critics of the regime, particularly at such a late stage in the war.
