            "answer_text": "How would you write a thank you letter to your motherinlaw or even the leader of your country. It is all the same. Think politely, include the words thank you for (this item or concept) and end it there. A thank you letter is just that, thanks. Never include anything that can be taken out of context or used against you in a verbal argument or a court of law. If you are sending the thank you letter because of requirement and obligation and not because you are truly thankful\u2026..then always think of it as the polite insult of politician speak. ",
