            "answer_text": "This part is for CBSE students/if you feel it is relevant for you too: write an answer with good content, you cannot adhere to the word limit and you must never not adhere to the word limit. Even if you pour in your heart out in the answer, it will only get marks if it has the points that are there in the answer key that the examiners have. Now, the amount of creative language and emotional writing that you can put in depends on the question. If it's a subjective or extrapolatory question that has a word limit of more than 150 words, go for it. Be it a prose or poem, think about the essential qualities that the characters possess or the poem has. Try to start your answer with a quote. Even for explaining lines from a poem, you can allude to other poems in your answer. This type of examiner will read what you've written and judging your writing skills and knowledge, will award you with good marks. But if you have the other kind of teacher who gets irritated seeing long answers, then you gotta use the other tactic. Find out the maximum marks of each question. Keep as many points in your head as the marks awarded (eg- 3 points for 3 marks). Write them but not in bullets. Make separate paragraphs if you must. Underline the key phrases. I think that's the most you could do. All the best. Ps- I have nothing but contempt and swears for the second type who usually counts the number of lines written and marks. ",
