            "answer_text": "Why not. It is a word processor. For a work of fiction, it is fine. I haven\u2019t tried adding charts and pictures and things, but I\u2019m sure it works well. You can save it to most formats. Before I used google docs, I sent stuff to my publisher that had been typed on my Mac at home and on Windows at various other places. They spent a fair amount of time going in and fixing the document up for their computers. Using google docs, there is not the same problem (or, at least, it is fairly consistent). Who knows, by the time you get it prepped for your publisher, they might ask for a specific program, but it is likely that they will go in and fiddle around with the format and everything on their own computers. It is fine. There are programs that are made to help with novel writing or film writing or playwriting. They will help with specific formatting. They might even have some tools to help with notes or organizing or showing rewrites. Still, for novel writing, all you really need is something to write on. The brand does not make a difference. Agents and publishers might want to see docs in .docx or something\u2014make sure you can save to that. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically speaking, anything you can use to get ideas onto a page is good. I, myself, have used everything from a notebook and pen to Scrivener (my preferred program). Personally, Google Docs annoys the heck out of me. For me, it always seems laggy, and compared to Microsoft Word or Scrivener, it's clunky to have to download the doc from the drive every time I want to work on it offline. Additionally, I don't trust Google as far as I can throw them. I'm of the opinion that it's only a matter of time before they start trying to censor people, and I don't trust them not to eat my documents if I mistakenly type something they don't like. In my honest opinion, the only- ONLY- good thing about Google Docs is the universality of the Cloud. I freely admit that it is terribly convenient to be able to work on a document on one device, and then switch (almost) seamlessly to another device. Convenience is a great motivator for some people. I lug my laptop around with me everywhere because I abhor typing on a phone keyboard for anything more than texting (or answering questions on Quora or Reddit), so for me, it's a moot point. My favorite program for writing is Scrivener. It has all the basic formatting options you need to make a book look good, and the compilation feature is the best and most intuitive I have ever found. No more importing Word docs into InDesign or some other clunky eBook assembly program. Scrivener does it all for you and follows your parameters in doing so. TL;DR: Like so many things, it all comes down to personal preference. For myself, I won't touch Google Docs with a 10-foot pole unless I absolutely have to do so. I recommend a laptop with Scrivener instead. ",
