            "answer_text": "There are a few answers to this question, all of them correct in some way. 1) It doesn't matter. As Renee Masur said, a writer writes. Learn the essentials, then write. Write a lot.  2) That depends on what you mean by \"becoming a writer.\" If you write, you already are one. Oh...you want to be a paid writer? Do you want to publish fiction? Poetry? Self-help books? Cookbooks? Do you want to be a copywriter? A journalist? A freelancer? All of the above? This can have a bearing on the answer.  2A) If you want to be a copywriter, study business and marketing. If you want to be a fiction writer and publish novels then pursue a career that makes a decent amount of money with the least time investment. You will be probably be living off of your \"day job\" for years before you finish a manuscript...much less sell one. It takes even longer to make enough money to quit your job. So you want the job that gives you plenty of time to write. If you're smart, you'll limit your expenses (live below your means) and save a good portion of your income. Invest it wisely and you'll be able to work even less, and write more.  3) Study general business or psychology. Or both. You can't lose with these subjects no matter what you do with your life. (Guess what I studied! Yeah. Those.) Best of luck! Rich Friend, Poor Friend Me! > Freelance Writer, Web Content and SEO Optimization ",
