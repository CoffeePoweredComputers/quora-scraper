            "answer_text": "Assuming you are discussing a statistical test of significance - the significance (rejection) level should be set before seeing the data and doing the test otherwise it casts serious doubt on the validity of the test. That\u2019s because setting the significance level after doing the test lets one adjust it to get the desired conclusion. Then the conclusion can\u2019t be trusted. E.g. if the result is p > .05 , hmm, but it\u2019s p < .10, then if one really wants to reject the null hypothesis, one can say \u201cthe null. hypothesis is rejected at the p < .10 level ",

To visualize this, there is no 100 percent one-foot rulers that roll off the assembly line with an exact length of one foot. Carver Wrightman alias Cecil R. Williams ",
