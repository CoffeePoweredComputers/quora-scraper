            "answer_text": "Writing letters is hard.  It's even harder the first time.  It's even harder still if you don't have much to write about. I'm assuming that you're writing for a science/engineering Ph.D. program where they will be primarily focused on research. You can modify accordingly if it is different.  I'm also assuming that you think highly of the applicant and know them reasonably well through research. The primary thing that programs are looking for are applicants that have demonstrated excellence in both the classroom and in research.  The latter is more valuable because there are hundreds of applicants that have excellent grades and a transcript will be the ultimate arbiter of classroom achievement.  In a Ph.D. program, you want to see students develop into independent researchers.  Showing initiative as an undergraduate  for coming up with new ideas and following them through in the course of performing research is an important sign of a budding researcher.  So think of examples in the applicant's work that can demonstrate this initiative. Also think about what are their superlative traits.  Is it clarity of thought or communication?  Is it seeing the big picture and understanding how to act up on it?   Finally, it is useful to think of some personal characteristics of the student that are positive. A simple letter then would be 4 paragraphs that take up about a single-spaced page.  Those 4 paragraphs are How you know the student and a short framing description of him or her.A brief description of the research (aim for no more than 2 sentences).  Spend the majority of the paragraph describing what contributions they made, paying particular attention to their initiative.  You could add additional paragraph if there are multiple research projects or phases of the research project.A description of the personal qualities of the applicant.  A couple of sentences  is sufficient.The concluding paragraph where you lay down the bottom line.  It is sometimes useful to know what size pool of students you have experience with: \"I've worked with 5 undergraduates closely and have known 50 well enough to evaluate them and Ms So-and-So is by the far the best I've known.\"  Conclude with a take away sentence: \"Mr This-and-That is a spectacular scientist whom I give my highest possible recommendation.\"After you write it, you should read it for unintended double-entendres, faint praise, and other unintentional slights.  You should give it someone else to read double check your proof-read letter for the same problems.  It's very easy to turn a positive letter into an absolute damning one.  Unless you hate the person don't bring up any negative aspects, simply decline to write the letter if you feel that you must bring up negative attributes.   If you're writing for a woman, make sure you do not use diminutive adjectives: \"She had a cute idea.\" or \"This little change in perception made all the difference.\" ",

            "answer_text": "As someone that has written letters of recommendation, I'm 5/5. The best letters of recommendation do something that a lot of people don't like to do. They show that you're better than others. Simple as that.  So a lot of people have this idea that a letter of recommendation should sound something like this:  XXX was a great student. She accomplished this. She also did this. She exceeded expectations.  Unfortunately, that doesn't mean anything.  What means something is that she's better, so for example, Sarah was the best at creating financial models in her entire class. In fact, many times I would group Sarah with the associates because she was so much better than the rest of the analysts.  This is the fundamental aspect of a recommendation. How is the candidate better than other people. It's not enough to be good. Everyone is good and no one knows what good means.  Many recommendation guides say be specific about the accomplishment. Jonathan completed the diligence in 5 days, even though I asked him to do it in 10 days. He's a true all star.  That's not good. That's awful. That means Jonathan did something beyond expectation. I don't hire someone that exceeds expectations. I hire someone that's better than everyone else.  What's better is saying Jonathan completed the diligence in 5 days, when it took everyone else in his class to do it 8 days. You see how Jonathan now is better than his class. Jonathan isn't just exceeding expectations, he's doing something better than his colleagues.  Mary did 100 million in sales in 5 days. Many people will say, oh wow, that's great. 100 million. Great job mary. The truth is no. What does that mean?  What's much better is Mary did 100 million in sales in 5 days, when everyone else at Mary's position couldn't do 10 million in a month. Now Mary is an all star.  The fact is and this will sound harsh, people are only good, if other people are bad. You can't be good, if someone else isn't worse than you. The idea of the best means by definition that someone is worse than you. So you have to quantify that.  That is the unmistakable truth. When you write a recommendation, you're saying that this person is better than other people.  If you're uncomfortable saying other people are worse than the person you're writing a recommendation for, you have absolutely no business writing a letter of recommendation. UPDATE:  I am now 7/7 - 2 people were just accepted into MBA programs. ",
