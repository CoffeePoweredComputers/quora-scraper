            "answer_text": "I am aware of the (albeit small) trend today of having the sole child of the two parents use the combined surnames of the parents, but those names are normally three character names, to give the appearance that the name is a single-character surname and a double-character given name. Mr Li who married Ms Chen might register the child\u2019s name as Li Chen Mei, with Li registered as the surname. Most four-character Chinese names are formed out of very ancient surnames with two characters, like \u6155\u5bb9\u3001\u6b27\u9633\u3001\u53f8\u9a6c or \u53f8\u5f92, together with a two-character given name. One of my game character in a Chinese MMO was given the name of \u6b27\u9633\u7f8e\u5973 (the given name being \u201cpretty lass\u201d in vernacular talk), just for laughs. Other four-character Chinese names are actually the transliterated forms of names of minority tribes like Uighurs or Manchu. In fact, the clan name (surname) of the last Chinese Emperor Puyi is a four-character name \u7231\u65b0\u89c9\u7f57. Some thoughts for the question asker to think through! ",

            "answer_text": "Since we\u2019re ignoring four character names with two character surnames, I presume the question is asking about potential three (or four) character surnames. The only two I can think of are the surnames of the emperors of the Qing and Yuan dynasties, \u611b\u65b0\u89ba\u7f85 (\u00c0ix\u012bnju\u00e9lu\u00f3, lit. \u201cGolden\u201d, originally the clan name of the Manchu rulers) and \u5b5b\u5152\u53ea\u65a4 (B\u00f3'\u00e9rzh\u012bj\u012bn, Borjigin, the clan name of Genghis Khan and his decedents). But those are non-Han names. I\u2019m also excluding things like Posthumous Names, which can be arbitrarily long - Cixi\u2019s was \u5b5d\u6b3d\u6148\u79a7\u7aef\u4f51\u5eb7\u9824\u662d\u8c6b\u838a\u8aa0\u58fd\u606d\u6b3d\u737b\u5d07\u7199\u914d\u5929\u8208\u8056\u986f\u7687\u540e (Xi\u00e0o q\u012bn c\u00edx\u01d0 du\u0101n y\u00f2u k\u0101ngy\u00edzh\u0101o y\u00f9 zhu\u0101ng ch\u00e9ngsh\u00f2u g\u014dng q\u012bn xi\u00e0n ch\u00f3ng x\u012b p\u00e8i ti\u0101n x\u00ecng sh\u00e8ng xi\u01cen hu\u00e1ng t\u00e0ih\u00f2u). For a Chinese name to have four characters with a single-character surname, that would mean the given name would have to be three characters. Something like, I don\u2019t know, \u9673\u5f37\u7d05\u570b. I think that\u2019s technically allowed these days, but I\u2019ve never encountered it. ",
