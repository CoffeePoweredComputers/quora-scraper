The confusion must be because you\u2019re assuming that \u2018everyone\u2019 is plural, right? Think of it like this: \u2018everyone\u2019 actually refers to \u2018every single one\u2019 present. Now, if you were to substitute my phrase, would you say \u2018every single one know?\u2019 Seems fairly obvious that it should be \u2018every single one knows,\u2019 right? This is because you are actually referring to every single person, as in \u2018every one of us.\u2019 You\u2019re actually using an indefinite pronoun, as explained above, but it might be helpful to think of it this way. The same goes for \u2018no one\u2019 or \u2018each of us\u2019 or \u2018anyone\u2019 or \u2018no one\u2019\u2026 ",
