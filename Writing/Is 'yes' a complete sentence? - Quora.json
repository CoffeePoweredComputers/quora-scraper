            "answer_text": "Yes. See how easy that was? It depends, however, on how you define a sentence. I prefer: a statement that expresses a complete thought. The reason the single word yes can express a complete thought is that it is always a response, and there is an implied subject and verb that reflect the question the yes responds to. So my yes above is simply a short form for: Yes, it is.This is a common structure in a question and response pair. The question normally includes an interrogative adverb plus a subject and verb. The response is a matching adverb, like yes, or an equivalent adjective, like sure, without the subject and verb since it supplied implicitly by the question. Really, is that all there is to it? Yes, really. ",

            "answer_text": "Not if you accept the formal definition that a sentence must contain a finite verb and a subject \u201cdoing\u201d the verb. The well known shortest sentence is \u201cHe Wept\u201d or was it \u201cJesus wept\u201d? The shortest sentence possible, two words. (Infinitives and participles are not \u201cfinite\u201d verbs.) Hence, although \u201cYes\u201d occurs frequently as a stand-alone statement, that in itself doesn\u2019t make it into a sentence. If you accept that def\u2019n\u2026 And if you don\u2019t, then you could infer that any combination of words is a sentence, But in reality many of those will be phrases rather than sentences. ",
