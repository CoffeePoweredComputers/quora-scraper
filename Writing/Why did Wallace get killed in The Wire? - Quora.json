            "answer_text": "Wallace was visibly shaken up by the way Brandon, a stick-up artist who robbed them along with Omar, was killed and laid out on display for the entire Pit to see. Brandon was obviously tortured by Wee-Bey, Bird, and Stinkum. It weighed even more heavily on Wallace since he was the one that alerted the Barksdale's top muscle to Brandon's location. The reality of what happened was too much for him to handle. Wallace then told D'Angelo he wanted out of the \"game\" by saying \"I don't won't to play\" anymore. D gave him money and then allowed him to leave and encouraged him to get a better education because he truly had potential. McNulty, Freamon, and the rest of the detail heard Poot telling a girl how messed up Wallace has been ever since that stick-up boy was killed over the wiretap. They decided to get to Wallace in the hopes that he knew about Brandon's murder and would decide to inform on his murderers. Wallace agreed and it was decided that he spend time at his grandmother's house well outside of Baltimore until it was time for him to return so he could testify. Kima Greggs got shot in an undercover sting gone wrong and the cops had made significant progress in the Barksdale investigation while he was gone. The police getting closer and closer to making a significant bust combined with Greggs being shot put Avon and Stringer on red alert. Avon and Stringer consulted with their lawyer, Maurice Levy, about how to lessen their exposure. They essentially made a hit list of anyone that could hurt them. This hit list included Wallace since he was visibly shaken up by Brandon's murder and had recently disappeared. Wallace's recent behavior and actions made him look highly suspect to Avon and Stringer and it gave them good reasons to believe he's either a snitch or a snitch in the making. They decided to eliminate him to keep him from informing on them. Wallace making the grave mistake of returning to work for D, which was on the wire but missed, spelled his doom. In addition, though unbeknownst to them, Wallace's death is the reason Stringer was able to walk free at the end of season 1. Wallace's testimony of seeing Stringer in the truck the night Brandon was murdered was the only significant thing that could be used against Stringer. Without him, there was nothing they could do to get Stringer off the streets. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Why did Wallace get killed in The Wire? The other answers here detail how Wallace was killed\u2026but not WHY. Wallace was safe from the streets and had he remained at his grandmother\u2019s house and not made phone calls back to Baltimore, he likely would have survived. However, he grew homesick and he wasn\u2019t very mature, so he foolishly decided to return to the neighborhood, assuming that he could simply go back to the way that things were. Wallace then compounded his error by hanging around the area of \u201cThe Pit\u201d in the lowrises. Even if he had returned to Baltimore and had decided not to testify, he had know or suspect that his disappearance would be viewed negatively by the crew that he worked for, especially when he didn\u2019t explain how he had left the city. His final mistake was assuming that he could trust Bodie and Poor when he had to know that they were having trouble trusting him. He paid for this with his life. Wallace was killed because he was immature and not very bright. He didn\u2019t listen to what the police told him, he didn\u2019t remain in the relatively safety of his grandmother\u2019s home, he went back to a place where had to know it was unwise to be and he continued to trust friends who clearly demonstrated that they no longer trusted him. When Wallace tells Poor that he wanted out of the drug trade because \u201cI don\u2019t want to play anymore.\u201d indicated clearly that he wasn\u2019t capable of being in that trade and that eventually he would have been arrested or killed. The latter came true. ",
