            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not gonna try and tell you your business. You may have a good reason for what you\u2019re contemplating. I\u2019ll only say one thing about that; Your reason(s) probably aren\u2019t as good as you think they are. Moving on, if you want to write a suicide note so that the people it\u2019s meant for don\u2019t think you\u2019re mad at them, then write the note first, send it as text to whoever you want to communicate with, and let them tell you what they think. If, after hearing from all those folks, if you still want to go through with it, you have that option. I bet that if you\u2019re honest and really talk to the people you want to, you\u2019ll find out they\u2019d rather have you around, warts and all. If you really want to make someone feel loved, then at least stay alive long enough to get a life insurance policy, and name them as the beneficiary. Then make it look like an accident. A couple hundred grand split up between your friends is a good way to let them know you were still cool with them. That might take a couple of months to pull off, but honestly, what have you got to lose? Stick around a little longer and do your friends a solid from the void in a couple of months. Or maybe you change your mind. Either way, it\u2019s hard to lose on that deal. TL;DR Please don\u2019t kill yourself, but if you really must, at least get some little bit of good out of it for the people you love. ",
