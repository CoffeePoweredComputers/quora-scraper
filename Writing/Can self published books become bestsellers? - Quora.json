            "answer_text": "Yes. I\u2019ve done it twice. It\u2019s not simple, mind you. But it\u2019s definitely possible. The USA Today bestseller list is the easiest big list to hit. It requires somewhere between 6000 and 10,000 sales in a single week. You also need at least 500 of those sales to be somewhere other than Amazon, as they don\u2019t list Amazon-only books. That\u2019s the list my indie (self-published) books have hit twice. The NYT list is much harder. First, because you need to sell more books to hit that list (usually at LEAST 10k sales in one week), and second because the NYT curates their list and eliminates any \u2018unworthy\u2019 books. Generally, \u2018unworthy\u2019 to them means \u201cpublished by someone who isn\u2019t paying the NYT for advertising\u201d. ;) It\u2019s still possible for indies to hit this list, and some indie writers do every year, but it\u2019s difficult. Of course, other types of \u2018bestseller\u2019 can be hit all the time. Anyone who wants to make the WSJ list can buy their way into it for about $10,000 most of the year. Would be guru-style speakers do this all the time, writing a book and then giving away thousands of copies of it to make the WSJ list, which then opens doors for paid speaking gigs. And I\u2019ve had dozens of books make various Amazon \u2018bestseller\u2019 lists. Getting an Amazon orange bestseller tag isn\u2019t that difficult at all. ",

            "answer_text": "No and it never will. People can\u2019t buy books when they don\u2019t even know about those books\u2019 existance. That\u2019s the reason why the ultimate challange for becoming a bestseller is DEFEATING the COMPETITION\u2019S MARKETING. Now the problem in achieving this - for a selfpublished author - come from those factors: 1) big publishing companies are MANY. 2) they have budgets at disposal you can\u2019t even imagine. 3) they have a level of experience in literary marketing you can\u2019t even imagine. 4) they are at war with each other since the dawn of times, and that pushed their marketing expertise to the estreme. Compared to them, you are like a 14 years old, cannon fodder, military cook infantry soldier trying to with against a whole nation\u2019s aviation, navy and tanks on your own. Are you ready to enter a ruthless war going on since the dawn of times, fought by thousands of people with more experience and means at disposal than you will ever have? Are you still sure you can win by \u2018just writing something awsome\u2019? I don\u2019t think so. ",

            "answer_text": "I you mean New York Times bestseller or one of those, very unlikely. If you mean Amazon or Apple, very likely. The problem is, eBooks dont get given an ISBN. NYT and such collate sales based on ISBN reported sales. So if an eBook doesn\u2019t have a best selling paperback version, thus providing an ISBN number, it will never be considered for NYT best seller because Amazon do not release sales information. But on Amazon, yes its possible. Any book in the top 150 of the paid store will also be #1 in most of it\u2019s categories. And the sales necessary to get to this state are in the ballpark of what NYT requires to be #1 on it\u2019s list. So in order to do both Amazon and NYT, you need to be releasing eBook and paperback at the same time, AND sell a huge number of them in the first week. ",

There are lottery winners too, that doesn\u2019t inform you on whether you will win the lottery. If you want to know if YOUR book will be successful, you need the judgement of someone who can read your book and give you advice. You also need to learn how to do marketing so you can connect your target audience with your book. Because all of the successes in self-publishing are also successes in marketing. ",

Weir took their advice and ended up with a superb story that was picked up by Random House and later became, as they say, a major motion picture. We should all be so lucky.
