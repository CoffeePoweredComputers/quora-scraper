            "answer_text": "The publisher. For self-publishing, that\u2019s the author. For vanity publishing (where the author pays the publisher \u2014 please don\u2019t do this), it\u2019s mostly the author, but the publisher may refuse a book that\u2019s defamatory, libelous, plagiarized, or just so awful they don\u2019t want their name on it. Ordinarily, though, they\u2019ll take just about anything so long as they\u2019re paid. Some lie and claim to be selective in what they\u2019ll accept; others are up front about it. For traditional publishing, the person at the publishing company who reads submissions and chooses what should be published is called an acquiring editor. Some acquiring editors are given free rein to buy and publish anything they want; others submit their choices to a publishing committee, where the marketing or legal departments may overrule them and refuse to publish a book the editor wanted. At small presses, the acquiring editor and the publisher are often the same person. Whatever the situation, the final say goes to the publisher, whether that\u2019s an individual or a corporation \u2014 which is why he, she, or it is called \u201cthe publisher\u201d. ",
