            "answer_text": "The first person pronouns haven\u2019t changed much since Middle English. Chaucer, writing in the late 1300\u2019s, uses \u2018I\u2019, and \u2018me\u2019. Earlier, in Norman times, the first person nominative was sometimes written \u2018ic\u2019 which was the Old English form. One archaism which you\u2019ll occasionally encounter in literature of early modern English is \u201cmine\u201d as possessive adjective, when preceding a word beginning with a vowel, e.g., \u201ccome to mine arms.\u201d In his day, Chaucer used \u201cmy\u201d when the following word began with a consonant, but \u2018myn\u2019 when the following word began with a vowel or \u2018h\u2019, e.g., \u201cin myn hand.\u201d ",
