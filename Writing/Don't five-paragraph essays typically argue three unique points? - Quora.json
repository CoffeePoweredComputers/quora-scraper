The absolute classic standardized no-imagination no-freedom version of the 5-graf essay is Introduction: some reason for the reader to be interested, ending in thesis statement Body 1: Although some people say \u2026. summary of evidence AGAINST the thesis Body 2: In fact, Actually, In the real world, etc. \u2026. why the evidence against the thesis is fallacious, untrue, irrelevant, or trivial, leading into what the real evidence is Body 3: Why the important evidence shows that the thesis is right Conclusion: Therefore \u2026 thesis restatement \u2026 and why that matters, often referring to the reason for interest in the introduction. I didn\u2019t enjoy teaching it and student writing it produced was generally dull, but it did seem to improve student writing. Kind of like doing dull calisthenics so that you can play an interesting sport. ",

The word \u201cunique\u201d isn\u2019t quite appropriate since the three body paragraphs all develop separate points that, in themselves, support the thesis or controlling idea that you set out in your opening paragraph.
