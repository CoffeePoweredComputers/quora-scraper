            "answer_text": "One of the best strategies taught to students around the world is using a mind map to brainstorm different ideas. Start simply capturing your ready thoughts, e.g. Uncle Arthur's blue van. From this broad topic, you can be generating all the connected themes, concepts, and ideas. Continue to develop it, and over time your mind will start making sense of the concept on the paper (or screen). If you're tired, just continue to throw nonsensical things that come to your mind on the paper. This is a process of streamlining your cognition. Once your mind is focused, as it threw out the garbage, it will take you to make deeper sense of what you have put out. I'm sure doing it twice or more will help you get better ideas for your essay.
