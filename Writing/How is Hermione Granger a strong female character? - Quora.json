            "answer_text": "She is a strongly-written character and she\u2019s female. In a rational world, that should be enough. I frankly would prefer if that phrase wasn\u2019t often synonymous with \u201cbitchy and condescending to male characters while always being depicted as right for being so\u201d, something Hermione is at times guilty of, but at least it\u2019s more she\u2019s a teenage girl and teenage girls can be bitchy just like teenage boys can be dim, and she grows out of it. Unlike a lot of \u201cstrong females\u201d who ARE just bitchy and condescending, there\u2019s never any doubt that Hermione is smart, devoted to her friends, and has her own doubts, insecurities, and flaws that aren\u2019t just tacked on to give the authors something to point to (ie \u201cBut she THINKS she\u2019s plain!\u201d while it\u2019s clear in text the character isn\u2019t.) Hermione\u2019s strong points are relevant to the plot and make sense for her character, and her flaws are also important and they aren\u2019t (in the books, at least) blissfully excused because she\u2019s a Strong Female Character. They\u2019re genuine FLAWS. She rises above them or learns to moderate them, while still being smart and supportive of her friends and helping with the main plot. A strongly written character does that. ",
