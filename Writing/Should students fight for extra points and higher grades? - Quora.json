            "answer_text": "My experience with TAs and professors and as a grader of papers myself is that mark grubbing (which is what I call this) is an easy way to win the battle and lose the war.  If you occasionally have legit issue, that is one thing.  But there were certain people who would crawl into the office and start haggling over a few marks relentlessly.  The path of least resistance might then be to agree.  But as the ancient Britons used to say \"you don't get rid of the Dane by paying the Danegild\": graders learn that grubbers invariably come back over some other perceived injustice if they win once.   So mostly it meant the grubbers would thereafter lose any benefit of the doubt in the many cases where grading involves judgement.  This did not stop grubbers from trying to find (and finding a few) soft touches, but mostly they get what they deserve:  rough justice. This behaviour was most commonly resisted by: \"I do not regrade piecemeal, but will happily regrade the entire document.\"  Such a regrade would almost invariably result in a lower grade.  Touch\u00e9. ",
