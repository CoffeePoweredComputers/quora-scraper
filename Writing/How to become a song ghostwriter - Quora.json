            "answer_text": "I am very ignorant about the music industry, because of that I can only give you a limited answer. I know that it is possible for some people to get paid to write songs. I don\u2019t even know whether or not song writing is something that gets \u2018ghostwritten\u2019 but I am aware that sometimes a musician or band does a song and then people find out that \u201ca songwriter wrote that one\u201d rather than the members of that band. I think it might be possible to ghostwrite a song at websites such as http://Guru.com where the work is real. The pay is often painfully low, but the work is usually real and legitimate, although there are some fakes there at times. Here is a link that gets you going in the right direction: 5 Tips for Songwriting Success in Today\u2019s Music Industry Due to my own ignorance, I can\u2019t help you better than that. ",
