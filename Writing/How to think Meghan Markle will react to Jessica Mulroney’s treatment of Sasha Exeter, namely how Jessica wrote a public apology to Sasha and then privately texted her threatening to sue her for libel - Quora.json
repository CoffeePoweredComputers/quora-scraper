            "answer_text": "How do I think this will play out between Meghan Markle and her best friend, Jessica Mulroney? After Mulroney frightened and threatened to sue Sasha Exeter for liable, and then Exeter came forward with her fears, publicly, as is right and proper? And Jessica has lost a sponsor already in addition to her television show, and will probably lose more sponsors and Instagram followers.  I think Meghan has enough problems of her own, with lawsuits, Disney choosing to work with Beyonc\u00e9 for $100 million, and the Obamas leading a Black Lives Matter symposium that included Taylor Swift and not Meghan Markle? Privately, I think Meghan needs her friends right now. She and Harry have not had any projects that have brought in some much needed money, so publicly Meghan needs to distance herself for a while from Jessica.  Jessica certainly knows a lot about Meghan Markle. They have been best friends for quite a few years and met when Meghan moved to Toronto to film her series. I hope Meghan doesn\u2019t ghost Jessica, because friends are supposed to be there even in the bad times. So I see it looking publicly like Meghan isn\u2019t fiends with her best friend, but in reality they will still talk and text. This is the one woman Meghan trusted to watch Archie while she traveled to the UK and also the US on business, back when Meghan, Harry and Archie all lived in Canada. Meghan left Archie with Jessica Mulroney. I can see it looking like Meghan isn\u2019t friends with her, but eventually this will pass, and hopefully the two women will have been seen to have remained tight. But, for Meghan\u2019s image she probably needs to distance herself from Mulroney. Jessica wrote some awful things. Her actions were terrible.  Meghan can\u2019t drown. She needs to look to people who can help her, and right now Jessica, as much as they like one another, cannot do that for Meghan. I hope Meghan does find work. I hope she embraces her identity as a biracial woman, and she finds work as one also. Meghan finds herself trying to generate income in a new world where a pandemic still is a very real threat, the Black Lives Matter movement is gaining momentum such as it has never seen, and it\u2019s a confusing landscape. So much has changed since Meghan left Suits. Being a biracial actress can be a very cool thing. We have a long way to go until black women have a strong voice with good roles as actresses in Hollywood. I look forward to that day. Could Meghan go to NYC and act in a play? I don\u2019t think so, but I personally don\u2019t think she\u2019s a great actress. She is okay. Add dancing and singing to that and suddenly NYC is a possibility for her.  Meghan is drowning in all her money woes. She can\u2019t carry the weight of a floundering Jessica Mulroney too. I believe they will remain friends, just not publicly right now. It has to be a quiet friendship, and when the time is right, and Jessica rises from the ashes, Meghan will be seen publicly with her again. Until then? I think Meghan will make it look like they aren\u2019t super close anymore. It\u2019s a tough world out there. People come back from making mistakes. But in the world of celebrities, one has to make themselves look good to the world, and now? Black Lives Matter is very important to the world. Meghan is trying to stay relevant in a constantly changing environment. And she needs to earn money soon. ",

            "answer_text": "This is certainly an interesting situation. The court of public opinion, and Jessica\u2019s employers have already spoken out, condemning her of racist comments, which Jessica tried to deflect by the old \u201cmy best friend is a black woman\u201d hew and cry. So, it does appear that Meghan has been called upon by a desperate Jessica to defend her. But will she? Personally, I don\u2019t see how she can without being called a hypocrite.  What horrible timing, too. Right after Meghan has made public in Essence magazine her video to the Immaculate Heart graduating class with a definite \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d message. So, I don\u2019t see her defending Jessica publicly at all. The bigger question is will their private relationship survive this, or will Meghan drop that friendship like a hot potato, which it is right now. Meghan has a reputation for dropping family, but I haven\u2019t heard about her treating friends in a similar fashion. It would be cruel, if she did. This is her friend whose children were in her wedding. Whom she entrusted Archie with when she did the farewell tour in the UK. When she and Harry went to the JP Morgan event. It seems that Jessica has always been her go-to person when she needs something. I think it\u2019s sad that Meghan probably won\u2019t be able to return the favor in this instance. But it wouldn\u2019t be the first time she put her public image and career ahead of others\u2019 needs and feelings. I don\u2019t believe that Harry is happy with his current circumstances - no close friends or family near him to lean on. And I feel certain he is missing that, trying to adjust to a strange town in a strange country, especially with coronavirus, protests and riots consuming the attention of the public. It can\u2019t be easy. Canada had to be far more soothing. So, sadly, I think that Meghan will distance herself from Jessica even as far as their personal relationship goes- at least for the time being. Will their friendship survive in the long run? That\u2019s the million dollar question. ",
