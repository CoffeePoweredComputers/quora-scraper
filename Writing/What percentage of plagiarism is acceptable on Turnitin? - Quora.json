            "answer_text": "By how much is acceptable do you mean how much can you get away with? If you copy from 1 source in classic mode the copied material shows up highlighted in one color. If you copy from two sources the copied material shows up in two colors. If you copy from more than two sources the answer shows up looking like a rainbow. It is very obvious. Original work is very easy to spot, 0\u201310% highlighted in any color in the answer sections and that just because the questions have certain key words that need to be discussed. Anything more than that and the instructor on record would be backed up by administration if they decided to pursue a consequence. Especially as the source material is right there to compare it to. It is amazing how many different ways there are to say the exact same thing in the English language. I have never even heard of a dean in grade school or college backing down from a student or parent when an instructor decided to go through with a consequence for copied and pasted work. It is improbable for people to say something the exact same way. Some common sense is used to decide how to interpret a highlighted text flagged by AI for copying though. For example, if the question is, \u201cWhat is the law of conservation of energy?\u201d and 100 students say, \u201cenergy is neither created nor destroyed\u201d that is one thing. But that would be one question out of many and I wouldn\u2019t expect any other answers on that assignment to have an identical answer anywhere else in the assignment. If another answer was also highlighted on a submission, and now more than one answer is highlighted that could easily be considered cheating, even if it is below the 10% mark I think. Instructors use common sense to interpret the AI flags. A student that is not copying and pasting does not have to worry about being flagged by accident and then getting a consequence for cheating because the percent was too high. That never happens. But if you are copying and pasting even a little your instructor always sees it on TurnItIn. Even if the percent is less than ten percent. The program makes it really obvious. ",

            "answer_text": "Turnitin does not determine what is an acceptable similarity percentage, but rather, only reports what it finds. It is up to the institution to which the paper is being submitted to make this determination. Often, institutions publish the acceptable percentages. If so, it is up to each student to ensure that the paper meets that criteria before submitting. Regardless of percentage; however, plagiarism can occur even at zero percent similarity. For instance, a well-paraphrased paper may not reflect any similarity for Turnitin reporting; however, may also be fully plagiarized. The key is to ensure that all sources are properly documented and cited, where used. In conclusion, meeting the institution\u2019s criteria for similarity percentage is important; however, not plagiarizing is imperative - regardless of percentage.
