            "answer_text": "The verb \u201cto succeed\u201d \u2014 in the sense of accomplishing something \u2014 is intransitive, meaning that it does not take a direct object. Your original sentence, He succeeded a third attempt. attempts to make \u201ca third attempt\u201d a direct object of the verb. This is nonsensical. To correct it, insert a preposition (\u201con\u201d or \u201cwith\u201d would work): He succeeded on a third attempt. This makes \u201con a third attempt\u201d a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb \u201csucceeded.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "What is wrong with the sentence \"He succeeded a third attempt.\"? How should I correct it? In that sentence, succeeded is intransitive: it does not take a direct object, so \u2018\u2026a third attempt\u2019 is an indirect object, which requires a preposition. Correct alternatives are: \u2018He succeeded at a third attempt.\u2019 \u2018He succeeded on his third attempt.\u2019 ",
