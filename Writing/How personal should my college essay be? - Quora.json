            "answer_text": " When writing a college essay, prompts will tell you what to write. Often, the essay prompt tells the students to indicate why they want to join the college. Sometimes, colleges prefer to include non-conventional essay prompts to test the student\u2019s creativity. A college essay about your desire to get admitted should document your life experiences. However, there is a limit to how personal your college essay can be. What should I include in my college essay? Despite the need to tell your life story, you should try not to \u2018overshare\u2019 with the admission board. Talk about mutual benefits Indicate what you can offer the college in exchange for the opportunity to acquire your degree with them. It is essential to discuss all the research opportunities you wish to explore and why the institution is the best fit for you. Discuss your academic achievements If you have participated in any national or regional competitions in high school, you should include them in your essay. Participating in STEM competitions and Olympiads will bear testament to your academic prowess. Mention your life challenges Your prospects at admission will increase if you mention hurdles you had to overcome in your personal life. For students from low-income households, writing about your challenges to make ends meet will help your chances of gaining admission. Don\u2019t overshare Always remember that the admissions committee members are not your buddies. You don\u2019t have to share any stories regarding your political views or sexual experiences. Authenticity is everything, but there are no benefits to keeping it too real. Adjust the tone of your paper Your college essay can be successful if you use a semi-formal tone. Proofread the final copy and get rid of any phrases that might suggest familiarity with the board. You can get personal in your college essay, but you should filter the information you share with the committee. ",

            "answer_text": "As personal as it can get without destroying the sanctity of the question/topic. Personal experiences provide admission committees a glimpse into your journey so far and evaluate whether your decisions are coherent with your aims and goals. It also is a good way to relate to the challenges different candidates face in their journey. However it should be ensured that the objectivity of the question or the topic is not lot in unnecessary details and the examiner does not have to go through an endless stream of life events.  What personalization also does is that it gives an element of uniqueness to the essay given that most essays will involve familiar themes around educational background and future ambitions.

In case, you\u2019re not really hurt because of these hard times, then you could write about it for showing a strength of character, but don\u2019t make it too much. As in every essay, try to show yourself in the good light, but still - don\u2019t make it too much, because you should not be arrogant. ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest, the college admissions people don't really care. There are the occasional essays that move them in one way or another, but that is generally because of the quality of the writing, not the content. You could write very artfully about something completely mundane and have a gamechanging essay, or you could take a very personal experience and have mediocre writing. It really doesn't matter what you write about. They want to see how you think and react to situations in your life. ",

I would avoid stories where you come off only as a victim.  You're looking for respect, not pity, from the reviewer.  If there are topics that are too emotional for you to write about, I would avoid those and pick something less stressful.  You primarily want the essay to be well-structured and well-written, so I recommend getting a draft together and having one or more people read it and give feedback. ",

How have others affected you? So, talking about overcoming adversity can be a good topic for an essay. Just be careful to avoid topics that are inherently controversial, where the reader might react more to your position on the topic than your writing. Writing about politics or religion, for example, is always risky. ",
