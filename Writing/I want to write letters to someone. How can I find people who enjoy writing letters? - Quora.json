            "answer_text": "I know how you feel. I used to be a prolific letter writer during the pre-computer and internet days. But I was forced to move with the times. While I still love writing, those I used to write to have  no patience with this outdated method of communication. Just recently,  for the heck of it, and just for variety,  I  wrote a letter  on a blank sheet of paper using a fountain pen. It was a pleasure. My handwriting still looked good. But the thought of hunting for an envelope, finding the right value of the postage stamp to be used ( I have no idea of the postal rates today. I remember a post card used to cost  5 paise, an inland letter, 10 paise, and an envelope 25p) and writing the full postal address and going in search of a post box and then waiting for several days to get a reply and not even being sure the letter will reach or be replied to, made me give up the idea. So I scanned it and emailed it! Later, when I first bought an Ipad, I happened to come across a rather  cute app.It was called \"Use your Handwriting\". You can use the lower half the screen area as a slate, and use your fingertip to write on it (using cursive writing) and the app  shrinks it to normal size and your handwriting is retained exactly as it is. It does NOT convert your hand written words into typed text. Your hand writing is preserved. You can scribble, doodle, or write in any script. You then email it directly from your Ipad. The person you send it to,  receives it as an email with your hand written letter appearing in your own handwriting,  as a clearly readable jpg image and \"zoomable\" if the handwriting appears too closely spaced. This app was available on the App Store for $1. I toyed around with it, for sometime,  impressed a few friends and, as usually happens, the novelty wore off after some time and it was back to typing on my laptop as usual. Today, my old friends don't even have time for reading my emails! They open their mail boxes once or twice a week and reply to my long replies with \"Nice\" 'Thanks\" 'Received, all well.\", \"Regards\"  etc. When they need to communicate, they just pick up the phone and talk.  If I knew you personally, I would have offered myself as a potential recipient but I am sure I am not suitable. My age (66) probably disqualifies me. I have no idea what your nationality is. I am an Indian. You are better off corresponding with someone in your own age group and with whom you share your interests. I wish you luck in finding someone to send your letters to.GV ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Questioner, How was your day? I'm so glad that you raised a question that hooked me. I didn't know what to say? I went home and saw old letters that my cousins wrote to me and my siblings. It felt so good reading that. The handwritten letters are a delight to read. I think that last time I wrote a handwritten letter in 2006. It was a letter to my cousin (sister) who got terribly ill and lost a year. Phone calls were so expensive and I still remember that I wrote something from my heart with the limited experience and knowledge I had. She was so touched. I don't know why I'm writing this but, like you, I also love to write letters. I thought you would be glad to receive a letter and hence I am writing to you. I am sure you won't mind the irrelevant content in my letter. May be you can write to me in the comments.  I just want to tell that when we truly love something then we find a way to do it. Isn't it? I write letters to people but in my journal. It's so much fun and entertaining. You can also try it. Also, you can make some pen friends on Quora who might like to write letters to you and receive it from you. Cheers,Rohan PS- I write formal business letters on a regular interval. But, we're not talking of them... right! I just clarified to prevent my colleagues from point it out :P ",
