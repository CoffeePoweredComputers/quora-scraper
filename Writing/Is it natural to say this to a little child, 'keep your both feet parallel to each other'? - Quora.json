Keep it simple: \u201cKeep your feet together!\u201d Show them how to do it, or show them a picture. You could teach the word \u201cfeet\u201d, and the two words \u201ctogether\u201d and \u201capart\u201d. Then you could have a little game where you say \u201cfeet apart!\u201d Or \u201cfeet together!\u201d And they do it. Two teams, whoever does the correct action first gets a point. Then you do it, and they say \u201cfeet together \u201c or \u201cfeet apart\u201d (hearing and identifying is easier than producing the words, so you should order activities like this). This could be a game with the same rules as above. ",

In my opinion, it\u2019s perfectly natural and a good way for a child to learn math and to lie still at the same time. Some kids can be super fidgety so it\u2019s hard for them to sleep quickly. ",
