We are constantly searching after happiness, but we often fail in our pursuit. We may get a glimpse of happiness, but it does not last forever. We do not want miseries, but we cannot avoid them. Scriptures inform us that we are spiritual beings, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, and by nature, we are full of happiness \u2013 \u0101nandamayo \u2018bhy\u0101s\u0101t (ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra).
