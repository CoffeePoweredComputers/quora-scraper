            "answer_text": "In general population the race that your claiming asks for your paperwork. It's a sheet of paper that lists what charges your incarcerated for. That stands true for the older prisons(San Quentin) like Smoke said. In the new prisons however, If you ask for paperwork you can be brought up on Terrorist threat charges if the inmate wants to press charges and reports it to the C.O.'s. I think it's a way of making it easier on the prison system as a whole where crime/race segregation for inmates will eventually be wiped out. When I was getting paroled at Corcoran they were just starting to do mixed race bunk beds which is pretty much un heard of in California Prisons. Good luck and hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not open information, you find out by the inmate telling each other. Guards have access to inmates files and sometimes spread the reason around the camp. Anytime I was in an altercation with an inmate I\u2019d look up that persons charges and disciplines he has receive while locked up. And somethings inmates knew the person on the outside and tell others way they got arrested. ",
