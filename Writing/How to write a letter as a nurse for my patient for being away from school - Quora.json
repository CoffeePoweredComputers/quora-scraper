            "answer_text": "Be sure you talk to your patient about how much information s/he wants released. Review HIPAA guidelines before you write anything. They\u2019re pretty stringent. Don\u2019t offer what the illness was, or even that s/he was in the hospital unless the patient OK\u2019s it\u2014you must have some kind of form for release of information if you\u2019re working at a hospital. I have found that very few education professionals have the slightest idea of what medical and psych diagnoses mean. Furthermore, they\u2019re not as aware of HIPAA breaches as nurses are, and have a pretty gossipy culture. My daughter\u2019s MS guidance counselor, for instance, did not know what OCD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder was. Not a clue. I\u2019d limit it to: Name of person who gets it, who by rights should be a nurse aware of HIPAA, who can then pass on limited information as needed. Zena W. was under medical care from the period 7/7/07 - 9/9/07. Should you have further questions or want additional confirmation, you may call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Sincerely, ",
