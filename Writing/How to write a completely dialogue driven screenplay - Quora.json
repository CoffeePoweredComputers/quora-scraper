            "answer_text": "You think about the motivations of your character.  Think what motivates your character to say something. When your character feels a certain way why he feels that way? What are his emotions?  These may not have to be expressed but knowing it helps to write about them properly.  How do these emotions motivate him to say or do something? If he feels angry does he say it directly or does he hide it or mask it by showing a happy or a more pleasant face?  This creates personality of the character.How does the other character react to the first character based on its own personality and emotions?  Emotions are the most vital part of a character.  Emotions are expressed in the form of Dialogues.  When these expressions are made in a non staight-forward manner, it makes the character more interesting and intriguing.  How the other character reacts and expresses with its own emotions makes a story. So think why your characters say something when they say. You can then take it further from there and add the necessary intrigue to your story.",
