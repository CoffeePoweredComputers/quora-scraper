However, I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people are doers without using common sense in the process. I mean they ought to think before they re-act to situations so they can clearly make the best choice in whatever challenges they may be confronted. That\u2019s why thinking thinks out plus the consequences can mean good decisions made. ",
