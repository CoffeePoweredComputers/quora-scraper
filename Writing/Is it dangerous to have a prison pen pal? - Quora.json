            "answer_text": "I am answering as someone who taught in prison for a few years at both men and women's max security. Here are a few of the situations I am aware of regarding pen pals. A convict who'd been in and out of prison for 18 of his 33 years once told me that people on the outside are either looking for love or money. Finding out what motivates them is how inmates control their new friends for their benefit. \u2014 He also noted that his best contacts are overweight women with lower self-esteem because many crave the attention.An inmate in for molestation became engaged to a woman with 3 kids while serving his sentence. She planned to move him in when he was released in 6 months. They'd been corresponding for 2+ years. I asked how often they'd visited in person. Once. He'd been in prison twice, once for incest and this time for numerous counts of molestation.A woman (who I actually knew on the outside of prison) was sentenced to life for killing her husband. She also had an affair with her stepson and became pregnant by her attorney during her trial. She was quite attractive, very barbie doll in her appearance. \u2014 While she was located at the max prison where I taught I became aware that she was running a scam in which she'd tell numerous pen pals that her breast implants were leaking. Photos of her chest were sent, of course, as added visual stimulation. She'd collected thousands of dollars from people in their effort to help.Perhaps you believe you are going to find the 1 inmate who's truly good at heart. Well, please also remember that heart is just one aspect of one's personality. \u2026the mind is powerful. Emotions can be faked. Mental illness can be difficult for a layman to recognize through simple correspondence. Impulse control issues aren't as likely to be recognized when someone is locked in a highly regulated environment. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. There is a reason these individuals are in prison. I managed 2 living units in a State prison for many years, so yes I have seen it all pretty much. But I must say every now and again an inmate would surprise me. I worked in a male prison. My experience was pretty much a positive experience. Prisons are filled with all kinds of people from all races and different walks of life. I'm sure you all have heard the horror stories and yes they are true but let me just talk about the people inside of the prison. You have inmates and staff. Inmates are people. We are there to protect the public from the inmates, the staff from the inmates, the inmates from the inmates and the inmates from themselves. We are there to not impose or render more punishment upon the inmates but rather to assist the sentence the state has given them. We are there to ensure everyone is safe, to not infringed upon the inmates civil rights but rather protect their civil rights as they do still have them. Yes there have been some staff that dont behave this way but the question is about the inmates. Inmates are human beings with many problems and illnesses. Whether it is mental illness or drug addiction or poverty or environment they lack an inability to conform to society's rules. There is a small number of inmates that will never go back but the fact is the large majority will go back. They suffer from narcissism. Some are psychopaths. Some are sociopaths. Whatever category you want to put them in. Most are not healthy. The one thing that stood out to me the most is that they all shared the criminal addictive thinking. It's actually scary. They have also the same traits we have. Some are super funny. They are kind. They are smart. Some might even say some are attractive. But their criminal addictive thinking behavior sets them way apart from normal society. Its spontaneous. Violent. Narassist. Malicious. Criminal. Self serving. Controlling. Etc. They dont follow the same rules as we do. They actually dont follow any rules if it interferes with what they want. They dont have the ability to think through consequences or control their behavior and thoughts. It's like it's the only thing that drives them to stay alive and without it they would die. When you spend as much time as I did with them you become very aware of spotting these differences. I can literally pick out anyone in a crowd who has a felony and has been in prison. You become aware of the differences in the way they look, walk, talk and think. Everything is a con to them. They know they are different that's why they go to such great lengths to evade people. Honestly I think its genetic. Who else would torture themselves like that over and over again totally destroying any chance at having a life. They suffer from extreme insecurity as well. Always trying to be better than everyone at the same time blaming the world for the position they are in. Please be careful. Yes they are people but most are just looking for their next victim to drag through with them in hell. ",
