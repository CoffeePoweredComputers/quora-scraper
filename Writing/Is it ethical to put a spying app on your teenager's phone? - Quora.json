            "answer_text": "It\u2019s your job as a parent to keep them safe, but it\u2019s also your job to help them become well-developed adults, and the teenage years are a crucial part for them to be differentiating themselves for others, finding who they, and being autonomous (even to the point of you thinking they are \u201cdifficult and rebellious\u201d\u2026I was indeed that difficult and rebellious guy, and I\u2019ve found happiness, which is all a parent should want for their children). Instead of \u201cspying on them\u201d, I\u2019d suggest becoming approachable, and having true conversations with them about the important things or how they are doing with their life (not \u201carguments\u201d or \u201cbeing controlling\u201d), treating them with respect, as another human being, not just your kid. Everybody likes to be asked \u201chow are you doing? Is there anything I can do to help your life be filled with happiness?\u201d, at least once in a while. And last thought: allow them to make mistakes. It\u2019s important that they are allowed the respect to make some of their own decisions, and to have you there for support, advice, and love (especially when they \u201cscrew up\u201d). The choices they make as teenagers have life-long effects, but I should know, the choices I made in high school led me to suffer from substance abuse, anxiety, and depression, but the truth is, I love where I am at in life, I don\u2019t regret my choices, cause they made me who I am, and if I had to do it over, I\u2019d do it the same darn way, because \u201cI\u201d made those choices, nobody else made them for me, and they brought me through all my amazing experiences to where I am in life. Much Love, Peter Benson. ",

            "answer_text": "How old is the teenager? In some areas 18 years old is an adult and has the same rights as an adult.As an adult caregiver you have responsibilities for children under your care. Yes it is ethical, but do not be careless. If you are caught they may no longer trust you. Many believe that many children believe there is a \u201cwar\u201d between adults who \u201cknow nothing\u201d and children who \u201cknow it all\u201d.I would have \u201cmonitoring\u201d ( the better term) applications on EVERYTHING YOUR child has that connects to a network including smartphones, video game consoles, and \u201cschool\u201d laptop computers. It is YOUR household and it is YOUR responsibility. I found that young ladies are meany times less responsible than you may think. Also young gamers are especially adept at discovering ways to thwart your monitoring ( they know what you are thinking about- their friends tell them about their experiences with their caregivers) . Here are some things to watch for: Devices that you do NOT know about. The phone, game machine or computer that you see them use may not be the machine they are really using! It is possible to easily set up virtual machines, virtual clients and burner phones and applications like Hamachi and others that allow them to tunnel through the firewall using AN ENCRYPTED LINK THAT YOU KNOW nothing ABOUT. All you observe is the device they are using and NOT the device they are secretly connected to. This is a big problem in many school districts where there is strict monitoring by IT professionals , yet the children are able to surf porn sites. gambling sites, and adult sites without detection. There are applications specifically designed for children to do this obfuscation and un monitored internet use.",
