            "answer_text": "As a science fiction writer, I too often find myself staring at the blank page not knowing how to begin. I guess it does not matter what one is going to write, whether a science fiction, a romantic story, or an article for some popular fashion magazine. We all have these moments when we are stuck, run out of ideas, or simply do not have the inspiration to create. I personally have my favorite list of famous citations that I would start tossing in my mind to get my story going. Those phrases or words come either from other science fiction books and movies or were once said by well-known scientists. For example: \u201cThe Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever.\u201d KONSTANTIN TSIOLKOVSKY;\u201cThe good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.\u201d \u2015 NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON;\u201cI'm sure the universe is full of intelligent life. It's just been too intelligent to come here.\u201d ARTHUR C. CLARKE;\"All civilizations become either spacefaring or extinct.\" CARL SAGAN.Sometimes it helps to look at some meaningful images (photos, paintings, antique art collection). I may simply loot outside my window and stare at something happening there: people walking, clouds moving, birds flying\u2026 any shift in attention could spark further thoughts in my mind. I also have a habit of opening one random book from my collection of science fiction novels or just classical literature and reading the first sentence or a paragraph my mind comes across. I then start quickly writing and developing the story further. This seemingly dull technique often makes miracles for me. The key is to start writing immediately after reading random phrases from a book. Often I acknowledge that I cannot begin writing due to lack of inspiration. In this case, there is not much one can do, other than taking a break and finding oneself some source of inspiration: listen to favorite music, spend some time with the loved ones, do something joyful and pleasant, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the scale of what I am writing. I ask my students to make stories based on these prompts but also use them myself:  I wish I knew better where these images, these cards came from. They were a gift and I can\u2019t recall. If anyone knows, I will credit the maker. I also use, and, well, make my students use Rory\u2019s Story Cubes. Here is one set of dice:  I often try to make a story based on all nine dice but with students, get them to choose three or four dice to make a story from. For short stories that I write on my own, I like to use Click Bait titles and imagine that the links could lead to. There is no need to read my first draft stories, but here they are, if anyone cares: creativiti project. The start of one such story:  Finally, for my Nanowrimo stories, my longer works of fiction, the things that prompt me or make me want to write are surprisingly ephemeral. Big picture ideas that sound cool but have little in the way of practical details. I liked the work of this blog: Building the ultimate Solar System which discussed how to put 36 Earth-sized planets in the Goldilocks zone of a sun. I decided I wanted to write about evolution vs intelligent design in a fictional place where ID could actually be seen. Okay. So on November 1, at midnight, I sat at my computer and\u2026 huh. No characters, no plot, not story, just a cool idea. I found an idea, many of them, quickly enough but it was a tough few hours at the start. The story I am preparing for right now, that I will start writing for this year\u2019s Nanowrimo is based on another cool idea. A crime is committed at a Long Term Care Home - these places are in the news a great deal now but my story will probably not take place during CoVID. The police work to investigate but the residents suffer from various forms of dementia. They have little short term memory. When they think about their current circumstances, they do not remember their children leaving them in such a residence. They often do not recall that their spouse has passed away. They look about and pick up cues around them to inform them of their environment. They see a picture with snow and guess that it is winter. Some water on the floor suggests melting snow. Someone in a light T-shirt is coughing so the resident makes the intellectual leap: this person was outside in the snow and got sick. The now they live in is imagined and not entirely real. And our own now is only better, not perfect. That idea is the prompt for my story this year. This time at least, I am preparing the characters ahead of time, I will plan the crime, or confusing mix of crimes and decide some plot points I must reach in my narrative. ",
