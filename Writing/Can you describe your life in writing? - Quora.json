I am 18 year old living in Mumbai.I am going to appear for HSC and JEE and CET in 2020.My preparation for all is negligible.I find studies difficult.I have almost given up on it.I tried to keep away all my distractions away still cannot get over it.My body is fat,eyes poor,face poor and so on and I am short(165 cm).Laziness has controlled me and now ruining me.I find hard to concentrate and get Distracted easily.I am immature according to people.I am a introvert according to people.Behind my back everyone calls be a C(you know what I mean).People talk less or avoid talking to me and so I do.My parents are worried alot about me,about my future and so on.I have nothing special.I had a good academic performance that too is lost now.Apart from this I had nothing and have nothing.I won't be able to survive the way I live.My father said me this and also my other family members.My life has become miserable because of all of the above points.This is the shortest summary I can give rest all are mentioned in my answers which I wrote before.I just wanted to know how to overcome this all.I have never lied anything on Quora or don't do for any sympathy. THANK YOU\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "You can. But if it's about writing in story form I personally think only writing your life without any fiction would be very boring. As long as your life was really interesting or something you may be able to write a pretty decent story/book. But if it had only some parts that were really ear catching than nobody would bother to even reach the end. But simply answering your question, yes you can ",
