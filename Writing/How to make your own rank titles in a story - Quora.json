            "answer_text": "First thing I suggest is study an existing rank structure. It don\u2019t matter from when or where, just study any one. Once you understand why the ranks break up in the way they do, and the jobs performed at each level look at your story and create a structure that makes sense for your story. Make sure you don\u2019t skip jobs, but feel free to move them around. Once you know how your rank structure works, then start naming the various levels. There you go. All done. ",
