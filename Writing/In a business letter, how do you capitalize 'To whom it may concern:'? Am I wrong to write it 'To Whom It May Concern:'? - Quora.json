            "answer_text": "No need to know how to Capitalize that expression because there is no reason to use that expression. If you do not know the person, to whom the letter should be addressed to, then no one at the letter\u2019s address will see the need to respond. Try this line of questioning: Why are you writing such a letter? It is probably because you need: An answer to a question Want to give advise, or suggestion, about a concern, condition, etc. You have been devalued by someone, or something, within the organization of the addressee. You want to state an opinion, a belief, a fact, or other information to the addressee. There are probably other reasons for writing the letter. But in every case someone must read and react to your letter to satisfy your intentions. You do not need to know a person\u2019s name or title, but you do need to know where the mail-room of the addressee will route the letter. \u201cTo whom this may concern\u201d will quickly direct the letter to the trash bin. Quickly evaluated as junk mail. Therefore, instead of using \u201cTo whom this may concern\u201d state the Dept., Group, Facility, Branch, or other meaningful division within the scope of the addressee. Put the expression \u201cTo whom this may concern\u201d into your own trash bin. Using it only suggests that you are too lazy to find whom the reader of the letter should be. ",

It\u2019s true that your first example is the more common. But I wonder what\u2019s the worst that could happen if you capitalized a few more words? Will someone call the grammar police? Or, heaven forbid, someone will wonder why John did that. As Eliza Doolittle sang in My Fair Lady, \u201cthere will still be Spring every year and art and music will thrive.\u201d Let\u2019s live a little and capitalize an unsuspecting word every now and then \u2014 just to see what happens.
