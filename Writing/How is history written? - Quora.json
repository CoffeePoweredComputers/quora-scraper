            "answer_text": "I think the best history above all else requires extreme clarity of vision. You as the author must be brutally honest about the reason why you have chosen this story. Today\u2019s reader is exceptionally sophisticated. Information is no longer the property of a few gatekeepers; the opposite is true. Anyone with access to the internet can get individual perspectives, frequently uncensored, on any event current or otherwise. We know that history is subjective. How does a modern writer respond to this challenge? My favorite strategy, which is only beginning to really gain traction, is the obviously biased narrative history. The author fully understands the personal ties to the subject matter and engages them. A hypothetical book about the life of Anne Boleyn (popular topic of what I am referring to here) can serve as a good example here. Why: -Very specific subject matter. Don\u2019t write about an epoch. Choose a person, a moment, or something very specific and dive into detail. This is what conventional history does not provide. -Niche market. Specific people, places and events are not going to please everyone. They should never aim to try. This is unique opportunity for the author to connect with the reader through a shared interest that existed before the book. The book is not making this thing relevant. This type of history has nothing to prove. -Adheres to facts but opinion is allowed. Because you are sharing instead of instructing the reader, opinion is absolutely allowed provided facts are properly noted. The reader wants not just the facts but the author\u2019s take on them as well. -Is not afraid to be engaging. When you pick a very specific topic, you can tell the story using traditional narrative techniques without violating your authority as an author. This history does not make lofty claims. It is not proposing that it is anything more than the discoveries of one researcher with a passion for the subject matter. This allows the author to show the reader why it is so engaging, why it has ignited their own passion without being disingenuous. Books about specific people in history written from a unique point of view that is genuine but less austere than traditional attract me. The person does not have to be obscure\u2014in fact, if I have never heard of someone I actually feel disinclined to read it because it seems irrelevant. I would advise against going too far outside of mainstream history for subject matter. I like characters, so I personally like reading about the people behind the legends, so to speak. What I do not like is when someone is presented as the polar opposite of their public image. This is simply childish and insulting. With few exceptions, no one is all \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d Regardless of your own preferences, my closing point is this: always imagine you are writing for a peer, not someone who is ignorant. Do not present information to modern readers in a voice of total authority; you know this and they do not, so you are educating them. This type of behavior is simply becoming more and more intolerable and alienating in all areas of life, authorship included. I hope this is helpful. I am going to wrap this up in the interest of length, but its a fascinating question. Thank you for asking! ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very general question that\u2019s difficult to answer without qualification. For me as a writer there are venues to consider: History as fiction (i.e. historical fiction) History from personal experience (i.e. memoir) History as analysis (i.e. historical reference) History as drama (i.e. historical reenactment \u2014 speculative history) There\u2019s all kinds of various techniques, research, kinds of narrative, that go into those examples. Whichever you are doing you pick the best story telling vehicle and techniques to depict the history you want to present to the reader. ",
