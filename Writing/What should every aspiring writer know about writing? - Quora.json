            "answer_text": "That \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d is stupid advice. All it amounts to is, \u201cI\u2019m lazy and have a severe lack of imagination when it comes to interpreting your work, so please make it as painfully as obvious as possible, otherwise I\u2019ll refuse to read it.\u201d Most storytelling is done through the simplest conveying of information. This is true for campfire stories and bedtime stories, for example, in which the speaker regales their audience with a series of simple descriptions pieced together and called a story. And you know what? That\u2019s good enough for their audience members. It\u2019s only when it comes to prose stories that you have people telling you it\u2019s not\u2026 for some reason. \u201cA gallant knight rides to the top of the mountain on horseback to save a girl who has been taken captive by the dragon Scar. Scar terrorized her village for weeks before the kidnapping, all in pursuit of a suitable meal. Now the knight is coming to slay the foul beast and take her back home to her parents\u2026! etc. etc.\u201d That\u2019s pretty much in-line with the style of storytelling I mentioned above. Is anyone actually going to tell me they felt NOTHING, not even a sliver of emotion, reading that? \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d is basically just a fancy way of saying, \u201cPlease spoon-feed me pretty words, and if you don\u2019t, then I won\u2019t have any faith in your ability to weave a compelling story. Instead, I\u2019ll clock out by the end of the first paragraph rather than stick around for the big picture.\u201d Does this mean you should never \u201cShow?\u201d No. What this means is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d Telling someone not to do something is nothing but asinine. There are no rules. What you should do depends solely on the unique individual requirements of your story. Don\u2019t be afraid to \u201ctell,\u201d even if some people may avoid your work like the plague because they\u2019re dumb. Don\u2019t be afraid to \u201cshow,\u201d but do so only because you feel it\u2019s right based on the needs of your story, and not because someone told you to do so. I know it sounds like I prefer one over the other, but really, I\u2019m just making two crucial points: 1) That everything has merit; 2) That trying to define art in black-and-white terms is both stupid and disrespectful to its true multifaceted nature.

            "answer_text": "The writer tries to move stuff from his brain into the brains of his readers, using words as his only tools. Good writing doesn't just transport ideas\u2014it gives the reader a visceral experience, as if the writer is reaching inside his skull, grabbing fistfuls of neurons, twisting them, petting them, and sometimes crushing them.  before you add the clutter, keep it simple stupid The most basic skill a writer can have is the ability to describe things simply and clearly, which means either painting a concrete picture or making a clear argument. It also means using easy but exacting words and to-the-point syntax. For example, this sentence ... \"Worrying about his sick kitten and puzzling over the situation in the Middle East, he hurried\u2014all the while checking his watch\u2014towards the train.\" ... would be much clearer (though not necessarily better) as ... \"He hurried towards the train, all the while checking his watch, worrying about his sick kitten, and puzzling over the situation in the Middle East.\" The easiest form of sentence to understand is \"subject verb.\" The more words you cram between those two parts of speech (or before them), the tougher it is for the reader to understand. The reader wants to know who is doing what to whom. In my sentence, the \"who\" is \"he\" and the \"what\" is \"hurried towards the train.\" I am not advocating prose in which every sentence (or even any sentence) follows that form. I am saying you should understand how to write that way, why it's a clear way to write, and, when you deviate from it, why you're doing so. In the above example, maybe my goal is to highlight the sick kitten and the Middle-East situation, and that's why I begin with them. Or maybe I'm trying to create tension by delaying getting-to-the-point. That's fine, as long as I understand what I'm doing. Complex phrasing, challenging words, and baroque sentence structures are all useful tools, but you should know how to use them, when to use them, and how to make do without them. Walk before you can run. lick the reader all over, soaking him with spit Next, writers should understand that it's much easier to make readers have sensory experiences than feelings or ideas. Whenever possible, writers should use that to their advantage. An essay on democracy will benefit from descriptions of flipping switches inside voting booths; and geometry texts are digestible when the reader can imagine putting on running shoes and sprinting around the circumference of a circle.  As much as you can, evoke sounds, sights, tastes, touches, and smells. Punch and pinch the reader; fill his nostrils with urine or the scent of cherry pie; rub him all over with wet paper towels; tune his inner radio to cool jazz or static; sprinkle cinnamon on his tongue... Sometimes you can evoke sensations by raw description: explaining what an object or scene looks like, smells like, etc. Sometimes you can animate a non-sensual abstraction via metaphor: \"She raged, accusing him of one thing after another. Each accusation was like a firecracker detonating in his sinus cavities.\" Humans have a sixth sense, which is just as evocative as the famous five\u2014and I'm not talking about ESP. I'm talking about our kinetic sense, our sense of movement. Verbs that move are always strong: push, pull, kick, bend, straighten, leap, stretch, roll, amble, crouch, sprint... You can use them literally (\"The penguin waddled\") or figuratively (\"I toppled her argument\").  time for show and tell Writing teachers sometimes say \"show don't tell.\" It's not a bad heuristic for beginners, but it's oversimplified. I prefer to say, \"Earn the right to tell.\" Telling\u2014as in explaining rather than evoking\u2014is harder for readers to relate to than the sorts of sensory data I outlined, above. So if you have something to tell, make sure that you've either prepped the reader by helping him picture (smell, etc.) the scene or by quickly following your telling with a sensory picture that illustrates it.  The show is the setup; the tell is the punchline. The tell is the thesis; the show is the proof. Example of showing and then telling:   My girlfriend kept drinking all my beer. She would hog the remote control and force me to watch hours of 'Sex in the City.' She packed my suits into boxes and filled my closets with her dresses, jackets, and sweaters. She insisted on smoking inside, and my apartment still reeks of nicotine. She was a selfish bitch, and that's why I broke up with her. The last sentence is telling, but I earned the right to tell from my earlier sentences that showed.  Example of telling and then showing:   Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys' house. The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him...  This famous opening, from Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina,\" starts by telling and then, to anchor the idea into the reader's brain, switches to showing. You don't always need to formulaically tell first and then show or show first and then tell. What you need to do is just keep in mind that we sense easier than we understand ideas\u2014and that we understand mostly through sensing. So by all means tell. Just make sure your telling is linked to sensations. Also, keep in mind that \"showing\" means evoking. If you're wondering whether \"It was raining\" is showing or telling, ask yourself whether or not it evokes the sensation of rain. I don't think it does, do you? Try something like \"the rain soaked through his shirt, plastering it to his chest....\"  And keep in mind this excellent advice from novelist Chuck Palahniuk:  In six seconds, you\u2019ll hate me. But in six months, you\u2019ll be a better writer.  From this point forward \u2013 at least for the next half year \u2013 you may not use \u201cthought\u201d verbs. These include: Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires, and a hundred others you love to use.  The list should also include: Loves and Hates.  ... Until some time around Christmas, you can\u2019t write: Kenny wondered if Monica didn\u2019t like him going out at night\u2026\u201d  Instead, you\u2019ll have to Un-pack that to something like: \u201cThe mornings after Kenny had stayed out, beyond the last bus, until he\u2019d had to bum a ride or pay for a cab and got home to find Monica faking sleep, faking because she never slept that quiet, those mornings, she\u2019d only put her own cup of coffee in the microwave. Never his.\u201d  Instead of characters knowing anything, you must now present the details that allow the reader to know them. Instead of a character wanting something, you must now describe the thing so that the reader wants it. Instead of saying: \u201cAdam knew Gwen liked him.\u201d You\u2019ll have to say: \u201cBetween classes, Gwen was always leaned on his locker when he\u2019d go to open it. She\u2019d roll her eyes and shove off with one foot, leaving a black-heel mark on the painted metal, but she also left the smell of her perfume. The combination lock would still be warm from her ass. And the next break, Gwen would be leaned there, again.\u201d In short, no more short-cuts. Only specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling.  \u2014 http://litreactor.com/essays/chuck-palahniuk/nuts-and-bolts-%E2%80%9Cthought%E2%80%9D-verbs write sensually and you can forget most other rules If you commit to evoking sights, sounds, smells, tastes, movements, and textures in the reader's brain, you can quit sweating the small stuff. For instance, you've probably heard that strong verbs and specific nouns are better than adverbs and adjectives.  This isn't necessarily true, but it often turns out to be the case\u2014not because modifiers are bad, but because it's easier to evoke sensations via concrete, easy-to-grasp objects and actions. If you write, \"he looked at her quizzically,\" that's harder to instantly picture than, \"he cocked his head\" or \"he furrowed his brow.\" Don't worry about adjectives and adverbs. Just work to evoke images and other sensations. Make your images strong and specific.  the three biggies Beginners often need to learn three things:  (1) write every day; (2) read everything you write out loud;  (3) and make multiple drafts. Almost every writing book makes these suggestions, but when I first started writing, I refused to follow them. Why? Because I was egotistical and lazy. I thought maybe other writers needed to write every day, but surely I didn't need to. Besides, it was too much work. And I felt the same way about reading aloud and making multiple drafts.  Writing well is hard. You need to practice every day, because it's the only way you'll improve\u2014and you can easily backslide. So you need to \"practice scales,\" like a pianist.  If you can't think of anything to write today, just describe your morning: \"The alarm went off. I groaned and refused to get out of bed. But it kept ringing, so finally I threw the covers aside and stumbled to the bathroom...\" It doesn't matter what you write. It doesn't have to be interesting. You don't need to show it to anyone. Just write, write, write... You don't get to call yourself a writer unless you write every day. But if you write every day, you're an official writer, even if you've never had anything published. You need to read everything you've written out loud, because that's the only way you'll know if it sounds natural. As soon as I mouth my words, I find all sorts of forced and awkward-sounding passages. (TIP: if you're at work or a coffee shop and can't read out loud, at least move your lips. It will force your brain to imagine you're reading out loud.) You have to make multiple drafts because editing is easier than writing. And you need to first get something down on paper so you have something to edit. Think of your first draft as a data dump. Then you start chiseling away at it, going over each word, adding and subtracting.  Stephen King, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jane Austen ... they all work (or worked) with multiple drafts. If you're a serious writer, you need to do that, too.  Every once in a while, you'll hear about an amazing writer who doesn't redraft. Yes, they exist. They are freaks of nature. Don't assume you're one of them.    PS. You don't have writer's block! See Marcus Geduld's answer to How can I deal with writer's block when I have so many ideas in my head, but no way to write them down? I don't feel confident enough to write and I suppose I am not literate enough in TV and film. How can I get more confident to write? And keep in mind what Ira Glass has to say about taste (emphasis added):  Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste.  But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit.  Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work.  Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.  And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through. every piece of writing counts If you want to be a writer, you should always be \"on.\" Give up the idea of \"tossed off writing that's not real writing.\" Proof-read and redraft your emails, your text messages, your shopping lists. If you're a writer, you care about writing. You always care. You always take care. The flip version of this \"law\" is: you know you're a writer when you start proof-reading your text messages, worrying over each word\u2014when you can no-longer conceive of not caring how you write a sentence.  Do you know any professional chefs? I do. They don't say, \"I know I'm a chef, but I'm just making a sandwich for a snack.\" They are incapable of being around food without caring. When they are around food, they care.  write to somebody It's much easier to write to a specific person than \"the general reader.\" Sometimes, when I'm stuck, I write in gmail instead of MS Word. I start a letter to a friend\u2014with no intention of sending it\u2014and start describing, storytelling, arguing or whatever.  We evolved to talk to specific people, not people in general. So use that part of your nature! When you're writing, make a case to your mom; argue with your husband; write a love letter to your teddy bear... Later, you can generalize it. By the way, writing to a specific person can help you find a \"voice.\" You will find yourself writing differently if it's an \"email\" to a six-year-old than if it's an email to your boss. This technique tends to work for programmers, too. It's useful in many fields. We're social animals. Understand that fact and use it to your advantage*. See Rubber duck debugging. read every day... ... and when a writer gives you a strong sensation, surprises you, or makes an idea pop into focus in your brain, stop and ask, \"How did he do that?\" study rhetoric The ancient Greeks formalized the study of persuasion and coined all sorts of terms for various writing structures. A well-known example is \"antithesis\"\u2014the tension between opposites. For instance, let's say I'm trying to convince you to move to New York. Here's a way to do with using antithesis: \"New York is a a dirty city. Gum wrappers and soda cans decorate the gutters; used condoms float in Central Park's lakes; and, at night, you'll see rats scurrying around the subway tracks; but you'll never find a city more full of life! New York will dazzle you with color and light; it will seduce you with its scents of jerk chicken, gyros, spicy corn and candied peanuts; you'll follow proud, long-legged women up Madison Avenue, and everywhere you'll grab fistfuls of money.\" See Rhetoric, Figure of speech, and Rhetorical device. Here's a clearly-written, inexpensive book on rhetoric for writers: Amazon.com: Rhetorical Devices: A Handbook and Activities for Student Writers eBook: Brendan McGuigan, Douglas Grudzina and Paul Moliken: Kindle Store write rule-based poetry Writers need to become word experts, and one of the best ways to do that is to challenge yourself with constraints, like writing in e-prime (see below) or refusing to use any word containing the letter 'e.'    Whenever you constrain your prose, you should always do so with the goal of sounding natural. Can you give your e-less essay to a friend without him noticing anything odd? When you can write fluidly with constraints, you'll be able to write wonderfully without them. (I remember when my dad taught me to drive with a stick shift, telling me that I'd find automatic transmission a cinch if I mastered shifting gears, first.) The most common form of constrained writing is poetic verse. There are many forms you can try, for instance the Shakespearean sonnet. Here are its rules:  1. Each line must be ten syllables long. 2. You should be able to speak each line \u2014without it sounding forced \u2014with every other syllable (starting with the second) getting more stress than the one before it. Example: \"She stood and tortured me then slammed the door. 3. There must be 14 lines total. 4. The rhyme scheme for the first 12 lines is ABAB, with every other line rhyming: Example: She stood and tortured me then slammed the door.I cried, \"Please stop!\" but she ignored my pleas.She laughed and sang and danced and laughed some more,While I unraveled, shaken, ill at ease... 5. The last two lines (the final couplet) should rhyme with each other: Though cruelty was her skill and pain her art,I loved her even as she broke my heart. If sonnets are too complicated, try a simpler from, like the haiku or the limerick. Look it up on wikipedia, learn the rules, and have a go. See Category:Poetic form. And I urge all writers \u2014no matter what form of writing they do\u2014to read Stephen Sondheim's two books on lyric writing. They trap you in the mind of a writer who cares about each and every word he writes. Hat Box: The Collected Lyrics of Stephen Sondheim: Stephen Sondheim: 9780307957726: Amazon.com: Books try e-prime E-Prime, a constrained English, forbids you to use any form of the verb \"to be,\" so instead of writing, \"She was scared,\" you must write, \"She shivered\" or \"She ran screaming to her mother.\" I spent a year writing in e-prime (always working to make my prose sound natural, despite the constraint), allowing myself to use \"to be\" forms only in quotes, as in this paragraph. E-prime forces you to craft every sentence around an agent doing something, e.g. a woman shivering, a dog peeing, or a bomb exploding. My e-prime year improved my writing more than any other exercise.  break a rule You've heard teachers say, \"You have to know the rules before you can break them.\" Okay, well: you know the rules. So now go ahead and smash them to pieces. You may not be a grammarian, but you know at least some rules of writing. Those are the ones you're allowed to break, and those are the ones you must break. Why? Because writers don't let words own or dominate them. Writers own words. Writers hypnotize nouns and order them to act like verbs; they gleefully stick square pegs in round holes; they spit in the eyes of their fifth-grade English teachers. I am not excusing shoddy, lazy work. What I am saying is this: if you don't know the rules, the words control you. If you're controlled by the rules, the words still control you. You must become the master of the words and the rules, using them as tools, not as bosses.  Obviously, if you're a student and writing \"ain't\" will get you an F, don't do it. But in your own writing, be the boss and don't let anyone else push you around.  Unless you're writing experimental poetry or prose (or colloquial dialogue), go easy on the departures from standard English. They should be the spice, not the main course. If every word is surprising, none of them are surprising. The eccentric is only effective when it's hidden within the ordinary.  You don't have to keep all your experiments. You're also in control over what goes into the final draft. Just keep playing. Keep loose with language.  \"My Lit professor assigned Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, and Othello, and now my brain is totally Shakespeared, and I don't know whether to be or not to be.\" \"She ordered me to get her lunch, then she made me fix the toilet, then she told me to wash all the dishes, then she ordered me to drive her mom to the airport, then she gribbled me to grickle her grapper grouper until I smashed her head with a doodle doodle doo!\" extend metaphors In Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson explain that our writing and speech is laced with metaphors we fail to notice. For instance, here are a couple of sentences from earlier in this post: \"It's much easier to write to a specific person than 'the general reader.' Sometimes, when I'm stuck, I write in gmail instead of MS Word.\" Note that I likened being unable to write with being physically trapped and using gmail as being inside something. Such metaphors should convince you\u2014if you still need convincing\u2014that we're sensual creatures: that when faced with something murky like writer's block or interacting with a computer, we evoke physical concepts, like being stuck and being inside a container. Here's a fun and useful exercise: find a passage written by yourself or someone else, locate all the buried metaphors and extend them: In my passage, in addition to \"stuck\" and \"in,\" there's \"writing to,\" which seems to evoke the idea of words traveling towards a person, as if they're birds or arrows. Here's my attempt of an extended version: \"It's much easier to write to a specific person\u2014pushing each word towards him and watching them waddle off like baby ducks\u2014then it is writing to a general reader. Sometimes, when I'm stuck in a deep well with nothing at the bottom except blunt pencils and blank pieces of paper, I claw my way to the top, stumble out onto the grass, rush inside, open my laptop and dive into gmail, as if it was an olympic pool, and I swim frantically towards a friend or former lover.\" I'm not suggesting you should write this way normally. But it's a great, playful exercise that turns words into toys and makes you deeply aware of what you're writing.  Turn words into toys! inspiration  ... The ego is the enemy of the imagination. Anything that you think about writing when you're not writing, is a product of the ego and is absolutely wrong. One hundred percent, all the time, wrong. And if you take a step back and think how much time you spend trying to purify yourself in order to get ready to write, that's like 95% of the time. And the reason for that is the ego has a stake in perpetuating the behavior that you've already engaged in. We do not think our way to right action; we act our way to right thinking.  So what I do is I start writing. If I think about my writing before I start to write, what I'm really doing is justifying not writing, because ... I'm not writing. ... I'm going to find a way to keep not writing. So what I say is I don't have the idea yet; it's not fully realized yet... Not only that: I don't have pencils; my pencils are not sharpened; I don't have the right notebook. ... Whoa! Eleven-forty five already. Time for lunch. ... When you think about exercising, what you invariably say to yourself is, \"You know, I'm too fat. What's the point? I'm too old; I'm too fat; I'm too old; I'm too slow; I'm too this; I'm too that...\" And all you're doing is justifying the fact that you're not exercising.  -- David Milch, creator of \"Deadwood.\"  You can decide if Milch is going overboard or not, but in my opinion what he's saying is basically sound. The more time you waste on \"Which word processor should I use?\" and \"outlining,\" the less time you are writing. And it's all about writing! Honestly, if a member of your team is stuck for ideas, tell him to write about what he had for breakfast that morning. Writing anything is a step forward.  Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.  -- Anton Chekhov  Some films are slices of life. Mine are slices of cake. -- Alfred Hitchcock  Style is the art of getting yourself out of the way, not putting yourself in it.  -- David Hare  if it sounds like writing, I rewrite it.  -- Elmore Leonard  He was doing a film, and he explained to his writer that the beginning of the film had to show that this man had been married a long time and that he is kind of tired of it. He had gotten used to his wife and had a roving eye. So the writer brought him four pages of introductory exposition of character. Lubitsch looked at it and said, 'You don\u2019t need all that.' He took all four pages out. 'Just put down this\u2014the man walks into the elevator with his wife, and keeps his hat on. On the seventh floor a pretty blonde walks in, and the man takes his hat off.' -- Director Rouben Mamoulian (Love Me Tonight, The Mark of Zorro, Blood and Sand) remembering director Ernst Lubitsch.  Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect. -- Teller  There is a great difference, whether the poet seeks the particular for the sake of the general or sees the general in the particular. From the former procedure there ensues allegory, in which the particular serves only as illustration, as example of the general. The latter procedure, however, is genuinely the nature of poetry; it expresses something particular, without thinking of the general or pointing to it.  -- Goethe  People are very good [at] thinking about agents. The mind is set really beautifully to think about agents. Agents have traits. Agents have behaviors. We understand agents. We form global impression of their personalities. We are really not very good at remembering sentences where the subject of the sentence is an abstract notion.  -- Daniel Kahneman  Begin with an individual and you find that you have created a type; begin with a type and you find that you have created \u2014 nothing.  -- F. Scott Fitzgerald And make sure you read this: David Mamet on Dramatic Writing.   * I experienced the benefit of \"social thinking\" today, after writing \"School is a form of child abuse.\" I then wanted to add a sentence admitting that I'd made an over-the-top, rhetorical claim. I wanted to write, \"When I say 'school is child abuse,' know I'm being _________,\" but I couldn't fill in the blank. The word wasn't even on the tip of my tongue. It had fallen off and was lodged somewhere under the sofa or coffee table. And my pleas to various thesauri and dictionaries proved fruitless.  Finally, I called my wife, who is good with words. But I got her voice mail, so instead of explaining my problem, I hung up.  Then I gave up and wrote, \"I know that's a loaded phrase,\" which was okay, but it wasn't exactly what I intended. What was I being when I coined the loaded phrase? What's a word for someone who uses loaded phrases? Arg!  An hour later, my wife called me back. She'd seen my number pop up on her phone and was curious about what I wanted and why I hadn't left a message.  \"Oh, it's no big deal,\" I said. \"I was trying to think of a word for ... provocative! That's it! That's what I was trying to think of! I'm being provocative! I'm a provocateur! Thanks so much! You're a life saver!\"  \"Uh ... I didn't do anything.\" But she did! She existed. She was a person for me to talk to, and she is an important person in my life\u2014one that my brain is used to trying to explain things to clearly. \"I'm not going to dredge up the word for you,\" said my brain. \"But I'll do it for her!\"  Until I talked to her, everything had failed: straining my memory, relaxing my mind, using references materials, etc. But just the act of socializing\u2014just the intention to socialize\u2014made the word appear!  Magic! ",
