            "answer_text": "What i get from your question is that your Bank account is inactive because of no transaction in it for six months and above and now you want to get it activated. It is simple, just visit your bank branch with your original credentials i.e. your valid ID\u2019s to verify your title of the account and ownership. Banks usually provide their specific forms to fill in order to activate your account which are easy to read and answer; bank staff can also help you do that but if for any unfortunate reasons they don\u2019t have the forms available or XYZ ,then just write a simple two liner letter to them informing that your bank account is inactive since you were not able to make any transaction due to so & so reason; dont forget to mention your account detail (Ac number, Ac type etc.) and your ID #s with current address and contact detail. I am sure you will be accommodated. ",
