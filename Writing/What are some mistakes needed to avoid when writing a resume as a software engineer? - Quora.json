            "answer_text": "Not applicable to everyone, but took me a long time to realize. Don\u2019t just have one version of your resume for every job you apply to. Companies call different roles different things and don\u2019t always abide by the commonly accepted definition of particular roles. This is especially true for data roles. I\u2019ve seen \u201cData Scientist\u201d used to describe everything from a Machine Learning expert to a BA who knows SQL. Debates aside of what \u201cshould\u201d be considered a Data Scientist or not, you should tailor your resume to the role and THEIR expectations, not yours. Personally, I keep a base resume with my relevant experience and then adapt my title and skills based on what I\u2019m applying to. If it\u2019s a data heavy role, I\u2019ll mention my data related skills. If it\u2019s a software heavy role, I\u2019ll mention my software skills early on. As long as you feel it\u2019s a good role for you, use their language and apply with the relevant resume. ",
