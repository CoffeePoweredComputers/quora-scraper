My father died early but I carry the memories of his outstanding skills in various fields. He was not a highly qualified person but was exceptionally brilliant in many fields at young age like photography, drawing, block making, chemicals, machine working etc.  As I became engineer I was not very good with toolkit business but always yearned to be like him. YES. I WANTED TO FOLLOW THE PATTERN BUT I KNEW MY SHORTCOMINGS IN THAT AREA. I went for managerial role very soon that entailed lot of writing work but at the back of my mind, I always wanted to remain highly technical and practical; somehow I was lucky to perform well when there was a need for that, perhaps because of the genes I carried.  Thanks for asking an emotional question, Tudor.  ",

            "answer_text": "Before my father passed on he started writing a book about those he loved. He wrote it knowing he was going to die soon. I always remembered my father being that way, a philosophical person that lives for knowledge. I often times find myself comparing his life to my own. How he thought, what he would think of me today, and would I make him proud. I do enjoy writing and looking for answers to life in general. Usually my grandmother compares me to him. Especially his humor and attitude. Sometimes I feel glad that he passed on as it has helped me mature as a person. Still I wish he was here, if I had a day to just talk to him I would be in heaven.

However, we do not become them.  They may have guided and mentored us, but we are unique individuals with choices and decisions of our own. Perhaps we gain more understanding of them as we approach their age.  You are who you are because of the choices you make.   So choose wisely and your children will be grateful for your influence.

Your parents knew you your entire life, and it is possible they understood things about you that were clear to them because they have a greater overall sense of continuity. They literally knew you from day one. As you grow older, you will appreciate that insight. Also, as you reach those milestones in life yourself, you will also understand better some of the mistakes you parents made.  The flip side to the wisdom you learn, you may also learn some forgiveness. ",
