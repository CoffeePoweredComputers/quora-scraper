In those answers (of varying quality) I touch on burning issues like Soup, Childbirth, Childhood, Adolescence, Music, Aging, Nostalgia, Thrift Stores, Art, Death, Sex, Love, Disappointment, Facial Hair\u2026the list goes on and on. It\u2019s all (or mostly) there. I\u2019ve left out a few key things\u2026but professional biographers often have less to work with. I have no idea what it all means. I don\u2019t pretend to be a noteworthy person. I could be anybody. Get some 3x5 cards and jot down some notes\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter if you upvote my answers or not. Arrange the cards in an order that makes sense. I can do the same for you. We can shuffle cards\u2026I don\u2019t care. Synthesize it into something. Burroughs used the cut-up method\u2026I like 3x5 cards. It\u2019s how I outline. Make drawings if you like. This is your baby - I\u2019m giving it to you. I get a final review. I would expect it to be inaccurate and distorted at points. I want to see what you can do with my life. I\u2019m dead curious. ",
