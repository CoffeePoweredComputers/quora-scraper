            "answer_text": "You can use nicknames. These help characterize the character as well. For example, a character who always pays for things with exactly two gold pieces could be called, well, Two-Gold. Or a character who does a specific thing is named after it, like the way Glen Cook names some of his characters in the Black Company series. For instance, Croaker is the doctor and Shifter is a mage who can shapeshift.  You can have the nicknames convey mystery. Why is a cold-blooded killer with his mouth sewn together called Smiler? Why does everybody call the ten-year old kid in the room Old Man? Things like that.  So you can have other characters call your character Red, or something. Or some other generic name, like doll, tramp, or wench. Be creative. This technique allows you to describe characters without naming them, in fact arguably trivializing their name altogether. ",

            "answer_text": "Prologues. I like to write action-based prologues, they help describe a particular environment, entity, event, or anything else, really. For one of my stories, the prologue was my main character (who was a wolf-shifter) running down an elk with his pack (who were normal wolves), and once they had made the kill he howled, and his howl carried so far that my second main character heard it. Once they were all done with the carcass, he led the pack \u201chome\u201d. Nobody said his name, but it introduced the character. My first chapter kicked off at the second main character hearing the howl while out hunting, just because I didn\u2019t want to do two chapters on Kalen back to back. ",
