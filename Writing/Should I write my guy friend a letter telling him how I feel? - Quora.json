Those things should be told face to face or better don't tell him. I know it's difficult and you\u2019re afraid of rejection, I was like you so I wait and wait until he moved from my home city and I coul tell him only by text. Don't make this mistake, ask him to meet. Tell him how do you feel and if he doesn't feel the same, well, you'll move on one day. At least after doing it you'll know how brave you are ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "And what are you planning on doing if he does not feel the same way? Not dissing you here sister, but let us face facts. You and I do not handle rejection really well. Guys are born and bred for it. You and me, not so much. So, what are your plans if he does no react EXACTLY as your fantasy scenario says he will? The letter can change your friendship and end it pretty quickly. Is that what you want? Finally, if you are friends then why the letter? Can't you direct the conversation toward moving to the next level? Can\u2019t you talk to the boy you plan on making your boyfriend? If not, then maybe this is not such a good idea in the first place. If you can\u2019t talk to him how can you have a more-than-friend relationship with him? Just saying. ",

I have told others that I love them and dealt with the rejection of being in a relationship waiting to hear it said back to me (twice) and I still don\u2019t regret saying how I feel. You win some and you lose some but you never know how your words will change someone\u2019s life. Tell your friend how you feel. It could be amazing or terrible but you\u2019ll never know if you don\u2019t do it. If you live your life with fear as an influencer, life will be very limited to you. ",
