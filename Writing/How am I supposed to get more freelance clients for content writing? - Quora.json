To get the best out of your freelancing career in the Content Writing domain, you can work on the following pointers: Create your content portfolio - It\u2019s important to showcase all your prospective clients your writing style and content quality.Leverage LinkedIn - LinkedIn is not only for jobs, but it\u2019s a lot more. In the past 2 years, the platform has emerged as a viable option for marketers, business professionals (from different industries) and high-end corporate firms to find potential candidates. So, build up your profile on LinkedIn the right way. Some quick pointers:Build your network on LinkedIn - The primary step is to find people who deal in your industry/domain. Once you have a list, you can connect and gradually start sharing your views/thoughts/work with them. The more interaction you make, the better people will start knowing you and your engagement will improve.Create your personal hashtag and use it for branding - Other than interacting with your network, you can also create your personal hashtag that you can include in your LinkedIn posts. Note: My personal hashtag is - #mannkizubani I created this hashtag recently, so search this hashtag and you will find all my LinkedIn posts that includes this hashtag.Be proactive and consistent in publishing - To get the best out of LinkedIn platform, you need to be consistent and regular. The more you interact (via comments, posts, etc.), the better your chances are to land a good gig.STOP using Upwork/Freelancer (and other sites) - All these sites (Upwork/Truelancer/Freelancer, etc.) are no longer that worthy of spending time. There was a time when Upwork proved beneficial for Indian writers to find international clients, but its\u2019 no longer the case. Better go for LinkedIn. It\u2019s your best bet.Try your Luck with Facebook groups - I no longer use Facebook, owing to multiple data breach and other allegations, but the platform has a lot of dedicated groups w.r.t Content writing/Digital Marketing. You can try your luck with these Facebook groups, but I can\u2019t guarantee that you will land a gig. The reason I stopped relying on these groups is because most clients cheat their writers. The cheating mostly occurs in the form of a delayed payment or NO PAYMENT at all. So, tread your steps carefully.Best wishes for your career. Note: You can follow me through my blog or connect with me on LinkedIn, if you seek a one-to-one interaction or some guidance pertaining to the digital marketing domain. Be Wise and then Rise.
