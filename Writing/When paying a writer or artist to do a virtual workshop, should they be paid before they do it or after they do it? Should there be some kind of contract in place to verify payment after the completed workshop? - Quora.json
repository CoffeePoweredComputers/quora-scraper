            "answer_text": "You could offer payment half before the workshop and half afterwards, but either way you need a contract, not so much to cover verification of payment, but the entire agreement you have with the teacher/tutor. Do not ignore this or you are likely to encounter significant issues and a court will not be impressed. You don\u2019t want to be standing there, with a judge saying \u2018What are your business terms and conditions? Do you not have any?\u2026\u2019 Ignorance is no defence in a court of law! It\u2019s important the tutor understand that they must turn up, be on time, be well presented (not messy hair), be personable and well prepared with their content/information etc etc. and anythind else that you require. If they leave the workshop half way through, how will you handle it? What if they get sick before, during or after it? What if they turn up onscreen drunk or on drugs? You need to think about your requirements and phrase them out. You also need to provide facilities and map out your own obligations - you need to commit to providing these things as your part of the relationship. Your bank should be able to verify the payment, but yes, they must confirm themselves that they have been paid and no further payment attempt will be made by you until you can draw the money back that you paid and which has somehow not arrived. Contact your bank re how they handle it when someone says the money has not arrived, and so you know your rights/obligations. This does not constitute legal or professional advice of any kind and you are recommended to contact a lawyer - your professional association or union may offer these services for free - to get some decent terms down on paper. I don\u2019t recommend you to draft your own, unless you have expeirence of this. You could easily tie your business in knots and lose a lot of money. During my career I found a single small change in wording, such as a comma being moved, or a preposition \u2018of\u2019 being changed to \u2018for\u2019 can make the difference between being paid or not being paid. Be careful! ",

            "answer_text": "I would not do the virtual workshop without being paid. If you are paying for my advice/help/teaching, then you give me money before I give you teaching/entertainment. Same as paying for a show before it starts. This is true with all training seminars, too. If someone is going to attend, even if they don\u2019t get anything from it, they have to pay for it. They are paying for my time, not for their own results. If they are paying me, it\u2019s because they think I\u2019m worth the memory. But all I can do is teach, I can\u2019t learn it for you. So you should always pay first. If you\u2019re trying to attract someone to do a virtual workshop, you should work out what they will be paid if the seminar \u2018makes,\u2019 then pay them when it does. (Makes meaning that you have had enough people sign up AND PAY to be able to pay the artist and to make it worthwhile to do.) Virtual workshops have a lot of additional issues (like selling the webinar later), but at the very least, you shouldn\u2019t have the artist/writer to \u2018come\u2019 to you and give the seminar if you haven\u2019t already paid them.
