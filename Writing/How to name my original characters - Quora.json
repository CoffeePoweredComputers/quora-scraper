            "answer_text": "Of course, it depends on how much material is available on names and naming practices. One way is to find census reports or the equivalent to see what people were named at that time. Another is to read newspapers or look at dramas and novels of the time and place. There are books that give Babies\u2019 names in England and the USA through the ages. It is a problem for authors. Quite often one will discover that certain names were popular at certain times. In England of the past, Kings\u2019 names were popular for boys as President's names were popular in the USA. Then one has to learn something of the naming practices such as naming boys after their fathers or for their godparents. I find that naming characters is as difficult as it was naming my kids. ",
