            "answer_text": "I think both are correct. From English grammar angle, they show the tense of verb. 'I know' describes the saying in present, while 'I knew' describes the saying in the past. Futher more, the presenter uses 'I know' to say about something is true obviously. That means everybody knows about mentioned thing is true. Whereas, using 'I knew' may tell everybody that the presenter just found out, got the meaning that they might not have knowledge or awareness before ",
