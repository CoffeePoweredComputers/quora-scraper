            "answer_text": "http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5321.txt: The local-part of a mailbox MUST BE treated as case sensitive. Therefore, SMTP implementations MUST take care to preserve the case of mailbox local-parts. In particular, for some hosts, the user \"smith\" is different from the user \"Smith\". However, exploiting the case sensitivity of mailbox local-parts impedes interoperability and is discouraged. Mailbox domains follow normal DNS rules and are hence not case sensitive. So in practice e-mail addresses are case-insensitive. Just try with yourself. ",
