            "answer_text": "Improve your observation skills. Pay attention to how things feel, taste, smell, sound, etc. and find ways to describe them without using cliche\u2019s. If you don\u2019t know what a cliche\u2019 is, then you should look into that. Read books in your genre and also read books about how to write. There are a lot of really great books out there, and every one of those great books has a different lesson to teach you. I often reread the best instructional books because I\u2019ll get something different out of them each time. Sometimes, too, you\u2019ll be at one stage of development and understand craft at one level, and then later you\u2019ll see new depths to the same lesson, or you\u2019ll find that you understand the lesson in a different way that suggests a different approach to your writing. Learn to research and learn to think for yourself. I try not to pick on people on Quora too much, especially because a lot of them aren\u2019t native English speakers and the search engine on Quora can be tricky, but this question (or similar ones) have been asked many times, which makes me suspect that you didn\u2019t look too hard before you asked. Find those answers on Quora and read them. Also, take a look at the related questions on the right side of your Quora screen and read the answers to some of those. This is probably the most important of my suggestions, because you have to become proactive in your education. If you must be hand-fed your information, then you won\u2019t succeed. The fact that you asked this question suggests that you\u2019re at least a little bit of a go-getter, which is good. Encourage that trait in yourself. Take classes from working professionals. There are a lot of classes offered by colleges, conventions, etc. If you decide to take some classes, make sure that the instructor is a good one, and that the instructor is well-informed in the genre of writing you\u2019re interested in. Advanced writers can take a class on poetry or literature and get quite a bit out of them without destroying their voice, but impressionable new writers might take advice to heart that might damage their writing. For example, I took a class from a college professor who told me that my writing was excellent but that I shouldn\u2019t \u2018waste my time\u2019 on writing fantasy. I\u2019m really, really glad I didn\u2019t take that advice. He wasn\u2019t a bad instructor. I learned a lot from him. But as a new writer you have to be sure that the first classes you take won\u2019t lead you away from your own personal style and voice. You do have to be flexible in your thinking, though. You can\u2019t always be \u2018right\u2019 about your writing. To progress, you have to adapt and change. A good instructor will help you develop into a better writer. A bad instructor will try to force you to only write about things that the instructor thinks are worthwhile, and only in the style that the instructor thinks is the \u2018best.\u2019 When you lack experience, it\u2019s hard to tell if the instructor is taking you in a good direction or not, which is why I suggest taking classes from published authors when possible, especially if they\u2019re successful in the genre that you\u2019re interested in. Get good feedback. Like finding a good instructor, finding someone who will give good feedback is tough, especially if you don\u2019t know what good feedback looks like. Research critique groups and learn about proper critique etiquette. Simply learning about how to give a good critique will help you recognize when you\u2019ve found someone who can help you improve your writing. Also, practice critiquing other writer\u2019s work. You\u2019ll learn a lot from the mistakes and successes of others. Besides, it\u2019s not really fair to ask other writers to critique your work without reciprocating in some way. If you expect good critiques, you have to give good critiques. That way, everyone is helping everyone else. Once you get good at giving and receiving feedback, you can begin the search for beta readers. If you find a good beta reader, treat them well. I take mine out to dinner when it comes time to sit down and discuss my book. It takes time, effort, and a lot of careful thought to be a beta reader, so you should respect their time and show appreciation for their work. Likewise, even if you don\u2019t agree with what was said, always thank fellow writers for their critiques of your work, and try not to argue with them. You can disagree, of course, but keep your disagreements to yourself. They shouldn\u2019t have to defend their honest opinions. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Go down to your local library and find books written in your niche from 1930, 1940 and 1950. Most of the books from that era follow a \u201cclassic\u201d style where they came out of name traditional hardbound publishers. Every Saturday for 3 months, go sit and read. You have to do a repetitive behavior to learn the pattern so if your career is important, do the behavior. Don\u2019t check out the book, don\u2019t buy the book. Utilize the resource created by your tax dollars. Get on Reddit and find all the \u201cWP\u201d writing prompt blurbs, copy them into a word processor and work through the prompt. Don\u2019t stop until you have 1,500 words. Here\u2019s the catch. A writing career will span stuff you don\u2019t like, subjects that make you uncomfortable, and topics that go against your personal ethics. Power through those and keep at it until you\u2019ve got your 1,500. File those into a folder called Writing Prompts. You don\u2019t have to post your writing unless you want to post. Go over to Quora and Yahoo Answers. Find a question being asked that you know something about and copy and paste it into that handy, dandy word processor. Don\u2019t stop until you have 1,500 words. File those into a folder called Quora Questions or whatever. You don\u2019t have to post your writing unless you want to post. Answer a minimum of 100 questions, maybe 200 if it takes you that long to get comfortable with it. Go down to your local aquarium or museum and watch the fishies or look at paintings. Sit down and watch them for a minimum of 20 minutes. Look at the paintings for a minimum of 20 minutes. Get your tablet or notepad and write out 5 points about the fishies and 5 points about the paintings. Here\u2019s the catch. Find an ugly, grotesque fish that you simply don\u2019t like. Write down why you don\u2019t like it. Try to convince someone with your writing why they should not like it. Same thing with a painting. There you have something to do online and in real life. The life of a writer watches sunny days stream by your window while you scribble on paper or pound out thousands of words on a keyboard. Keep this practice in play every week, every month and every year and keep writing. ",
