            "answer_text": "Always study is important. If you don't study you can't deliver what you want deliver. Means if you are a guy who scores 99 out of 100 in each test as you were studying regularly but someday you didn't study and appear for the exam there are chances that you may score 100/100 but more are the chances of getting even lesser than 90 as you are not in continuation with topic. If you are always in study mode ( i.e. observing, listening and reading appropriate topic of speech or any topic ) you are in continuation with the content of your speech means your speech content never gets boring and old as you are in touch with new and old things of the topic if you are studying regularly. This helps to rejuvenate the audience with new spice in the same old dish also makes you think and explore new things at ease. So always study hard. Even our state leaders, cricketers or any they always study their speech and try to read the contents related to it before delivering the speech on same. ",
