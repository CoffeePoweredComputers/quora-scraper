            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Do book editors get royalties? Generally, no, but that depends upon a lot of things, like the contract the editor has. I generally make a big stink about reading and, more importantly, understanding any contract before you sign it. I also point out that you should ALWAYS have a contract, even when doing business with family or friends. Even though 90% of the time you won\u2019t need it, that other 10% of the is a life-changing mess and you damned well better beleive you needed it. So, editors. What kind? Did you hire them to edit your book? Read the fine print in the contract. They should not get a percentage of anything, in my opinion. You pay them, they do their job, you are done. An editor for hire who tries to slip in a percentage of future earning is a sneaky bastard I wouldn\u2019t do business with. Much like an agent who wants a percentage of ALL future earnings, not just the ones they negotiated for. No one deserves a piece of all the pies except the creator of the work. An editor with a publisher you are publishing with probably should not either. No matter what they earn, it should come out of the publisher\u2019s percentage. That is part of what being a publisher is. The publisher assumes all costs. This does not mean that they don\u2019t earn off of the royalties, it just means it does not affect the percentage the writer earns, like an agent does. It is entirely possible the publisher has a deal with the editor that they earn based upon what the books do. This would especially apply to acquisition editors. In real life? Modern Indie publishers and small presses or micro publishers or whatever are trying to carve out their own niche. They don\u2019t have a lot of money and are doing the best they can. I have seen contracts where the publisher takes their cut and then an additional cut is taken from the author\u2019s royalties to pay the editor. I don\u2019t know that I agree with that, but some are fine with it. It is a \u201cnew\u201d way of doing business. Don\u2019t like it? Fine. Read your contract and understand it and don\u2019t sign it. All contracts are negotiable. Even if the final negotiation is that you don\u2019t sign it. ",

            "answer_text": "It happens very, very rarely. If a book editor has had a really significant role in the creation, planning, management, style, direction and so on of a major work, they may get some consideration and a (small) percentage of sales. For instance the Editor of a large encyclopedia might be paid a fee by its publisher but also be offered some sort of royalty as a reflection of the long-term work and commitment (preparation of this sort of title can take many years). The people like me - who dot the is and cross the ts in manuscripts written by other people and prepare them for publication - never get royalties. We work on a flat-fee basis (or if we\u2019re really lucky, an hourly rate); we don\u2019t expect anything more than that. I know someone who has managed a series of books (and its online satellites) for over 20 years now. While he works freelance for the publisher, he is effectively the curator of the entire series and is responsible for most of the publishing administration, as well as the list-building, general management and detailed work on each individual project. In respect of this work he has negotiated a deal where he is paid a fraction of his normal hourly rate for the day-to-day work, but is also paid a royalty on sales. Apparently this works very well for all concerned but it isn\u2019t by any means common; it reflects his very, very close involvement with all aspects of the project. ",

            "answer_text": "As a freelance book editor, I got paid royalties for the first book I ever worked on. However, this is the exception rather than the rule, and it\u2019s the only book I\u2019ve got paid royalties for. Most self-publishing authors pay their editors an agreed amount rather than offering royalties\u2014and it makes sense for both the author and the editor to agree to this. On the author\u2019s side, if the book sells extremely well, they might give up a potentially large sum of money to the editor. On the editor\u2019s side, if the book sells extremely poorly, the editor might earn barely anything, or worse still, nothing at all. In the case where I got royalties for editing, it was a slightly unusual situation. The publisher was relatively small and didn\u2019t provide their own in-house editorial team, and the author couldn\u2019t afford to pay an editor up-front, so they split their own royalties to ensure I\u2019d get something for my efforts. As it was the first book I\u2019d ever worked on, I was happy to add the book to my profile and less concerned about earning anything from the project, so it worked out well for both of us. On the whole, editors don\u2019t get paid royalties unless it\u2019s an unusual set of circumstances. ",
