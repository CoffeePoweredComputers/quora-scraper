            "answer_text": "Some of the other answers are\u2026 idiosyncratic. To correct one misstatement: Technically, in fiction, most publishers and awards consider anything over 40,000 words to be a novel, but many publishers won\u2019t look at anything under 60,000. 100,000 is typical. It is not a minimum. A normal printed page is usually about 400 words. A typical manuscript page is about 250. Count a few for yourself if you doubt me. For non-fiction, the people who say a book should be however long it needs to be are absolutely right. Self-help books are often pretty short, sometimes as little as 30,000 words; textbooks and reference works are sometimes huge, ranging up to 250,000 words. It all depends on what you\u2019re writing about, and who your audience is. Memoirs are often treated much like novels \u2014 80,000 to 120,000 words is probably good, but you can go well outside that range. Do you have illustrations? It\u2019s often page count that people look at, rather than word count, so a heavily-illustrated book can have a lower word count. A picture isn\u2019t really worth a thousand words, but it\u2019s probably good for a couple of hundred. Look at other books in the field you\u2019re aiming at. Look at the page counts. Consider the type size \u2014 how much do they squeeze onto a page? Then use that to estimate the wordage, and you\u2019ll have a standard to work from. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no magical word count for nonfiction books. It depends on the genre, depth of subject matter, and importantly whether you\u2019re self-publishing or seeking a traditional publisher. For the latter, word counts are still relatively high \u2014 generally 60k or more, though shorter books have become more popular so some publishers are now happy to publish short books as well. Look at the word count of books that have been published recently in your genre (page count x 250 words gives you a rough idea of the word count) to get an idea of this. With self-publishing, word counts are generally much lower \u2014 think 30k (more or less). This is partly because lots of self-published books are read via e-readers, where a 90k book would get a bit overwhelming. It\u2019s partly because readers have less time these days, and partly because they may be less likely to take a chance on a long self-published book without the publisher\u2019s seal of approval verifying it\u2019s worth dedicating that time to. Ultimately, the key thing as a writer is not waffling or adding unnecessary filler to reach some ideal word count. The word count should be as long as is needed cover the content sufficiently so the reader can understand and implement the information. Say as much as needs to be said and say no more than that. ",
