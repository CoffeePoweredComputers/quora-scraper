            "answer_text": "He's understands now. Is grammatically incorrect as in the above sentence , if we carefully watch we will see that the letter (s) is added with the verb understand, but it's grammatically incorrect, we can add( s) or (es) with the verb , when the sentence is present indefinite tense and the subject is third person singular number, Present indefinite tense is written as: Subject + present form of verb + others .and if the subject is third person singular number letter (s) or (es) will be added with the present verb form. So following this rule we can write the above sentence as: He understands now, but the sentence is incorrectly written as: He's understands now. He's is the contracted form of He is , and we can not add (s) or( es) with the present verb form after (be) verb (is), so the sentence : he is understands now, is completely grammtically wrong, the correct form is ; He understands now . It follows the rule of present indefinite tense. Though the above sentence is written grammatically correct yet the sentence does not bear complete sense , If I asks a question to the subject what he understands now ,that is not mentioned in the sentence, so the sentence is written incomplete manner, we can write the sentence like : He understands the real fact now. The above sentence bears a complete sense now. ",

I think this will help you gain a better understanding of the relations between nouns, pronouns, and possessive pronouns in future use of English phrases. \u201cHe\u2019s learning more.\u201d \u201cEnrique is learning more about the topic as the course progresses.\u201d \u201cEnrique is learning more.\u201d \u201cHe is learning more.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s studying\u201d \u201cEnrique is currently studying the material.\u201d \u201cHe is studying\u201d ",
