            "answer_text": "This feeling of not having done enough during one\u2019s Ph.D comes in everyone\u2019s mind at some point or another. That is perfectly normal. In fact, I would have been surprised if one does not get such thoughts! In fact, that makes you (and your thesis), stronger. Since your defense seminar is scheduled soon, you must already be having an approved thesis. Ask yourself: If my work isn\u2019t enough, would my advisor have permitted me to write a thesis?Assuming my advisor is wrong, would this thesis have passed the scrutiny of (at least) two qualified examiners?Most importantly, would you have composed a thesis willingly, in the first place, if you did not, at a major level, feel you haven\u2019t done substantial work?If the answers to these questions tend towards a resounding \u2018NO\u2019, then you know what that means. If you still have a doubt, re-read your thesis as a bedtime story. You may be underestimating yourself! ",

Like what were the methods. Sometimes we are not getting expected results. You can explain this condition also that you got results different From your hypothesis then the story moved to different path which itself will explain how difficult it was to work. Next, you present both the data and each possible quantifications graph of the data. Like you did western analysis or confocal microscopy or simple DAB based staining. You do quantifications of each of these results. That's all I can help you right now. Good luck. May you fare well. Thanks ",

It may be possible to put questions but most of the time they only know to ask questions. Moreover, if external examiners have given the comments, you are 90% through in your effort. Read and reread the thesis multiple times and if anything is not clear dont include in presentation. Face boldly and confidently. All the best ",
