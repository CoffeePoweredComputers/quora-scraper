            "answer_text": "Practice. I wrote on blank A4 paper to practice the same (the whole page filled with writing). It took about 70 pages to get it down properly, though I saw a radical betterment already by the 20th (I managed so-and-so thereafter, but at the 70th page it was consistent). There are probably other ways to do the same, but essentially you have to develop the feel for it, and that takes practice. A shortcut, if you\u2019d be willing, and if the pages aren\u2019t too thick, is including a lined sheet behind it to help you out. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019d work to help you become independently capable of writing on blank pages, but if you just want pages without lines, it\u2019s a nice substitute. I hope this helps. ",
