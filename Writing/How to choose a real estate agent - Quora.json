            "answer_text": "\u201cHow did you ultimately choose your real estate agent?\u201d To start out, I\u2019m a real estate investor and have been to the closing table dozens of times. I have gone through a lot of real estate agents over time. I build relationships with the good ones and have absolutely no problem firing the bad ones. In my case, I have gone through a lot of trial and error over the years to find good agents. The agent I have used for the last 10 transactions was an agent that placed American flags in the corner of every every property in a 2800 property subdivision every Independence Day and Veteran\u2019s Day. This isn\u2019t why I hired him, but it is how I came in contact with him. Why I hired him is because after I interviewed him about selling my home, he really knew his business, had a plan to sell, and had sold the home I lived in two previous times. Finding a good real estate agent can be difficult. Below are my suggestions. Well, as usual for me, I\u2019m going to go against the grain with many of the other answers. I suggest that you do NOT use a real estate agent that is related to you or a close friend of one of your relatives. A real estate transaction is a business transaction and it is no place for family politics, emotions, or sloppy performance. That said, if your mother is a real estate agent, you should just stop reading now. Here is what I suggest: Talk to friends and family to get recommendations for agents that have performed well in the past. Again, avoid your sister\u2019s best friend\u2019s husband.Go on walk-about in the neighborhood where you want to buy or sell. Find out who works the area. Good agents know their area and get the listings.Interview your agent. Talk to the person to understand how they will work for you to sell your property or find you the exact property you want.Setup a temporary relationship. Never sign an exclusive agreement to represent you as a buyer. If they want you to sign one of these agreements, then keep moving. If they don\u2019t have the skills to keep you as a client without a contract, they aren\u2019t worth having at all.Make sure you understand their plan for your business engagement. If you don\u2019t understand how they are going to go about selling your property or finding you a property, there probably isn\u2019t a plan. If there isn\u2019t a plan, you aren\u2019t going to be successful.Pay attention closely and make sure they do too. If your agent isn\u2019t listening to you, it isn\u2019t going to work. Especially when buying, if you are telling your agent what you are looking for and they are not showing you what you want to see, you need to tell them more specifically what you want to see and they need to listen.Don\u2019t be afraid to let them go. Don\u2019t be fickle though. Agents make an investment of time and money to help you sell or buy a home, so make sure you respect that investment. But again, this is a business transaction and if it\u2019s not working, let the agent know that it isn\u2019t working, and move on to finding a new agent.When you find a good one, hold on to them. Your next transaction may be out of their area, but there\u2019s a good chance that they do know someone. All the other rules above apply and it may not work out in the long run, but you better off than just opening up the yellow pages (do those still exist?).",

            "answer_text": "The most popular way to chose a real estate agent is 1) a referral from a friend, family member or neighbor, along with 2) finding agents through their listings (for sale) by driving around or searching on the Internet for homes. These are far from the best ways to select a real estate agent because the best real estate agent is highly dependent on the buyer or seller's subject property - its location, price range, type (condo, single family, duplex, commercial, etc.), and other characteristics and how well that matches with the agent's experience. If no subject property is determined yet, then there search criteria or parameters would substitute for the subject property. Ideally, you want the agent who is most \"fluent\" or well versed in the subject property that you are seeking to buy or sell. Some agents specialize or lean towards doing more of the buy or sell side, this is another good indicator. But you definitely want someone who is in the top 5 producers for your neighborhood and price range. They will know how to price a property, what value to offer, how to make an offer attractive but not leave money on the table, etc. They will also have a lot of contacts and \"pull\" if they are a mover and shaker and this will get your offer heard, your property toured, and perhaps save you money. Finally, agents have different strengths; some are great negotiators, some are great at moving a house quickly or for top dollar, others know how to price a home properly or do elaborate CMAs. Having one that has all these qualities is ideal.  The top 10% of agents handle 80%+ of the transactions being conducted in a given area. Of these top 10% they have vastly different specializations as discussed above. Thus, to truly pick a great agent, you need to analyze the local MLS (multiple listing data) by crunching numbers.  First, find the set of all properties for sale and all recently sold properties over the last 12 months that are comparable to the subject property or search criteria in the immediate geo-location (try drawing a 5 mile radius using lat/longs but this radius is best derived as a function of population/listing density, since more density means a smaller radius is more accurate and vice-versa). Then, score those properties based on the benefits of the outcome to the client relative to a calculated baseline performance for the set of cohorts that are all real estate agents associated with the set of properties found in step 1 above and adjust the scoring based on a listing similarity coefficient or variable.  For example, did the client pay more or less than the market rate, did the home they listed seller faster, slower, not at all. Tally those scores by associated real estate agent and create a distribution of scores by agent. This score should represent the best agent for your request.  Of course, I left out a lot of the details for the computation above but realistically, no one is going to go through this process to select an agent. So, I developed a service to provide customized Realtor recommendations, make live introductions, and assist in managing, hiring and firing of real estate agents, on your behalf. This company is known as NeighborCity.com,  is a licensed California brokerage (officially American Home Realty Network, Inc), and provides referrals to the most qualified agents in all 50 states.
