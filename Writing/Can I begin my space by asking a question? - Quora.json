Besides the question item, links and posts also inspire follow-up requests, and any assertion or claim could in principle be challenged. During the Spaces beta, new users asked how they might run those for themselves, and their inquiries were collated into a stream now called What was Spaces Workshop? That provided a way for them to convert a space on demand for their own uses such as a blog. Social networks began by asking for personal status or announcements. Comments prompt users to impart their thoughts. Books and papers often have a main question urging the hypothesis. New fields often end up begging the question no end. Marketing adds a dimension of sentiment. Since the space will be around a subset of topics, a good question will likely provoke another bunch of concerns. Such a move can set the mood to Invoke a critical or creative process. ",

Rather than asking question, you can simply share content shown in your suggestion . I think this is much better idea. ",
