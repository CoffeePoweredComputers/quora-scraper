            "answer_text": "Of course, however that would depend on the use & content of the actual letter. For example, school children write notes \u201cfrom their parents\u201d all the time. They know it's wrong, but suits their agendas. In the case of a legally binding document, it would be illegal to do so, like signing another person's name on a cheque, and punishable by law. Hoping this is helpful. ",

This depends on the totality of the circumstances. This is not legal advice. If you want legal advice, you should consult a lawyer and explain al of the facts in detail. ",
