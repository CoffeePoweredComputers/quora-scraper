            "answer_text": "Introverted is a thinking style - ie you may silently work through things in your mind before speaking the answer. The extroverted will speak whilst they think (broad generalisation) to engage others to find the answer. You can see how extroverted people get energy form this level of engagement. Many introverts find it distracting and energy sapping. Leaders can be either, with the proviso that over time introverts learn how to let others know what is going in underneath and get them involved. Particularly if you lead extroverts. This doesn't mean you need to become the life of the party or a sparkling conversationalist. Just that you need to learn over time to be more open about what is going on. If you are saying you are shy, then that is another story. There are lots of great ways to build confidence to prove to yourself that in fact you are super interesting and capable of holding court. I saw someone refer to Toastmasters, thats a great way to do it in a structured safe environment. There are many introverted leaders. The world needs more deep thinkers, which introverts do very well. (BTW extroverts need not be aggrieved as deep thinking isn\u2019t just the domain of introverts - they just do it quietly). ",

            "answer_text": "Introvert or Extrovert does not have to do anything with leadership. In fact, most of the top executives of fortune 500 companies are introverts. \u201cLeadership can\u2019t be taught but it can be learned\u201d There is a debate in business and academic circles around how leaders are made. This goes beyond the age-old question of whether leaders are made or born. That has been answered a long time ago: leaders are made, not born. For those with the courage and commitment to being a leader, very little teaching is required. They learn by doing; through experience, not words. Joining a leadership program while in college can be very helpful for a professional career as it prepares you for the industry and the experience is worth adding in the CV which can help in getting shortlisted for the companies as well as good B-schools. One such leadership program that I know of is Board of Young Leaders at EMN program organized by Eat My News, which is a community-driven media and learning platform. It helps its members to develop overall personality and make them more inspired, informed and intelligent. Challenges, opportunities, and experience in the program not only nurture the leader in you but also prepare you for a professional career. Its members are currently placed in top companies such as TCS, Little Black Book, HDFC, Tech Mahindra and EY. Some of them have also got calls for admission from top B-Schools like IIM A, B, C, and top international business schools. It\u2019s a great place to build the network as people from more than 15 countries are its members and an experience certificate at the end definitely adds up to your CV. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's not sugarcoat things - as an introvert, you have a harder time getting people to believe in you as their leader.  That's okay. You might not be a habitational leader (one who is always the leader), but everyone can be a situational leader, meaning that in certain circumstances you are in the flow and take charge. This might be scenarios in which you have a lot of knowledge in a certain area (i.e. you have good survival skills and have to guide a group through a rough night in the woods) or in which you have a lot of passion (i.e. doing a group project about cats, which you absolutely love). Find these circumstances. What makes you tick? What do you know that others don't? Then step up and take charge. Start up a student club or a project and find people who will work with you. Take the lead in something you're confident in, and you'll start to learn more and more about what it takes to be a good leader. Be open to learn and not afraid to fall. Don't be arrogant, but be confident in your skills. But always listen to others to improve yourself.  You might be an introverted leader, but you will find your leadership style. Just go for it! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve made people angry. They\u2019ve been upset. Disappointed. Sad.  People will point the finger. Point blame. We\u2019re all victims of the attribution bias, where we tend to attribute our successes to internal factors and attribute our failures to external means. I\u2019ve been this person as well. Angry. Upset. Mad. We can change our behavior. We can take accountability for our actions, no matter what the situation is. If we take the time, we can develop an understanding of just about anything. It\u2019s hard to be introspective. Humans will be humans. No matter how hard you try, there will always be someone who thinks differently than you. That\u2019s okay. As humans, we\u2019re controlled by our emotions, and as a leader, you must understand this. The first skill you must learn is empathy. Everything else in leadership is easy. Learning how to coach. Ask questions. Train. Plan for the future. Keeping your team accountable. Holding productive meetings. Compensation. Sales. Marketing. Everything is easier. Although, in the \u201cThe Dichotomy of Leadership,\u201d Jocko Willink and Leif Babin talk about various topics that can be difficult to grasp if you\u2019re starting as a leader. It takes time. You\u2019re going to have difficult conversations. You\u2019re going to make tough decisions. No matter what the situation is, you have to empathize with the other person. As a leader, it all falls on you. Be okay with that. You need time, patience, the ability to learn and apply. The one thing you need to develop excellent leadership skills is time. I\u2019ve screwed up many times. Thousands. Mostly because I\u2019m not patient. Over a decade of leading, I\u2019ve been able to slow down and look at the big picture. I still struggle with patience. People move at different paces. Learn at different speeds. They need different things. The best thing I\u2019ve ever done for my career was to hire a business coach. He helps keep me accountable, focused and see the things while I\u2019m trapped in my head. One of the best pieces of advice I\u2019ve learned as a leader is drip, don\u2019t drown. Meaning, lead people slower. Don\u2019t drown them with too much information or too many goals. If you\u2019re serious about developing your leadership skills, the best way is to hire a coach. Just like with anything, you need a great coach to be a great player. In can be a coach on your current team, or you can hire one. The next way to learn is by reading the five best leadership books and start applying what you learned immediately. Here are my book recommendations: The Dichotomy of LeadershipThe Making of a ManagerSales Leadership (can apply to any role)Laws of Human NatureSuper ThinkingOnce you\u2019ve started learning from experts in leadership, set yourself a goal, and begin working to achieve it. Get feedback from your team. Once you\u2019ve become proficient at one leadership skill, adjust and move on to the next leadership skill. Developing leadership skills takes time. The best way to start developing them is now. Don\u2019t overthink it and start doing. Thanks for reading! :) If you want to optimize life\u2019s potential, join me here. ",
