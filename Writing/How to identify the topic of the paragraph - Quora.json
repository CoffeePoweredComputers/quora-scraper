            "answer_text": "Usually, the topic sentence is the first sentence in the paragraph. Again, it is usually there, but since this is question of frequency and not a constant, this is not the best way to find the topic sentence. So, what is the best way to find a topic sentence? Read the entire paragraph and then ask yourself, what is this paragraph all about? Do I see a central idea? If so - and a good paragraph has a clear central idea - then that central idea is stated in the topic sentence. To find the topic sentence, identify the central idea. (By the way, the topic sentence for this paragraph - in bold - was not the first sentence.) ",
