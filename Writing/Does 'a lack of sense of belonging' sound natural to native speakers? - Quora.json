            "answer_text": "The confusion might be that \"sense of belonging\" is being used as a trait like \"self-esteem\":  \"He suffers from a lack of self-esteem / a lack of sense of belonging.\" However, most naturally and idiomatically, outside of psychology at least, the phrase \"a sense of belonging\" is singular and indefinite:  \"He lacks a sense of belonging.\"  Spinning this out into a noun phrase is possible:  \"He committed the murder for lack of a sense of belonging.\"  If we want a sentence containing \"a lack,\" it gets a little more unwieldy:  \"He suffers from a lack of a sense of belonging\" is grammatical but not good writing.  In all of these sentences, it is *a* sense of belonging.  Other singular pronouns may be used instead, but there is always a pronoun:  \"I'm seeking some sense of belonging\" / \"I value the sense of belonging that membership brings\" / \"It's that good old sense of belonging that I'm after.\" In summary, \"a lack of sense of belonging\" is completely natural, but only if you have the technical term \"sense of belonging\" in your vocabulary rather than the non-technical one. Non-technical: \"Children with a sense of belonging are able to make friends, cooperate, and share as well as show compassion toward others.\" Technical: \"Results indicated that sense of belonging is closely related to indicators of both social and psychological functioning.\" ",

For example, \"alienated\", \"withdrawn\", \"asocial\" and in a broader context, the noun \"anomie.\" Those might have suited some readers more than \"a lack of sense of belonging.\" My main objection to it would be that it might be too casual for a formal paper. A minor objection would be that it might be clearer if slightly reworded. ",

It would have been more appropriate to write, \"Poetry written from the perspective of  urban youth tends to reveal their anxiety at failing to fit in.\"   Failing to fit in is a phrase you will often hear in spoken American English.
