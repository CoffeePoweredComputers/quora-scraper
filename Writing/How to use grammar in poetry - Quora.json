            "answer_text": "Use correct grammar and spelling at all times, please, unless your poem is written in a dialect. Punctuation is another thing. Use it, or don\u2019t use it, as your muse dictates. Line breaks can serve as commas and periods (full stops). I personally find (as a reader of poetry) that seeing the first letter of each line capitalized is distracting. I\u2019d recommend you don\u2019t do it. But at the end of the day (or at 5 am, haha) it\u2019s your poem, and you can write it as you please. ",
