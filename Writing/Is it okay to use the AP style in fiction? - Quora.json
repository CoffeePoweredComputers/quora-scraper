            "answer_text": "There are lots of different acceptable styles for fiction. I like the AP style a lot because it\u2019s informal. In dialogue it\u2019s more like the characters would really talk in real life. If you go strictly by Strunk and White by contrast, the dialogues will often sound stilted and awkward, not at all like anyone ever really talks these days. My last two novels and my current WIP are set in the Dark Ages. Many authors writing about that time would use a very formal style and mix in a few Old English words, trying to make the dialogue sound authentic. It\u2019s false authenticity though. British people of that time didn\u2019t speak Old English and they certainly didn\u2019t speak formally as you hear in the corny dialogue in movies about the Arthurian Age. The British people in those days spoke a crude dialect which was a mixture of ancient Celtic languages and Latin (the latter being a holdover from Roman occupation). I write fantasy novels about Elves and some authors and movie actors seem to think Elves speak very formal English like the upper class in England does \u2014 how silly. Since my readers don\u2019t speak any of those tongues in everyday speech, I feel free to use modern informal dialogue because I think that will help readers relate to my characters better. I don\u2019t know what sort of fiction you\u2019re writing but I can\u2019t think of any genre where an excessively formal style would help your readers relate better but I think the AP style certainly would. No publisher will mind. As for readers, if you\u2019re writing any sort of period piece you will always get critics saying, \u201cPeople didn\u2019t talk that way back then.\u201d They won\u2019t be jarred though, they\u2019re just finding something to fuss about. The only thing, style-wise, you should worry about is whether AP style helps your readers relate to the plot and the characters better than a more formal style. As for figuring out what will jar readers and what will please them, find a good editor and let them have a crack at your rough draft. Personally, I\u2019ve learned a lot about style from my editor. Both of us feel free to break the rules of style manuals when it suits the story. The main rule of writing is, all the rules of writing are made to be broken and best-selling authors do it all the time. ",

As long as your text is an enjoyable read, reasonably error-free and consistent in its style, I don\u2019t think it matters all that much. As I said, I don\u2019t know about American Publishers. Maybe you can do a little survey among agents and publishers and take a look at those publishers that fit your novel best. ",

            "answer_text": "If that\u2019s the style you\u2019re comfortable with\u2026why not? In my experience, different publishers lean toward different guidelines for their editing. Many go with The Chicago Manual of Style, but not all. Moreover, many have their own \u201chouse\u201d style\u2014and there\u2019s no way that an author will know exactly what that is. I\u2019ve never seen a book turned down because it used a different professional style. Write a great book, then hope you get a great editor wherever the book lands. Good luck! ",

That said, I would presume most publishing houses would take a manuscript written in AP style and edit it to match that publishing company\u2019s style manual. They probably wouldn\u2019t find it jarring. They probably wouldn\u2019t recognize that you\u2019re writing in AP style, though they might notice that you don\u2019t italicize anything.
