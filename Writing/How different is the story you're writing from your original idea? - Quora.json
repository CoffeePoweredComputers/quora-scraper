            "answer_text": "Oh, I love this question. How we artists love to talk about our works! And I had just finished the second draft of my Urban Fantasy story, I can talk about it all night long! I had started thinking about this story as early as 2013 or 14. I started with world-building around that time. By 2017 when I have the first story outline, I already wrote about 30K worth of world-building material. And by the time I finished the first draft at the end of 2019, about half of the world-building had changed, about 1/4 of the timeline had changed and I must rewrite about half of it to make the changed parts work. Almost everything I\u2019ve planned originally had changed. The main character was originally designed to be able to unleash unthinkable power (similar to Vanya from The Umbrella Academy). She had used her power once as a teenager which caused death and mistery, after that she was branded with a death curse, if she uses it again, she\u2019ll be dead. Then I realized this is just another overdone cliched \u201cchosen one\u201d trope, plus the \u201canguish teenager\u201d who screamed, \u201cI never wanted this\u201d. I can\u2019t stand these. So I changed the magic system and make the protagonist Kate a \u201cmagical disabled\u201d person, truly-honest-to-god-never-be-able-to-use-magic-person in a world where everyone can use magic. Then I was presented with a different challenge: if everyone can use magic, and only Kate can not, she would be very dead in the first conflict and this would be a very short and boring story: \u201cKate had an argument with a wizard, and was burned to death by a fireball, the end.\u201d Then I started to increase the difficulty of people using magic. The theme was there from the beginning, that using magic comes with a price, a painful (potentially deadly) backlash against the caster. But originally, the backlash happened at random. You might get it, you might not. It\u2019s like rolling dice for magical mishaps. In order to level the ground a bit for Kate, I made magic backlashes mandatory. The more powerful the magic you use, the more painful and more damage the backlash is. As a result, truly powerful magic spells are usually performed by a few people working together in the form of \u201critual\u201d, so they can share the backlash. And because of the backlash, people won\u2019t just throw around magic fireballs at random without any consequences. No, you don\u2019t want to use magic to just animate booger, it doesn\u2019t worth it. Still, our Kate had a significant disadvantage, the previous \u201cdeath by fireball\u201d scenario could still happen. So I set up Kate in such a way that she can\u2019t use magic, but magic energy doesn\u2019t hurt her either. You can fire a magic missile at her, and it\u2019ll pass through her like nothing (still causing some physical pain, but she doesn\u2019t take damage). But if you use magic to throw a stone at her, she will get a concussion. Again, the same \u201cdeath by fireball\u201d scenario could happen, only \u201cdeath by flying daggers\u201d. So I gave her a backstory that enables her to make a LOT of connections with every bigwig out there. She was born under a prophecy, had an insanely privileged pedigree, have access to a LOT of secret knowledge, while she can\u2019t use magic, but she knows about magic a lot more than your average magic users. Sure, most people are capable of killing her, but do you really want to consider the consequences of killing her? That\u2019s where I landed with Kate. She can\u2019t use magic, she can\u2019t be damaged by magic. It is in her best interest to keep things civil, using her knowledge and wits to solve problems, because the moment people start throwing spells around, she loses all her advantage. When I started the concept, my protagonist was a 20 something woman with an enormous amount of power but limited by a death curse. When I finished the first draft, my protagonist was a late 30 something woman who can\u2019t use magic at all, and has no hope ever to use it, but managed to navigate the world using her wits and her ability to manipulate people. Every step of the way, I wanted to give her power. The temptation of writing a chosen one, of taking the easier way, is there all the time. Every step of the way, I limited her power so she can be truly special, to me. I\u2019m glad I choose to go with the story of a squib, all things considered, I like this version a lot better than my original concept. It is a story I want to read. ",

            "answer_text": "Very. Well tbf, I hadn\u2019t thought the entirety of it through, but there were a lot of differences between the first iteration of my story and it\u2019s \u2018current\u2019 iteration. So, we\u2019ll start with what the series was about. It was a DC elseworlds type story called \u2018Justice league: Overlords. In which, after Darkseid invaded earth at the start of the year 2000, the world was left in tatters. As they always do, the Justice league won the war, but they didn\u2019t win it neatly. The world was suffering, so Superman (as he often does in these kinds of stories) and the JL decided to take control. Of the entire planet. The main story picks up\u2026at least 10 years after this fact, with Batman (as he often does) leading a resistance. Now, this stayed essentially the same, however, there were many differences between the original version, and the newer version. One of these was how the JL ran the world. In the original version, Each Hero ruled over a different part of the Earth. Superman ruled America, Wonder woman ruled Great Britain and Europe, Cyborg ruled Japan and the general Asia area, and the rest\u2026well this was where that plan fell apart. I couldn\u2019t see the Flash ruling anywhere, he\u2019s not really a ruler character. Same with Green lantern. Another big change was the structure of the league, and who was in it. The original JL lineup was Superman, Wonder woman, Cyborg, Green lantern and the Flash. They were all relative equals, communicating with eachother sort of how the Jedi council did in SW. However, I made a few changes to this structure. For starters, I reinforced Superman as the big baddy, so made him unquestioned leader of the JL. He has all the power, the rest of the league, well, they\u2019re\u2026mildly terrified of him. I also changed the ages of many characters. In the very early stages, The league had been around many years, same as the new version, but the members were a lot older. This was because in normal continuity, the league members often are around abouts the same age. Flash was the most evident of this, being in his\u2026I think I had him in his seventies. This wasn\u2019t great, so I made some adjustments to the time line, Starting Superman crash on Earth in 1900, giving me roughly a century to work out who can be in the league, and how old they would be. I dramatically altered character dynamics, Superman was the oldest member, everyone else joined after him, meaning some didn\u2019t have much of a relationship with him. With the original version, I hadn\u2019t given much thought to the world building aspect of the story. It was pretty bare bones. The new version, like I said earlier, has a relatively colourful 100 years worth of history, showing us the various superhero teams that were formed throughout the years, Starting with the \u2018original trilogy\u2019 of superheroes post WW2 (Superman, Wonder woman and Captain Marvel), and eventually culminating with the JL, a bigger team that had most of the DC regulars. Old version of the story had none of this. Now, onto big things, plot defining things. In the original version, I killed Elizabeth (female Alfred) by having her assassinated by Superman, using Deathstroke and Death storm. Batman then fell into a deep depression and had a series of alcohol infused delusions, later revealed to have been caused by Amazo (yeah it got wild). This was where the original version ended. In the new version, I promoted Death storm to core league member, and kept Elizabeth (Liz) alive. Instead, in an entirely different way, I killed Batman. Looking through the old story, I\u2019ve found another abandoned plot point. Originally, Superman didn\u2019t know Bruce Wayne was Batman. Well, he knew he was Batman, but not that he was the Batman leading the resistance. In the original version, Superman had burnt down Wayne manor to serve as a warning for Bruce, telling him to stand down. Bruce would have \u2018agreed\u2019 and the identity of the new Batman was assumed to be\u2026someone I hadn\u2019t actually decided on yet, and never did. Oh, and in the original story, Wonder woman was the child of Superman and Hippolyta. IN both versions, Hippolyta, not her daughter, went to mans world to fight WW1, and evidently hooked up with Supes at some point. Diana was then born, and her true origins were kept a secret. In the current version, Hippolyta still went to war, but when she came back, she went to a forbidden island to ask Cerce to make her a daughter using magic. Cerce agreed, and used a doll to form Diana. Unknown to her, the \u2018doll\u2019 contained the captured spirit of Enchantress, and as a result, Diana had a split personality. Diana, princess of Themyscira, and Enchantress, wicked magic user. Oh, and another thing I\u2019d almost forgotten, the whole series started with a meeting between Superman and Aquaman. The current version also starts like this, but with one major difference. Aquaman was actually Martian manhunter, who was posing as an aged Aquaman in order to keep the real (younger) Aquaman safe. That was\u2026well let\u2019s just say although MM disguising himself as AM made it in, him aging AM up was cut. Oh, and in the stages between the old and current versions, Aquamans son was going to accidentally kill his father during a future confrontation with Superman, and then join him. Should have kept that tbh. Then there\u2019s the name itself. Justice league:Overlords Like I said before, the league were ruling \u2018lords\u2019 of Earth, so the name made sense. The even referred to eachother as \u2018Lord Superman\u2019 and \u2018Lady Wonder woman\u2019. Which wasn\u2019t at all awkward to write into the story. I kept the name, but the titles were discarded. God knows what I was thinking. So I guess you could say the name was more literal in the first version of the story. Now, who wants to see a proper comparison between both versions? Tough, you\u2019re seeing it anyway. I\u2019ll warn you in advance, as superheroes tend to work better in a visual medium, and I suck at drawing, I used Lego for the visuals. Yeah. Not great, but it made character designs and personalities a lot easier to come up with, as well as settings. I\u2019m also a huge Lego fan, so that helped too. Original version (and other affiliated bits and bobs): Series: LEGO\u00ae creations by Sam K : MOCpages.comLEGO\u00ae creations by Sam K : MOCpages.comCharacter showcases: LEGO\u00ae creations by Sam K : MOCpages.comThe current version (all affiliated bits are in the same folder) Justice league: OverlordsYou can also see I dramatically changed writing styles, definitely wrote the current version better. Dialogue only was\u2026a stupid decision, but worked alright for the site it was on. Still hideously under developed though. So, hope that helps answer the question. Ngl, I\u2019ve missed talking about this series, I really loved it while I was still writing it. It\u2019s likely dead for now, but y\u2019never know, I might come back to it :D ",
