            "answer_text": "No. Copyright is automatic under the Berne convention, so unless you\u2019re in one of the few countries that aren\u2019t signatories to it, you don\u2019t have to take any action to copyright it. Further, since it has been published, you should have proof of when it was published. Now, in many countries \u2014 including the US \u2014 registering your copyright gives you additional legal protections. However, it is not required to do so, and you still have copyright even if you do not register it. ",
