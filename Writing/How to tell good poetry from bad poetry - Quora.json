            "answer_text": "Judging from what I see in national magazines and poetry websites now, I'm tempted to say that it is very difficult to tell good poetry from bad, especially for editors. It seems that most of what passes for poetry is just a prose paragraph broken up into lines of a few words each. (In the old days, it was a few lines of insipid thoughts arranged to feature a rhyme at the end of each line.) This brings to mind an incident from high school. I was a senior at the time and presumed I was pretty smart in matters literary. So a friend of mine, an underclassman, one day pulled out a piece of paper and, with a very casual unpretentious air, read me a poem he had written. It sounded to me like a parody of Allen Ginsberg or just a riff on the fifties Beatnik style. In other words, I thought he was having a little fun with the medium. So I laughed discreetly in what I thought were the appropriate spots. Well, what do you know? A couple of weeks later, our senior English teacher brought it in and read it to us. \"Let me show you the wonderful poem this young man has written.\" Next spring, it's in the school literary magazine, and we all read it with serious faces. You never know for sure. So how do we distinguish \"free verse\" from chopped up prose sentences or genuine verse from what used to be dismissed as \"doggerel?\" There should be some ambiguity, some metaphysical aspect, some mindset or picture other than the literal interpretation of the words strung together. If you are just telling me that a bug walked across the window on an autumn morning, why should I care? Are you telling me that winter is coming and bugs die? Well, do I have to write my own poem, or are you going to write it for me? Then, unless the bare language is extremely powerful, perhaps evoking some myth or confined emotion seeking escape, there needs to be something special in the imagery of the words. The words ought to have some kind of effect just from the sound, sight,or arrangement. That's why it's poetry and not prose. Here's an example. As kids, we used to like e.e. cummins just because he didn't use capital letters, and, of course, because he looked like an enormous insect. His lines on the printed page looked like a train-wreck. But when \"eddieandbill\" and \"bettyandisbel\" came running and they all got together, and that little lame goatman started whistling \"far and wee,\" we knew what was going on out there (See the e.e.cummins poem \"Chanson Innocente\") I assume that's French for \"Song of Innoncence,\" and, if so, one should not let the irony of the title get lost. This is not about innocence. One of my high school friends was fond of drawing the wee out to weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! to emphasize the fun part to it. After all, it was a little lame goatman that was whistling. Sometimes the rhymes in the rhymed verse are almost irrelevant, overwhelmed by the imagery. See, for instance, Coleridge's Kubla Khan: In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure dome decree: Where Alph the sacred river ran Through canyons measureless to man Down to a soundless sea. In most of Poe's verse it really is the sound effects, to include rhyme, rhythm and interior sound, that just won't let you go. I read once that Ralph Waldo Emerson called Poe \"The Jingle Man\" and I don't believe he meant it as a compliment. But if you aren't gripped by these lines from the first verse of \"Ulalume,\" then you are a really hard case: It was night in the lonesome October Of my most immemorial year: It was hard by the dim lake of Auber, In the misty mid region of Weir - It was down by the dank tarn of Auber, In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir. Sometimes, if, for instance, you're writing nonsense verse, you need the rhyme to carry the load. See Lewis Carroll or Ogden Nash or the now forgotten lad who first chronicled the adventures of the Young Girl from Nantuckett. But if you're doing that, you should make it overtly funny. Don't leave us guessing. Lead-footed rhymes in a poem about death can also be hard to take. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century there were plenty of poets who gave rhyme a bad name. They can still put you to sleep in a few minutes, rhyme and all. Longfellow's best material was unrhymed and Walt Whitman didn't use it. (Well, he probably did somewhere that I have forgotten.) The sure sign of an amateur today is unmetered (or even metered) verse ended with lame rhymes. In this day and time, if you want to be recognized as a poet rather than a jingle writer and you can't compose a country music tune to go with your work, you are probably going to want to use free verse. But please, put a little work into it and give the lines some sort of poetic exuberance even at the risk of sounding like Walt Whitman. Old Walt, whatever his faults, never sounded like he had just written a letter to the newspaper and chopped it up into free verse with a pair of scissors. Well, sometimes he did, but when he did, it was at least funny. There's a great party game which, for some reason I never could get anybody to play, where you change the title of a Walt Whitman poem and get an instant parody. My favorite was I'm Walt Whitman and the Neighborhood Association Wants me Out. It ends with the memorable lines (penned,of course, by Walt himself and extracted from several different poems): I am Walt Whitman, liberal and lusty as Nature, Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding, I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart, I open my scuttle at night... I wait on the door-slab. Who wishes to walk with me? The Victorian and Edwardian poets seemed particularly good at keeping your attention with meter and rhyme while packing in such overpowering themes that you barely noticed the rhyme. Kipling was good at it, but the content of his material seems rather stilted and irrelevant to us today. In the early twentieth century there's A.E. Housman. Once again, the depth of thought in his verse, makes you forget the rhyme almost entirely. Try Housman's \"On Wenlock Edge\" where he plies you with his description of the English woods in winter and draws you into his reverie as he contemplates his Roman ancestor who stood in the same spot when the place was known as \"Uricon.\" This is what we are generally looking for rather than flash and fireworks. Robert Frost likes to give the impression that he's just a simple New England farmer throwing out advice about life, but look at The Road not Taken. Maybe a hint there of Heisenberg and Schrodinger? ( I tried without success to raise this issue as a question on Quora.) Once again, Frost's rhyme and word structure is so mundane compared to the themes his poems suggest that most of us can't even remember the actual verses. Go ahead - try and recite a Frost poem. And there is wait for it... cowboy poetry. You should not dismiss it, because it is a genre unto itself. Usually recited by a fellow in western garb rather than read from a book, it will ordinarily feature incidental rhyme, but the recitation usually minimizes the rhyme in favor of sentimental thoughts about the open range and cowboy ways. It isn't all bad. Some of it is fun, because deep down everybody likes cowboy stuff. Still, to be taken seriously, that cowboy stuff ought to be pretty deep. By the way, have you ever thought about the fact that the towered academics worship Robert Frost and do wheelies over his work while they dismiss Baxter Black and his cowboy poems? Robert Frost claims to be a New England farmer and Baxter Black claims to be just an old cowpoke, but they both invoke the secrets of the Universe in their poetry and both utilize fairly uncomplicated verse. Hey, stuff happens. Then we get T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. They're both still under copyright so I can't bore you with their verse. They were the first, at least in a really long time, whose work was more commonly studied by way of reading critical analysis rather than the poems themselves. This doesn't make it bad poetry. Seriously. The content is there. If you can actually find some scholars who are interested enough in your work to explain it to college students, what difference does it make that it's totally opaque to the average reader? Your problem as a budding poet, however, is that you are probably not going to get any college professors to study and explain your own work. Some of their work is so weird and clunky that it might be fun to play the Walt Whitman game with them. There have been prominent prose writers whose poetry is really bad. William Faulkner, when he was shoveling coal for the Physical Plant at Ole Miss thought he was going to be a poet. He self-published a volume called \"The Marble Faun.\" It would be charitable to say it wasn't very good, totally lacking in interesting content. (Just about everybody who fancies himself a Faulkner parodist throws out the term \"Marble Fawn\" as a vehicle for making fun of Faulkner's verse, and then finds out it's already been done). James Joyce's poetry looks like something you find published by college kids in the student newspaper. Mostly stale imagery without context or depth. Sylvia Plath's work, written in free verse, is fruitful with imagery and metaphor. Each poem offers the reader some sort of thematic idea which she makes available, if not in the form of instant gratification, at least with a reasonable level of contemplation. This is, after all, what poetry is about. In my view, from the standpoint of style, imagery and structure, she sets a standard from which an aspiring poet might benefit by studying. (We aging hippies may have been guilty of exaggerating her importance due to our fascination with her and her hubby-poet Ted Hughes' lugubrious lifestyle. She killed herself by putting her head in an oven, and generations of dilletantes have devoted themselves to accusations that Ted abused her.) Then there is Allan Tate. Though some of his work might tend toward the obscure, most of his theme and content are available with sufficient study by the reader. His Ode to the Confederate Dead is a master work now fallen into disfavor with the elitist establishment due to its subject matter. Tate's body of work demonstrates how poetic energy can be enhanced by invoking the darkness of history, the soul, or religious concepts of the universe. He often addresses death, aging, and history in the abstract taking us just deep enough that we do not lose ourselves in the darkness and then brings us back to pronounce the metaphor. Another from whom the aspiring poet can learn. But be careful here. Mr. Tate is a professional. You may wind up sounding like one of those \"Goths\" who used to wear black makeup and wander around the high school making everybody feel depressed. Dylan Thomas wrote lines that are visually appealing. Lots of big words and complicated syntax, obscure illusions. But maybe a little too obscure. Still he got away with it. He was quite popular during the Beat and Hippie generations. Maybe not so much in the Age of Disco or among Millennials. D.H. Lawrence wrote a lot of stuff about weird animals. A really suggestive snake, and several pages about a baby tortoise! It does have a certain appeal. Mostly it's just weird. Of course, no essay on good and bad poetry is complete without mentioning the late Rod McKuen. He was an accomplished musician and acclaimed composer of popular music and movie themes. Many of the tuneful standards of the era bore his name on the credit line. He recorded his poetry with sleepy background music and made albums out of them. (Before you laugh, they sold by the millions.) According to Wickipedia , he was among the best selling poets in the late sixties. People gave out his little books for birthday presents to Grandma. My point is that you don't hear much about him any more. The albums were something you played at a party after about half of your friends had dozed off. But really not very good as background for making out. Then there was William Butler Yates. He was born in 1865, and we are not much familiar with his \"youthful poetry.\" The poems he wrote in the late Victorian and Edwardian era have the aspect of an old man looking back even though he wasn't old yet, a trait common among poets good and bad. His rhyme seems to be almost incidental. His well-known poem The Lake Isle of Innisfree (from 1893) does not seem to have anything much for us, but for some reason it caught the imagination of Victorian readers and of many on into the middle twentieth century. For this reason, you may have studied it in high school if you preceded the Millennial generation. Its success points out that sometimes you can score by striking a chord with the hearts of your current readers. I once heard a recording , presumably off a wax record, where he grunts it out in the manner you expect a \"real poet\" to sound. Best I can tell it sounds like somebody who wants to go on vacation. After World War I Yates utilized apocalyptic and mythical themes, also invoking the Irish Easter revolt. His later works, some non-rhymed, and some set in rhyme seemingly thrown in for good measure, feature a marvelous syntax which reflects the depth of content. In his last years (he died in 1939) he produced several memorable meditations on old age. When Looking for \"good poetry\" one may well learn from Yates, memorable language combined with a fanciful vision of both past and future which is difficult to let go. So it is with what is probably his most memorable work, The Wild Swans at Coole, closing with the unforgettable lines: But now they drift on the still water Mysterious, beautiful; Among what rushes will they build, By what lake's edge or pool Delight men's eyes when I awake some day To find they have flown away? Read these lines over and ultimately you realize it is not the swans who will fly away, but ourselves, and yet we carry the image of the swans with us for the rest of our lives. Finally, a poem which you can easily access on the Internet, although it remains under copyright and I cannot provide text. It is High Flight by Gillespie Magee an RAF pilot who was killed in combat in 1941. It has become an anthem for aviators and their culture. Like most successful rhyming poetry in the modern era, the rhyme is barely noticed and almost unnecessary. The outstanding feature is the wondrous imagery of a pilot alone in an early model propeller driven aircraft. It is a perfect example of how to get past structural issues, keep the language lucid and readable and avoid the garbled syntax which accompany much modern descriptive poetry. Google it. Download it and read it. Memorize it. So there you are. You are looking for interesting syntax, introspective depth, irony, avoidance of clanging rhythm and loud rhyme (unless there is a joke to be had from it) and as little sanctimony as possible. Beyond that you're on your own. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two related steps. The first, and most significant, to read a great deal of poetry\u2014all periods, all types. The second: read about poetry. Poetry, contrary to what a well-meaning high school teacher or a poster on Quora may have averred, is not solely about the expression of emotion or personal feeling. The center of much poetry\u2014not all\u2014 shifted in that direction about 200 years ago with the beginning of the Romantic period, with Wordsworth\u2019s effusions on daffodils. (I\u2019m speaking in terms of European literature.) The fact is that one must define poetry as a combination of multiple factors\u2014rhythm, rhyme, fixed forms, and heightened language. Most modern poetry has jettisoned the first three and, in my view, even the fourth, in many cases. (A great deal of the poetry written since the beginning of the twentieth century isn\u2019t poetry at all, under that definition.) The subject of poetry can be anything. There are great lyric poems and great love poems, of course; but there are also great epic poems, great religious poems, great narrative poems, great discursive poems, great comic poems, great political poems\u2014great poems, in fact, on just about any subject imaginable. By reading about poetry, you will know which poets critics admire. By reading a great deal of poetry, you will begin to form your own taste and judgment. You will know that you have begun to form taste and judgment when you can say why you like or dislike a poem, and when you can understand why a critic may deem a poem great, and acknowledge that, at the same time you can say why you disagree with that critic\u2019s judgment. A sampling to get you started? A great epic poem: try any of the three ancient epics\u2014Iliad, Odyssey, Aeneid\u2014or Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost. A great discursive and religious poem: Dante\u2019s Commedia. Great love poems: A sampling of Donne and Marvell. Great narrative poems: A few of the Canterbury Tales, perhaps The Knight\u2019s Tale, The Miller\u2019s Tale and The Nnu\u2019s Priest\u2019s Tale. A great satirical poem: Dryden\u2019s Absalom And Achitophel, or Byron\u2019s Don Juan. A selection of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets. Wallace Stevens\u2019 13 Ways Of Looking At A Blackbird. T. S. Eliot, The Waste Land. A selection of Browning\u2019s dramatic monologues\u2014say, Abt Vogler and My Last Duchess. A selection of Blake, who is essentially unclassifiable. These are all great poems. I\u2019d be glad to suggest a sampling of what I consider bad poetry, if you like. ",

            "answer_text": "When people use terms like \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d, they usually mean \u201csomething I like\u201d or \u201csomething I don\u2019t like.\u201d When people in a field use the term, they usually have specific measures related to craft. And then beyond those measures of craft, they tend to revert again to \u201csomething I like.\u201d That\u2019s a tongue in cheek response, but the base is: if you like it, you\u2019re allowed to consider it good. It\u2019s much more precise to refer to \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse\u201d poetry, based on how well it does what it does. But there are general standards to which poems are held. Most important, they have form. The form may be invisible, as in free verse, but every decision, from where a line break comes to what constitutes a stanza, is deliberate and happens for a reason. If these reasons help the poem do what it\u2019s trying to do, they\u2019re good reasons. Second, modern poetry standards try to make those decisions seem natural and inevitable. If you\u2019ve read inexperienced poets writing rhyme, you\u2019ll notice that sometimes the sentences become twisted beyond understanding in order to get that rhyme where it belongs. If they\u2019re using both meter and rhyme, the rhythm often gets sacrificed to get that rhyme in. One reason free verse (non-rhyming, non-metrically repetitive) became so powerful is that the poets who drove that movement were pushing natural speech. While English, like many other languages, has a natural predictable stress pattern, sticking to that at all times simply isn\u2019t possible without planning; and while we have lots of words which rhyme, there aren\u2019t so many that rhyming always sounds inevitable. Third, the poem has imagery. Think of a poem as happening in two or more universes at the same time. On the face of it, there\u2019s one universe: say, you\u2019re complaining about the weather. (A popular subject for poems about love.) Then in the next universe over, you\u2019re actually lamenting a relationship, or someone not being next to you. And in the next universe to that, you\u2019re saying it so specifically, and with such familiar images, that anyone who\u2019s ever felt that way will be nodding their heads and saying, \u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019ve been there.\u201d And a really great poem may be saying other things, in other universes, as well; for example, it might be plausible that the very same poem is also making fun of how the poet is feeling by going just slightly beyond the line of self pity. Think that\u2019s hard? Do that in four lines, with formal rhyme scheme, and you end up with this: O WESTERN wind, when wilt thou blow. That the small rain down can rain? Christ, that my love were in my arms. And I in my bed again! And if you\u2019re saying, yeah, that sort of fits your description, add to the mix that this poem was written in the 16th century (and we\u2019re in the 21st!) and it still works. That\u2019s good poetry. That\u2019s what good poets shoot for. We don\u2019t always hit the mark, or the Oxford Book of English Verse (and every other poetry book) would be far longer than the OED, in smaller type. But that\u2019s how you tell good poetry. It tries to be concrete and still live in other people\u2019s universes, say things in a new way, start with the personal but is never only about one person\u2019s point of view. It takes sound seriously \u2014 read the poem aloud, and you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s repetition of sound. A good poem pays as much attention to sound as a good concerto does. It just has different instruments to work with. As to a not-very-good poem? It tries too hard, so that the craft gets in the way of what it\u2019s trying to do (except for a certain school of thought which is all about the craft). It is more a relief of feeling than a revelation of feeling. It says things in ways which already are familiar because other people said things like that. (The 21st century poet is going to have a much harder time writing a fresh poem about missing her lover, because so many people already did.) A not very good poem is narcissistic, and not in a fun way. A pretty good poem is narcissistic only in one of its universes, if that. Hope this helps. Let me know if you have further questions. ",

            "answer_text": "Poetry isn\u2019t sacred, spooky, or the stuff of genius. It is a form of communication. Start there. An essay, movie script, letter home, law outline, and dirty joke are also forms of communication. And in each case, form follows function. The form of a composition serves a purpose. For instance, the linear focus and quick-switch of a joke\u2019s playful surprise. Or the sense of being present with across the distance with a string of anecdotes, catching up on events in a letter. If in doubt as to form, use the most accessible. If a message could be stated in prose, state it in prose. Sometimes, it cannot, as in matters of feeling. That\u2019s where poetry tends to come in. Arguably, the function of poetry is to express experiences that cannot be stated in prose or at least not stated as well. Poetry is characterized by synergy of words, memorable turn of phrase, tone, purposeful economy of expression. Here we have Shel Silverstein, no less than Walt Whitman. Jack Prelutsky as much as William Shakespeare, Bob Dylan and Dylan Thomas. Good poetry captures more than is said by the words alone. Bad poetry could have been said better, more simply, as prose. ",

            "answer_text": "Good poetry will move you in some way, bad poetry won't. Even from an academic perspective, no poetry is inherently good or bad. Some poetry is historically important but important is not the same as good. I'm a great lover of poetry and yet there is a lot of classic stuff that is widely viewed as masterful that honestly just doesn't do it for me. I guarantee that every professor of poetry is the same. In any artistic medium, it's impossible to like everything. I generally find that people who pretend to like everything are masking a failure to grasp the art. If a poem says more to you than the simple words on the page, then it has done it's job. If it moves you in a good way, then you would say it's good. Occasionally, you may get a chance to attend a poetry reading and watching a bunch of boring people make a wide range of silly thoughtful faces and a bunch of hmmmmm and ahhhh sounds so that everyone else will know that they're the kind of high class people who are into poetry. Don't be like those people, they're lame. If it moves you, awesome. Make a note of the author and check their other work. If not, fine, let 'em move someone else. ",

What did the poem , say to you? What thoughts formed from the opening line and maybe even hit you a few minutes after you finished? Maybe you scanned the lines and didn\u2019t see a single thing of interest and thought well that\u2019s bad. Maybe you read the whole thing through ;four, five, twenty times and each time found something new, something that touched you, something that reminded you, of something you\u2019d already felt That would be good ",

I like poetry that makes me think; let\u2019s say one poem doesn\u2019t exactly mean what one first feels after reading it twice, to me that is a good poem..a bad poem simply states a fact without giving the reader chance to ponder. Must a poem have a rhyming scheme to flow from the tongue? No, not in my view. I sometimes like to rhyme within a stanza for this effect. The usage and arrangement of words together can bind harmony and meaning; sometimes that meaning can appear blurred, for me, that\u2019s good, it isn\u2019t concrete, it gives room for other meanings, each not battling purpose. This may sound cheap, I have a new book coming out late March 2019 or April entitled {A Delighted Bat} under J.C. Dowdy, It\u2019s a small book of thirty pages, I suppose it\u2019s called a \u201cNook Book\u201d, better than being labeled a pamphlet I suppose! Anyway, as I stated before, I write as I feel, and sometimes a poem comes out as I would prefer it to. Am I to judge what is good or bad poetry? Yes I am, as anyone out there is, we all know what we like. ",

You have to really understand what is bad before you can tell what is good. And that also works the other way around. Read stuff. Read all kinds of poetry you find, in the library, on the internet or just randomly. Soon enough you\u2019ll start comparing and develop some skills. Sure, no one can be a true, ultimate judge. The concept of good and bad also relies on our perspective and taste. But not entirely. ",

Sorry to all of my fellow millennials out there, who have an adoration of Milk and Honey or The Sun and Her Flowers, but can you even consider it poetry? Here is an example of her writing: \u201cand here you are living despite it all\u201d I honestly think an experienced fifth grader could of wrote that. It lacks depth, it lacks creativity, it has zero substance. I can see why so many people started to replicate her poems, but turn them into memes instead. Milk and Vine is pretty comical, and kind of shows that anyone can do what Rupi Kaur is doing, its nothing special at all. No offense to Rupi Kaur as a person, I am sure she is lovely and nice and good human being but I don\u2019t believe she deserves the amount of praise she gets for her books when they are utter trash.
