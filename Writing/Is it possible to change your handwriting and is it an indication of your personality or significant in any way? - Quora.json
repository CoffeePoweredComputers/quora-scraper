            "answer_text": "There are over 300 factors to consider in analyzing a handwriting sample (sample, as in at least a 1/2 page or so of spontaneous writing). Which factor do you speak of when you talk of changing your handwriting? Speed? Pressure? Angularity? Middle zone size? Letter spacing? Word spacing? Lots to consider. In brief, variations in script could suggest flexibility, or inconsistentcy, or worse. It depends on the other factors which support or mitigate any single personality trait.  See what I say below about artists or others who seem to change their handwriting.  The Hidden Danger of Changing Your Handwriting - Scott Petullo Below are excerpts from related blog posts: Graphology: Why Everyone\u2019s Handwriting is Unique - Scott Petullo \"To the untrained eye, one person\u2019s handwriting may look similar to  another\u2019s, but consider some of the factors reviewed by well-trained  handwriting analysts: baseline; capitals; connectives; connectivity;  consistency; contradictions in script; compression;  contraction/expansiveness; down-strokes; ductus; elaboration; expansion;  finals; fluidity; form; harmony; hooks; jabs; knots; lead-ins;  legibility; loops; margins; movement; organization; originality;  personal pronoun I; pressure; retracing; rhythm; shading; signature;  simplicity; size; slant; overall arrangement and picture of space;  letter, word and line spacing; speed; spirals; tension; ties; zonal  balance and much more...\" Why it\u2019s Impossible to Replicate Someone\u2019s Handwriting - Scott Petullo \"Select individuals, such as artists, may appear to be able to  significantly alter their script, like they possess two or more  different forms of handwriting. However, though two different forms of  handwriting by the same person may appear different on the surface, it\u2019s  very likely the two forms have a lot in common, including those factors  I list above (rhythm, pressure, etc.) and more. \"My handwriting sample forms include the following directions: \u201cThe  writing sample should be done in your normal writing style while you are  comfortably seated at a table or desk. If you habitually print, then  please also include a paragraph of cursive writing. If you normally have  several styles of writing, you may also include samples of each.\u201d \"A job applicant, for example, couldn\u2019t attempt to significantly alter  his or her script without the risk of raising problematic personality  red flags; affectation and bluff are straightforwardly identified  through handwriting analysis.

            "answer_text": "Is it possible to change your handwriting and is it an indication of your personality or significant in any way? Yes, indeed. Attempting to change your personality by changing your writing is called graphotherapy. It operates on the principle that as long as you know what strokes represent, then altering those strokes in a disciplined manner will reverse engineer your personality. Milton Bunker, the granddaddy of \u201cscientific handwriting analysis\u201d or Grapho-Analysis, confirmed that by changing strokes, one could change traits that were sabotaging the person\u2019s success. He cautioned that one could only attempt such an internal makeover under the guidance of an expert grapho-analyst and even then, a person should never to attempt to change more than one trait at a time - or it could end in disaster. In his seminal book, Handwriting Analysis - Read Character by Grapho-Analysis, he asks the question: Would it be possible, I asked myself,to work in reverse, changing first the writing with the hope of changing the writer\u2019s character? He said the answer was yes, with certain provisos: Do not attempt to change all your weak traits at once or \u201c\u2026you may easily be headed for a psychiatric ward.\u201dHe would help a writer make one change at a time and advised him to write a certain stroke a certain way 30 times every night before bedtime. Without ever missing a night.The person desiring a change must have the character to support a positive change. For example, someone with a criminal disposition might benefit from greater confidence or self-reliance, but without integrity, no good could come of the changes.\u201cIt takes months of careful guidance under the careful supervision of a professional grapho analyst to make any great number of changes and they must be made slowly,\u201d Milton declared.Handwriting is brainwriting, so changing a stroke is likely creating new synapses in the brain to groove the new habit. Graphotherapy is a very cool way to get inside your own mind and fine-tune it. ",

            "answer_text": "It is indeed possible to change your handwriting. It just takes practice. However since your handwriting is a physical illustration of your personality, it is best to change it only to a way that feels right to you. Handwriting analysts (graphologists) can recommend ways for you to change your writing to help you change aspects of your personality that you wish to change. This is because handwriting is body language and any body language affects how you feel. And how you feel over a long time becomes part of your personality (as in feeling optimistic or pessimistic etc.) This is called Graphotherapy. These changes can take some time to become your natural way of writing, depending on how big a change it is making to your personality. But on your own, if you just choose writing you like the look of and start copying it and practicing it, it will after a while become your natural way of writing. And if you chose it just because you liked the style, it is probably a pretty good fit for your personality. ",

            "answer_text": "Nice question.  1. Yes, it is possible to change one's handwriting. It can be done. However, not many people care about improving it as they do not give it enough importance.  2. Many people judge others by their handwriting and presentation style. Person with a good handwriting and presentation skill is normally considered efficient than the one without. It is quite obvious in a way that people think: how can a person control a business effectively, if he does not have a control on the way he writes; he must be careless. People can judge that way. Willingness to improve handwriting signifies that you care about the people who read what you write. This is a must have quality for Doctors! :P 3.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is possible to change your handwriting, although it isn't easy to develop a second form of handwriting which feels completely natural.  When I was at school, teachers struggled to read my appalling handwriting, and I was consistently marked down because my handwriting was illegible. So I actually trained myself to develop a second handwriting, which - although not beautiful - was at least a bit more legible. So today I have two completely distingt handwritings. One is fast and scrawly, the other neater but much slower. ",
