            "answer_text": "For the sake of a baseline, let\u2019s assume the following: You type 40 words per minuteYou are financially independent and have no need to spend 8\u201312 hours per day struggling to stay on the right side of debt-slavery.A standard manuscript page is 250 words.A 500 page manuscript is 125,000 words.So: 40wpm x 60 minutes per hour x 8 hours per day = 19,200 words per day. 125,000 words / 19200 words per day = 6.510416666666667 days. About a week. Of course, it\u2019s unlikely that\u2019s a good novel\u2026. The point is, it takes as long as you have time, discipline, and energy to work on it. I\u2019ve \u201cwon\u201d NaNoWriMo by writing a ~75000 word novel in 30 days. I\u2019ve written two other novels in 90 days. Recently, I wrote a 65k novel in about 2 weeks. I made the time, planned how many words I needed to write each day and each hour of the time I gave myself to reach the overall goal I set for myself. I didn\u2019t wait for inspiration to strike. I sat down and worked at it. You can too. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow! A great question? Wish I had a great answer. On the quick side, I guess a fast writer could produce 1,000 words a day. Meaning you could finish a first draft in 6 months given some down time. That doesn\u2019t account for planning, research, editing and rewriting. So maybe a clean draft in a year. I\u2019d still say that would be fast. My first novel took about a year and a half for 350 pages. My second was serialized once a week for a year (a great experience for a writer). My third, a Vietnam War novel, took some 30 years of on and off writing, throwing drafts out and revising, etc. The final draft, 550 pages, took 2 years. I\u2019d guess an average of three years for 500 pages for a final draft. My second Vietnam War novel took about 2 1/2 years for 500 pages. Others may have had very different experiences. ",
