This is the first Indian horror book that I have read at a stretch throughout the night and it is totally engrossing. The author is Neil D\u2019Silva. I am currently reading his another horror book with romance component called Pishacha . Another writer I am hearing a lot about is Arnab. I will be picking up his book next. Though Neil and Arnab are contemporary writers I also enjoy reading Ruskin Bond\u2019s horror reads. He is versatile and exemplary writer and of course a master in writing. ",
