            "answer_text": "In contrast with basic Grammarly version that is entirely free, Grammarly Premium costs money. And to be honest, quite a lot of money. No wonder that many people ask whether it is worth it to pay for it. Well, let's have a look first on how much Grammarly Premium costs. The monthly subscription costs 29.95 USD, a quarterly subscription is 19.98 USD per month, and yearly subscription (both quarterly and the annual subscription must be paid in whole), costs 11.66 USD per month. Well, we hear you. The monthly subscription seems way too expensive, at least to us, and we think it is not worth it. Do not take us wrong. We absolutely believe that Grammarly App is worth it. We just feel that it makes sense only to purchase the annual subscription, so you will save quite a lot of money. We realize that this is all marketing, and it is obviously what Grammarly wants us to do, but that is quite common with other subscriptions when the longer plan is often cheaper, so we do not feel that this action is somehow unfair. You can even try the upgraded plan for one month for free, so you know what you are about to buy. If you want to know more then I will suggest you this link Grammarly App. I hope it will help you to know more about improving your English. ",
