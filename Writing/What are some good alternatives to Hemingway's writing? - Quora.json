            "answer_text": "There are no alternatives to Hemingway\u2019s writing. He was as good as they come and the only contender in a specific category. The brevity, directness and simplicity of his writing can never be compared. However, that does not mean other (American) writers are a notch less. Mark Twain, William Faulkner, Scott Fitzgerald and John Steinbeck - have all different and endearing styles of writing. I am not about to bring in the British authors here, as the writing styles are completely different. It is only about American writers in and before Hemingway's time, not even Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, T S Eliot, Herman Melville etc. ",
