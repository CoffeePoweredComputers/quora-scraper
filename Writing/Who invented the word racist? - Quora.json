            "answer_text": "How and when the term racism first gained widespread adoption is debated. There are isolated uses of the term racism from c. 1900, with the first recorded use in 1902 in a quote by Richard Henry Pratt. Other terms like racialist (1910), racialism (1882), race hatred (19c) and negrophobia (19c) were in use even earlier.The term Racism itself entered widespread use in 1936. While most early use of the word was in the context of Nazi Theories, some point to Leon Trotsky's early use of the word as evidence the term has widespread origins as a political weapon used by far-left Communist ideologues in order to create division. A theory predictably popularized by online wingnut vanguards and 'race realists' such as Stefan Molyneux. It is based on the fact that, in 1930, Trotsky used the word \"rasisti\" in his text The History of the Russian Revolution, and the term \"racism\" appears to have gained widespread use later in the same decade.

            "answer_text": "The Oxford English Dictionary's first recorded utterance of the word racism was by a man named Richard Henry Pratt in 1902. Pratt was railing against the evils of racial segregation. Although Pratt might have been the first person to inveigh against racism and its deleterious effects by name, he is much better-remembered for a very different coinage: Kill the Indian...save the man. \"A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one,\" Pratt said. \"In a sense, I agree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.\" We're still living with the after-effects of what Pratt thought and did. His story serves as a useful parable for why discussions of racism remain so deeply contentious even now. ",
