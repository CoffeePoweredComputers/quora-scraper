            "answer_text": "I would put in a vote for David Farland\u2019s The Runelords series.  In this series, there\u2019s more than one sort of magic in play. However, one type of magic that was particularly original was the idea of \u201cendowments.\u201d The basis of this magic was transferring abilities and attributes. If you want to have magical powers like enhanced strength, or speed, or healing, or beauty, you either have to take those attributes from someone else or find someone to offer them to you. These endowments could be a source of trade, a source of slavery, a military technique, or a source of political wealth in the pseudo-medieval world Farland imagines. Endowments could be borrowed from animals and implanted in humans, though not very safely. Instead, the best source of endowment was another human being. The one making the endowment had to be willing to give up the attribute, or the magical tool for the transfer (called a forcible) would not work. So, a noble lord might have a retinue of volunteers (called dedicates) who allow themselves to go blind or deaf, so that the champions or scouts of the kingdom will have supernaturally keen eyesight or hearing. Others will go lame so that the best soldiers can run faster than the enemy. Wise men might allow themselves to be reduced to imbecility, so that judges and rulers would have more wisdom to hear cases and rule men. On the other hand, evil tyrants could use threats of torture or violence to a dedicate\u2019s family to force the other to comply with the transfer. They might deliberately seek to steal the abilities of others en masse. For instance, a dictator might keep harems of women who are reduced to deformity, so that his own wife\u2019s beauty (or his own) is magically advanced, and they might imprison singers to steal their voices, or artists and dancers for their dexterity or agility, and so forth. It would be like taking a dozen mediocre artists and robbing them of their creativity to create a single Michelangelo, or a score of mediocre scientists to create one Einstein. The books then systematically explore the implications of such an ability in terms of political systems, the ethics of sacrifice, and the tendencies of human psychology in very interesting ways. I don\u2019t want to give too much away, but some sample points of discussion: how would melee combat pragmatically change with this ability? Is it better to cripple a large number of commoners to supercharge a few hundred trained warriors with greater abilities? Or is it better (both for national morale and for greater numbers of troops and patriotic participation in the country\u2019s defense) to avoid that? What happens if you form a snake\u2019s circle, in which a group of a dozen people each bind themselves to each other and share attributes, rather than one person being the recipient at the end of a chain of bound individuals? How would that work? What moral obligations do you have to individuals who are debilitated for a national cause or to enhance another? Do they deserve the same recognition as veterans who risk life and limb for their country, even though they never put themselves at risk of death? Or are they now at risk of death as a military target? Is it legitimate to engage in a military strategy to kill your enemies\u2019 civilian dedicates, since that will weaken the power of those they have endowed who are fighting against you? Would it be moral to punish criminals by taking away their strength, or a rapist\u2019s sex drive, and give away those attributes to someone paralyzed or infertile? Or is that just a sort of social vampirism? What if the criminal agreed to it instead of taking jail time? I found the books an interesting read, though full disclosure\u2014I\u2019ve only read the first four or so books. I believe there\u2019s now closer to eight in the full series. ",

            "answer_text": "The magic in the shared world \u201cLiavek.\u201d Magical power is tied to the length of time your mother was in labor. The longer your \u201cluck time,\u201d the more powerful you are magically. To become a magician, each year you can try to \u201cinvest\u201d your luck into a physical object. If you fail, you usually die. If you succeed you can cast spells. Magicians cast spells by the classic words-and-gestures, by dance, by engaging in combat, by any of hundreds of methods. Some are specialists, some can use multiple methods. However, after you invest your luck: if the object in which you invested it is stolen or lost, you lose your power. It must be within some small distance for your magic to work.If the object is destroyed, I seem to recall the effects are more catastrophic than just losing your power until your next birthday.And each year you must re=invest your luck (same or different object). Less dangerous than the original investment, but not perfectly safe either, and during that process your power is out of action.WHich makes it tough of magicians who have used their magic (as many do) to extend their lifespan. A multi-century old magician needs to trust someone to maintain his life-sustaining spells while he reinvests, a time when he would be powerless to repel a betrayal.There are numerous variations on this theme, as there are on the workings of magic for each particular magician. The stories set in Liavek were written by a group of very good authors, ranging up to incredibly good in some cases. Give them a try. I particularly recommend John M. Ford\u2019s \u201cThe Illusionist\u201d (in his collection Casting Fortune as well as one of the Liavekian collections). But then I used to be an actor myself, so a novella set in a world like this looking at the theatrical profession is quite irresistible to me. ",
