            "answer_text": "Email is a very poor medium for this kind of request. Asking to be released from your project is a negotiation, and negotiating by email is like playing chess by post. Moreover, the lack of subtle cues such as tonality, facial expressions and emphasis mean that whatever you write can easily be misinterpreted by the reader. Email is good for communicating bland\u200b, uncontentious information, sharing facts and agreements that have already been made and asking questions to provoke thinking in advance of meetings. It's rubbish for trying to influence anyone. Your best bet would be to have a face-to-face meeting, or failing that, a phone call. You can establish much stronger rapport this way, and your chances of influencing your managers to remove you from the project are very much greater. During the conversation, ask lots of questions about the normal length of time that any person is expected to spend on the same project. Ask about what criteria would have to be met to move to another project. Be sure to ask about, recognise and acknowledge what's important to your managers, and talk to them about who would backfill you on the project if you were to leave and what you could do to make sure that there was a seamless handover. Expanding your thinking to take into account the perspectives of the person with whom you are negotiating, and thinking through how any proposed course of action will work out in practice is the key to a successful negotiation. If you do that, your chances of success will be much higher. ",
