            "answer_text": "Dorothy Clark has brought up a very important point. SEO isn't just about attracting visitors to your pages, it's about matchmaking.  We're trying to attract visitors who have an interest in our subject matter, who will read our content, and ideally follow through on our goals. (Such as buying our widgets or filling out a contact form.)  If our keywords get them to our site, but the content doesn't satisfy them then they will leave. We'll have increased traffic, but also increased the bounce rate, frustrated potential customers and not helped our end goals.  I think we should write for humans first. Then read through those 500 words and identify which topics we've really covered. How many subjects did you really discuss? There is likely to be one main theme in such a short amount of text, though we may have touched on a few related topics.  Now our job isn't to stuff the text with keywords. Instead we should be reading the text to ensure that we've used the words (in context) that people would likely use when searching for the type of content we've created. If we're writing about big red dogs, let's make sure we've mentioned red dogs and not only used alternative phrases such as crimson canines. If we've also discussed their eating habits then maybe we also mention something like \"dog food\" or \"nutritional needs.\" 1 or 2 really relevant words will be more effective than 5 tangential words. So if you focus on relevance than word count you should be on the right track. ",
