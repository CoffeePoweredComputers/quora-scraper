            "answer_text": "You should be able to unlink it inside of Outlook - either through Tools/Internet Calendars, or by right-clicking on the Gmail calendar that is showing in Outlook and deleting that.Unless I'm misunderstanding the way you linked it. If you did it through Google, then it's under Settings/Calendar (can access from either the settings link in the upper right of Google calendar, or right underneath your linked calendar on the left.)That said? I have been terribly happy using Tungle to 'sync' all of my calendars so that I don't worry about whether the invite goes through google or not.  Tungle syncs all of my calendars so I'm good whether or not it sent me a Google calendar invite.  Not affiliated with them at all, but passionately love it. ",
